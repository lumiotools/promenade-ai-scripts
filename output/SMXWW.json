Current Global Challenges and Incentives for Continuing\nSustainable Development\nIn 2015, all United Nations (UN) Member States adopted the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable\nDevelopment that comprises 17 complex Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The SDGs are\nthe urgent call to actions for both developed and developing countries to collaboratively sustain\n“development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future\ngenerations to meet their own needs\" (Source: UN). The Paris Agreement, adopted by 196\ncountries in 2015, together with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, provides the\nglobal foundation for sustainable, resilient, and low-carbon future to mitigate progressing\nclimate change.\nIn 2023, the world is approaching the half-way targets of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable\nDevelopment and is in urgent need to move from planning to actions. The European Green Deal,\napproved in 2020, includes a set of policies driving climate-neutral development of the region\nwith key focus on 55% reduction of net GHG emissions by 2030 (compared to 1990 levels). The\nEU Green Taxonomy builds on UN SDG’s and Paris Agreement to create a universal classification\nsystem, providing a global benchmark for investors and industry stakeholders to promote\ninvestments in sustainable economic activities and limit greenwashing with misleading\ninformation on companies’ environmental impact and sustainable development. The EU leads\nthe global race to implement climate actions along with sustainable development, focusing on\nincorporating science-based targets that are economically and technically achievable. This offers\na peer learning approach to help other global economies to drive their transition towards low-\ncarbon economies, taking into account the European Green Deal in climate mitigation approach\nand playing an important role in scaling up sustainable investments worldwide. 3\nThe future of the resource economy is set to be shaped by the three key levers – Sustainability\n6\nDevelopment Goals together with Circular Economy, Risk and Resilience and Digital\nTransformation – to derive the key tangible benefit of the digital productivity bonus as well as\nmuch needed transparency.\nThe recently published Global Risks Report 2023 of World Economic Forum (WEF) clearly\nindicates that the post-pandemic carbon emissions of the global economy have reached the\nlevels not seen in decades. Failure of climate-change mitigation and adaptation, along with\ncontinuing natural disasters and extreme weathers, environmental damage, as well as natural\nresource crises are ranked among the top environmental risks both in short and long-term\nperspective. Additionally, the food and energy crisis coupled with dramatic inflation and rising\ncost-of-living are resulting in social unrest, further emphasizing the urgent need to reshape the\nworld we all live in. The world is facing the real potential of socioeconomic and environmental\npolycrisis with an urgent need for solutions that guarantee more stable future, taking into\naccount long-term sustainable development. 4\nThe Role of Technology & Data, Cross-industry Collaboration, and 5P’s Approach\n7\nNew technologies play an important role in the transition to net-zero, but need to be inclusive\nand fit for purpose. Technology has become a powerful tool enabling the move of the Circular\nEconomy approach forward and the shift from start-up phase to full implementation and impact\nphase. Digital transformation is becoming an inseparable part of the global transition to the\nCircular Economy and net zero. The main goal is to apply new technologies in areas where they\ncan result in added value, pushing the outcomes a step further to reach different industries. Data\nhas become the new gold. Both qualitative 5 and quantitative data is considered the new\ncurrency for growth and innovation, enabling the connection of business profits with progressing\nsustainability. Global trends indicate the growing adoption of new technologies by the individual\ncustomers as well as across industries to advance a shared vision of contributing in digital\ntransformation to fulfil the The Paris Agreement and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable\nDevelopment.\nThe global resource management sector is transitioning toward greater digital technology\nadoption using disruptive smart technologies and platform-based solutions to ensure physical\nand digital tracking of closed-loop material management, to authenticate sustainability claims as\nwell as to enable cross-industrial collaboration, bringing a significant series of environmental,\nsocial, and economic benefits, and driving much-needed transparency to avoid greenwashing. In\nthese terms, the digital solutions can shape a bigger picture of the circular economy approach,\nnot only from the business perspective but also from the industrial point for better\nunderstanding, transparency, and mapping of the sustainability potential.\nIn the recent report “Growth Opportunity Outlook in the Waste Recycling and Circular Economy\nIndustry” published in December 2023, Frost & Sullivan has identified top 10 growth\nopportunities across the waste recycling and circular economy industry that drive the\ntransformative shift from a linear to a circular economy. It highlights the importance of\n8\ncollaboration across key industry verticals to develop innovative technologies and services\nbacked by strong business models and driven by digital transformation to increase resource\nrecovery and efficiently recycle materials.\nOne of the key top growth opportunities identified by Frost & Sullivan for 2023 is development\nof the waste-to-resource mapping, verification and validation platforms. As the circular economy\napproach prioritizes the reuse and resale of secondary materials with no modification of the\nproduct or materials as well as recovery and recycling that include efficient processing and\nrefurbishment, it is in urgent need to implement solutions that enable data-based operation and\nverified material tracking along entire life-cycle. Material, component, product, and waste\nexchange platforms connect producers, users, and processors with transparent information\nabout supply and demand as well as and exchange opportunities. Waste-to-resource platforms\nsupport reverse logistics while creating growth opportunities for circular business models and\ncollaboration among stakeholders with compatible waste or resource streams. Results include\nimproved resource management and recovery, enabling material and cost efficiencies. Digital\nresource management platforms can aggregate and analyse data and, using advanced analytics\nand AI, automatically match suppliers and other partners across the waste and material supply\nchain for efficient coordination of reuse, resale, and waste upcycling operations. Digital mapping\nof material and waste data ensures that it is accessible, visible, verifiable, and valuable. Waste-\nto-resource platforms will empower businesses with the tools and knowledge to take action on\ndecarbonization and limit waste generation. Digital platforms also support growth opportunities\nin the areas of reusable packaging solutions, online marketplaces for resale or sharing of\notherwise unwanted items, and innovations in design for recovery and reuse.\nAccording to Frost & Sullivan, successful businesses focus on five core pillars of the\nEnvironmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) factors: Process, People, Product, Partnerships, and\nPlatform (the 5P’s). Effective synergies across these five pillars create growth opportunities and\ndevelopment of new business models while ensuring companies meet the ESG standards\nconsistent with a “good for people, good for planet, good for business” approach. 7\n9\nFigure 4. The Frost & Sullivan’s 5P’s Approach to ESG Platforms\nThe global resource management sector is transitioning toward greater digital technology\nadoption using disruptive smart technologies and platform-based solutions to ensure physical\nand digital tracking of closed-loop material management, authenticate sustainability claims as\nwell as to enable cross-industrial collaboration, bringing a significant series of environmental,\nsocial, and economic benefits, and driving much-needed transparency. In these terms, the digital\nsolutions can shape a bigger picture of the circular economy approach, not only from the business\nperspective but also from the industrial viewpoint for better understanding, transparency, and\nmapping of the sustainability potential.\n10\n2. SMX: Company overview\nSMX has developed a chemical based digital tracking solution that has the potential to efficiently\nand securely realize the benefits of the circular and closed loop economy.\nFigure 2: SMX's IOT2 – Intelligence ON Things\nSource: SMX\nThe technology\nSMX's chemical based marker system imprints a permanent mark on solid, liquid or gaseous\nobjects or materials with the marker capable of being deployed in multiple layers. As the marker\ncomprises a combination of 500,000+ marker codes – each mark is unique.\nThe marker system is coupled with a unique patented reader that responds to signals from the\nmarker and coupled with a patented algorithm captures the details of the product retrieved and\nstored securely through block-chain.\nThe key value proposition of the SMX solution is to enable next generation Intelligence ON Things\nwith the following distinct offerings:\n• Easily deployable solution – Drop-in solution – with toolkits available for industry to\ndeploy the solution with no changes needed in the production processes\n• Given the markers' embedded nature – the ability to detect the embedded data within\nseconds via the SMX reader without destroying the product/material or any need for\nspecial lab tests. The block-chain offers an additional layer of authentication.\n• Best-in-class offering – with considerable value and operational benefits in comparison to\nsimilar offerings.\n• Supply chain integrity – being the first solution to provide end-to-end transparency to\nincrease trust and reduce liability\n11\n• Brand authenticity – strong tool in the global fight against counterfeit\nBox #.1: SMX Transparent Supply Chain Management for Electronics\nSMX has been chosen to be in the Intel Integrity Partner Program\nAs highlight in Figure 3 below – SMX is able to also provide the much needed food security in a\npost coronavirus world.\nFigure 3: SMX solution delivering on the food security in the post-coronavirus world\nSource: SMX\nSMX is pursuing a clear three-stage roadmap for market entry:\n12\n1. Market leader adoption – Adoption of the solution by market leader such as BASF, Intel,\nThe Perth Mint etc.\n2. Become an industry standard – Building on the adoption of the market leader to establish\nitself as an industry benchmark and also increase adoption by other companies in the\nvalue chain\n3. Regulator adoption – Build on prior two points to then influence regulators and\nprofessional agencies in key industries to be become a preferred solution\nThe SMX business model is to be a B2B service platform to accelerate collaboration and\npartnership in each target segment such as chemicals, precious metals, pharma, food,\nbeverage, agriculture and electronics. It aims to have multiple revenue streams that will grow\nand compound over time and comprise of – an implementation fee/one-time set-up fee,\ntechnology license fee/recurring SaaS payment and lastly - a service fee that will be recurring\nand based on usage.\nWe will focus on circular economy and specifically plastic as the main growth engine for SMX\nfuture operations.\n13\n2.1 The Circular Economy of Plastic Recycling and Resource Recovery\nKey Takeaways\n• The Global Circular Economy of Plastic Packaging Recycling, Resource Recovery and\nDisposal Market is estimated to be $14.01 billion in 2019 and is expected to grow at a\nCAGR of 9.1%.\n• Volume generated for 2019 is 108.2 million metric tonnes and is expected to increase\nto 186.8 in 2030. The recycling rates will reach 54.7% in 2030 compared to 28.6% in\n2018.\n• PET, HDPE, LDPE, PVC and PP recycling rates will increase to 66.8%, 57%, 36%, 48%,\n47.1% respectively in 2030.\n• SMX address some of the key unmet needs of the plastic recycling industry particularly\nwith regards to hard to recycle post-consumer plastic segment. The embedded\nchemical marker will allow for better tracking, monitoring and sorting of the post-\nconsumer plastic with the Circular Value Chain Approach.\nChina's waste ban has created numerous opportunities in countries that were exporting their plastic\nwaste. Producers, consumer and recyclers are working together to enhance recyclability of packaging\nplastic. Europe is leading the circular economy way in dealing with packaging plastic waste by\nestablishing a \"zero landfill\" of plastic waste by 2030. The \"Circular Economy of Plastic Recycling\"\nrefers to an industrial economy that, contrary to the traditional linear economy, reclaims used\nmaterials and recycles them as secondary raw materials for new products.\nGiven the challenges around mechanical recycling – chemical recycling is emerging as a promising\nsolution to tackle global challenge associated to single use plastic waste.\n14\nFigure 8: Plastic Energy's Innovative Solution provides a framework for a Circular Economy of Plastic Waste\nRecycling and Resource Recovery\nPlastic packaging accounts for close to one-third of overall plastic and comprises of various\ngrades and types that are graded from 1 to 7 and are posing challenges both in the collection,\nsorting and recycling of plastic waste. About 6% of global oil production devoted to production\nof plastics and in 2012 the resulting emissions amounted to approximately 390 million tonnes\nof CO2(for all plastic and not packaging specifically)\nOnly 30 million tonnes of the 106.3 million tonnes of plastic packaging collected was actually\nrecycled. One of the biggest challenges for the plastic packaging recycling industry has been the\npost-consumer packaging comprising largely of multi-layer plastic packaging- which are difficult\nto segregate and effectively recycle.\n15\nA solution such as the SMX marker, will allow for both an effective tracking and monitoring as\nwell as enable for better sorting and separation of plastic for a fuller circular economy. Improved\ntracking & tracing of materials and products beyond the point of sale is also set to improve trust,\nauthentication and incorporate resale and material recovery.\n16\n3. Company Financial Analysis & Valuation\nValuation Method & Approach\nValuation of a start-up company in its early stages can be challenging due to limited cash flow (if\nany) and uncertainty regarding the future. As part of a Discounted Cash Flow (DCF), the accepted\nmethod used in financial valuations, there are several modifications to a start-up company's\nvaluation. In general, there are four primary methods within the DCF method:\n1. Real options – this valuation method is designated for pre-clinical and early-stage\nclinical programs/companies where the assessment is binary during the initial phases\nand based upon scientific-regulatory assessment only (binomial model with certain\nadjustments).\n2. Pipeline assessment – a valuation method used for early-stage companies before the\nmarket stage where time-to-market may be a few years for full operations. The\ncompany's value is the total discounted cash flow for its products/signed agreements\nplus unallocated costs and its technology platform assessment.\n3. DCF valuation - this method applies to companies with products that have a positive\ncash flow from operations.\n4. Market benchmark – this method is based on recent deals (M&A and/or fundraising)\nwithin the company's domain and market multiples.\nSMX is a publicly held firm, thus a late-stage firm from a financial aspect, however early-mid stage\nin its time-to-market. Our valuation is based on a market benchmark approach with recent M&As\ndeals similar to the company.\n3.1 Financial overview – Supply Chain Tech Market\nToday's global supply chain is a highly fragmented industry that includes a sprawling ecosystem\nof disparate providers, each at different technological maturity stages. We view this as a\ncompelling backdrop for new entrants seeking to address gaps in the status quo and see growth\nareas across the value chain, including procurement, inventory management, freight,\nwarehousing, fulfillment, and last-mile delivery.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has strained global supply chains and led to significant mismatches in\nsupply and demand. Assembly and manufacturing plants have faced shutdowns, causing\nproduction delays and shortages of global goods. Nonessential goods have been stuck in limbo,\nwith retailers unable to accept deliveries. Grocers have struggled to keep household goods on\nshelves. These disruptions have highlighted the need for technologies that can help ensure\nbusiness continuity and mitigate economic shocks' impacts. Additionally, businesses involved in\nglobal trade are demanding better visibility across delivery and supply channels, quicker shipping\ncapabilities, and the ability to source products on-demand to reflect real-time conditions at the\nconsumer level.\nStartups are rising to the occasion, developing software and data services to address these\npressing needs. Investors, in turn, have put substantial amounts of venture funding to work to\n17\nboth modernize and disrupt this industry. In 2020, VC investors funneled approximately $12.6\nbillion into supply chain technology startups in North America and Europe across 555 deals.\nVC activity\nVenture capital activity in supply chain tech continued to normalize in Q4 2022. Deal count\ndeclined modestly quarter-over-quarter (QoQ) by 7.8% to 201 deals. On a YoY basis, the number\nof deals was down 46.4%. Deal value in the quarter increased by 28.2% QoQ to $4.0 billion, but\nwas down 71.4% YoY. The sequential lift in deals stemmed mainly from a few larger deals in Q4.\nThe top three deals accounted for nearly one-third of the total. Overall value of supply chain tech\ndeals for 2022 fell back to approximately the average of the 2018 to 2020 period following the\ndramatic run-up in 2021 in supply chain tech deals and VC funding. The number of deals across\nstages was relatively steady QoQ, but on a value basis, late-stage deals saw a big increase, while\nother stages remained flat.2\nFinancial overview – Industrial Internet of Thing (IoT) Market\nWe characterize SMX's role in the supply chain as an IIOT company. Specifically, as a use-case\nspecific application provider, addressing the visibility and authentication needs along the supply\nchain using IoT.\n2 PitchBook, Supply chain tech, Q4 2022 report\n18\nOverview\nIndustrial loT (IIoT) technologies, collectively referred to as \"Industry 4.0,\" allow for the digital\nand smart transformation of capital-intensive industries including manufacturing, logistics,\ntransportation, and oil & gas production. Sensor technologies, big data, analytics, and other\ntechnologies are used to monitor and diagnose manufacturing machinery and equipment, supply\nchain, and safety operations. This allows for predictive maintenance, demand forecasting,\nimproved productivity, and better efficiencies across the entire value chains of industrial\ncompanies.\nSubsegments within IIoT include:\nManufacturing & supply chain: Devices that enable predictive maintenance of industrial\nequipment and asset tracking of inventory along the supply chain.\nEnergy & utilities: Devices and sensors that measure power\ngeneration and usage (also includes oil & gas extraction\nmonitoring) .\nAgriculture: Devices that monitor field conditions for\nagricultural planning .\nIndustry drivers\nFirst, many industries are utilizing loT connectivity to\nempower autonomous equipment operations, including\nrobotics and unmanned aerial vehicles. Second, rising volume of equipment data from\nprogrammable logic controllers, enterprise resource planning systems and industrial sensors has\ncreated a need for companies to make sense of it. Last, global supply chains increasingly\npressure companies to maintain visibility along networks of manufacturers and distributors to\navoid \"retail shrinkage,\" or loss of inventory due to shoplifting, theft, or administrative errors.\nMarket size\nThe industrial loT market is forecast to grow over 22% to $229.2 billion in 2021. From 2021-2024,\nwe forecast both manufacturing & supply chain and agriculture subsegments to grow in line\nwith the market or above, at 13.2% and 11.1% CAGRs respectively. Energy & utilities is forecast\nto grow at only 10.0%, in part because of the fixed rate of investment in the utilities sector and\nrisk-averse nature of oil & gas technology investments. Use cases we expect to benefit most from\nan economic recovery include power generation, mine operation, factory automation, and\nlivestock tracking. Logistics and asset tracking may lag slightly given high growth experienced in\n2020, although they may still grow in double-digits.\n19\nIIOT Market Size1 ($B)\nNote: This market size is based on total end user spending\nSource: PitchBook, IDC, Omdia, Gartner | Geography: Global\nDisruption potential\nExisting lloT platforms can be disrupted through the creation of a holistic, cloud-based platform\nthat integrates controls and analytics across all the devices in a network. Incumbent control\nsystems can be walled gardens that work only with certain devices and may not communicate\nfully with analytics systems. This gap decreases the ROI of IloT systems but also increases\ncustomer lock-in. Some incumbents have attempted to overcome the innovator's dilemma,\nincluding GE, SAP, Microsoft, and IBM. These platforms each have drawbacks in user experience\nthat create opportunities for startups to create use-friendly API-driven platforms.\nVC activity\nIndustrial loT had a breakout year in VC funding, raising over $2 billion for the first time, according\nto our data. VC funding remained robust throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, reflecting the\nneeds of startups to meet urgent customer demands to adapt to digital operations. While H2 saw\nonly two industrial loT mega-deals, some startups' valuations continued to grow. Predictive\nmaintenance startup Augury raised a $55.0 million Series D, achieving a 1.6x valuation step-up.\n20\nMining platform vendor Intellisense.io raised its valuation 2.7x in its second institutional round\nof the year. We believe few companies are achieving scale during the pandemic, but some appear\nto be establishing product-market fit, creating opportunities for M&A.\nWe recorded only two industrial loT exits in 2020 and note industrial automation incumbents\nhave been inactive in M&A. IloT incumbents include General Electric (NYSE: GE), Siemens (ETR:\nSIE), Robert Bosch, ABB Group (NYSE: ABB), and National Instruments (NASDAQ: NATI) based on\ntheir loT revenue and mindshare in the industry. Despite partaking in broader M&A activity, none\nof these incumbents have made pure-play acquisitions in loT since 2018. However, market\nconditions appear to be changing in ways that may support increased M&A by industrial\nautomation incumbents. The manufacturing & supply chain, is the largest category of loT in terms\nof end-user spending, is positioned for a high-growth year in 2021. In Q4 2020, ABB acquired\nhygienic robotics startup Codlan Robotics, demonstrating gaps exist in industrial automation\nportfolios and signaling the potential for increased exit activity in 2021.\nOpportunities\nAsset tracking: Existing GPS and RFID solutions are not ideal for tracking assets over long\ndistances because of high power requirements and low range, respectively. Low-power non-\ncellular sensors can be used to track assets for many industries that rely on freight for their\nsupply chains. Consumer goods, transportation, and defense are target markets for new\ntechnologies in the space due to high maintenance and inspection costs. We believe asset\ntracking will be among the fastest-growing IIOT subsegments, especially given the need for\nenterprises to gain additional visibility over their supply chains because of the pandemic. In\n2020, Accel-KKR invested $45.0 million in supply chain management startup Pinc, citing its ability\nto give Fortune 500 customers additional visibility over their supply chains during the pandemic.\nSamsara, Cloudleaf, and Nexxiot have developed a series of low-power sensors that enable\nlonger-distance tracking. Omni-ID and Eximia are developing improvements to conventional RFID\nsolutions, although we expect these solutions to remain limited.\nDigital twins: Digital twins refer to digital replicas of physical assets that can be used to measure\nand manage the real asset using a software platform. These replicas can reduce maintenance\ncosts and improve manufacturing efficiency since manufacturing processes can be simulated in\na software model. Digital twins are built on top of data from loT devices, including sensors,\nantennae, and control systems. An example is a digital twin of a jet engine built using the\nequipment sensors on the engine. If damage occurs, pilots can simulate how that engine will\nperform in various conditions and if fatal failure is likely to occur. They can then decide how best\nto use that engine, removing the guesswork from the process. OEMs benefit from these models\nbecause they can automate sales orders for replacement parts as soon as they are proven to be\ndefective, enabling distributors to gain an additional one to two turns of inventory per year.\nDigital twins maintained a flat market size in 2020 due to high demand and their ability to\nenhance workforce efficiency. End-user spending on digital twins is forecast to reach $12.7 billion\nin 2021, an 18.8% snapback over 2020.2 Startups constructing replicas of real assets include\nHumatics and Uptake. Uptake can leverage its industry-leading library of equipment failure\nmodes to build digital twins that evolve over time with new data. At the early stage, Elevat is\n21\nplanning to connect digital twins to sales order automation, which could be a value creator for\nOEMs.\nConsiderations\nLimited product-market fit with enterprises: Architectural complexity among disparate\nmachineries makes implementing new loT components and protocols especially difficult and\ntime-consuming. Many companies that are adopting loT strategies remain in \"pilot\" mode.\nAlthough international standards such as ISA-95 have been developed to help create automated\ninterfaces across control systems and enterprises, successful deployments and use cases still\nrequire a patchwork of custom software integrations and long sales cycles to persuade both IT\nand OT stakeholders.\nIncumbents dominate the market and have wide moats: Currently, the major players in this space\nare the large conglomerates such as GE or Siemens that dominate the market. Additionally,\ncollaboration among incumbents is increasing, which may crowd out startups in this space. For\nexample, Cisco has integrated its networking capabilities with GE's Predix. The result of such\npartnerships may bridge the gap between controls and analytics.\nOutlook\nNiche use cases to generate organic growth for focused startups: In the near term, enterprises\nmay not be ready to swap out legacy control systems for widescale loT deployments. For this\nreason, we do not expect holistic solutions for industrial automation to gain much traction.\nStartups that focus on specific problems, including agricultural field monitoring, oil & gas\noptimization, and mine monitoring, are likely to deliver better analytics and predictive\nmaintenance relative to incumbents and have a better shot at unbundling existing control system\nplatforms.\nCVC Investments to translate to acquisitions: Industrial automation incumbents escalated their\nVC activity in recent years, with investment count led by Honeywell, Siemens, and ABB doubling.\nThe parent companies of each of these corporate venture arms have business lines in lioT, and\nwe believe that IIOT companies are prime acquisition targets for the parents of these CVC arms,\nespecially given valuation pressures from the pandemic. Already in Q4 2020, ABB acquired\nhygienic robotics startup Codlan Robotics, demonstrating the gaps in industrial automation\nportfolios that have emerged as a result of shifting preferences. We believe new sources of\ndemand will require acquisitions to keep up with the market.\nSmart metering to cede to asset tracking as sensors Improve: Smart metering has been the initial\nfrontier of lioT due to the clear use case for utilities to manage energy usage among their\ncustomers. Given the high penetration of smart meters, we expect the next growth opportunity\nin lioT to be in asset tracking, where legacy technologies do not offer a sufficient ROI to drive\ngrowth, and more advanced supply chain tracking is required. Given the scale of physical assets\nin transit in fields such as healthcare, construction, and supply chain, we expect this industry\ncould amount to a billion-dollar opportunity for startups in hardware, software, and connectivity.\n22\n3.2 Similar deals and recent M&As\nWe based our valuation on a top-down, market benchmark analysis for the last 3 years of M&As\nactivity in the IIOT and supply chain tech domains. We analyzed several types of material marking\nsolutions, such as Applied DNA’s CertainT, iTRACE and SecureMarking. On the blockchain front,\nsome of the most active startups are Netherlands-based Circularise, UK-based Circulor and\nEverledger. Circulor just announced a $25 million funding, but it has numerous high profile\nclients, including Jaguar, Mercedes and Boeing. Also, Several incumbents are getting in on the\nact, such as GreenToken by SAP. And multiple Japanese industrial firms are using blockchain for\nplastic recycling, including Teijin, Mitsui Chemicals, Mitsubishi Chemicals, Asahi Kasei and others.\nWe estimated SMX's valuation based on similar competitors benchmarking (see appendix), using\ndata from Pitchbook, a financial database. Based on these companies' last known average post-\nmoney valuation, we explore SMX's valuation benchmark at $146.9M (N=46, a non-exhaustive\nlist can be found at the appendix).\n3.3 SMX recent capital raising\nSMX recently merged on 28th February 2023 with Lionheart III Corp. The combined entity had a\npro forma valuation of US$360 with a valuation of $200M for SMX.\nWe also explored SMX's past fundraising. SMX has launched its anticipated anti-fraud solution\nfor gold, trueGold, a co-owned entity with The Perth Mint Australia (which is wholly owned by\nthe Government of Western Australia). This is the world's first mine-to-marketplace ethical gold\nsupply chain assurance solution. trueGold is the world's first mine-to-marketplace ethical gold\nsupply chain assurance solution.\nIn Q4 2020, The Perth Mint invested in trueGold based on a $80M post-valuation where SMX\nalone holds 47%. Besides gold, SMX's raised additional capital to support its diamond activity\nfor a $40M post-money valuation.\nSMX is focus on six different markets aligned with its business plan: Plastic, Fashion, Gold,\nPremium wine & spirits, Electronics, and Metals. However, we believe that SMX has the potential\nto expand into additional markets based on its unique platform.\n23\n3.4 Valuation summary\nSMX recently merged on 28th February 2023 with Lionheart III Corp. The combined entity had a\npro forma valuation of US$360 with a value of $200M for SMX. SMX began trading on Nasdaq on\n8th March 2023 with share price of $3.03 and closed with $3.64 with total shares outstanding of\n22,501,306 shares.\nWe based our analysis on:\n1) Similar M&As deals that have conducted in recent years in the specific sub sectors and\nstages SMX is operating in, i.e. IIOT and supply chain tech. Our research indicates a range\nof $142.2 to $151.6M and on average of $146.9M.\n2) SMX entered into SPAC with a value of $200M based on arm’s length transaction value.\n3) SMX recent capital raising for its subsidiries (TrueGold, diamond firm) indicates additional\nvalue. Furthermore, SMX is a technology platform firm and in such it can generate more\nassets to all materials as it did for gold and diamond.\nSMX, as of March 31st, 2023, has $5.68M of cash and cash equvilents (including funds from its\nSPAC deal and other sources) and loans (long term loans until 2024) of $3.86, i.e. net cash of\n$1.82.3 We assume quarterly burn rate of approx.. $1.2M, thus, SMX will raise capital soon as to\nsupport its strategy for 2023 and beyond.\nWe conclude our analysis based on similar M&As deals that have conducted in recent years in\nthe specific sub sectors and stages SMX is operating in with a range of $142.2M to $151.6M and\non an average value of $146.9M.\nBased on the above, we initiate our coverage with a price target range of $6.3 to $6.7 with an\naverage of $6.5.\n3 Company’s prospectus.\n24\nAppendix 1: Similar Deals Sample (non-exhaustive list)\nCompany Pre-\nCompany Company\nDescription money Valuation\nName Country\n(million, USD)\nProducer of ready to eat food products and beverages intended to offer\nnutritional meal alternatives.

Under the Scheme those shares will be cancelled with such participants receiving Parent Shares on the basis of the Scheme consideration, subject to SMX option holder approval, Australian court approval and the satisfaction of various conditions. \n\nSubject to the terms and conditions set forth in the BCA and the SID, SMX shareholders will receive consideration under the Scheme of 1 Parent Share per 10.3624 SMX shares having an implied value of $10.00 per Parent Share and Parent will become the holder of all of the issued shares in SMX and Lionheart, with SMX being delisted from the ASX. \n\nUnder the BCA, Merger Sub will merge with and into Lionheart, with Lionheart surviving the merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent, with existing Lionheart stockholders receiving Parent Shares in exchange for their existing Lionheart shares and existing Lionheart warrant holders having their warrants automatically adjusted to become exercisable in respect of Parent Shares instead of Lionheart shares (“Parent Warrants”), as further described in the BCA, subject to Lionheart stockholder approval and the satisfaction of various other conditions. \n\nWe are actively pursuing to enter into subscription agreements (collectively, the “Subscription Agreements”) with certain institutional and accredited investors (collectively, the “PIPE Investors”), pursuant to which the PIPE Investors will agree to subscribe for and purchase, and we will agree to issue and sell to such PIPE Investors, prior to or substantially concurrently with the closing of the Business Combination, up to $25 million in securities of the Company (the “PIPE Financing”). The securities to be issued pursuant to the Subscription Agreements will not be registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\nAct”), in reliance upon the exemption provided in Section 4(a)(2) thereof. Currently, we have not confirmed whether the Sponsor, directors, officers or their affiliates will participate in the PIPE Financing nor are aware of any material differences in the terms and price of securities issued at the time of the IPO and the securities to be issued in connection with the PIPE financing at this time. \n\nThe closing of any PIPE Financing would be subject to customary conditions for a financing of this nature, including the substantially concurrent consummation of the Business Combination. The Subscription Agreements are expected to provide that the Company will grant the PIPE Investors customary registration rights with respect to any securities issued to such investors in connection with any PIPE Financing following the Closing. \n\nIn connection with the Closing, the Class B common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, of the Company (the “Class B Common Stock”), issued prior to the initial public offering of the Company, held by our sponsor, Lionheart Equities, LLC (the “Sponsor”), and certain other Company stockholders will automatically convert into shares of Class A Common Stock on a one-for-one basis, not subject to adjustment. In connection with the signing of the BCA, the Sponsor and certain members of our board of directors and management team waived all of the adjustment rights they were granted in connection with our IPO. In addition, the Sponsor and certain members of our board of directors and/or management team have agreed to (a) vote all of their shares of Class B Common Stock and all of their shares of Class A Common Stock in favor of the Business Combination and each other proposal described in the accompanying proxy statement/prospectus, (b) certain restrictions on their shares of Class A Common Stock and (c) in the case of the Sponsor, use best efforts to contain any transaction costs that are allocable to the Company in accordance with the BCA. \n\nOur publicly traded Class A Common Stock, redeemable warrants to purchase one share of Class A Common Stock (“Company Public Warrants”) and Company Public Units comprising one share of Class A Common Stock and one-half of one Company Public Warrant (“Company Public Units”) are currently listed on The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”) under the symbols “LION,” “LIONW” and “LIONU,” respectively. \n\nAlthough the Parent is not currently a public reporting company, following the effectiveness of the registration statement of which this proxy statement/prospectus is a part and the closing of the Transactions (as defined in the BCA), Parent will become subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act. Parent will apply for listing, to be effective at the time of the consummation of the Transactions, of the Parent Shares and warrants on Nasdaq under the symbols “SMX” and “SMXW”, respectively, and Parent is expected to be publicly traded on Nasdaq under those symbols following the completion of the Transactions, subject to receipt of Nasdaq’s approval and official notice of issuance. While trading on Nasdaq is expected to begin on the first business day following the date of completion of the Transactions, there can be no assurance that Parent’s securities will be listed on Nasdaq or that a viable and active trading market will develop. See “ _Risk Factors_ ” for more information. \n\nThe Company will hold a special meeting of stockholders in lieu of the 2022 annual meeting (the “Special Meeting”) to consider matters relating to the proposed Business Combination. In connection with the Special Meeting, you will be asked to consider and vote upon (i) a proposal (the “Business Combination Proposal”) to approve the BCA, a copy of which is attached to the accompanying proxy statement/prospectus as _Annex A_ ,and the transactions contemplated thereby; and (ii) a proposal to adjourn the Special Meeting to a later date or dates, if necessary, (A) to ensure that any supplement or amendment to the accompanying proxy statement/prospectus that the Lionheart Board of Directors (the “Lionheart Board”) has determined in good faith is required by applicable law to be disclosed to Lionheart stockholders and for such supplement or amendment to be promptly disseminated to Lionheart stockholders prior to the Special Meeting, (B) if, as of the time for which the Special Meeting is originally scheduled, there are insufficient shares of common stock represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct business at the Special Meeting or (C) to permit further solicitation and vote of proxies if there are insufficient votes for, or otherwise in connection with, the approval of the Business Combination Proposal (the “Adjournment Proposal”). Each of these proposals is more fully described in the accompanying proxy statement/prospectus, which each stockholder is encouraged to read carefully. \n\nThe Special Meeting will be held at 1:00 p.m. Eastern Time, on January 30, 2023, in virtual format. \n\nYOUR VOTE IS VERY IMPORTANT, REGARDLESS OF THE NUMBER OF SHARES OF COMMON STOCK YOU OWN. To ensure your representation at the Special Meeting, please complete and return the \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\nenclosed proxy card or submit your proxy by following the instructions contained in the accompanying proxy statement/prospectus and on your proxy card. Please submit your proxy promptly whether or not you expect to attend the Special Meeting. Submitting a proxy now will NOT prevent you from being able to vote in person at the Special Meeting. If you hold your shares in “street name,” you should instruct your broker, bank, or other nominee how to vote in accordance with the voting instruction form you receive from your broker, bank, or other nominee. \n\nThe Lionheart Board has unanimously approved the BCA and the transactions contemplated thereby and recommends that the Lionheart stockholders vote “FOR” the approval of the BCA, and “FOR” the other matters to be considered at the Special Meeting. When you consider the Lionheart Board’s recommendation of these proposals, you should keep in mind that our directors and officers have interests in the Business Combination that may conflict with your interests as a stockholder. Please see the section entitled “ _Summary of the Proxy Statement/Prospectus — Interests of Certain Persons in the Business Combination_ ” for additional information. \n\n**Parent will be an “emerging growth company” as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, and is therefore eligible to take advantage of certain reduced reporting requirements otherwise applicable to other public companies.**\n\n**Parent will also be a “foreign private issuer” as defined in the Exchange Act and will be exempt from certain rules under the Exchange Act that impose certain disclosure obligations and procedural requirements for proxy solicitations under Section 14 of the Exchange Act.

You are cordially invited to attend the Special Meeting, which will be held for the following purposes: \n\n(1) |  _The Business Combination Proposal —_ To consider and vote upon a proposal to approve the Business Combination Agreement, dated as of July 26, 2022 (as it may be amended, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time, the “BCA”), a copy of which is attached to the accompanying proxy statement/prospectus as _Annex A_ , by and among Lionheart, Security Matters Limited, a publicly traded company on the Australian Securities Exchange (“ASX”) (“SMX”), Empatan Public Limited Company, a public limited company incorporated in Ireland (“Parent”), and Aryeh Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (“Merger Sub”), and a scheme implementation deed, as may be amended, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time (“SID”), a copy of which is attached to the accompany proxy statement/prospectus as _Annex B_ _-1_ , by and among Lionheart, SMX and Parent, and the transactions contemplated thereby. Under the SID, SMX has agreed to propose a scheme of arrangement under Part 5.1 of the Corporations Act (“Scheme”) and capital reduction (“Capital Reduction”) which, if implemented, will result in all shares in SMX being cancelled in return for the issuance of ordinary shares of Parent (“Parent Shares”), with Parent then being issued one share in SMX (“SMX Shares”) (resulting in SMX becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent), subject to SMX shareholder approval, Australian court approval and the satisfaction of various conditions. In addition, SMX has agreed to propose an option scheme of arrangement under Part 5.1 of the Corporations Act (“Option Scheme”) which, if implemented, will result in the SMX options held by participants in the Option Scheme being subject to a cashless exercise based on a Black-Scholes valuation, in exchange for SMX Shares. Under the Scheme those shares will be cancelled and such participants receiving Parent Shares on the basis of the Scheme consideration, subject to SMX option holder approval, Australian court approval and the satisfaction of various conditions. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the BCA and the SID, SMX shareholders will receive consideration under the Scheme of 1 Parent Share per 10.3624 SMX shares having an implied value of $10.00 per Parent Share and Parent will become the holder of all of the issued shares in SMX and Lionheart, with SMX being delisted from the ASX. Under the BCA, Merger Sub will merge with and into Lionheart, with Lionheart surviving the merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent, with existing Lionheart stockholders receiving Parent Shares in exchange for their existing Lionheart shares and existing Lionheart warrant holders having their warrants automatically adjusted to become exercisable in respect of Parent Shares instead of Lionheart shares (“Parent Warrants”), as further described in the BCA, subject to Lionheart stockholder approval and the satisfaction of various other conditions.   \n---|---  \n(2) |  _The Adjournment Proposal —_ To consider and vote upon a proposal to approve the adjournment of the Special Meeting to a later date or dates, if necessary, (A) to ensure that any supplement or amendment to the accompanying proxy statement/prospectus that the Board of Directors of the Company (the “Lionheart Board”) has determined in good faith is required by applicable law to be disclosed to Company stockholders and for such supplement or amendment to be promptly disseminated to Company stockholders prior to the Special Meeting, (B) if, as of the time for which the Special Meeting is originally scheduled, there are insufficient shares of common stock represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct business at the Special Meeting or   \n---|---  \n  \n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\n(C) to permit further solicitation and vote of proxies if there are insufficient votes for, or otherwise in connection with, the approval of the Business Combination Proposal (the “Adjournment Proposal” and, together with the Business Combination Proposal, each, a “Proposal” and collectively, the “Proposals”).   \n---  \n  \nThese items of business are described in the accompanying proxy statement/prospectus, which we encourage you to read in its entirety before voting. Only holders of record of our common stock at the close of business on January 6, 2023 (the “Record Date”) are entitled to notice of the Special Meeting and to vote and have their votes counted at the Special Meeting and any adjournments or postponements of the Special Meeting. \n\nPursuant to our Existing Charter, we will provide holders of our Class A Common Stock with the opportunity to redeem their Company Public Shares for cash equal to their pro rata share of the aggregate amount on deposit in the Trust Account, which holds the proceeds of our initial public offering, as of two business days prior to the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Business Combination Proposal (including interest not previously released to us to pay its taxes). For illustrative purposes, based on funds in the Trust Account of approximately $127.0 million on September 30, 2022, the estimated per share redemption price would have been approximately $10.10, excluding interest not previously released to us to pay our taxes. The Company originally had until November 8, 2022 to complete a business combination. On November 8, 2022, December 8, 2022 and January 9, 2023, respectively, the Company caused $412,500 (representing $0.033 per share of Class A common stock) on each such date to be deposited into the Trust Account to extend the date by which it has to consummate its initial business combination to February 8, 2023 (or until May 8, 2023 if the Company extends the period of time to consummate its initial business combination pursuant to any further Extension Period). Accordingly, if the Company takes the full time through February 8, 2023 to complete the Business Combination (or until May 8, 2023 if it extends the period of time to consummate its initial business combination pursuant to any further Extension Period), the conversion amount per share at the special meeting for such business combination or the Company’s subsequent liquidation will be approximately $10.20 per share (without taking into account any interest), in comparison to the current conversion amount of approximately $10.10 per share. \n\nCompany Public Stockholders may elect to redeem their shares even if they vote “FOR” the Business Combination Proposal. A holder of Company Public Shares, together with any affiliate of such holder or any other person with whom such holder is acting in concert or as a “group” (as defined in Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act), will be restricted from seeking redemption rights with respect to more than 15% of the Company Public Shares without our prior consent. Accordingly, all Company Public Shares in excess of 15% held by a Company Public Stockholder, together with any affiliate of such holder or any other person with whom such holder is acting in concert or as a “group,” will not be redeemed for cash without our prior consent. Each redemption of shares by Company Public Stockholders will decrease the amount in the Trust Account. We will not consummate the Business Combination if the redemption of shares would result in the Company’s failure to have at least $5,000,001 of net tangible assets. Lionheart Equities, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the “Sponsor”) and our directors and officers have entered into a letter agreement with us pursuant to which they agreed to waive their redemption rights in connection with the consummation of the Business Combination with respect to any shares of common stock they may hold. Nomura Securities International, Inc. (“Nomura”), Northland Securities, Inc. (“Northland”) and Drexel Hamilton, LLC (“Drexel”, and together with Nomura and Northland, the “Underwriters”), the underwriters of our IPO (as defined herein), have also agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to the Company Public Shares held by them, other than Company Public Shares held directly or indirectly by it on behalf of a third-party client. The Sponsor, the Underwriters, SMX, Parent and/or their respective affiliates may purchase shares of Class A Common Stock on the open market. Such purchases (“Open Market Purchases”) will be made prior to the Special Meeting and will be separate from the redemption process conducted in connection with the Business Combination. The purposes of any Open Market Purchases would be to reduce the number of shares of Class A Common Stock that may be redeemed in connection with the Business Combination, and may include a business decision to increase such purchaser’s ownership at an attractive price. The Sponsor, the Underwriters, SMX, Parent and/or their respective affiliates shall only make Open Market Purchases to the extent the price per Class A Common Stock so acquired is no higher than the redemption price that would be available in connection with the redemption procedures described in the accompanying proxy statement/prospectus. In addition, the Sponsor, the Underwriters, SMX, Parent and/or \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\ntheir respective affiliates will waive any redemption rights with respect to any shares of Class A Common Stock purchased in Open Market Purchases and will not vote any shares of Class A Common Stock purchased in Open Market Purchases in favor of the Proposals. Currently, the Initial Stockholders (as defined herein) own 21.4% of our common stock, consisting of the Founder Shares and the Company Private Shares (each, as defined herein). Founder Shares and Company Private Shares will be excluded from the pro rata calculation used to determine the per-share redemption price. We have entered into a letter agreement with the Sponsor and our directors and officers, pursuant to which, among other things, each such person has agreed to vote all shares of our common stock owned by them in favor of the Proposals. However, we intend to waive such obligations of the Sponsor, our directors and/or our officers to vote their shares of common stock in favor of the Proposals in respect of any shares purchased by such purchasers in Open Market Purchases. The Underwriters have agreed to vote any shares of our common stock held by them in favor of the Business Combination. However, we intend to waive such obligations of the Underwriters to vote their shares of common stock in favor of the Proposals in respect of any shares purchased by the Underwriters in Open Market Purchases. In addition, the Underwriters have contingent fees owing to them upon the successful completion of the Business Combination consisting of deferred underwriting fees of $4,375,000. \n\nAfter careful consideration, the Lionheart Board has determined that the Business Combination Proposal and the Adjournment Proposal are fair to and in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders and unanimously recommends that you vote or give instruction to vote “**FOR** ” the Business Combination Proposal and “**FOR** ” the Adjournment Proposal, if presented. \n\nThe approval of each of the Business Combination Proposal and the Adjournment Proposal, if presented, requires the affirmative vote (in person or by proxy) of the holders of a majority of the shares of Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock entitled to vote and actually cast thereon at the Special Meeting, voting as a single class. \n\nConsummation of the Business Combination is conditioned on the approval of the Business Combination Proposal at the Special Meeting, subject to the terms of the BCA and the SID. The Business Combination is not conditioned on the Adjournment Proposal. The proxy statement/prospectus accompanying this notice explains the BCA and the SID and the transactions contemplated thereby, as well as the Proposals to be considered at the Special Meeting. Please review the proxy statement/prospectus carefully and in its entirety. \n\nAll our stockholders are cordially invited to attend the Special Meeting in virtual format. There will be no physical meeting location and the Special Meeting will only be conducted via live webcast at the following address: https://www.cstproxy.com/lionheartiii/2023. Our stockholders may attend, vote and examine the list of our stockholders entitled to vote at the Special Meeting by visiting and entering the control number found on their proxy card, voting instruction form or notice included in their proxy materials.

Under the SID, SMX has agreed to propose the Scheme and Capital Reduction which, if implemented, will result in all shares in SMX being cancelled in return for the issuance of Parent Shares, with Parent then being issued one SMX Share (resulting in SMX becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent), subject to SMX shareholder approval, Australian court approval and the satisfaction of various conditions. In addition, SMX has agreed to propose the Option Scheme which, if implemented, will result in the SMX options held by participants in the Option Scheme being subject to a cashless exercise based on a Black-Scholes valuation, in exchange for SMX Shares. Under the Scheme, those shares will be cancelled and such participants receiving Parent Shares on the basis of the Scheme consideration, subject to SMX option holder approval, Australian court approval and the satisfaction of various conditions. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the BCA and the SID, SMX shareholders will receive consideration under the Scheme of 1 Parent Share per 10.3624 SMX shares having an implied value of $10.00 per Parent Share and Parent will become the holder of all of the issued shares in SMX and Lionheart, with SMX being delisted from the ASX. Under the BCA, Merger Sub will merge with and into Lionheart, with Lionheart surviving the merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent, with existing Lionheart stockholders receiving Parent Shares in exchange for their existing Lionheart shares and existing Lionheart, warrant holders, having their warrant automatically adjusted to become exercisable in respect of Parent Shares instead of Lionheart shares, as further described in the BCA, subject to Lionheart stockholder approval and the satisfaction of various other condition.   \n---|---  \n**Q:** |  **WHY AM I RECEIVING THIS DOCUMENT?**  \n---|---  \nA: |  The Company is sending this proxy statement/prospectus to its stockholders to help them decide how to vote their shares of the Company’s common stock with respect to the matters to be considered at the Special Meeting.

If we do not consummate the Business Combination and fail to complete an initial business combination by February 8, 2023 (or until May 8, 2023 if we extend the period of time to consummate our initial business combination pursuant to any further Extension Period), we will be required to dissolve and liquidate our Trust Account by returning the then remaining funds in such account to the Public Stockholders.   \n---|---  \n**Q:** |  **WHAT IS SMX’s BUSINESS?**  \n---|---  \nA: |  SMX provides one solution to solve both authentication and track and trace challenges in order to uphold supply chain integrity and provide quality assurance and brand accountability to producers of goods. Its technology works as a track and trace system using a marker, a reader and an algorithm to identify embedded sub-molecular particles in order to track and trace different components along a production process (or any other marked good along a supply chain) to the end producer.   \n---|---  \n**Q:** |  **WHY IS THE COMPANY PROPOSING THE BUSINESS COMBINATION?**  \n---|---  \nA: |  We are a blank check company incorporated as a Delaware corporation on January 28, 2021 and incorporated for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses. Our acquisition plan is not limited to a particular industry or geographic region for purposes of consummating an initial business combination. However, we (a) must complete an initial business combination with one or more target businesses that together have a fair market value of at least 80% of the assets held in the Trust Account (excluding the deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on the income earned on the Trust Account) at the time of the agreement to enter into the initial business combination and (b) are not, under the Existing Charter, permitted to effect an initial business combination with a blank check company or a similar company with nominal operations.   \n---|---  \n  \nWe have identified several criteria and guidelines we believe are important for evaluating acquisition opportunities. We use these criteria and guidelines in evaluating acquisition opportunities, but we can decide \n\n11 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\nto enter into an initial business combination with a target business that does not meet these criteria and guidelines. We are seeking to acquire companies that we believe: (a) can utilize the extensive networks we have built in the real estate industries; (b) have a defensible core business, sustainable revenues and established customer relationships; (c) are undergoing change in capital structure, strategy, operations or growth; (d) can benefit from our operational and strategic approach; (e) offer a unique value proposition with transformational potential that can be substantiated during our detailed due diligence process; and (f) have reached a transition point in their lifecycle presenting an opportunity for transformation. Based on its due diligence investigations of SMX and the industry in which it operates, including the financial and other information provided by SMX in the course of their negotiations in connection with the Business Combination, the Lionheart Board has unanimously determined that the Business Combination with SMX is fair and advisable to, and in the best interests of, the Company and its stockholders. See the section entitled “ _The Business Combination_ _—_ _Lionheart’s Board of Directors’ Reasons for the Approval of the Business Combination._ ” \n\n**Q:** |  **DID THE LIONHEART BOARD OBTAIN A FAIRNESS OPINION IN DETERMINING WHETHER OR NOT TO PROCEED WITH THE BUSINESS COMBINATION?**  \n---|---  \nA: |  Yes. The Lionheart Board obtained a fairness opinion from Scura Partners, dated July 24, 2022, which provided that, as of that date and based on and subject to the assumptions, qualifications and other matters set forth therein, (i) the consideration in the Transactions is fair from a financial point of view to the Company and (ii) the fair market value of SMX equals or exceeds 80% of the amount held by the Company in trust for benefit of its public stockholders (excluding any deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on interest earned on the trust account). The opinion of Scura Partners was limited to the fairness, from a financial point of view to the Company, of the aggregate consideration to be paid pursuant to the SID and the BCA. Scura Partners did not express an opinion as to the fairness of the Transaction or any aspect or implication thereof to, or any other consideration of or relating to, the holders of any class of securities, creditors, or other constituencies of Empatan, the Company or SMX. See the section entitled “ _The Business Combination —_ _Fairness Opinion of Scura Partners_ ” of this proxy statement/prospectus for additional information.   \n---|---  \n**Q:** |  **WHY IS THE COMPANY PROVIDING STOCKHOLDERS WITH THE OPPORTUNITY TO VOTE ON THE BUSINESS COMBINATION?**  \n---|---  \nA: |  We are seeking approval of the Business Combination for purposes of complying with our Existing Charter. In addition, pursuant to the Existing Charter, we must provide all Company Public Stockholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their Company Public Shares upon the consummation of an initial business combination (as defined in our Existing Charter), either in conjunction with a tender offer or in conjunction with a stockholder vote to approve such initial business combination. If we submit an initial business combination to the stockholders for their approval, our Existing Charter requires us to conduct a redemption offer in conjunction with the proxy solicitation (and not in conjunction with a tender offer) pursuant to the applicable SEC proxy solicitation rules.   \n---|---  \n**Q:** |  **DO SMX SHAREHOLDERS NEED TO APPROVE THE BUSINESS COMBINATION?**  \n---|---  \nA: |  SMX shareholders are separately voting to approve the Scheme and the Capital Reduction as discussed in the section entitled “ _The Business Combination Agreement and Scheme Implementation Deed_ ”.   \n---|---  \n**Q:** |  **DO I HAVE REDEMPTION RIGHTS?**  \n---|---  \nA: |  If you are a holder of Company Public Shares, you have the right to demand that the Company redeem such shares for a pro rata portion of the cash held in the Trust Account, which holds the proceeds of the IPO, as of two business days prior to the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Business Combination Proposal (including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to the Company to pay taxes) upon the Closing (“Redemption Rights”).   \n---|---  \n  \nNotwithstanding the foregoing, a holder of Company Public Shares, together with any affiliate of such holder or any other person with whom such holder is acting in concert or as a “group” (as defined in \n\n12 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\nSection 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act) will be restricted from seeking redemption with respect to more than 15% of the Public Shares without our consent. Accordingly, all Company Public Shares in excess of 15% held by a Company Public Stockholder, together with any affiliate of such stockholder or any other person with whom such holder is acting in concert or as a “group,” will not be redeemed without our consent. \n\nUnder the Existing Charter, the Business Combination may be consummated only if the Company has at least $5,000,001 of net tangible assets after giving effect to all redemption requests from holders of Company Public Shares that properly demand redemption of their shares for cash. \n\n**Q:** |  **WILL MY VOTE AFFECT MY ABILITY TO EXERCISE REDEMPTION RIGHTS?**  \n---|---  \nA: |  No. You may exercise your redemption rights whether you vote your Company Public Shares for or against, or whether you abstain from voting on, the Business Combination Proposal or any other Proposal described in this proxy statement/prospectus. As a result, the Business Combination Proposal can be approved by stockholders who will redeem their Company Public Shares and no longer remain stockholders, and the Business Combination may be consummated even though the funds available from the Trust Account and the number of Company Public Stockholders are substantially reduced as a result of redemptions by Company Public Stockholders. The Sponsor, the Underwriters, SMX, Parent and/or their respective affiliates may purchase shares of Class A Common Stock on the open market. Such purchases (“Open Market Purchases”) will be made prior to the Special Meeting and will be separate from the redemption process conducted in connection with the Business Combination. The purposes of any Open Market Purchases would be to reduce the number of shares of Class A Common Stock that may be redeemed in connection with the Business Combination, and may include a business decision to increase such purchaser’s ownership at an attractive price. The Sponsor, the Underwriters, SMX, Parent and/or their respective affiliates shall only make Open Market Purchases to the extent the price per Class A Common Stock so acquired is no higher than the redemption price that would be available in connection with the redemption procedures described in this proxy statement/prospectus. In addition, the Sponsor, the Underwriters, SMX, Parent and the stockholders and/or their respective affiliates will waive any redemption rights with respect to any shares of Class A Common Stock purchased in Open Market Purchases and will not vote any shares of Class A Common Stock purchased in Open Market Purchases in favor of the Proposals.   \n---|---  \n**Q:** |  **HOW DO I EXERCISE MY REDEMPTION RIGHTS?**  \n---|---  \nA: |  In order to exercise your redemption rights, you must (i) if you hold Company Public Units, separate the underlying Company Public Shares and Company Public Warrants, and (ii) prior to 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time on, January 26, 2023 (two business days before the Special Meeting), tender your shares physically or electronically and submit a request in writing that we redeem your Company Public Shares for cash to Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, our transfer agent (“Transfer Agent”), at the following address:   \n---|---  \n  \nContinental Stock Transfer & Trust Company \n\n1 State Street 30th Floor \n\nNew York, New York 10004 \n\nAttention: Mark Zimkind \n\nEmail: Mzimkind@continentalstock.com \n\nPlease check the box on the enclosed proxy card marked “Stockholder Certification” if you are not acting in concert or as a “group” (as defined in Section 13d-3 of the Exchange Act) with any other stockholder with respect to shares of common stock. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a holder of the Company Public Shares, together with any affiliate of his or any other person with whom he is acting in concert or as a “group” (as defined in Section 13d-3 of the Exchange Act) will be restricted from exercising redemption rights with respect to more than an aggregate of 15% of the shares of Class A Common Stock included in the Company Public Units sold in our IPO. Accordingly, all Company Public Shares in excess of the 15% threshold beneficially owned by a Company Public Stockholder or group will not be redeemed for cash without our prior consent. \n\n13 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\nStockholders seeking to exercise their redemption rights and opting to deliver physical certificates should allot sufficient time to obtain physical certificates from the Transfer Agent and time to effect delivery. It is our understanding that stockholders should generally allot at least two weeks to obtain physical certificates from the Transfer Agent. However, we do not have any control over this process and it may take longer than two weeks. Stockholders who hold their shares in street name will have to coordinate with their bank, broker or other nominee to have the shares certificated or delivered electronically. \n\nStockholders seeking to exercise their redemption rights, whether they are record holders or hold their shares in “street name” are required to either tender their certificates to our Transfer Agent prior to the date set forth in these proxy materials, or up to two business days prior to the vote on the Business Combination Proposal at the Special Meeting, or to deliver their shares to the Transfer Agent electronically using Depository Trust Company’s (“DTC”) Deposit/Withdrawal At Custodian (“DWAC”) system, at such stockholder’s option. **The requirement for physical or electronic delivery prior to the Special Meeting ensures that a redeeming stockholder’s election to redeem is irrevocable once the Business Combination is approved**. \n\nThere is a nominal cost associated with the above-referenced tendering process and the act of certificating the shares or delivering them through the DWAC system. The Transfer Agent will typically charge a tendering broker a fee and it is in the broker’s discretion whether or not to pass this cost on to the redeeming stockholder. However, this fee would be incurred regardless of whether or not we require stockholders seeking to exercise redemption rights to tender their shares, as the need to deliver shares is a requirement to exercising redemption rights, regardless of the timing of when such delivery must be effectuated. \n\nFor a discussion of the material U.S. federal income tax considerations for holders of Company Public Shares with respect to the exercise of these redemption rights, see “ _Certain Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations_ ” beginning on page 149. \n\n**Q:** |  **DO I HAVE APPRAISAL RIGHTS IF I OBJECT TO THE PROPOSED BUSINESS COMBINATION?**  \n---|---  \nA: |  Holders of our Class A Common Stock are not entitled to appraisal rights in connection with the Business Combination under the DGCL. Holders of our Class B Common Stock have appraisal rights in certain circumstances as provided for under the DGCL.   \n---|---  \n**Q:** |  **WHAT HAPPENS TO THE FUNDS DEPOSITED IN THE TRUST ACCOUNT AFTER CONSUMMATION OF THE BUSINESS COMBINATION?**  \n---|---  \nA: |  A total of $126,250,000 in net proceeds of the IPO was placed in the Trust Account following the IPO. After consummation of the Business Combination, the funds in the Trust Account will be used to pay holders of the Company Public Shares who exercise redemption rights, to pay fees and expenses incurred in connection with the Business Combination (including aggregate fees of up to $4,375,000 as deferred underwriting commissions) and for the Post-Combination Company’s working capital and general corporate purposes. We currently have $126,425,233 remaining in our Trust Account to consummate a business combination or to fund any additional redemptions that could be requested as more fully provided herein.   \n---|---  \n**Q:** |  **WHAT HAPPENS IF THE BUSINESS COMBINATION IS NOT CONSUMMATED?**  \n---|---  \nA: |  There are certain circumstances under which the BCA and the SID may be terminated. Please see the section entitled “ _The Business Combination Agreement and Scheme Implementation Deed — Termination of the Business Combination Agreement”_ and “— _Termination of the SID”_ for information regarding the parties’ specific termination rights.   \n---|---  \n  \n14 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\nIf we do not consummate the Business Combination, we may continue to try to complete a business combination with a different target business until February 8, 2023 (or until May 8, 2023 if we extend the period of time to consummate our initial business combination pursuant to any further Extension Period). Unless we amend the Existing Charter (which requires the affirmative vote of the holders of 65% of all then outstanding shares of Common Stock) and amend certain other agreements into which we have entered to extend the life of the Company, if we fail to complete an initial business combination by February 8, 2023 (or until May 8, 2023 if we extend the period of time to consummate our initial business combination pursuant to any further Extension Period), then we will: (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up; (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem our Company Public Shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest not previously released to the Company to pay its taxes (less up to $100,000 of such net interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding Company Public Shares, which redemption will completely extinguish our Company Public Stockholders’ rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any), subject to applicable law; and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and the Lionheart Board, dissolve and liquidate, subject in each case to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. In the event of such distribution, it is possible that the per share value of the residual assets remaining available for distribution (including Trust Account assets) will be less than the initial public offering price per unit in the IPO. See the section entitled “ _Risk Factors — Risks Related to the Company and the Business Combination_.” \n\nHolders of our Founder Shares have waived any right to any liquidation distribution with respect to such shares. In addition, if we fail to complete a business combination by February 8, 2023 (or until May 8, 2023 if we extend the period of time to consummate our initial business combination pursuant to any further Extension Period), there will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect to our outstanding warrants, which will expire worthless. \n\n**Q:** |  **HOW DO THE SPONSOR, AND OUR DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS INTEND TO VOTE ON THE PROPOSALS?**  \n---|---  \nA: |  The Sponsor and the Company’s directors and officers are entitled to vote an aggregate of 22.0% of the outstanding shares of common stock (which includes the Founder Shares and the Company Private Shares). The Company has entered into a letter agreement with the Sponsor and our directors and officers pursuant to which, among other things, each such person has agreed to vote all shares of our common stock owned by them in favor of the Proposals. However, we intend to waive such obligations of the Sponsor, our directors and/or our officers to vote their shares of common stock in favor of the Proposals in respect of any shares purchased by such purchasers in Open Market Purchases. As a result, in addition to the shares of common stock held by the Sponsor and its officers and directors, Lionheart may need only 4,612,501, or 36.9% (assuming all outstanding shares are voted), or approximately 4.85% (assuming only the minimum number of shares representing a quorum are voted), of the Class A Common Stock to be voted in favor of the Business Combination in order to have the Business Combination approved.   \n---|---  \n**Q:** |  **WHAT CONSTITUTES A QUORUM AT THE SPECIAL MEETING?**  \n---|---  \nA: |  A majority of the voting power of the common stock entitled to vote at the Special Meeting must be present, in person or represented by proxy at the Special Meeting to constitute a quorum and in order to conduct business at the Special Meeting. Abstentions and broker non-votes will be counted as present for the purpose of determining a quorum. The Underwriters, the Sponsor and our directors and officers, who collectively currently own 22.0% of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock, will count towards this quorum. In the absence of a quorum, the chairman of the Special Meeting has power to adjourn the Special Meeting. As of the Record Date for the Special Meeting, 8,012,501 shares of common stock would be required to be present in person or represented by proxy to achieve a quorum.   \n---|---  \n  \n15 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\n**Q:** |  **WHAT VOTE IS REQUIRED TO APPROVE EACH PROPOSAL AT THE SPECIAL MEETING?**  \n---|---  \nA: |  _The Business Combination Proposal:_ The approval of the Business Combination Proposal requires the affirmative vote (in person or by proxy) of the holders of a majority of the shares of Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock entitled to vote and actually cast thereon at the Special Meeting, voting as a single class. Accordingly, a stockholder’s failure to submit a proxy or to vote in person at the Special Meeting, as well as an abstention from voting and a broker non-vote with regard to the Business Combination Proposal, will have no effect on the Business Combination Proposal. Company stockholders must approve the Business Combination Proposal in order for the Business Combination to occur.   \n---|---  \n  \n_The Adjournment Proposal:_ The approval of the Adjournment Proposal, if presented, requires the affirmative vote (in person or by proxy) of the holders of a majority of the shares of Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock entitled to vote and actually cast thereon at the Special Meeting, voting as a single class. Accordingly, a stockholder’s failure to submit a proxy or to vote in person at the Special Meeting, as well as an abstention from voting and a broker non-vote with regard to the Adjournment Proposal, will have no effect on the Adjournment Proposal. The Business Combination is not conditioned on the approval of the Adjournment Proposal. \n\nThe Company has entered into a letter agreement with the Sponsor and our directors and officers pursuant to which, among other things, each such person has agreed to vote all shares of our common stock owned by it, him or her in favor of the Proposals. However, we intend to waive such obligations of the Sponsor, our directors and/or our officers to vote their shares of common stock in favor of the Proposals in respect of any shares purchased by such purchasers in Open Market Purchases. \n\n**Q:** |  **DO ANY OF THE COMPANY’S OFFICERS OR DIRECTORS HAVE INTERESTS IN THE BUSINESS COMBINATION THAT MAY DIFFER FROM OR BE IN ADDITION TO THE INTERESTS OF STOCKHOLDERS?**  \n---|---  \nA: |  The Sponsor and our directors and officers have interests in the Business Combination that are different from or in addition to (and which may conflict with) your interests. You should take these interests into account in deciding whether to approve the Proposals. These interests include:   \n---|---  \n• |  the fact that our Initial Stockholders have agreed not to redeem any of the Founder Shares in connection with a stockholder vote to approve the proposed Business Combination;   \n---|---  \n• |  the fact that Ophir Sternberg, Roger Meltzer and Thomas Hawkins will serve as directors of the Post-Combination Company. Ophir Sternberg, Roger Meltzer and Thomas Hawkins are affiliated with the Company. Ophir Sternberg currently serves as the Company’s Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer and Roger Meltzer and Thomas Hawkins currently serve as directors of the Company;   \n---|---  \n• |  the fact that the Sponsor paid an aggregate of $25,000 for 2,875,000 Founder Shares in January 2021. Without giving effect to the sales or transfer of Founder Shares to the Underwriters and in connection with the IPO to certain insiders, the remaining 3,125,000 Founder Shares will have a significantly higher value at the time of the Business Combination, which if unrestricted and freely tradable would be valued at approximately $31,250,000 but, given the restrictions on such shares, we believe such shares have less value;   \n---|---  \n• |  the fact that our Initial Stockholders have agreed to waive their rights to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account with respect to their Founder Shares if we fail to complete an initial business combination by February 8, 2023 (or until May 8, 2023 if we extend the period of time to consummate our initial business combination pursuant to any further Extension Period) (or such later date as may be approved by the Company’s stockholders);   \n---|---  \n• |  the fact that the Sponsor paid an aggregate of $2,750,000 for Company Private Units comprised of 275,000 shares of Class A Common stock and 137,500 Company Private Warrants to purchase shares   \n---|---  \n  \n16 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\nof Class A Common Stock and that such Company Private Warrants will expire worthless if a business combination is not consummated by February 8, 2023 (or until May 8, 2023 if we extend the period of time to consummate our initial business combination pursuant to any further Extension Period);   \n---  \n• |  the continued right of the Sponsor to hold Class A Common Stock and the shares of Class A Common Stock to be issued to the Sponsor upon exercise of its Company Private Warrants following the Business Combination, subject to certain lock-up periods;   \n---|---  \n• |  if the Trust Account is liquidated, including in the event we are unable to complete an initial business combination within the required time period, the Sponsor has agreed to indemnify us to ensure that the proceeds in the Trust Account are not reduced below $10.10 per Public Share, or such lesser per Company Public Share amount as is in the Trust Account on the liquidation date, by the claims of prospective target businesses with which we have entered into an acquisition agreement or claims of any third party (other than our independent public accountants) for services rendered or products sold to us, but only if such a vendor or target business has not executed a waiver of any and all rights to seek access to the Trust Account;   \n---|---  \n• |  the Sponsor (including its representatives and affiliates) and the Company directors and officers, are, or may in the future become, affiliated with entities that are engaged in a similar business to the Company. For example, each of the Company’s officers may be considered an affiliate of the Sponsor. The Sponsor and the Company’s directors and officers are not prohibited from sponsoring, or otherwise becoming involved with, any other blank check companies prior to the Company completing its initial business combination. Moreover, certain of the Company’s directors and officers have time and attention requirements for certain other companies. The Company’s directors and officers also may become aware of business opportunities which may be appropriate for presentation to the Company and the other entities to which they owe certain fiduciary or contractual duties.   \n---|---  \n  \nAccordingly, they may have had conflicts of interest in determining to which entity a particular business opportunity should be presented. These conflicts may not be resolved in the Company’s favor and such potential business opportunities may be presented to other entities prior to their presentation to the Company, subject to applicable fiduciary duties. The Existing Charter provides that the Company renounces its interest in any corporate opportunity offered to any director or officer unless such opportunity is expressly offered to such person solely in his or her capacity as a director or officer of the Company and such opportunity is one the Company is legally and contractually permitted to undertake and would otherwise be reasonable for the Company to pursue, and to the extent the director or officer is permitted to refer that opportunity to the Company without violating another legal obligation. For more information, see “ _Management of the Company_ — _Conflicts of_ _Interests_.” \n\n• |  the fact that Ophir Sternberg has certain business dealings tied to shares of the Post-Combination Company. For more information, see “ _Certain Relationships and Related Person Transactions_ ”;   \n---|---  \n• |  the continued indemnification of our existing directors and officers and the continuation of our directors’ and officers’ liability insurance after the Business Combination;   \n---|---  \n• |  the fact that the Sponsor and our directors and officers will lose their entire investment in us and will not be reimbursed for any out-of-pocket expenses if an initial business combination is not consummated by February 8, 2023 (or until May 8, 2023 if we extend the period of time to consummate our initial business combination pursuant to any further Extension Period). The approximate value of Sponsor’s interest in the Post Combination Company is $34,000,000 million, consisting of 3,400,000 shares of Class B Common Stock at a price of $10.00 per share, which will automatically convert into Shares of Class A Common Stock at the Closing of the Business Combination. The cost basis of this investment was approximately $4.78 million, consisting of 3,125,000 Founder Shares at $0.008, per share, or $25,000, 275,000 private placement units at $10.00 per unit, or $2,750,000, plus 2,000,000 private warrants at a price of $1.00 per warrant, or $2,000,000;   \n---|---  \n  \n17 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\n• |  that, at the closing of the Business Combination we will enter into the amended and restated registration rights agreement (“Registration Rights Agreement”), substantially in the form attached as _Annex_ _E_ to this proxy statement/prospectus, with the Sponsor and our directors and officers, which provides for registration rights to such persons and their permitted transferees;   \n---|---  \n• |  that, Ophir Sternberg entered into a chairman agreement (“Chairman Agreement”), with Parent and Faquiry Diaz entered into an independent contractor agreement, with Parent, which provides for certain services to the Post-Combination Company and a grant of restricted stock units in the Post-Combination Company; and   \n---|---  \n• |  that, each independent director of the Post-Combination Company will be granted restricted stock units in the Post-Combination Company.   \n---|---  \n  \nThese interests may influence our directors and officers in making their recommendation that you vote in favor of the approval of the Business Combination. \n\n**Q:** |  **WHAT DO I NEED TO DO NOW?**  \n---|---  \nA: |  The Company urges you to read carefully and consider the information contained in this proxy statement/prospectus, including the Annexes and the other documents referred to herein, and to consider how the Business Combination will affect you as a stockholder of the Company. Stockholders should then vote as soon as possible in accordance with the instructions provided in this proxy statement/prospectus and on the enclosed proxy card.   \n---|---  \n**Q:** |  **WHAT HAPPENS IF I SELL MY SHARES OF CLASS A COMMON STOCK BEFORE THE SPECIAL MEETING?**  \n---|---  \nA: |  The Record Date for the Special Meeting is earlier than the date that the Business Combination is expected to be completed. If you transfer your shares of Class A Common Stock after the Record Date, but before the Special Meeting, unless the transferee obtains from you a proxy to vote those shares, you will retain your right to vote at the Special Meeting. However, you will not be able to seek redemption of your shares of Class A Common Stock because you will no longer be able to tender them prior to the Special Meeting in accordance with the provisions described herein. If you transferred your shares of Class A Common Stock prior to the Record Date, you have no right to vote those shares at the Special Meeting or redeem those shares for a pro rata portion of the proceeds held in the Trust Account.   \n---|---  \n**Q:** |  **HOW DO I VOTE?**  \n---|---  \nA: |  If you are a holder of record of common stock on the Record Date, you may vote in person at the Special Meeting by attending the meeting virtually or by submitting a proxy for the Special Meeting. You may submit your proxy by completing, signing, dating and returning the enclosed proxy card in the accompanying pre-addressed postage paid envelope. You may also vote by telephone or Internet by following the instructions printed on the proxy card.   \n---|---  \n  \nIf you hold your shares in “street name,” which means your shares are held of record by a broker, bank, or nominee, you should contact your broker, bank, or other nominee to ensure that votes related to the shares you beneficially own are properly counted. In this regard, you must provide the broker, bank, or nominee with instructions on how to vote your shares or, if you wish to attend the meeting and vote in person, obtain a proxy from your broker, bank, or nominee. \n\n**Q:** |  **IF MY SHARES ARE HELD IN “STREET NAME” BY A BROKER, BANK, OR OTHER NOMINEE, WILL MY BROKER, BANK, OR OTHER NOMINEE VOTE MY SHARES FOR ME?**  \n---|---  \nA: |  If your shares are held in “street name” in a stock brokerage account or by a broker, bank, or other nominee, you must provide the record holder of your shares with instructions on how to vote your shares. Please   \n---|---  \n  \n18 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\nfollow the voting instructions provided by your broker, bank, or other nominee. Please note that you may not vote shares held in “street name” by returning a proxy card directly to the Company or by voting in person at the Special Meeting unless you provide a “legal proxy,” which you must obtain from your broker, bank, or other nominee.   \n---  \n  \nUnder the rules of Nasdaq, brokers who hold shares in “street name” for a beneficial owner of those shares typically have the authority to vote in their discretion on “routine” proposals when they have not received instructions from beneficial owners. However, brokers are not permitted to exercise their voting discretion with respect to the approval of matters that Nasdaq determines to be “non-routine” without specific instructions from the beneficial owner. It is expected that all proposals to be voted on at the Special Meeting are “non-routine” matters. Broker non-votes occur when a broker or nominee is not instructed by the beneficial owner of shares to vote on a particular proposal for which the broker does not have discretionary voting power. \n\nIf you are a Company stockholder holding your shares in “street name” and you do not instruct your broker, bank, or other nominee on how to vote your shares, your broker, bank, or other nominee will not vote your shares on the Business Combination Proposal or the Adjournment Proposal. Such broker non-votes will will have no effect on the vote count for such other proposals. \n\n**Q:** |  **WHAT IF I ATTEND THE SPECIAL MEETING AND ABSTAIN OR DO NOT VOTE?**  \n---|---  \nA: |  For purposes of the Special Meeting, an abstention occurs when a stockholder attends the meeting in person and does not vote or returns a proxy with an “abstain” vote.   \n---|---  \n  \nIf you are a Company stockholder that attends the Special Meeting virtually and fails to vote on the Business Combination Proposal and the Adjournment Proposal, your failure to vote will have no effect on the Business Combination Proposal or the Adjournment Proposal; however, your attendance will be counted for the purpose of establishing a quorum at the Special Meeting. \n\n**Q:** |  **WHAT WILL HAPPEN IF I RETURN MY PROXY CARD WITHOUT INDICATING HOW TO VOTE?**  \n---|---  \nA: |  If you are a holder of record of common stock on the Record Date and you sign and return your proxy card without indicating how to vote on any particular Proposal, the common stock represented by your proxy will be voted “**FOR** ” each of the Proposals presented at the Special Meeting.   \n---|---  \n**Q:** |  **MAY I CHANGE MY VOTE AFTER I HAVE MAILED MY SIGNED PROXY CARD?**  \n---|---  \nA: |  Yes. If you are a holder of record of common stock on the Record Date, you may change your vote at any time before your proxy is exercised by doing any one of the following:   \n---|---  \n• |  send another proxy card with a later date;   \n---|---  \n• |  notify the Company’s Secretary in writing before the Special Meeting that you have revoked your proxy; or   \n---|---  \n• |  attend the Special Meeting and vote electronically by visiting and entering the control number found on your proxy card, voting instruction form or notice you previously received.   \n---|---  \n• |  If you are a stockholder of record and you choose to send a written notice or to mail a new proxy, you must submit your notice of revocation or mail your new proxy to MacKenzie Partners, Inc., 1407 Broadway, 27th Floor, New York, New York, 10018, and it must be received at any time before the vote is taken at the Special Meeting. Any proxy that you submitted may also be revoked by submitting a new proxy by mail, or online or by telephone, not later than 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on the day prior to the Special Meeting date, or by voting online at the Special Meeting. Simply attending   \n---|---  \n  \n19 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\nthe Special Meeting will not revoke your proxy. If you have instructed a broker, bank, or other nominee to vote your shares of common stock, you must follow the directions you receive from your broker, bank, or other nominee in order to change or revoke your vote.   \n---  \n**Q:** |  **WHAT HAPPENS IF I FAIL TO TAKE ANY ACTION WITH RESPECT TO THE SPECIAL MEETING?**  \n---|---  \nA: |  If you fail to take any action with respect to the Special Meeting and the Business Combination is approved by stockholders and consummated, you will become a stockholder of the Post-Combination Company. Failure to take any action with respect to the Special Meeting will not affect your ability to exercise your redemption rights. If you fail to take any action with respect to the Special Meeting and the Business Combination is not approved, you will continue to be a stockholder of the Company while the Company searches for another target business with which to complete a business combination.   \n---|---  \n**Q:** |  **WHAT SHOULD I DO WITH MY SHARE, AND WARRANT CERTIFICATES?**  \n---|---  \nA: |  Stockholders should not submit their certificates now, unless you are a stockholder exercising your redemption rights. After the consummation of the Transactions, Parent will send instructions to stockholders regarding the delivery of their share and warrant certificates in return for securities of Parent.   \n---|---  \n**Q:** |  **WHAT SHOULD I DO IF I RECEIVE MORE THAN ONE SET OF VOTING MATERIALS?**  \n---|---  \nA: |  Stockholders may receive more than one set of voting materials, including multiple copies of this proxy statement/prospectus and multiple proxy cards or voting instruction cards. For example, if you hold your shares in more than one brokerage account, you will receive a separate voting instruction card for each brokerage account in which you hold shares. If you are a holder of record and your shares are registered in more than one name, you will receive more than one proxy card. Please complete, sign, date and return each proxy card and voting instruction card that you receive in order to cast a vote with respect to all of your shares.   \n---|---  \n**Q:** |  **WHAT ARE THE MATERIAL U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE BUSINESS COMBINATION TO ME?**  \n---|---  \nA: |  As described more fully under the section entitled “ _Certain Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations — Material U.S. Federal Tax Considerations — The Business Combination_ ” below, the Business Combination has been structured to qualify as a “reorganization” within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, though there is substantial uncertainty as to whether the requirements for a “reorganization” can be satisfied, and in the event that the Business Combination does not satisfy the requirements of a “reorganization,” the Business Combination also has been structured to, and it is the opinion of our counsel will, qualify as a transaction described in Section 351(a) of the Code. Assuming the Business Combination qualifies as a “reorganization” under Section 368(a) of the Code of a transaction described in Section 351(a) of the Code, U.S. holders (as defined below) should not generally recognize gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes with respect to the shares that they own as a result of the Business Combination. Should the Business Combination not satisfy the requirements of a “reorganization,” qualifying only as a transaction described in Section 351(a) of the Code, the exchange of Company Public Warrants for Parent Warrants would be taxable.

The Excise Tax, if imposed, will create a tax liability on the Company repurchasing shares after the Business Combination and not on the shareholders who exercise their redemption rights. The Company’s Existing Charter permits the use of interest earned on the proceeds placed in the Trust Account to pay taxes that may be levied on the Company, including the possible Excise Tax.

To better understand the Business Combination and the proposals to be considered at the special meeting, you should read this entire proxy statement/prospectus carefully, including the annexes. See also the section entitled “Where You Can Find More Information.” Each item in this summary refers to sections of this proxy statement on what that subject is discussed in more detail_. \n\n**Parties to the Business Combination**\n\n**_Lionheart III Corp_**\n\nThe Company is a blank check company incorporated on January 14, 2021 as a Delaware corporation and formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses. \n\nThe Company’s securities are traded on Nasdaq under the ticker symbols “LION,” “LIONU” and “LIONW.” The mailing address of the Company’s principal executive office is 4218 NE 2nd Avenue, Miami, Florida 33137 and the telephone number of the Company’s principal executive office is (305) 573-3900.\n\n**_Security Matters Limited_**\n\nSecurity Matters Limited (together with its subsidiaries, “SMX”) provides one solution to solve both authentication and track and trace challenges in order to uphold supply chain integrity and provide quality assurance and brand accountability to producers of goods. Its technology works as a track and trace system using a marker, a reader and an algorithm to identify embedded sub-molecular particles in order to track and trace different components along a production process (or any other marked good along a supply chain) to the end producer \n\nSMX was incorporated in May 2018 under Australian law. In October 2018, SMX was listed on the Australian Securities Exchange under the symbol “SMX.” \n\nThe mailing address of SMX’s principal executive office is Level 25, 525 Collins Street, Melbourne, VIC, Australia, 3000 and its telephone number is +61 3 9321 9888. \n\nFor more information about SMX, see the sections entitled “ _Business of Security Matters_ ” and “ _Security Matters’ Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation_.” \n\n**_Parent_**\n\nParent will serve as a holding company for SMX and Lionheart after consummation of the Transactions. Parent’s current sole shareholder is Doron Afik. \n\nParent was formed on July 1, 2022 as a public limited company under the name Empatan Public Limited Company, incorporated in Ireland. Parent’s principal executive office is located at Mespil Business Centre, Mespil House, Sussex Road, Dublin 4, Ireland, D04 T4A6. Parent’s telephone number is +353 1 920 1000. Parent is newly incorporated for the purposes of becoming a holding company following the Business Combination. Accordingly, Parent has no operation activities and only has nominal assets consisting of cash and cash equivalents and no liabilities. As such, no financial statements of Parent are required or included in this proxy statement/prospectus. After the consummation of the Transactions, Parent will become the continuing public company. Parent expects to apply to list its shares on Nasdaq under the symbols “SMX” and “SMXW”, respectively. \n\n22 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\n**_Merger Sub_**\n\nMerger Sub was formed solely as a vehicle for consummating the Merger under the name Aryeh Merger Sub, Inc., and is a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent. \n\nMerger Sub, a Delaware corporation , was formed on July 22, 2022. Merger Sub’s principal executive office is located at K&L Gates LLP, Level 25, 525 Collins Street, Melbourne VIC 3000, Australia. Merger Sub’s telephone number is +61-3-9205-2000. After the consummation of the Transactions, it will cease to exist. \n\n**Emerging Growth Company**\n\nParent qualifies as an “emerging growth company,” as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act, as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (“JOBS Act”), which means that it can take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies. These include, but are not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation (to the extent applicable to a foreign private issuer). \n\nParent could remain an emerging growth company until the last day of Parent’s fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of Lionheart’s initial public offering. However, if Parent’s annual gross revenue is $1.07 billion or more, if its non-convertible debt issued within a three year period exceeds $1 billion or the market value of its shares that are held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million on the last day of the second fiscal quarter of any given fiscal year, Parent would cease to be an emerging growth company as of the following fiscal year. \n\n**Foreign Private Issuer**\n\nParent will be a “foreign private issuer” as defined under the Exchange Act. As a foreign private issuer under the Exchange Act, Parent will be exempt from certain rules under the Exchange Act, including the proxy rules, which impose certain disclosure and procedural requirements for proxy solicitations. Moreover, Parent will not be required to file periodic reports and financial statements with the SEC as frequently or as promptly as domestic U.S. companies with securities registered under the Exchange Act, and Parent will not be required to comply with Regulation FD, which imposes certain restrictions on the selective disclosure of material information. In addition, Parent’s officers, directors and principal shareholders will be exempt from the reporting and “short-swing” profit recovery provisions of Section 16 of the Exchange Act and the rules under the Exchange Act with respect to their purchases and sales of Parent Shares. \n\nAs a foreign private issuer, Parent will also be permitted to follow certain home country corporate governance practices instead of those otherwise required under the applicable rules of Nasdaq for domestic U.S. issuers. In order to rely on this exception, Parent is required to disclose each Nasdaq rule that it does not intend to follow and describe the home country practice that Parent will follow in lieu thereof. Parent does not currently intend to follow any Irish corporate governance practices in lieu of Nasdaq corporate governance rules. \n\n**The Business Combination, the BCA and the SID**\n\n**_The Business Combination Agreement_**\n\nThe terms and conditions of the Business Combination are contained in the BCA and the SID, which are attached as _Annex A_ and _Annex B-1_ , respectively, to this proxy statement/prospectus.

Under the Scheme those shares will be cancelled and such participants receiving Parent Shares on the basis of the Scheme consideration, subject to SMX option holder approval, Australian court approval and the satisfaction of various conditions. \n\n**_Consideration_**\n\nSubject to the terms and conditions set forth in the BCA and the SID, SMX shareholders will receive consideration under the Scheme of 1 Parent Share per 10.3624 SMX shares having an implied value of $10.00 per Parent Share and Parent will become the holder of all of the issued shares in SMX and Lionheart, with SMX being delisted from the ASX. \n\nUnder the BCA, Merger Sub will merge with and into Lionheart, with Lionheart surviving the merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent, with existing Lionheart stockholders receiving Parent Shares in exchange for their existing Lionheart shares and existing Lionheart warrant holders having their warrants automatically adjusted to become exercisable in respect of Parent Share instead of Lionheart shares (“Parent Warrants”), as further described in the BCA, subject to Lionheart stockholder approval and the satisfaction of various other conditions. \n\n**_Conditions to the Closing of the Business Combination_**\n\n_Conditions to the Obligations of Each Party_\n\nThe obligations of SMX, Lionheart, Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the Business Combination are subject to the satisfaction or waiver (where permissible) of certain condition precedents of the SID. \n\n_Conditions to the Obligations of Lionheart_\n\nThe obligations of the Company to consummate the Business Combination are subject to the satisfaction or waiver (where permissible) of additional conditions, including: \n\n• |  certain conditions precedent of the SID;

The form of Lock-up Agreement is attached to this proxy statement as _Annex G_. \n\n27 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\n**Amended and Restated Sponsor Agreement**\n\nLionheart entered into an amended and restated Sponsor Agreement (the “A&R Sponsor Agreement”) with Lionheart Equities, LLC (the “Sponsor”) and certain directors and officers of Lionheart (the “Insiders”) pursuant to which the Sponsor and Insiders have agreed to take, or not take, certain actions, including: (a) to vote any shares of common stock of Lionheart owned by it, him or her (all such shares of common stock, the “Covered Shares”) in favor of the Business Combination and each other related proposal related at the Lionheart stockholder meeting and any other special meeting of Lionheart’s stockholders called for the purpose of soliciting the approval of Lionheart’s stockholders in connection with the consummation of the Business Combination; (b) to vote the Covered Shares owned by it, him or her against any Lionheart Competing Transaction or change in the capitalization of Lionheart except as contemplated by the BCA and the SID, and (c) not redeem any Covered Shares owned by it, him or her for redemption in connection with such shareholder approval. The A&R Sponsor Agreement is attached to this proxy statement as _Annex D_. \n\n**Registration Rights Agreement**\n\nThe BCA and the SID contemplates that, prior to the Second Court Date, the Parent, the Sponsor, certain Lionheart stockholders, and certain SMX shareholders will enter into an amended and restated registration rights agreement (the “A&R Registration Rights Agreement”) pursuant to which, among other things, the Parent will agree to undertake certain shelf registration obligations in accordance with the Securities Act, and certain subsequent related transactions and obligations, including, among other things, undertaking certain registration obligations, and the preparation and filing of required documents. The A&R Registration Rights Agreement is attached to this proxy statement as _Annex E_. \n\n**Voting Agreement**\n\nPrior to the Second Court Date, the Parent and the Shareholders (as defined in the Voting Agreement) will enter into a Voting Agreement (the “Voting Agreement”) pursuant to which, among other things, during the Term (as defined in the Voting Agreement) the Parent and the Shareholders have agreed to take all such action within its power as may be necessary or appropriate (including the Parent nominating or appointing certain persons and the Shareholders voting or providing a written consent or proxy, if applicable, in each case with respect to ordinary shares of the Parent) such that the board of directors of the Parent (a) consists of seven (7) members as set forth in the Voting Agreement and (b) is divided into three classes of directors, with each class serving for staggered three year terms. The Voting Agreement also provides for certain board observer rights and director indemnification obligations. The Voting Agreement is attached to this proxy statement as _Annex F_. \n\n**PIPE Subscription Agreements**\n\nWe are actively pursuing to enter into the Subscription Agreements with the PIPE Investors, pursuant to which the PIPE Investors will agree to subscribe for and purchase, and we will agree to issue and sell to such PIPE Investors, prior to or substantially concurrently with the closing of the Business Combination, up to $25 million in securities of the Company. The securities to be issued pursuant to the Subscription Agreements have not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), in reliance upon the exemption provided in Section 4(a)(2) thereof. Currently, we have not confirmed whether the Sponsor, directors, officers or their affiliates will participate in the PIPE Financing nor are aware of any material differences in the terms and price of securities issued at the time of the IPO and the securities to be issued in connection with the PIPE financing at this time. \n\nThe closing of any PIPE Financing will be subject to customary conditions for a financing of this nature, including the substantially concurrent consummation of the Business Combination. The Subscription Agreements are expected to provide that the Company will grant the PIPE Investors customary registration rights with respect to any securities issued to such investors in connection with any PIPE Financing following the Closing. \n\n28 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\n**2022 Incentive Equity Plan**\n\nPrior to the effectiveness of the registration statement, Parent’s board of directors and its shareholders will approve and adopt the SMX Public Limited Company 2022 Incentive Equity Plan (the “2022 Incentive Equity Plan”) which will reserve for grant a number of Parent Shares equal to 15% of the number of issued and outstanding Parent Shares immediately after the closing of the Business Combination. Additionally, pursuant to the 2022 Incentive Equity Plan, the Parent Shares reserved for issuance thereunder will automatically increase annually by 5% on the first day of each fiscal year beginning with the 2023 fiscal year. The 2022 Incentive Equity Plan is attached to this proxy statement as _Annex J_. \n\n**Recent Developments**\n\nIn August 2022, SMX entered into a Standby Equity Facility to raise up to US $1,400,000 (AU$ 2,000,000) for the period until October 31, 2022. Under the Standby Equity Facility, SMX retains full control of the subscription process, with the discretion as to whether to request share placements, the timing of the share placements and the maximum number of shares to be requested to be issued under each placement; the purchase price per SMX share is of 91.5% of the of the volume weighted average price of SMX’s shares during the relevant valuation period with a floor price of AU$ 0.17 (approximately US$ 0.12). \n\nSMX and Parent entered into term sheets dated August 24, 2022 and September 05, 2022, with three private investors and entered into a note dated September 06, 2022 (the “Warrants Bridge Loan”), with one of such private investors, which investors agreed to lend SMX and Parent an aggregated term sheets amount of $3,760,000 against 10% interest per annum (paid quarterly in arrears) with 50% of the loan to be repaid with interest on the first anniversary of the date of issue and 50% on the earlier of (i) the second anniversary of the date of issue, and (ii) a change in control event (which does not include the Business Combination). It has also been agreed that each investor will receive 200,000 warrants to subscribe for Parent Shares, 50,000 bonus warrants and a first priority security interest in the shares of SMX’s interest in trueGold Consortium Pty Ltd. The investors may redeem part of the warrants at closing of the Business Combination against 50% of the amount lent. \n\n**_Interests of Certain Persons in the Business Combination_**\n\nThe Sponsor and our directors and officers have interests in the Business Combination that are different from or in addition to (and which may conflict with) your interests. You should take these interests into account in deciding whether to approve the Proposals. As a result of such interests, the Sponsor and our directors and officers may be incentivized to complete a business combination with a less favorable combination partner or on terms less favorable to Company Public Stockholders rather than fail to complete a business combination by February 8, 2023 (or until May 8, 2023 if we extend the period of time to consummate our initial business combination pursuant to any further Extension Period) (or such later date as may be approved by the Company’s stockholders) and be forced to liquidate and dissolve the Company. These interests include: \n\n• |  the fact that our Initial Stockholders have agreed not to redeem any of the Founder Shares in connection with a stockholder vote to approve the proposed Business Combination;   \n---|---  \n• |  the fact that Ophir Sternberg, Roger Meltzer and Thomas Hawkins will serve as directors of the Post-Combination Company.

The Sponsor and the Company’s directors and officers are not prohibited from sponsoring, or otherwise becoming involved with, any other blank check companies prior to the Company completing its initial business combination. Moreover, certain of the Company’s directors and officers have time and attention requirements for certain other companies.

The approximate value of Sponsor’s interest in the Post Combination Company is $34,000,000 million, consisting of 3,400,000 shares of Class B Common Stock at a price of $10.00 per share, which will automatically convert into Shares of Class A Common Stock at the Closing of the Business Combination. The cost basis of this investment was approximately $4,780,000, consisting of 3,125,000 Founder Shares at $0.008, per share, or $25,000, 275,000 private placement units at $10.00 per unit, or $2,750,000, plus 2,000,000 private warrants at a price of $1.00 per warrant, or $2,000,000;   \n---|---  \n• |  that, at the closing of the Business Combination we will enter into the amended and restated registration rights agreement (“Registration Rights Agreement”), substantially in the form attached as _Annex_ _E_ to this proxy statement/prospectus, with the Sponsor and our directors and officers, which provides for registration rights to such persons and their permitted transferees;   \n---|---  \n• |  that, Ophir Sternberg entered into a chairman agreement (“Chairman Agreement”), with Parent and Faquiry Diaz entered into an independent contractor agreement, with Parent, which provides for certain services to the Post-Combination Company and a grant of restricted stock units in the Post-Combination Company; and   \n---|---  \n• |  that, each independent director of the Post-Combination Company will be granted restricted stock units in the Post-Combination Company.   \n---|---  \n  \n**_Reasons for the Approval of the Business Combination_**\n\nIn reaching its unanimous resolution (i) determining that the BCA, the SID and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Business Combination and the issuance of shares in connection therewith, are fair and advisable to, and in the best interests of, the Company and its stockholders and (ii) recommending that Company stockholders adopt the BCA and the SID and approve the Business Combination and the other transactions contemplated by the BCA and the SID, the Lionheart Board consulted with the Company’s legal and financial advisors in connection with its evaluation of the BCA, the SID and the Business Combination, reviewed the results of due diligence conducted by the Company’s management, together with its legal and financial advisors and considered a range of factors, including, but not limited to, the factors discussed below. In light of the large number and wide variety of factors considered in connection with its evaluation of the Business Combination, the Lionheart Board did not consider it practicable to, and did not attempt to, quantify or otherwise assign relative weights to the specific factors that it considered in reaching its determination and supporting its decision. The Lionheart Board viewed its decision as being based on all of the information available and the factors presented to and considered by it. In addition, individual directors may have given different weight to different factors. \n\nThe officers and directors of Lionheart have substantial experience with mergers and acquisitions and in evaluating the operating and financial merits of companies from a wide range of industries and concluded that their experience and backgrounds enabled them to make the necessary analyses and determinations regarding the Business Combination with SMX. In analyzing the Business Combination, the Lionheart Board conducted due diligence on the Company and researched the industry in which it operates and concluded that the Business Combination was in the best interest of stockholders. \n\nIn the prospectus for the IPO, the Company identified general criteria and guidelines that the Company believed would be important in evaluating prospective target businesses. The Company indicated its intention to acquire companies that it believes possess the following characteristics: \n\n• |  consider reasonably accepted valuation standards and methodologies to seek businesses, as determined in the sole discretion of the Company’s officers and directors.   \n---|---  \n  \n31 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\n• |  businesses that have generated attractive unit economics at scale, have established and growing revenue streams. The Company did not expect to acquire startup companies, companies with speculative business plans or companies that are excessively leveraged.   \n---|---  \n• |  businesses that have a leading, growing or unique niche market position in their respective sectors. The Company expected to analyze the strengths and weaknesses of target businesses relative to their competitors and seek to invest in one or more businesses that demonstrate advantages when compared to their competitors, including capable management team, defensible proprietary technology, strong adoption rates and relevant domain expertise.   \n---|---  \n• |  businesses that have experienced management teams or those that provide a platform to assemble an effective and capable management team. The Company expected to focus on management teams with a track record of driving revenue growth and creating value for their stockholders.   \n---|---  \n• |  businesses that will benefit from being publicly listed and can effectively utilize the broader access to capital and the public profile to grow and accelerate shareholder value creation.   \n---|---  \n• |  companies that have a leading or niche market position and that demonstrate advantages when compared to their competitors, which may help to create barriers to entry against new competitors.   \n---|---  \n• |  businesses that have historically generated, or has the near-term potential to generate, strong and sustainable free cash flow.   \n---|---  \n  \nIn considering the Business Combination, the Lionheart Board considered a number of factors pertaining to the Business Combination as generally supporting its decision to enter into the BCA, the SID and the transactions contemplated thereby, including, but not limited to, the following factors (not necessarily in order of relative importance): \n\n• |  **Reasonableness of the aggregate consideration to be paid to the Stockholders under the BCA and the SID**. Following a review of the financial data provided to the Company, including certain unaudited prospective financial information of SMX (including, where applicable, the assumptions underlying such unaudited prospective financial information) and the Company’s due diligence review of SMX’s business, the Lionheart Board determined that (i) the consideration in the Transactions is fair from a financial point of view to the Company and (ii) the fair market value of SMX equals or exceeds 80% of the amount held by the Company in trust for benefit of its public stockholders (excluding any deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on interest earned on the trust account). In this context “reasonable” means (i) given the uniqueness of the SMX business model, that the work done by the third party due diligence advisors supported the “reasonableness” of the assumptions used to validate the business model, (ii) that the variables considered by the Lionheart Board in relation to the financial analysis for the SMX business were a reasonable basis to compute the valuation, and (iii) given the inherent uncertainties in any long-term projections, particularly in a business like SMX’s where there is limited historical financial information to extrapolate.   \n---|---  \n• |  **Due Diligence.** The Company’s management and advisors conducted due diligence examinations of SMX, including: commercial, financial, legal and regulatory due diligence, and extensive discussions with SMX’s management and the Company’s management and legal advisors concerning such due diligence examinations of SMX.   \n---|---  \n• |  **Industry and Trends.** SMX’s business is based in a blockchain and technology industry focused on supply chain integrity, and that the Lionheart Board considers attractive, and which, following a review of industry trends and other industry factors (including, among other things, historic and projected market growth), the Lionheart Board believes has continued growth potential in future periods.   \n---|---  \n• |  **Opportunity to introduce an attractive asset class to public investors that has historically been transacted in non-US public market settings.** The Company’s belief that recent transactions involving SPACs indicate a market trend to bring companies with novel business models and innovative asset classes to the US public markets.   \n---|---  \n  \n32 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\n• |  **Negotiated Transaction.** The Lionheart Board considered the terms and conditions of the BCA, the SID and the related agreements and the transactions contemplated thereby, each party’s representations, warranties and covenants, the conditions to each party’s obligation to consummate the Business Combination and the termination provisions, as well as the strong commitment by both the Company and SMX to complete the Business Combination. The Lionheart Board also considered the financial and other terms of the Business Combination and the fact that such terms and conditions are reasonable and were the product of arm’s length negotiations between SMX and the Company.   \n---|---  \n• |  **Other Alternatives.** After a review of other business combination opportunities reasonably available to the Company, the Lionheart Board believes that the proposed Business Combination represents the best potential business combination reasonably available to the Company taking into consideration, among other things, the timing and likelihood of accomplishing the goals of any alternatives.   \n---|---  \n• |  **Post-Closing Governance**. The fact that the Sponsor had negotiated the right to nominate three members of the Board following the Business Combination, which the Lionheart Board believes will allow for the Post-Combination Company to benefit from the Sponsor’s professional relationships to identify potential board members that will have appropriate industry and/or financial knowledge and professional experience to oversee the Post-Combination Company and drive returns for stockholders.   \n---|---  \n• |  **Limitations of Review**. The Lionheart Board considered what they were presented and did obtain a fairness opinion from Scura Partners. The opinion confirmed (i) the consideration in the Transactions is fair from a financial point of view to the Company and (ii) the fair market value of SMX equals or exceeds 80% of the amount held by the Company in trust for benefit of its public stockholders (excluding any deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on interest earned on the trust account). Additionally, the opinion of Scura Partners was limited to the fairness, from a financial point of view to the Company, of the aggregate consideration to be paid pursuant to the SID and the BCA. Scura Partners did not express an opinion as to the fairness of the Transaction or any aspect or implication thereof to, or any other consideration of or relating to, the holders of any class of securities, creditors, or other constituencies of Empatan, the Company or SMX.   \n---|---  \n  \nThe Lionheart Board also considered various uncertainties and risks and other potentially negative factors concerning the Business Combination, including, but not limited to, the following: \n\n• |  **Benefits May Not Be Achieved**. The potential benefits of the Business Combination may not be fully achieved or may not be achieved within the expected timeframe.   \n---|---  \n• |  **Regulation**. The risk that changes in the regulatory and legislative landscape or new industry developments may adversely affect the projected financial results and the other business benefits anticipated to result from the Business Combination.   \n---|---  \n• |  **Stockholder Vote.** The Company’s stockholders may fail to approve the proposals necessary to effect the Business Combination.   \n---|---  \n• |  **Closing Conditions**. The completion of the Business Combination is conditioned on the satisfaction of certain closing conditions that are not within the Company’s control, including the receipt of certain required regulatory approvals.   \n---|---  \n• |  **Litigation Related to the Business Combination.** The possibility of litigation challenging the Business Combination or that an adverse judgment granting permanent injunctive relief could indefinitely enjoin consummation of the Business Combination.   \n---|---  \n• |  **Listing Risks.** The challenges associated with preparing SMX, for the applicable disclosure and listing requirements to which SMX will be subject as a publicly traded company.   \n---|---  \n• |  **Market Volatility** : The possibility that the SPAC market experiences volatility and disruptions, causing deal disruption.   \n---|---  \n  \n33 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\n• |  **Liquidation**. The risks and costs to the Company if the Business Combination is not completed, including the risk of diverting management focus and resources from other business combination opportunities, which could result in the Company being unable to effect an initial business combination by February 8, 2023 (or until May 8, 2023 if we extend the period of time to consummate our initial business combination pursuant to any further Extension Period).   \n---|---  \n• |  **Fees and Expenses**. The fees and expenses associated with completing the Business Combination. In addition, the Lionheart Board considered the fact that the Underwriters have contingent fees owing to it upon the successful completion of the Business Combination, consisting of deferred underwriting fees of approximately $4,375,000.   \n---|---  \n  \nIn addition to considering the factors described above, the Lionheart Board also considered other factors, including, without limitation: \n\n• |  **Interests of Certain Persons.** The Sponsor, our officers and certain of our directors may have interests in the Business Combination (see “— _Interests of Certain Persons in the Business Combination_ ”).   \n---|---  \n• |  **Other Risk Factors.** Various other risk factors associated with the business of SMX, as described in the section entitled “ _Risk Factors_ ” appearing elsewhere in this proxy statement/prospectus.   \n---|---  \n• |  **Fairness Opinion**. Scura Partners LLC provided its Fairness Opinion to the Lionheart Board that, subject to the assumptions, qualifications, limitations and other matters set forth in the opinion, (i) the consideration in the Transactions is fair from a financial point of view to the Company and (ii) the fair market value of SMX equals or exceeds 80% of the amount held by the Company in trust for benefit of its public stockholders (excluding any deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on interest earned on the trust account). Additionally, the opinion of Scura Partners was limited to the fairness, from a financial point of view to the Company, of the aggregate consideration to be paid pursuant to the SID and the BCA. Scura Partners did not express an opinion as to the fairness of the Transaction or any aspect or implication thereof to, or any other consideration of or relating to, the holders of any class of securities, creditors, or other constituencies of Empatan, the Company or SMX.   \n---|---  \n  \nThe Lionheart Board concluded, in its business judgment, that the potential benefits that it expects the Company and its stockholders to achieve as a result of the Business Combination outweigh the potentially negative and other factors associated with the Business Combination. Accordingly, the Lionheart Board unanimously determined that the Business Combination and the transactions contemplated by the BCA and the SID are fair and advisable to, and in the best interests of, the Company and its stockholders. \n\n**_Voting Power; Record Date_**\n\nStockholders will be entitled to vote or direct votes to be cast at the Special Meeting if they owned shares of common stock at the close of business on, January 6, 2023, the Record Date for the Special Meeting. Stockholders are entitled to one vote for each share of common stock owned at the close of business on the Record Date. If stockholders’ shares are held in “street name” or are in a margin or similar account, stockholders should contact their broker, bank, or other nominee to ensure that votes related to the shares they beneficially own are properly counted. On the Record Date, there were 16,025,000 shares of common stock outstanding, of which 12,500,000 were Public Shares, 3,125,000 were Founder Shares and 400,000 were Private Shares. \n\n**_Redemption Rights_**\n\n**If you are a holder of Company Public Shares, you have the right to demand that the Company redeem such shares for a pro rata portion of the cash held in the Trust Account, which holds the proceeds of the IPO, as of two business days prior to the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Business Combination Proposal (including interest earned on the funds held in the

See “ _Lionheart’s Board of Directors’ Reasons for Approval of the Business Combination” beginning on page 125._\n\nIn considering the Business Combination, the Lionheart Board considered a number of factors pertaining to the Business Combination as generally supporting its decision to enter into the BCA and the SID and the transactions contemplated thereby, including, but not limited to, the following factors (not necessarily in order of relative importance): \n\n• |  Following a review of the financial data provided to the Company, including certain unaudited financial information and models regarding SMX (including, where applicable, the assumptions underlying such unaudited financial information and models) and the Company’s due diligence review of SMX’s business, the Lionheart Board determined that the consideration to be paid to SMX shareholders was reasonable in light of such data and financial information.   \n---|---  \n• |  Scura Partners delivered an opinion to the Lionheart Board to the effect that, as of the date of such opinion, and subject to and based on the assumptions, limitations, qualifications, conditions and other matters set forth therein, that (i) the consideration in the Transactions is fair from a financial point of view to the Company and (ii) the fair market value of SMX equals or exceeds 80% of the amount held by the Company in trust for benefit of its public stockholders (excluding any deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on interest earned on the trust account).   \n---|---  \n• |  The Company’s management and advisors conducted due diligence examinations of SMX, including: commercial, financial, legal and regulatory due diligence, and extensive discussions with SMX’s management and the Company’s management and legal advisors concerning such due diligence examinations of SMX.   \n---|---  \n• |  The agreement by Mr. Alon to be subject to a post-Closing lockup in respect of his Parent Shares, subject to certain exceptions, and to enter into an employment agreement with the Post-Combination Company, which is expected to provide important stability to the leadership and governance of SMX.   \n---|---  \n• |  The terms and conditions of the BCA, the SID and the related agreements and the transactions contemplated thereby, each party’s representations, warranties and covenants, the conditions to each party’s obligation to consummate the Business Combination and the termination provisions, as well as the strong commitment by both the Company and SMX to complete the Business Combination.   \n---|---  \n  \n37 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\n• |  After a review of other business combination opportunities reasonably available to the Company, the Lionheart Board believes that the proposed Business Combination represents the best potential business combination reasonably available to the Company taking into consideration, among other things, the timing and likelihood of accomplishing the goals of any alternatives.   \n---|---  \n  \nThe Lionheart Board also considered various uncertainties and risks and other potentially negative factors concerning the Business Combination, including, but not limited to, the following: \n\n• |  Haggai Alon is a key business driver of SMX and the success of SMX remains highly dependent on his continued involvement.   \n---|---  \n• |  The potential benefits of the Business Combination may not be fully achieved or may not be achieved within the expected timeframe.   \n---|---  \n• |  The Company’s stockholders may fail to approve the proposals necessary to effect the Business Combination.   \n---|---  \n• |  The completion of the Business Combination is conditioned on the satisfaction of certain closing conditions that are not within the Company’s control, including the receipt of certain required regulatory approvals.   \n---|---  \n• |  The Company Public Stockholders will hold a minority position in the Post-Combination Company (approximately 27.72%, assuming (1) the no redemption scenario and (2) that the holders of the Company’s existing Company Public Warrants and Company Private Warrants exercise those warrants), as such, the Company’s current stockholders are unlikely to have an influence on the management of the Post-Combination Company. Such ownership percentage will be affected by the level of redemptions by Company Public Stockholders and the exercise of outstanding warrants. See “ _Summary of the Proxy Statement/Prospectus — Impact of the Business Combination on Parent’s Public Float_ ”.   \n---|---  \n• |  The challenges associated with preparing SMX, which is an Australian public company, for the applicable disclosure and listing requirements to which SMX will be subject as a publicly traded company in the United States.   \n---|---  \n• |  The possibility that the SPAC market experiences volatility and disruptions, causing deal disruption.   \n---|---  \n• |  The risks and costs to the Company if the Business Combination is not completed, including the risk of diverting management focus and resources from other business combination opportunities, which could result in the Company being unable to effect an initial business combination by February 8, 2023 (or until May 8, 2023 if we extend the period of time to consummate our initial business combination pursuant to any further Extension Period).   \n---|---  \n• |  The fees and expenses associated with completing the Business Combination. In addition, the Lionheart Board considered the fact that the Underwriters have contingent fees owing to the upon the successful completion of the Business Combination, consisting of deferred underwriting fees of approximately $4,375,000.   \n---|---  \n  \nIn addition to considering the factors described above, the Lionheart Board also considered other factors, including, without limitation the fact that some officers and directors of the Company may have interests in the Business Combination (see “ _The Business Combination — Interests of the_ _Lionheart’s Directors and_ _Executive Officers in the Business Combination_ ” beginning on page 128) and various other risk factors associated with the business of SMX, as described in the section entitled “ _Risk Factors_ ” appearing elsewhere in this proxy statement/prospectus. \n\n**Opinion of Scura Partners**\n\nLionheart retained Scura Partners to evaluate the fairness, from a financial point of view, to SMX Shareholders of the merger consideration to be paid to such holders in the transaction. On July 24, 2022, Scura \n\n38 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\nPartners rendered its opinion to the Lionheart Board, which provided that, as of that date and based on and subject to the assumptions, qualifications and other matters set forth therein, (i) the consideration in the Transactions is fair from a financial point of view to the Company, (ii) the fair market value of SMX equals or exceeds 80% of the amount held by the Company in trust for benefit of its public stockholders (excluding any deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on interest earned on the trust account) and (iii) the Transaction is fair to all of Lionheart Stockholders and SMX Shareholders, collectively as a group, as opposed to shareholders that are unaffiliated with the Sponsor and its affiliates. \n\nThe full text of Scura Partners’ written fairness opinion, dated July 24, 2022, which sets forth, among other things, the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and qualifications and limitations on the review undertaken, is included as _Annex H_ to this proxy statement/prospectus and is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. The summary of Scura Partners’ opinion is included in the section of this proxy statement/prospectus entitled “ _Opinion of Scura Partners_ ” beginning on page 38. You are encouraged to read Scura Partners’ opinion and that section carefully and in their entirety. Scura Partners’ opinion was provided for the benefit of the Lionheart Board (in its capacity as such) and Scura Partners’ opinion was rendered to the Lionheart Board in connection with the Lionheart Board’s evaluation of the transaction. Scura Partner’s opinion did not address the relative merits of the transaction as compared to any other transaction or business strategy in which Lionheart might engage or the merits of the underlying decision by Lionheart to engage in the transaction. Scura Partners’ opinion was not intended to and does not constitute a recommendation to any Lionheart stockholder as to how such stockholder should vote or act with respect to the transaction or any matter relating thereto. \n\nFor a summary of Scura Partner’s opinion and the methodology that Scura Partners used to render its opinion, see the section entitled “ _Summary of the Proxy Statement/Prospectus_ _— Opinion of Scura Partners_ ” of this proxy statement/prospectus for additional information. \n\n**Lionheart’s Special Meeting of Stockholders**\n\nThe Special Meeting will be held at 1:00 p.m. Eastern Time, on January 30, 2023 in virtual format. The Special Meeting can be accessed by visiting https://www.cstproxy.com/lionheartiii/2023, where Company stockholders will be able to listen to the meeting live and vote during the meeting. Additionally, Company stockholders have the option to listen to the Special Meeting by dialing 1 800-450-7155 (toll-free within the U.S. and Canada) or +1 857-999-9155 (outside of the U.S. and Canada, standard rates apply). The passcode for telephone access is 4747463#, but please note that Company stockholders who choose to participate telephonically cannot vote or ask questions. Please note that you will only be able to access the Special Meeting by means of remote communication. At the Special Meeting, Company stockholders will be asked to vote on the Business Combination Proposal and, if necessary, the Adjournment Proposal. \n\nStockholders will be entitled to vote or direct votes to be cast at the Special Meeting if they owned shares of common stock at the close of business on January 6, 2022, the Record Date for the Special Meeting. Stockholders are entitled to one vote for each share of common stock owned at the close of business on the Record Date. If stockholders’ shares are held in “street name” or are in a margin or similar account, stockholders should contact their broker, bank, or other nominee to ensure that votes related to the shares they beneficially own are properly counted. On the Record Date, there were 16,025,000 shares of common stock outstanding, of which 12,500,000 were Company Public Shares, 3,125,000 were Founder Shares and 400,000 were Company Private Shares. \n\nA quorum of Company stockholders is necessary to hold a valid Special Meeting. A majority of the voting power of the common stock entitled to vote at the Special Meeting must be present, in person or represented by proxy at the Special Meeting to constitute a quorum and in order to conduct business at the Special Meeting. Abstentions and broker non-votes will be counted as present for the purpose of determining a quorum. The Underwriters, the Sponsor and our directors and officers, who collectively currently own 22.0% of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock, will count towards this quorum. As of the Record Date for the Special Meeting, 8,012,501 shares of common stock would be required to be present in person or represented by proxy to achieve a quorum. \n\n39 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\nThe Company has entered into a letter agreement with the Sponsor and our directors and officers pursuant to which, among other things, each such person has agreed to vote all shares of our common stock owned by it, him or her in favor of the Proposals. However, we intend to waive such obligations of the Sponsor, our directors and/or our officers to vote their shares of common stock in favor of the Proposals in respect of any shares purchased by such purchasers in Open Market Purchases. As a result, in addition to the shares of common stock held by the Sponsor and its officers and directors, Lionheart may need only 4,612,501, or 36.9% (assuming all outstanding shares are voted), or approximately 4.85% (assuming only the minimum number of shares representing a quorum are voted), of the Class A Common Stock to be voted in favour of the Business Combination in order to have the Business Combination approved. The Proposals presented at the Special Meeting will require the following votes: \n\n• |  _The Business Combination Proposal_ : The approval of the Business Combination Proposal requires the affirmative vote (in person or by proxy) of the holders of a majority of the shares of Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock entitled to vote and actually cast thereon at the Special Meeting, voting as a single class. Accordingly, a stockholder’s failure to submit a proxy or to vote in person at the Special Meeting, as well as an abstention from voting and a broker non-vote with regard to the Business Combination Proposal, will have no effect on the Business Combination Proposal. Company stockholders must approve the Business Combination Proposal in order for the Business Combination to occur.   \n---|---  \n• |  _The Adjournment Proposal_ : The approval of the Adjournment Proposal, if presented, requires the affirmative vote (in person or by proxy) of the holders of a majority of the shares of Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock entitled to vote and actually cast thereon at the Special Meeting, voting as a single class. Accordingly, a stockholder’s failure to submit a proxy or to vote in person at the Special Meeting, as well as an abstention from voting and a broker non-vote with regard to the Adjournment Proposal, will have no effect on the Adjournment Proposal. The Business Combination is not conditioned on the approval of the Adjournment Proposal.   \n---|---  \n  \n**Nasdaq Listing**\n\nThe Class A Common Stock, the Company Public Warrants and the Company Public Units are currently listed on Nasdaq under the symbols “LION,” “LIONW” and “LIONU,” respectively. Upon the closing of the Business Combination, we intend to apply to list the ordinary shares and warrants of Parent on NASDAQ under the new ticker symbols “SMX” and “SMXW”, respectively, and SMX shall cease to be quoted on the ASX. At the Closing, each Unit will separate into its components, comprising one share of Parent Share and one-half of one Parent Warrant. \n\n**Material Tax Considerations**\n\nFor a detailed discussion of certain U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Business Combination, see the sections titled “ _Certain Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations_ ” in this proxy statement/prospectus. \n\n**Anticipated Accounting Treatment of the Transactions**\n\nSince the Parent and Lionheart are not businesses as defined in IFRS 3, the transaction is not a business combination. Based on IFRS 3’s provisions, such a transaction is accounted for in the consolidated financial statements of the Parent (the legal acquirer) as a continuation of the financial statements of SMX (the legal acquiree), together with a deemed issuance of shares by SMX at fair value and a re-capitalization of its equity. This deemed issuance of shares is in fact both an equity transaction under IAS 32 (receiving the net assets of Lionheart, primarily cash) and an equity-settled share-based payment transaction under IFRS 2 (receiving the listing status of the Parent/Lionheart). The difference between the fair value of the shares deemed to have been issued by SMX and the fair value of Lionheart’s identifiable net assets represents a payment for the service of \n\n40 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\nobtaining a stock exchange listing for its shares and a cost of raising capital. Transaction costs are allocated on a relative fair value basis of the amounts allocated to each equity transaction as mentioned above, such that the amount attributed to the equity transaction is deducted from equity and the amount attributed to the listing service is charged as expense in profit or loss. For purposes of the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information, it is assumed that the fair value of each individual SMX ordinary share issued to Lionheart Stockholder is equal to the fair value of each individual SMX ordinary share resulting from the $200 million proforma combined enterprise value assigned to SMX in the Business Combination Agreement. \n\n**Summary Risk Factors**\n\nIn evaluating the proposals set forth in this proxy statement/prospectus, you should carefully read this proxy statement/prospectus, including the annexes, and especially consider the factors discussed in the section entitled “ _Risk Factors_ ” \n\nSome of the risks related to the Transactions, Lionheart and SMX are summarized below: \n\n**_Risks related to the Company and the Business Combination_**\n\n• |  Lionheart may not have sufficient funds to consummate the business combination.   \n---|---  \n• |  If Lionheart’s stockholders fail to properly demand redemption rights, they will not be entitled to redeem their Lionheart Class A common shares for a pro rata portion of the trust account.   \n---|---  \n• |  The Business Combination remains subject to conditions that Lionheart cannot control and if such conditions are not satisfied or waived, the Business Combination may not be consummated.   \n---|---  \n• |  Lionheart may waive one or more of the conditions to the Business Combination.   \n---|---  \n• |  The exercise of discretion by our directors and officers in agreeing to changes to the terms of or waivers of closing conditions in the BCA and the SID may result in a conflict of interest when determining whether such changes to the terms of the BCA and the SID or waivers of conditions are appropriate and in the best interests of the Lionheart stockholders.   \n---|---  \n• |  Termination of the BCA and the SID could negatively impact SMX and Lionheart.   \n---|---  \n• |  Lionheart and SMX will incur significant transaction and transition costs in connection with the Business Combination.   \n---|---  \n• |  If Lionheart is unable to complete an initial business combination, Lionheart’s Company Public Stockholders may receive only approximately $10.10 per share on the liquidation of the Trust Account (or less than $10.10 per share in certain circumstances where a third party brings a claim against Lionheart that the Sponsor is unable to indemnify), and Lionheart’s warrants will expire worthless.   \n---|---  \n• |  Subsequent to Lionheart’s completion of the Business Combination, Lionheart may be required to take write-downs or write-offs, restructuring and impairment or other charges that could have a significant negative effect on Lionheart’s financial condition, results of operations and our stock price, which could cause you to lose some or all of your investment.   \n---|---  \n• |  Our warrant agreement will designate the courts of the State of New York or the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by holders of our warrants, which could limit the ability of warrant holders to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with our company.   \n---|---  \n• |  Parent’s Shares may not be listed on a national securities exchange after the Business Combination, which could limit investors’ ability to make transactions in such securities, subject Parent to additional trading restrictions, and subject Parent’s security holders to Irish stamp tax upon securities transfers.   \n---|---  \n• |  The stock price of the Parent Shares may be volatile.   \n---|---  \n  \n41 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\n• |  The trading market in the Parent Shares may become substantially less liquid than the average trading market for a stock quoted on Nasdaq following the consummation of the business combination, and this low trading volume may adversely affect the price of the Parent Shares.   \n---|---  \n• |  Parent may issue additional Parent Shares or other equity securities without seeking approval of the Parent shareholders, which would dilute your ownership interests and may depress the market price of the Parent Shares.   \n---|---  \n• |  Future resales of the Parent Shares issued in connection with the transactions may cause the market price of the Parent Shares to drop significantly, even if SMX’s business is doing well.   \n---|---  \n• |  Lionheart stockholders may decide to sell their Lionheart securities or Parent Shares, which could cause a decline in their market prices and the value of the Parent Shares after consummation of the transactions.   \n---|---  \n• |  Because the market price of Parent Shares may fluctuate, Lionheart stockholders cannot be sure of the value of the Parent Shares they will receive in the transactions.   \n---|---  \n• |  There may be less publicly available information concerning Parent than there is for issuers that are not foreign private issuers because it is anticipated that Parent will be considered a foreign private issuer and will be exempt from a number of rules under the Exchange Act and will be permitted to file less information with the SEC than issuers that are not foreign private issuers and Parent, as a foreign private issuer, will be permitted to follow home country practice in lieu of the listing requirements of Nasdaq, subject to certain exceptions.   \n---|---  \n• |  Parent may lose its foreign private issuer status in the future, which could result in significant additional costs and expenses. This would subject Parent to GAAP reporting requirements which may be difficult for it to comply with.   \n---|---  \n• |  As a “foreign private issuer” under the rules and regulations of the SEC, the Parent is permitted to, and will, file less or different information with the SEC than a company incorporated in the United States or otherwise subject to these rules, and will follow certain home country corporate governance practices in lieu of certain Nasdaq requirements applicable to U.S. issuers.   \n---|---  \n• |  If securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about Parent’s business, the market price of the Parent Shares and trading volume could decline.   \n---|---  \n• |  Upon completion of the business combination, Lionheart stockholders will become Parent shareholders, Lionheart warrant holders will become holders of Parent Warrants, and the market price for the Parent Shares may be affected by factors different from those that historically have affected Lionheart.   \n---|---  \n• |  The business combination may be completed even though material adverse effects may result from the announcement of the business combination, industry-wide changes and other causes.   \n---|---  \n• |  Delays in completing the business combination may substantially reduce the expected benefits of the business combination.   \n---|---  \n• |  The proposed business combination with SMX may be delayed or ultimately prohibited since such initial business combination may be subject to regulatory review and approval requirements, including pursuant to foreign investment regulations and review by governmental entities such as the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (“**CFIUS** ”). However, we believe it is unlikely that the Business Combination would be subject to CFIUS jurisdiction or impacted by a CFIUS review.   \n---|---  \n• |  Parent has no operating history. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information may not be an indication of Parent’s financial condition or results of operations following the business combination, and accordingly, you have limited financial information on which to evaluate Parent and your investment decision.   \n---|---  \n  \n42 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\n• |  Failure to effectively retain, attract and motivate key employees could diminish the anticipated benefits of the business combination.   \n---|---  \n• |  The fairness opinion delivered by Scura Partners will not reflect changes in circumstances between the date of the BCA and the SID and the completion of the business combination.   \n---|---  \n• |  Lionheart and SMX will be subject to business uncertainties and contractual restrictions while the Business Combination is pending.   \n---|---  \n• |  Parent is an “emerging growth company” and it cannot be certain if the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies will make the Parent Shares less attractive to investors.   \n---|---  \n• |  Parent may need additional capital in the future to meet its financial obligations and to pursue its business objectives. Additional capital may not be available on favorable terms, or at all, which could compromise Parent’s ability to meet its financial obligations and grow its business.   \n---|---  \n• |  Parent will incur significant costs and devote substantial management time as a result of being subject to reporting requirements in the United States, which may adversely affect the operating results of Parent in the future.   \n---|---  \n• |  Because Parent currently does not have plans to pay cash dividends on the Parent Shares, you may not receive any return on investment unless you sell your Parent Shares for a price greater than that which you paid for Lionheart Class A Common Stock.   \n---|---  \n• |  An active trading market of the Parent Shares may not be sustained and investors may not be able to resell their Parent Shares at or above the price for which they purchased the Lionheart securities.   \n---|---  \n• |  The trading price of the Parent Shares may be volatile, and holders of the Parent Shares could incur substantial losses.   \n---|---  \n• |  Lionheart and Parent may be targets of securities class action and derivative lawsuits which could result in substantial costs and may delay or prevent the transaction from being completed.   \n---|---  \n• |  Parent’s management has limited experience in operating a public company in the United States.   \n---|---  \n• |  There can be no assurance that we will be able to comply with the continued listing standards of Nasdaq.   \n---|---  \n• |  Lionheart has no operating history and is subject to a mandatory liquidation and subsequent dissolution requirement. As such, there is a risk that Lionheart will be unable to continue as a going concern if it does not consummate an initial business combination by February 8, 2023 (or until May 8, 2023 if it extends the period of time to consummate its initial business combination pursuant to any further Extension Period). If Lionheart is unable to effect an initial business combination by February 8, 2023 (or until May 8, 2023 if it extends the period of time to consummate its initial business combination pursuant to any further Extension Period), it will be forced to liquidate and its warrants will expire worthless.   \n---|---  \n• |  Unanticipated changes in effective tax rates or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our income or other tax returns could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.   \n---|---  \n• |  Future changes in U.S. and foreign tax laws could adversely affect Parent.   \n---|---  \n• |  Past performance by members of our management team, may not be indicative of future performance of an investment in the Company or the Post-Combination Company.   \n---|---  \n• |  We may be unable to obtain additional financing to fund the operations and growth of the Post-Combination Company.   \n---|---  \n• |  Changes in laws, regulations or rules, or a failure to comply with any laws, regulations or rules, may adversely affect our business, investments and results of operations.   \n---|---  \n  \n43 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\n• |  The Company’s and SMX’s ability to consummate the Business Combination, and the operations of the Post-Combination Company following the Business Combination, may be materially adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.   \n---|---  \n• |  Because Parent will become a public reporting company by means other than a traditional underwritten initial public offering, Parent’s shareholders may face additional risks and uncertainties.   \n---|---  \n• |  We have not registered the shares of Class A Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the Public Warrants under the Securities Act or any state securities laws at this time, and such registration may not be in place when an investor desires to exercise Company Public Warrants, thus precluding such investor from being able to exercise its Company Public Warrants except on a cashless basis and potentially causing such Parent Warrants to expire worthless.   \n---|---  \n• |  We may amend the terms of the Company Public Warrants in a manner that may be adverse to holders with the approval by the holders of at least 50% of the then-outstanding Company Public Warrants. As a result, the exercise price of a holder’s Company Public Warrants could be increased, the exercise period could be shortened and the number of shares of the Company’s Common Stock purchasable upon exercise of a Company Public Warrant could be decreased, all without the approval of that warrant holder.   \n---|---  \n• |  We may redeem unexpired Company Public Warrants prior to their exercise at a time that is disadvantageous to warrant holders, thereby making such warrants worthless.   \n---|---  \n• |  Because each Public Unit contains one-half of one Public Warrant and only a whole Public Warrant may be exercised, the Public Units may be worth less than Public Units of other blank check companies.   \n---|---  \n• |  Warrants will become exercisable for our Class A Common Stock, which would increase the number of shares eligible for future resale in the public market and result in dilution to our stockholders.   \n---|---  \n• |  Our stockholders may be held liable for claims by third parties against us to the extent of distributions received by them upon redemption of their shares.   \n---|---  \n• |  Our internal control over financial reporting may not be effective and our independent registered public accounting firm may not be able to certify as to their effectiveness, which could have a significant and adverse effect on our business and reputation.   \n---|---  \n• |  The Company’s stockholders may be held liable for claims by third parties against the Company to the extent of distributions received by them.   \n---|---  \n  \n**_Risks related to Tax_**\n\n• |  The enactment of legislation implementing changes in taxation of international business activities, the adoption of other corporate tax reform policies, or changes in tax legislation or policies could impact Parent’s future financial position and results of operations.   \n---|---  \n• |  U.S. holders that directly or indirectly own 10% or more of our equity interests may be subject to adverse U.S. federal income tax consequences under rules applicable to U.S. shareholders of “controlled foreign corporations.”   \n---|---  \n• |  Parent’s U.S. shareholders may suffer adverse tax consequences if Parent is classified as a “passive foreign investment company.”   \n---|---  \n• |  The Internal Revenue Service may not agree that Parent should be treated as a non-U.S. corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes.   \n---|---  \n• |  Section 7874 of the Code may limit the ability of Lionheart to use certain tax attributes following the Business Combination, increase Parent’s U.S. affiliates’ U.S. taxable income or have other adverse consequences to Parent and Parent’s shareholders.   \n---|---  \n  \n44 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\n• |  The Business Combination may be treated as a taxable exchange to holders of Company Public Shares or Company Public Warrants.   \n---|---  \n• |  The Excise Tax included in the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 may impose a significant tax liability on the Company after the Business Combination.   \n---|---  \n  \n**_Risks related to Irish Law_**\n\n• |  The Post-Combination Company does not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future, but if the Post-Combination Company pays dividends, such dividends may be subject to Irish dividend withholding tax or Irish income tax, and certain transfers of Parent Shares and Parent Warrants may be subject to Irish capital acquisitions tax or stamp duty.   \n---|---  \n• |  Irish law differs from the laws in effect in Australia and the United States, and there will be differences between your current rights as a holder of the Company securities and the rights one can expect as a holder of the Post-Combination Company securities, some of which may adversely affect you.   \n---|---  \n• |  Provisions in the Parent Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association and under Irish law could make an acquisition of the Post-Combination Company more difficult, may limit attempts by the Post-Combination Company shareholders to replace or remove the Post-Combination Company’s management, may limit shareholders’ ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with the Post-Combination Company or the Post-Combination Company’s directors, officers, or employees, and may limit the market price of the Parent Shares and/or the Parent Warrants.   \n---|---  \n  \n**_Risks related to the business and operations of Parent following the Transaction_**\n\n• |  The Post-Combination Company will incur significant increased expenses and administrative burdens as a public company, which could materially and adversely affect its business, results of operations, financial condition, and growth prospects.   \n---|---  \n• |  If the Post-Combination Company fails to maintain an effective system of disclosure controls and internal controls over financial reporting, its ability to produce timely and accurate financial statements or comply with applicable regulations could be impaired.   \n---|---  \n• |  The Parent’s management has limited experience as executive officers of a U.S. public company.   \n---|---  \n• |  A market for the Post-Combination Company’s securities may not continue, which would adversely affect the liquidity and price of its securities.   \n---|---  \n  \n**_Other Risks Associated with the Business of Parent_**\n\n• |  Lionheart stockholders may not realize a benefit from the Business Combination and any potential Pipe Financing commensurate with the ownership dilution they will experience in connection with the merger and the any potential PIPE Financing.   \n---|---  \n  \n45 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\n**SELECTED HISTORICAL FINANCIAL DATA OF LIONHEART**\n\nThe following table

The Transactions will be accounted for as an assets acquisition in accordance with IFRS. Lionheart is not considered a business as defined by IFRS 3 (Business Combinations) given it consists predominately of cash in the Trust Account. Therefore, the Transactions will be accounted for under IFRS 2 (Share-based Payment). Under this method of accounting, there is no acquisition accounting and no recognition of goodwill. Lionheart will be treated as the “acquired” company for financial reporting purposes, and SMX will be the accounting “acquirer.” The selected unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet as of June 30, 2022 gives pro forma effect to the Business Combination and related transactions as if they had occurred on June 30, 2022. The selected unaudited pro forma condensed combined statement of operations for the six months ended June 30, 2022 and for the year ended December 31, 2021 give pro forma effect to the Business Combination and related transactions as if they had been consummated on January 1, 2021. For further details, see the section titled “ _Anticipated Accounting Treatment_ ” beginning on page 131 of this proxy statement/prospectus. The following unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information has been prepared in accordance with Article 11 of Regulation S-X as amended by the final rule, Release No. 33-10786 “Amendments to Financial Disclosures about Acquired and Disposed Businesses.” Defined terms included below have the same meaning as terms defined and included elsewhere in this proxy statement/prospectus. \n\nThe selected pro forma information has been derived from, and should be read in conjunction with, the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information of the combined company appearing elsewhere in this proxy statement/ prospectus and the accompanying notes. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information is based upon, and should be read in conjunction with, the historical financial statements of Lionheart and related notes and the historical financial statements of SMX and related notes included in this proxy statement/prospectus. The selected pro forma information has been presented for informational purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of what the combined company’s financial position or results of operations actually would have been had the Business Combination and related transactions been completed as of the dates indicated.

The occurrence of one or more of the events or circumstances described in these risk factors, alone or in combination with other events or circumstances, may have a material adverse effect on Parent’s business, reputation, revenue, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects, in which event the market price of Parent Shares could decline, and you could lose part or all of your investment. Unless otherwise indicated, reference in this section and elsewhere in this proxy statement/ prospectus to the SMX’s business being adversely affected, negatively impacted or harmed will include an adverse effect on, or a negative impact or harm to, the business, reputation, financial condition, results of operations, revenue and future prospects of Parent._\n\n**Risks Related to the Company and the Business Combination**\n\n_In this section, unless otherwise noted or the context otherwise requires, “we”, “us”, and “our” refer to the Company or Lionheart._\n\n**_Lionheart may not have sufficient funds to consummate the business combination._**\n\nAs of September 30, 2022, Lionheart had $490,218 available to it outside the trust account to fund its working capital requirements and a working capital deficit of $2,238,655. If Lionheart is required to seek additional capital, it would need to borrow funds from its sponsors, initial stockholders, management team or other third parties to operate or may be forced to liquidate. None of Lionheart’s sponsors, initial stockholders, members of its management team, nor any of their affiliates is under any obligation to advance funds to Lionheart in such circumstances. Any such advances would be repaid only from funds held outside the trust account or from funds released to Lionheart upon completion of the business combination. If Lionheart is unable to consummate the business combination because it does not have sufficient funds available, Lionheart will be forced to cease operations and liquidate the trust account. Consequently, Lionheart’s public stockholders may only receive $10.10 per share and their warrants and rights will expire worthless. \n\n**_If Lionheart’s stockholders fail to properly demand redemption rights, they will not be entitled to redeem their Lionheart Class A common shares for a pro rata portion of the trust account._**\n\nLionheart stockholders holding Lionheart Class A common shares may demand that Lionheart redeem their Class A common shares for a pro rata portion of the trust account, calculated as of two business days prior to the anticipated consummation of the business combination. To demand redemption rights, Lionheart stockholders must deliver their Class A common shares (either physically or electronically) to Lionheart’s transfer agent no later than two (2) business days prior to the meeting. Any shareholder who fails to properly demand redemption rights by delivering his, her, or its Class A common shares will not be entitled to redeem his, her, or its Class A common shares for a pro rata portion of the trust account for redemption of his, her or its Class A common shares. See the section of this proxy statement/prospectus titled “ _The Special Meeting of Lionheart Stockholders_ _—_ _Redemption Rights_ ” for the procedures to be followed if you wish to redeem your Lionheart Class A common shares to cash. \n\n**_The business combination remains subject to conditions that Lionheart cannot control and if such conditions are not satisfied or waived, the business combination may not be consummated._**\n\nThe business combination is subject to a number of conditions, including that there is no legal prohibition against the consummation of the business combination, that Lionheart’s securities remain listed on Nasdaq through the closing, approval for registration on Nasdaq of the Parent Shares, approval by the Lionheart \n\n52 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\nstockholders of the business combination proposal and other proposals, continued effectiveness of the registration statement on Form F-4, of which this proxy statement/prospectus is a part, the truth and accuracy of Lionheart’s and SMX’s representations and warranties made in the BCA and the SID, the non-termination of the BCA and the SID, Parent entering into the composition agreement with the Irish Revenue Commissioners and a Special Eligibility Agreement for Securities for DTC, and Lionheart having at least $5,000,001 of net tangible assets immediately prior to, or upon the consummation of, the Transactions after taking into account holders of Class A common shares that have properly demanded redemption of their Class A common shares into cash. There are no assurances that all conditions to the business combination will be satisfied or that the conditions will be satisfied in the time frame expected. If the conditions to the business combination are not met (and are not waived, to the extent waivable), then either Lionheart or SMX may, subject to the terms and conditions of the BCA and the SID, terminate the BCA and the SID or amend the Termination Date. See the section of this proxy statement/prospectus titled “ _The Business Combination Agreement and Scheme Implementation Deed — Amendment; Waiver and Extension of the Business Combination Agreement_ ”, “ _—_ _Amendment; Waiver and Extension of the_ _Scheme Implementation Deed_ ”, “ _— Termination of the Business Combination Agreement_ ” and “ _— Termination of the SID_ ”. \n\n**_We may waive one or more of the conditions to the Business Combination._**\n\nWe may agree to waive, in whole or in part, one or more of the conditions to our obligations to complete the Business Combination, to the extent permitted by our Existing Charter and bylaws and applicable laws. However, if the Lionheart Board determines that a failure to satisfy the condition is not material, then the Lionheart Board may elect to waive that condition and close the Business Combination. We may not waive the condition that our stockholders approve the Business Combination. Please see the section entitled “ _The Business Combination Agreement and Scheme Implementation Deed — Conditions to Closing of the Business Combination_ ” for additional information. \n\n**_The exercise of discretion by our directors and officers in agreeing to changes to the terms of or waivers of closing conditions in the BCA and the SID may result in a conflict of interest when determining whether such changes to the terms of the BCA and the SID or waivers of conditions are appropriate and in the best interests of our stockholders._**\n\nIn the period leading up to the closing of the Business Combination, other events may occur that, pursuant to the BCA and the SID, would require the Company to agree to amend the BCA and the SID, to consent to certain actions or to waive rights that we are entitled to under those agreements. Such events could arise because of changes in the course of SMX’s business, a request by SMX to undertake actions that would otherwise be prohibited by the terms of the BCA and the SID or the occurrence of other events that would have a material adverse effect on SMX’s business and would entitle the Company to terminate the BCA and the SID. In any of such circumstances, it would be in the discretion of the Company, acting through the Lionheart Board, to grant its consent or waive its rights. The existence of the financial and personal interests of the directors described elsewhere in this proxy statement/prospectus may result in a conflict of interest on the part of one or more of the directors between what he may believe is best for the Company and our stockholders and what he may believe is best for himself or his affiliates in determining whether or not to take the requested action. As of the date of this proxy statement/prospectus, we do not believe there will be any changes or waivers that our directors and officers would be likely to make after stockholder approval of the Business Combination has been obtained. While certain changes could be made without further stockholder approval, if there is a change to the terms of the Business Combination that would have a material impact on the stockholders, we will be required to circulate a new or amended proxy statement or supplement thereto and resolicit the vote of our stockholders with respect to the Business Combination Proposal. \n\n**_Termination of the BCA and the SID could negatively impact SMX and the Company._**\n\nIf the Business Combination is not completed for any reason, including as a result of the Company’s stockholders declining to approve the Proposals required to effect the Business Combination, the ongoing \n\n53 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\nbusinesses of SMX and the Company may be adversely impacted and, without realizing any of the anticipated benefits of completing the Business Combination, SMX and the Company would be subject to a number of risks, including the following: \n\n• |  the Company may experience negative reactions from the financial markets, including negative impacts on its stock price (including to the extent that the current market price reflects a market assumption that the Business Combination will be completed);   \n---|---  \n• |  SMX may experience negative reactions from its customers and employees;   \n---|---  \n• |  SMX and the Company will have incurred substantial expenses and will be required to pay certain costs relating to the Business Combination, whether or not the Business Combination is completed; and   \n---|---  \n• |  since the BCA and the SID restricts the conduct of SMX’s and the Company’s businesses prior to completion of the Business Combination, each of SMX and the Company may not have been able to take certain actions during the pendency of the Business Combination that would have benefitted it as an independent company, and the opportunity to take such actions may no longer be available (see the section entitled “ _The Business Combination Agreement and Scheme Implementation Deed — Conduct of the Business Pending Consummation of the Business Combination; Covenants_ ” beginning on page 137 of this proxy statement/prospectus for a description of the restrictive covenants applicable to SMX and the Company).   \n---|---  \n  \nIf the BCA and the SID is terminated and the Lionheart Board seeks another business combination, Company stockholders cannot be certain that the Company will be able to find another acquisition target that would constitute a business combination or that such other business combination will be completed. See “ _The Business Combination Agreement and Scheme Implementation Deed — Termination_ _of the Business Combination”, “— Termination of the SID_ ” on page 145. \n\n**_We and SMX will incur significant transaction and transition costs in connection with the Business Combination._**\n\nWe and SMX have both incurred and expect to incur significant, non-recurring costs in connection with consummating the Business Combination as well as ongoing costs related to operating as a public company following the consummation of the Business Combination. We and SMX may also incur additional costs to retain key team members. All expenses incurred in connection with the BCA and the SID and the Business Combination, including all legal, accounting, consulting, investment banking and other fees, expenses and costs, will be for the account of the party incurring such fees, expenses and costs or paid by the Company following the closing of the Business Combination. \n\nThe Company’s transaction expenses as a result of the Business Combination are currently estimated at approximately $11,000,000, including $4,375,000 in deferred underwriting commissions to the underwriters of our IPO. The amount of the deferred underwriting commissions will not be adjusted for any shares that are redeemed in connection with an initial business combination. The per-share amount we will distribute to stockholders who properly exercise their redemption rights will not be reduced by the deferred underwriting commissions and after such redemptions, the per-share value of shares held by non-redeeming stockholders will reflect our obligation to pay the deferred underwriting commissions. \n\n**_If we are unable to complete an initial business combination, our Company Public Stockholders may receive only approximately $10.10 per share on the liquidation of the Trust Account (or less than $10.10 per share in certain circumstances where a third party brings a claim against us that the Sponsor is unable to indemnify), and our warrants will expire worthless._**\n\nIf we are unable to complete an initial business combination by February 8, 2023 (or until May 8, 2023 if we extend the period of time to consummate our initial business combination pursuant to any further Extension Period), our Company Public Stockholders may receive only approximately $10.10 per share on the liquidation of the \n\n54 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\nTrust Account (or less than $10.10 per share in certain circumstances where a third party brings a claim against us that the Sponsor is unable to indemnify (as described herein)) and our warrants will expire worthless, unless we amend our Existing Charter (which requires the affirmative vote of the holders of 65% of all then outstanding shares of common stock) and amend certain other agreements into which we have entered to extend the life of the Company. \n\n**_Subsequent to our completion of the Business Combination, we may be required to take write-downs or write-offs, restructuring and impairment or other charges that could have a significant negative effect on our financial condition, results of operations and our stock price, which could cause you to lose some or all of your investment._**\n\nAlthough we have conducted due diligence on SMX, we cannot assure you that this diligence will surface all material issues that may be present in SMX’s business, that it would be possible to uncover all material issues through a customary amount of due diligence, or that factors outside of SMX’s business and outside of our and SMX’s control will not later arise. As a result of these factors, we may be forced to later write down or write off assets, restructure operations, or incur impairment or other charges that could result in losses. Even if our due diligence successfully identifies certain risks, unexpected risks may arise and previously known risks may materialize in a manner not consistent with our preliminary risk analysis. Even though these charges may be non-cash items and not have an immediate impact on our liquidity, the fact that we report charges of this nature could contribute to negative market perceptions about the Post-Combination Company or its securities. Accordingly, any of our stockholders who choose to remain stockholders following the Business Combination could suffer a reduction in the value of their shares. Such stockholders are unlikely to have a remedy for such reduction in value. \n\n**_Our warrant agreement will designate the courts of the State of New York or the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by holders of our warrants, which could limit the ability of warrant holders to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with our company._**\n\nOur warrant agreement will provide that, subject to applicable law, (i) any action, proceeding or claim against us arising out of or relating in any way to the warrant agreement, including under the Securities Act, will be brought and enforced in the courts of the State of New York or the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, and (ii) that we irrevocably submit to such jurisdiction, which jurisdiction shall be the exclusive forum for any such action, proceeding or claim. We will waive any objection to such exclusive jurisdiction and that such courts represent an inconvenient forum. \n\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, these provisions of the warrant agreement will not apply to suits brought to enforce any liability or duty created by the Exchange Act or any other claim for which the federal district courts of the United States of America are the sole and exclusive forum. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in any of our warrants shall be deemed to have notice of and to have consented to the forum provisions in our warrant agreement. If any action, the subject matter of which is within the scope the forum provisions of the warrant agreement, is filed in a court other than a court of the State of New York or the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (a “NY foreign action”) in the name of any holder of our warrants, such holder shall be deemed to have consented to: (x) the personal jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located in the State of New York in connection with any action brought in any such court to enforce the forum provisions (a “NY enforcement action”), and (y) having service of process made upon such warrant holder in any such NY enforcement action by service upon such warrant holder’s counsel in the NY foreign action as agent for such warrant holder. \n\nThis choice-of-forum provision may limit a warrant holder’s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with our company, which may discourage such lawsuits. Alternatively, if a court were to find this provision of our warrant agreement inapplicable or unenforceable with respect to one or more of \n\n55 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\nthe specified types of actions or proceedings, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and result in a diversion of the time and resources of our management and board of directors. \n\n**_Parent Shares may not be listed on a national securities exchange after the business combination, which could limit investors’ ability to make transactions in such securities, subject Parent to additional trading restrictions, and subject Parent’s security holders to Irish stamp tax upon securities transfers._**\n\nParent will apply to have Parent Shares listed on Nasdaq after the consummation of the business combination. Parent will be required to meet the initial listing requirements to be listed, including having a minimum number of round lot shareholders. Parent may not be able to meet those initial listing requirements. Even if the Parent Shares are so listed, Parent may be unable to maintain the listing of such securities in the future. If Parent fails to meet the initial listing requirements and Nasdaq does not list the Parent Shares (and the related closing condition with respect to the listing of the Parent Shares is waived by the parties), Parent could face significant material adverse consequences, including: \n\n• |  a limited availability of market quotations for the Parent Shares;   \n---|---  \n• |  a reduced level of trading activity in the secondary trading market for the Parent Shares;   \n---|---  \n• |  a limited amount of news and analyst coverage for Parent;   \n---|---  \n• |  a decreased ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future;   \n---|---  \n• |  stamp duty may be chargeable on transfers of Parent Shares at a rate of 1% of the greater of the price paid or market value of the Parent Shares transferred; and   \n---|---  \n• |  Parent’s securities would not be “covered securities” under the National Securities Markets Improvement Act of 1996, which is a federal statute that prevents or pre-empts the states from regulating the sale of certain securities, including securities listed on Nasdaq, in which case Parent’s securities would be subject to regulation in each state where Parent offers and sells securities.   \n---|---  \n  \n**_The stock price of the Parent Shares may be volatile._**\n\nThe market price of the Parent Shares may be volatile. In addition to factors discussed elsewhere in this Risk Factors section, the market price of the Parent Shares may fluctuate significantly in response to numerous factors, many of which are beyond the Parent’s control, including: \n\n• |  overall performance of the equity markets;   \n---|---  \n• |  actual or anticipated fluctuations in the Post-Combination Company’s revenue and other operating results;   \n---|---  \n• |  changes in the financial projections the Post-Combination Company may provide to the public or the failure to meet these projections;   \n---|---  \n• |  failure of securities analysts to initiate or maintain coverage of the Post-Combination Company, changes in financial estimates by any securities analysts who follow the Post-Combination Company or the Post-Combination Company’s failure to meet these estimates of the expectations of investors;   \n---|---  \n• |  the issuance of reports from short sellers that may negatively impact the trading price of the Parent Shares;   \n---|---  \n• |  recruitment or departure of key personnel;   \n---|---  \n• |  the economy as a whole and market conditions in the Post-Combination Company’s industry;   \n---|---  \n• |  new laws, regulations, subsidies, or credits or new interpretations of them applicable to the Post-Combination Company’s business;   \n---|---  \n  \n56 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\n• |  negative publicity related to real or perceived quality of the Post-Combination Company’s products;   \n---|---  \n• |  rumors and market speculation involving the Post-Combination Company or other companies in the Post-Combination Company’s industry;   \n---|---  \n• |  announcements by the Post-Combination Company or its competitors of significant technical innovations, acquisitions, strategic partnerships, or capital commitments;   \n---|---  \n• |  lawsuits threatened or filed against the Post-Combination Company;   \n---|---  \n• |  other events or factors including those resulting from war, incidents of terrorism or responses to these events;   \n---|---  \n• |  the expiration of contractual lock-up or market standoff agreements; and   \n---|---  \n• |  sales or anticipated sales of shares of the Parent Shares by Parent or Parent’s shareholders.   \n---|---  \n  \nIn addition, the stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many companies. Stock prices of many companies have fluctuated in a manner unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. In the past, stockholders have instituted securities class action litigation following periods of market volatility. \n\n**_The trading market in the Parent Shares may become substantially less liquid than the average trading market for a stock quoted on Nasdaq following the consummation of the business combination, and this low trading volume may adversely affect the price of the Parent Shares._**\n\nLionheart’s common stock, units, and warrants currently trade on Nasdaq, and Parent will apply to have the Parent Shares trade on Nasdaq. Because Lionheart’s public stockholders have the option to redeem their Class A common shares to cash in connection with the business combination, the trading volume of the Parent Shares after consummation of the business combination may substantially decrease compared to other companies listed on Nasdaq. Limited trading volume in the Parent Shares will subject the Parent Shares to greater price volatility and may make it difficult for you to sell your Parent Shares at a price that is attractive to you. Limited trading volume in the Parent Shares may also result in Parent’s failure to continue to meet the listing standards for Nasdaq. \n\n**_Parent may issue additional Parent Shares or other equity securities without seeking approval of the Parent shareholders, which would dilute your ownership interests and may depress the market price of the Parent Shares._**\n\nUpon consummation of the business combination, Parent will have warrants outstanding to purchase up to an aggregate of 8,450,000 Parent Shares. Further, in addition to the potential PIPE Financing, SMX and Lionheart may choose to seek third party financing to provide additional working capital for the SMX business, in which event Parent may issue additional equity securities. Following the consummation of the business combination, Parent may also issue additional Parent Shares or other equity securities of equal or senior rank in the future for any reason or in connection with, among other things, future acquisitions, the redemption of outstanding warrants, or repayment of outstanding indebtedness, without shareholder approval, in a number of circumstances. \n\nParent’s issuance of additional Parent Shares or other equity securities of equal or senior rank would have the following effects: \n\n• |  Parent’s existing shareholders’ proportionate ownership interest in Parent will decrease;   \n---|---  \n• |  the amount of cash available per share, including for payment of dividends in the future, may decrease;   \n---|---  \n• |  the relative voting strength of each previously outstanding Parent Share may be diminished; and   \n---|---  \n• |  the market price of the Parent Shares may decline.   \n---|---  \n  \n57 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\n**_Future resales of the Parent Shares issued in connection with the transactions may cause the market price of the Parent Shares to drop significantly, even if SMX’s business is doing well._**\n\nCertain of SMX’s shareholders have agreed not to transfer any Parent Shares received in the connection with the cancellation of SMX shares in return for the issuance of Parent Shares except to certain permitted transferees, until 14 months after the consummation of the transactions, or earlier upon the subsequent completion of a liquidation, merger, stock exchange, or similar transaction. The Lionheart initial stockholders will be subject to the same transfer restrictions with respect to the Parent Shares to be received by them in the business combination, except that such Parent Shares will be restricted from transfer for fourteen (14) months after the consummation of the transaction. See the section of this proxy statement/prospectus titled “ _The Business Combination Agreement and Scheme Implementation Deed — Other Agreements Related to the Business Combination Agreement — Lock-up Agreements_.” \n\nAt the closing of the transactions, Parent will enter into an Amended and Restated Registration Rights Agreement providing the Sponsor, the Lionheart initial stockholders, certain SMX shareholders, and the underwriters with certain demand registration rights and piggy-back registration rights with respect to registration statements filed by Parent after the closing. See the section of this proxy statement/prospectus titled “ _The Business Combination Agreement and Scheme Implementation Deed — Other Agreements Related to the Business Combination Agreement — Registration Rights Agreement_.” \n\nUpon expiration of the applicable lock-up periods and upon the effectiveness of any registration statement Parent files pursuant to the above-referenced Amended and Restated Registration Rights Agreement, or as may be required under the subscription agreements with the PIPE investors, in a registered offering of securities pursuant to the Securities Act, or otherwise in accordance with Rule 144 under the Securities Act, the Sponsor, the Lionheart initial stockholders, the SMX shareholders and, if the PIPE Financing is consummated, PIPE investors, may sell large amounts of Parent Shares in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions, which could have the effect of increasing the volatility in the trading price of the Parent Shares or putting significant downward pressure on the price of the Parent Shares. \n\nDownward pressure on the market price of the Parent Shares that likely will result from sales of Parent Shares issued in connection with exercise of warrants or sales of warrants upon expiration of any applicable lockup periods could encourage short sales of Parent Shares by market participants. Generally, short selling means selling a security, contract or commodity not owned by the seller. The seller is committed to eventually purchase the financial instrument previously sold. Short sales are used to capitalize on an expected decline in the security’s price. Short sales of Parent Shares could have a tendency to depress the price of the Parent Shares, which could increase the potential for short sales. \n\nWe cannot predict the size of future issuances of Parent Shares to subscribe for Parent Shares or the effect, if any, that future issuances and sales of Parent Shares to subscribe for Parent Shares will have on the market price of the Parent Shares. Sales of substantial amounts of Parent Shares (including those issued in connection with the business combination), or the perception that such sales could occur, may adversely affect prevailing market prices of Parent Shares. \n\n**_Lionheart stockholders may decide to sell their Lionheart securities or Parent Shares, which could cause a decline in their market prices and the value of the Parent Shares after consummation of the transactions._**\n\nSome Lionheart stockholders may decide they do not want to own shares of a company that has the majority of its business and opportunities outside the United States or decide they do not want to hold Parent Shares for other reasons. This could result in the sale of Lionheart Class A common shares prior to the completion of the business combination or in the exercise of conversion rights, or the sale of the Parent Shares received in the business combination after the completion of the business combination. These sales, or the prospects of such sales in the future, could adversely affect the market price for Lionheart Class A common shares and Parent Shares, respectively, and the ability to sell the Lionheart securities in the market before the business combination \n\n58 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\nis completed as well as the Parent Shares after the business combination is completed. This could, in turn adversely affect the dollar value of the Parent Shares that the Lionheart stockholders will receive upon completion of the business combination. \n\n**_Because the market price of Parent Shares may fluctuate, Lionheart stockholders cannot be sure of the value of the Parent Shares they will receive in the transactions._**\n\nUpon completion of the business combination, each Lionheart Class A common share will be automatically cancelled in exchange for one Parent Share, subject to the right of Lionheart’s public stockholders to redeem their Lionheart Class A common shares for a pro rata portion of Lionheart’s trust account, and each Lionheart warrant will automatically be adjusted to become a Parent Warrant. The value of the Parent Shares upon completion of the business combination may differ from the value of the Lionheart Class A common shares and Lionheart warrants, respectively, at the signing of the BCA and the SID due to changes in the market value of the Parent Shares which may be caused by, among other things, market volatility. If the value of the Parent Shares decreases relative to the value of Lionheart Class A common shares and/or Lionheart warrants, respectively, between the date of the BCA and the SID and the closing of the transactions, the implied value and premium paid to Lionheart stockholders pursuant to the business combination will be lower than the implied value and premium as of the time the parties executed the BCA and the SID. \n\n**_There may be less publicly available information concerning Parent than there is for issuers that are not foreign private issuers because it is anticipated that Parent will be considered a foreign private issuer and will be exempt from a number of rules under the Exchange Act and will be permitted to file less information with the SEC than issuers that are not foreign private issuers and Parent, as a foreign private issuer, will be permitted to follow home country practice in lieu of the listing requirements of Nasdaq, subject to certain exceptions._**\n\nA foreign private issuer under the Exchange Act is exempt from certain rules under the Exchange Act, and is not required to file periodic reports and financial statements with the SEC as frequently or as promptly as companies whose securities are registered under the Exchange Act but are not foreign private issuers, or to comply with Regulation FD, which restricts the selective disclosure of material non-public information. It is anticipated that Parent will be exempt from certain disclosure and procedural requirements applicable to proxy solicitations under Section 14 of the Exchange Act. The members of Parent’s board of directors, officers and principal shareholders will be exempt from the reporting and “short-swing” profit recovery provisions of Section 16 of the Exchange Act. Accordingly, there may be less publicly available information concerning Parent than there is for companies whose securities are registered under the Exchange Act but are not foreign private issuers, and such information may not be provided as promptly as it is provided by such companies. \n\nIn addition, certain information may be provided by Parent in accordance with Irish law, which may differ in substance or timing from such disclosure requirements under the Exchange Act. As a foreign private issuer, under Nasdaq rules Parent will be subject to less stringent corporate governance requirements. Subject to certain exceptions, the rules of Nasdaq permit a foreign private issuer to follow its home country practice in lieu of the listing requirements of Nasdaq, including, for example, certain internal controls as well as board, committee and director independence requirements. Parent does not currently intend to follow any Irish corporate governance practices in lieu of Nasdaq corporate governance rules, but we cannot assure you that this will not change after consummation of the transactions. If Parent determines to follow Irish corporate governance practices in lieu of Nasdaq corporate governance standards, Parent will disclose each Nasdaq rule that Parent does not intend to follow and describe the Irish practice that Parent will follow in lieu thereof. \n\n59 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\n**_Parent may lose its foreign private issuer status in the future, which could result in significant additional costs and expenses. This would subject Parent to GAAP reporting requirements which may be difficult for it to comply with._**\n\nAs a “foreign private issuer,” Parent would not be required to comply with all of the periodic disclosure and current reporting requirements of the Exchange Act and related rules and regulations. Under those rules, the determination of foreign private issuer status is made annually on the last business day of an issuer’s most recently completed second fiscal quarter. \n\nIn the future, Parent could lose its foreign private issuer status if a majority of its ordinary shares are held by residents in the United States and it fails to meet any one of the additional “business contacts” requirements. Although Parent intends to follow certain practices that are consistent with U.S. regulatory provisions applicable to U.S. companies, Parent’s loss of foreign private issuer status would make such provisions mandatory. The regulatory and compliance costs to Parent under U.S. securities laws if it is deemed a U.S. domestic issuer may be significantly higher. If Parent is not a foreign private issuer, Parent will be required to file periodic reports and prospectuses on U.S. domestic issuer forms with the SEC, which are more detailed and extensive than the forms available to a foreign private issuer. For example, Parent would become subject to the Regulation FD, aimed at preventing issuers from making selective disclosures of material information. Parent also may be required to modify certain of its policies to comply with good governance practices associated with U.S. domestic issuers. Such conversion and modifications will involve additional costs. In addition, Parent may lose its ability to rely upon exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements of Nasdaq that are available to foreign private issuers. For example, Nasdaq’s corporate governance rules require listed companies to have, among other things, a majority of independent board members and independent director oversight of executive compensation, nomination of directors, and corporate governance matters. As a foreign private issuer, Parent would be permitted to follow home country practice in lieu of the above requirements. As long as Parent relies on the foreign private issuer exemption to certain of Nasdaq’s corporate governance standards, a majority of the directors on its board of directors are not required to be independent directors, its compensation committee is not required to be comprised entirely of independent directors, and it will not be required to have a nominating committee. Also, Parent would be required to change its basis of accounting from IFRS as issued by the IASB to GAAP, which may be difficult and costly for it to comply with. If Parent loses its foreign private issuer status and fails to comply with U.S. securities laws applicable to U.S. domestic issuers, Parent may have to de-list from Nasdaq and could be subject to investigation by the SEC, Nasdaq and other regulators, among other materially adverse consequences. \n\n**_As a “foreign private issuer” under the rules and regulations of the SEC, the Parent is permitted to, and will, file less or different information with the SEC than a company incorporated in the United States or otherwise subject to these rules, and will follow certain home country corporate governance practices in lieu of certain Nasdaq requirements applicable to U.S. issuers._**\n\nThe Parent is, and will be after the consummation of the business combination, considered a “foreign private issuer” under the Exchange Act and is therefore exempt from certain rules under the Exchange Act, including the proxy rules, which impose certain disclosure and procedural requirements for proxy solicitations for U.S. and other issuers. Moreover, the Parent is not required to file periodic reports and financial statements with the SEC as frequently or within the same time frames as U.S. companies with securities registered under the Exchange Act. SMX currently prepares its financial statements in accordance with IFRS. The Post-Combination Company will not be required to file financial statements prepared in accordance with or reconciled to U.S. GAAP so long as its financial statements are prepared in accordance with IFRS as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board. The Parent is not required to comply with Regulation FD, which imposes restrictions on the selective disclosure of material information to shareholders. In addition, the Parent’s officers, directors and principal shareholders are exempt from the reporting and short-swing profit recovery provisions of Section 16 of the Exchange Act and the rules under the Exchange Act with respect to their purchases and sales of Parent securities. Accordingly, after the merger, if you continue to hold Parent Shares, you may receive less or different information about the Parent and the Post-Combination Company than you currently receive about Lionheart. \n\n60 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\nFor information on the consequences if the Business Combination is not completed or must be restructured, please see the section of this proxy statement/prospectus entitled “ _Risk Factors_ _—_ _Risks Related to the Company and the Business Combination_.” \n\n**_If securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about Parent’s business, the market price of the Parent Shares and trading volume could decline._**\n\nThe market price for the Parent Shares depends in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about Parent or Parent’s business. If any of the industry analysts who may cover Parent change their recommendation regarding Parent’s securities adversely, or provide more favorable recommendations about Parent’s competitors, the trading price for the Parent Shares would be negatively affected. In addition, if one or more of the analysts who may cover Parent downgrade the Parent Shares or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about Parent’s business, the Parent Share price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts who may cover Parent was to cease coverage of Parent or fail to publish reports on Parent regularly, demand for the Parent Shares could decrease, which might cause the Parent Share price and trading volume to decline. \n\n**_Upon completion of the business combination, Lionheart stockholders will become Parent shareholders, Lionheart warrant holders will become holders of Parent Warrants, and the market price for the Parent Shares may be affected by factors different from those that historically have affected Lionheart._**\n\nUpon completion of the business combination, Lionheart stockholders will become Parent shareholders and Lionheart warrant holders will become holders of Parent Warrants. Parent’s business differs for that of Lionheart, and, accordingly, the results of operations of Parent will be affected by some factors that are different from those currently affecting the results of operations of Lionheart. Lionheart is a Delaware corporation that is not engaged in any operating activity, directly or indirectly. Parent is a holding company and its subsidiary SMX is engaged in the business of research and development to mark objects for supply chain tracking and quality assurance. Parent’s business and results of operations will be affected by regional, country, and industry risks and operating risks to which Lionheart was not exposed. For a discussion of the business of Parent, including the business currently conducted and proposed to be conducted by SMX, see the section of this proxy statement/prospectus titled “ _Business of Security Matters_ ”. \n\n**_The business combination may be completed even though material adverse effects may result from the announcement of the business combination, industry-wide changes and other causes._**\n\nIn general, either Lionheart or SMX can refuse to complete the business combination if there is a material adverse effect affecting the other party between the signing date of the BCA and the SID and the planned closing. However, certain types of changes do not permit either party to refuse to complete the business combination, even if such change could be said to have a material adverse effect on SMX or Lionheart, including the following events (except, in some cases, where the change has a disproportionate effect on a party): \n\n• |  changes in general economic, industry, regulatory or political conditions, the securities or other capital markets in general or law;   \n---|---  \n• |  any epidemic, pandemic (including COVID-19 or COVID-19 measures), hurricane, earthquake, flood, weather conditions, calamity or other natural disaster, act of God or other force majeure event (or any worsening of or recovery from any of the foregoing);   \n---|---  \n• |  geopolitical conditions, hostilities, civil or political unrest, any acts of war, sabotage, or terrorism (including any outbreak, escalation or worsening of any of the foregoing);   \n---|---  \n• |  any change in taxation rates, interest rates or exchange rates;   \n---|---  \n• |  any change in generally accepted accounting principles or the authoritative interpretation of them;   \n---|---  \n• |  the taking of any action required under the BCA or SID;   \n---|---  \n  \n61 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\n• |  any change in the market price or trading volume of certain of such party’s securities;   \n---|---  \n• |  any failure to meet any internal or published projections, forecasts, estimates or predictions of revenues, earnings or other financial or operating metrics for any period;   \n---|---  \n• |  the execution, delivery or performance of the BCA or SID, the announcement of the Scheme or the Option Scheme or the other transactions contemplated by the BCA or SID;   \n---|---  \n• |  the identity of, or any facts or circumstances relating to, the other party or their subsidiaries;   \n---|---  \n• |  any actions, suits or claims arising from allegations of a breach of fiduciary duty or violation of securities laws, in each case relating to the BCA, SID, Scheme, Option Scheme or the transactions contemplated by the BCA or SID; or   \n---|---  \n• |  any action (or the failure to take any action) with the written consent or at the written request of the other party   \n---|---  \n  \nFurthermore, Lionheart or SMX may waive the occurrence of a material adverse effect affecting the other party. If a material adverse effect occurs and the parties still complete the business combination, Lionheart’s stock price may suffer. \n\n**_Delays in completing the business combination may substantially reduce the expected benefits of the business combination._**\n\nSatisfying the conditions to, and completion of, the business combination may take longer than, and could cost more than, Lionheart expects. Any delay in completing or any additional conditions imposed in order to complete the business combination may materially adversely affect the benefits that Lionheart expects to achieve from the acquisition of SMX’s business. \n\nThe Business Combination may be subject to regulatory review and approval requirements by governmental entities, or ultimately prohibited. For example, the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. (“CFIUS”) has authority to review certain “covered transactions,” which includes direct or indirect foreign acquisitions of and investments in U.S. businesses. Among other things, CFIUS is empowered to require parties to make mandatory filings and to self-initiate national security reviews of a covered transaction if the parties to that covered transaction choose not to file voluntarily. If CFIUS determines that a covered transaction threatens to impair U.S. national security, CFIUS has the power to impose mitigation measures or to recommend that the President prohibit the transaction or order divestment if the transaction has been completed. The risk of CFIUS review of a covered transaction depends on a number of factors including the nature and structure of the transaction, the nationality of the parties, the operations of the U.S. business (including whether the business is a “TID U.S. business” as defined in 31 C.F.R. § 800.248), and the level of beneficial ownership interest and the nature of any information or governance rights involved. \n\nIn our view, it is unlikely that the Business Combination would be subject to CFIUS jurisdiction or impacted by a CFIUS review. We note that the Sponsors are not controlled by foreign persons and will not obtain control (as that term is defined in 31 C.F.R. § 800.208) over SMX pursuant to the Business Combination. Moreover, the parties have determined that SMX is not a TID U.S. business and, accordingly, the Business Combination not potentially subject to a mandatory CFIUS notice requirement. We do not anticipate any CFIUS delay. Nevertheless, if CFIUS were to conduct an inquiry, it could determine that the Business Combination is a covered transaction and may decide to conduct a review, in which case CFIUS could recommend that the President prohibit the Business Combination, or impose conditions with respect to it, which may delay or prevent us from consummating the transaction. \n\nThe process of government review, whether by CFIUS or otherwise, could be lengthy. Because we have only a limited time to complete our initial business combination, our failure to obtain any required approvals \n\n62 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\nwithin the requisite time period may require us to liquidate. If we are unable to consummate the Business Combination within the applicable time period required, including as a result of extended regulatory review, we will, as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than five business days thereafter, redeem the public shares for a pro rata portion of the funds held in the trust account and as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining shareholders and our board of directors, liquidate and dissolve, subject in each case to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. In such event, our shareholders will miss the opportunity to benefit from the Business Combination and the potential appreciation in value of such investment. Additionally, our warrants will become worthless. \n\n**_Parent has no operating history. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information may not be an indication of Parent’s financial condition or results of operations following the business combination, and accordingly, you have limited financial information on which to evaluate Parent and your investment decision._**\n\nParent has no operating history and SMX and Lionheart have no prior history as a combined entity and their operations have not been previously managed on a combined basis. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information contained in this proxy statement/prospectus has been prepared using the consolidated historical financial statements of Lionheart and SMX, and is presented for illustrative purposes only and should not be considered to be an indication of the results of operations including, without limitation, future revenue, or financial condition of Parent following the business combination. Certain adjustments and assumptions have been made regarding Parent after giving effect to the business combination. SMX and Lionheart believe these assumptions are reasonable, however, the information upon which these adjustments and assumptions have been made is preliminary, and these kinds of adjustments are difficult to make with accuracy. These assumptions may not prove to be accurate, and other factors may affect Parent’s results of operations or financial condition following the business combination. For these and other reasons, the historical and pro forma condensed combined financial information included in this proxy statement/prospectus does not necessarily reflect Parent’s results of operations and financial condition and the actual financial condition and results of operations of Parent following the business combination may not be consistent with, or evident from, this pro forma financial information. \n\n**_Failure to effectively retain, attract and motivate key employees could diminish the anticipated benefits of the business combination._**\n\nThe success of the acquisition of SMX will depend in part on the attraction, retention and motivation of executive personnel critical to the business and operations of Parent. Executives may experience uncertainty about their future roles with Parent and SMX during the pendency of the business combination or after its completion. In addition, competitors may recruit SMX management. If Parent is unable to attract, retain and motivate executive personnel that are critical to the successful operations of the combined business, SMX could face disruptions in its operations, strategic relationships, key information, expertise or know-how and unanticipated recruitment and onboarding costs. In addition, the loss of key personnel could diminish the anticipated benefits of the acquisition of SMX by Lionheart. \n\n**_The fairness opinion delivered by Scura Partners will not reflect changes in circumstances between the date of the BCA and the SID and the completion of the business combination._**\n\nThe opinion delivered by Scura Partners, Lionheart’s financial advisor, addresses the fairness of the (i) the consideration in the Transactions from a financial point of view to the Company and (ii) the fair market value of SMX equals or exceeds 80% of the amount held by the Company in trust for benefit of its public stockholders (excluding any deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on interest earned on the trust account) only as of the date that the merger agreement was executed. Additionally, the opinion of Scura Partners was limited to the fairness, from a financial point of view to the Company, of the aggregate consideration to be paid pursuant to the SID and the BCA. Scura Partners did not express an opinion as to the fairness of the Transaction \n\n63 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\nor any aspect or implication thereof to, or any other consideration of or relating to, the holders of any class of \n\nsecurities, creditors, or other constituencies of Empatan, the Company or SMX. The Lionheart board has not obtained an updated fairness opinion as of the date of this proxy statement/prospectus and Lionheart does not anticipate asking its financial advisor to update its opinion prior to the closing. Changes in the operations and prospects of SMX or Lionheart, general market and economic conditions and other factors that may be beyond their control, and on which the fairness opinion was based, may alter the value of SMX or Lionheart or the prices of shares of SMX shares or Lionheart common stock by the time the merger is completed. The opinion did not speak as of the time the transaction will be completed or as of any date other than the date of such opinion and the Lionheart Board does not anticipate asking Scura Partners to update its opinion. The Lionheart Board recommendation that Lionheart stockholders vote “FOR” approval of the Business Combination Proposal, however, is made as of the date of this proxy statement/prospectus. \n\nThe opinion delivered by Scura Partners is included as _Annex H_ to this proxy statement/prospectus. For a description of the opinion and a summary of the material financial analysis performed in connection with rendering such opinion, please refer to “ _The Business Combination — Fairness Opinion of Scura Partners_ ” beginning on page 117 of this proxy statement/prospectus. \n\n**_Lionheart and SMX will be subject to business uncertainties and contractual restrictions while the Business Combination is pending._**\n\nUncertainty about the effect of the Business Combination on SMX’s team members and third parties may have an adverse effect on the Company and SMX. These uncertainties may impair Lionheart or Security Matter’s ability to retain and motivate key personnel and could cause third parties that deal with Lionheart or SMX to defer entering into contracts or making other decisions or seek to change existing business relationships. If key team members depart because of uncertainty about their future roles and the potential complexities of the Business Combination, Lionheart or SMX’s business could be harmed. \n\n**_Parent is an “emerging growth company” and it cannot be certain if the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies will make the Parent Shares less attractive to investors._**\n\nParent is an “emerging growth company” as defined in the JOBS Act. As an emerging growth company, Parent is only required to provide two years of audited financial statements and only two years of related selected financial data and management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations disclosure. In addition, Parent is not required to obtain auditor attestation of its reporting on internal control over financial reporting, has reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation and is not required to hold non-binding advisory votes on executive compensation. In addition, the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of an extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards. This allows an emerging growth company to delay the adoption of these accounting standards until they would otherwise apply to private companies. Parent has elected to take advantage of such extended transition period. Parent cannot predict whether investors will find the Parent Shares to be less attractive as a result of its reliance on these exemptions. If some investors find the Parent Shares to be less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for the Parent Shares and the price of the Parent Shares may be more volatile. \n\nParent will remain an emerging growth company until the earliest of: (i) the end of the fiscal year in which Parent has total annual gross revenue of $1.07 billion; (ii) the last day of Parent’s fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date on which Lionheart consummated its initial public offering; (iii) the date on which Parent issues more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt during the preceding three-year period; or (iv) the end of the fiscal year in which the market value of the Parent’s Shares held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the last business day of its most recently completed second fiscal quarter. \n\nFurther, there is no guarantee that the exemptions available to Parent under the JOBS Act will result in significant savings. To the extent that Parent chooses not to use exemptions from various reporting requirements under the JOBS Act, it will incur additional compliance costs, which may impact Parent’s financial condition. \n\n64 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\n**_Parent may need additional capital in the future to meet its financial obligations and to pursue its business objectives. Additional capital may not be available on favorable terms, or at all, which could compromise Parent’s ability to meet its financial obligations and grow its business._**\n\nWhile Lionheart’s management anticipates that the funds made available from the potential PIPE Financing and Lionheart’s trust fund following the completion of the business combination will be sufficient to fund Parent’s operations in the near term, Parent may need to raise additional capital to fund operations in the future or finance future acquisitions. \n\nIf Parent seeks to raise additional capital in order to meet various objectives, including developing existing or future technologies and solutions, increasing working capital, acquiring new clients, expanding geographically and responding to competitive pressures, capital may not be available on favorable terms or may not be available at all. Lack of sufficient capital resources could significantly limit Parent’s ability to take advantage of business and strategic opportunities. Any additional capital raised through the sale of equity or debt securities with an equity component would dilute stock ownership. If adequate additional funds are not available, Parent may be required to delay, reduce the scope of, or eliminate material part of its business strategy, including acquiring potential new clients or the continued development of new or existing technologies or solutions and geographic expansion. \n\n**_Parent will incur significant costs and devote substantial management time as a result of being subject to reporting requirements in the United States, which may adversely affect the operating results of Parent in the future._**\n\nAs a company subject to reporting requirements in the United States, Parent will incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses that Parent would not have incurred as a private limited company in Ireland. For example, Parent will be subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act and is required to comply with the applicable requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, as well as rules and regulations subsequently implemented by the SEC, including the establishment and maintenance of effective disclosure and financial controls and changes in corporate governance practices. Compliance with these requirements will increase Parent’s legal and financial compliance costs and will make some activities more time consuming and costly, while also diverting management attention. In particular, Parent expects to incur significant expenses and devote substantial management effort toward ensuring compliance with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which will increase when it is no longer an emerging growth company as defined by the JOBS Act. \n\n**_Because Parent currently does not have plans to pay cash dividends on the Parent Shares, you may not receive any return on investment unless you sell your Parent Shares for a price greater than that which you paid for Lionheart Class A Common Stock._**\n\nParent currently does not expect to pay any cash dividends on Parent Shares. Any future determination to pay cash dividends or other distributions on Parent Shares will be at the discretion of the board of directors and will be dependent on Parent’s earnings, financial condition, operating results, capital requirements, and contractual, legal regulatory and other restrictions, including restrictions contained in the agreements governing any existing and future outstanding indebtedness Parent or Parent’s subsidiaries incur, on the payment of dividends by Parent or by Parent’s subsidiaries to Parent, and other factors that the Board deems relevant. As a result, you may not receive any return on an investment in the Parent Shares unless you sell the Parent Shares for a price greater than that which you paid for the Lionheart Class A Common Stock. \n\n**_An active trading market of the Parent Shares may not be sustained and investors may not be able to resell their Parent Shares at or above the price for which they purchased the Lionheart securities._**\n\nAn active trading market for the Parent Shares may not be sustained. In the absence of an active trading market for the Parent Shares, investors may not be able to sell their Parent Shares, respectively, at or above the \n\n65 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\nprice they paid at the time that they would like to sell. In addition, an inactive market may impair Parent’s ability to raise capital by selling shares or equity securities and may impair its ability to acquire business partners by using the Parent Shares as consideration, which, in turn, could harm Parent’s business. \n\n**_The trading price of the Parent Shares may be volatile, and holders of the Parent Shares could incur substantial losses._**\n\nThe stock market in general has experienced extreme volatility in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. As a result of this volatility, Lionheart’s stockholders may not be able to sell their Parent Shares at or above the price paid for Lionheart securities. The market price for the Parent Shares may be influence by many factors, including: \n\n• |  The continued impact of COVID-19 or other adverse public health developments;   \n---|---  \n• |  Actual or anticipated variations in operating results;   \n---|---  \n• |  Changes in financial estimates by the Post-Combination Company or by any securities analysts who might cover Parent;   \n---|---  \n• |  Conditions or trends in the Post-Combination Company’s industry;   \n---|---  \n• |  Stock market price and volume fluctuations of other public traded companies;   \n---|---  \n• |  Announcements by the Post-Combination Company or its competitors or new product or service offerings, significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships or divestitures;   \n---|---  \n• |  Announcements of investigations or regulatory scrutiny of the Post-Combination Company or lawsuits against the Post-Combination Company;   \n---|---  \n• |  Capital commitments;   \n---|---  \n• |  Political and country risks in the geographical areas in which the Post-Combination Company is operating;   \n---|---  \n• |  Business disruptions and costs related to stockholder activism;   \n---|---  \n• |  Additions or departure of key personnel;   \n---|---  \n• |  Sales of Parent Shares, including sales by Parent directors and officers or significant shareholders; and   \n---|---  \n• |  Expectations of future cash dividend declarations and payments.   \n---|---  \n  \n**_Lionheart and Parent may be targets of securities class action and derivative lawsuits which could result in substantial costs and may delay or prevent the transaction from being completed._**\n\nSecurities class action lawsuits and derivative lawsuits are often brought against companies that have entered into merger agreements. Even if the lawsuits are without merit, defending against these claims can result in substantial costs and divert management time and resources. An adverse judgment could result in monetary damages, which could have a negative impact on Parent’s liquidity and financial condition. Additionally, if a plaintiff is successful in obtaining an injunction prohibiting consummation of the transactions, then that injunction may delay or prevent the transactions from being completed. Currently, neither Parent nor Lionheart is aware of any securities class action lawsuits or derivative lawsuits being filed in connection with the transaction. \n\n**_Parent’s management has limited experience in operating a public company in the United States._**\n\nParent’s executive officers have limited experience in the management of a public company in the United States. Parent’s management team may not successfully or effectively manage its transition to a U.S. public company that will be subject to significant regulatory oversight and reporting obligations under federal securities laws. Their limited experience in dealing with the increasingly complex laws pertaining to U.S. public companies \n\n66 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\ncould be a significant disadvantage in that it is likely that an increasing amount of their time may be devoted to these activities which will result in less time being devoted to the management and growth of the Post-Combination Company. Parent may not have adequate personnel with the appropriate level of knowledge, experience, and training in the accounting policies, practices or internal controls over financial reporting required of public companies in the United States. The development and implementation of the standards and controls necessary for the Post-Combination Company to achieve the level of accounting standards required of a public company in the United States may require costs greater than expected. It is possible that the Post-Combination Company will be required to expand its employee base and hire additional employees to support its operations as a public company, which will increase its operating costs in future periods. \n\n**_There can be no assurance that we will be able to comply with the continued listing standards of Nasdaq._**\n\nOur Class A Common Stock, Company Public Units and Company Public Warrants are currently listed on Nasdaq. If, after the Business Combination, Nasdaq delists the Parent Shares from trading on its exchange for failure to meet the listing standards, we and our stockholders could face significant material adverse consequences including: \n\n• |  a limited availability of market quotations for our securities;   \n---|---  \n• |  reduced liquidity for our securities;   \n---|---  \n• |  a determination that the Parent Shares is a “penny stock” which will require brokers trading in the Parent Shares to adhere to more stringent rules and possibly result in a reduced level of trading activity in the secondary trading market for our securities;   \n---|---  \n• |  a limited amount of news and analyst coverage; and   \n---|---  \n• |  a decreased ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future.   \n---|---  \n  \nThe National Securities Markets Improvement Act of 1996, which is a federal statute, prevents or preempts the states from regulating the sale of certain securities, which are referred to as “covered securities.” To the extent the Parent Shares, Company Public Units and Company Public Warrants are listed on Nasdaq, they are covered securities. Although the states are preempted from regulating the sale of our securities, the federal statute does allow the states to investigate companies if there is a suspicion of fraud, and, if there is a finding of fraudulent activity, then the states can regulate or bar the sale of covered securities in a particular case. While we are not aware of a state, other than the State of Idaho, having used these powers to prohibit or restrict the sale of securities issued by blank check companies, certain state securities regulators view blank check companies unfavorably and might use these powers, or threaten to use these powers, to hinder the sale of securities of blank check companies in their states. Further, if we were no longer listed on Nasdaq, our securities would not be covered securities and we would be subject to regulation in each state in which we offer our securities. \n\n**_Lionheart has no operating history and is subject to a mandatory liquidation and subsequent dissolution requirement. As such, there is a risk that Lionheart will be unable to continue as a going concern if it does not consummate an initial business combination by_**** _February_**** _8, 2023 (or until May 8, 2023 if it extends the period of time to consummate its initial business combination pursuant to any further Extension Period).

Unless Lionheart amends its Existing Charter (which requires the affirmative vote of the holders of 65% of all then outstanding shares of common stock) and certain other agreements into which it has entered to extend \n\n67 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\nthe life of the Company, if Lionheart does not complete an initial business combination by February 8, 2023 (or until May 8, 2023 if it extends the period of time to consummate its initial business combination pursuant to any further Extension Period), it will: (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up; (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the Company Public Shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account including interest not previously released to the Company to fund its working capital requirements and taxes (less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses) divided by the number of then outstanding Company Public Shares, which redemption will completely extinguish Company Public Stockholders’ rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any), subject to applicable law; and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and the Lionheart Board, dissolve and liquidate, subject in each case to our obligations under the DGCL to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. In the event of such distribution, it is possible that the per share value of the residual assets remaining available for distribution (including Trust Account assets) will be less than the initial public offering price per Public Unit in the IPO. In addition, if Lionheart fails to complete an initial business combination by February 8, 2023 (or until May 8, 2023 if it extends the period of time to consummate its initial business combination pursuant to any further Extension Period), there will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect to its Company Public Warrants or the Company Private Warrants, which will expire worthless. Lionheart expects to consummate the Business Combination and do not currently intend to take any action to extend the life of the Company beyond February 8, 2023 (or until May 8, 2023 if it extends the period of time to consummate its initial business combination pursuant to any further Extension Period) if it is unable to effect an initial business combination by that date. \n\n**_Unanticipated changes in effective tax rates or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our income or other tax returns could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations._**\n\nWe will be subject to federal and state income taxes in the United States and potentially in other jurisdictions. Our future effective tax rates could be subject to volatility or adversely affected by a number of factors, including: \n\n• |  changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities;   \n---|---  \n• |  expected timing and amount of the release of any tax valuation allowances;   \n---|---  \n• |  tax effects of stock-based compensation;   \n---|---  \n• |  changes in tax laws, regulations or interpretations thereof; or   \n---|---  \n• |  lower than anticipated future earnings in jurisdictions where we have lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated future earnings in jurisdictions where we have higher statutory tax rates.   \n---|---  \n  \nIn addition, we may be subject to audits of our income, sales and other transaction taxes by taxing authorities. Outcomes from these audits could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. \n\n**_Future changes in U.S. and foreign tax laws could adversely affect Parent._**\n\nThe U.S. Congress and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development have focused on issues related to the taxation of multinational corporations. In particular, specific attention has been paid to “base erosion and profit shifting”, where payments are made between affiliates from a jurisdiction with high tax rates to a jurisdiction with lower tax rates. As a result, the tax laws in Ireland could change on a prospective or retroactive basis, and any such change could adversely affect Parent.\n\n68 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\n**_Past performance by members of our management team may not be indicative of future performance of an investment in the Company or the Post-Combination Company._**\n\nPast performance by members of our management team is not a guarantee of success with respect to the Business Combination. You should not rely on the historical record of members of our management team’s performance as indicative of the future performance of an investment in the Company or Post-Combination Company or the returns the Company or Post-Combination Company will, or is likely to, generate going forward. \n\n**_We may be unable to obtain additional financing to fund the operations and growth of the Post-Combination Company._**\n\nWe may require additional financing to fund the operations or growth of the Post-Combination Company. The failure to secure additional financing could have a material adverse effect on the continued development or growth of the Post-Combination Company. None of our officers, directors or stockholders is required to provide any financing to us in connection with or after our Business Combination. \n\n**_Changes in laws, regulations or rules, or a failure to comply with any laws, regulations or rules, may adversely affect our business, investments and results of operations._**\n\nWe are subject to laws, regulations and rules enacted by national, regional and local governments and Nasdaq. In particular, we are required to comply with certain SEC, Nasdaq and other legal or regulatory requirements. Compliance with, and monitoring of, applicable laws, regulations and rules may be difficult, time consuming and costly. Those laws, regulations or rules and their interpretation and application may also change from time to time and those changes could have a material adverse effect on our business, investments and results of operations. In addition, a failure to comply with applicable laws, regulations or rules, as interpreted and applied, could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. \n\n**_The Company’s and SMX’s ability to consummate the Business Combination, and the operations of the Post-Combination Company following the Business Combination, may be materially adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. _**\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has resulted, and other infectious diseases could result, in a widespread health crisis that has and could continue to adversely affect the economies and financial markets worldwide, which may delay or prevent the consummation of the Business Combination, and the business of SMX or the Post-Combination Company following the Business Combination could be materially and adversely affected. The extent of such impact will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. \n\nThe parties will be required to consummate the Business Combination even if SMX, its business, financial condition and results of operations are materially affected by COVID-19. The disruptions posed by COVID-19 have continued, and other matters of global concern may continue, for an extensive period of time, and if SMX is unable to recover from business disruptions due to COVID-19 or other matters of global concern on a timely basis, SMX’s ability to consummate the Business Combination and the Post-Combination Company’s financial condition and results of operations following the Business Combination may be materially adversely affected. Each of SMX and the Post-Combination Company may also incur additional costs due to delays caused by COVID-19, which could adversely affect the Post-Combination Company’s financial condition and results of operations. \n\n**_Because Parent will become a public reporting company by means other than a traditional underwritten initial public offering, Parent’s shareholders may face additional risks and uncertainties._**\n\nBecause Parent will become a public reporting company by means of consummating the Business Combination rather than by means of a traditional underwritten initial public offering, there is no independent third-party underwriter selling the Parent Shares, and, accordingly, Parent’s shareholders will not have the \n\n69 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\nbenefit of an independent review and investigation of the type normally performed by an unaffiliated, independent underwriter in a public securities offering. Due diligence reviews typically include an independent investigation of the background of the company, any advisors and their respective affiliates, review of the offering documents and independent analysis of the plan of business and any underlying financial assumptions. Because there is no independent third-party underwriter selling the Parent Shares, the Company’s stockholders must rely on the information included in this proxy statement/prospectus. Although the Company performed a due diligence review and investigation of SMX in connection with the Business Combination that it believed to be reasonable, the lack of an independent due diligence review and investigation increases the risk of investment in SMX because this due diligence investigation may not have uncovered facts that would be important to a potential investor. Our Sponsor may have an inherent conflict of interest because its shares of Class A Common Stock and Company Public Warrants will be worthless if a business combination is not completed with SMX or another company during a prescribed period of time. Therefore, there could be a heightened risk of an incorrect valuation of the Post-Combination Company’s business, which could cause potential harm to investors. \n\nA market for our securities may not continue, which would adversely affect the liquidity and price of our securities. In addition, because Parent will not become a public reporting company by means of a traditional underwritten initial public offering, security or industry analysts may not provide, or be less likely to provide, coverage of the Post-Combination Company. Investment banks may also be less likely to agree to underwrite follow-on or secondary offerings on behalf of the Post-Combination Company than they might if Parent became a public reporting company by means of a traditional underwritten initial public offering, because they may be less familiar with the Post-Combination Company as a result of not having performed similar work during the initial public offering process or because of more limited coverage by analysts and the media. The failure to receive research coverage or support in the market for the Parent Shares could have an adverse effect on the Post-Combination Company’s ability to develop a liquid market for the Parent Shares. See “- _Risks Related to Ownership of the Parent Shares Following the Business Combination_ — _If, following the Business Combination, securities or industry analysts do not publish or cease publishing research or reports about the Post-Combination Company, its business, or its market, or if they change their recommendations regarding the Parent Shares adversely, then the price and trading volume of the Parent Shares could decline_.” \n\n**_We have not registered the shares of Class A Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the Public Warrants under the Securities Act or any state securities laws at this time, and such registration may not be in place when an investor desires to exercise Company Public Warrants, thus precluding such investor from being able to exercise its Company Public Warrants except on a cashless basis and potentially causing such Parent Warrants to expire worthless._**\n\nWe have not registered the shares of our Class A Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the Parents Public Warrants under the Securities Act or any state securities laws at this time. However, under the terms of the Existing Warrant Agreement, we have agreed to use our best efforts to file a registration statement under the Securities Act covering such shares and maintain a current prospectus relating to the Company’s Class A Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the Company Public Warrants, until the expiration of the Company Public Warrants in accordance with the provisions of the Existing Warrant Agreement. We cannot assure you that we will be able to do so if, for example, any facts or events arise which represent a fundamental change in the information set forth in such registration statement or prospectus, the financial statements contained or incorporated by reference therein are not current or correct or the SEC issues a stop order. If the shares issuable upon exercise of the Company Public Warrants are not registered under the Securities Act, we will be required to permit holders to exercise their Company Public Warrants on a cashless basis. However, no Company Public Warrant will be exercisable for cash or on a cashless basis, and we will not be obligated to issue any shares to holders seeking to exercise their Company Public Warrants, unless the issuance of the shares upon such exercise is registered or qualified under the securities laws of the state of the exercising holder or an exemption from registration is available. Notwithstanding the above, if the Company’s Class A Common Stock is at the time of any exercise of a Company Public Warrant not listed on a national securities exchange such that it satisfies the definition of a “covered security” under Section 18(b)(1) of the Securities Act, we may, at our option, require \n\n70 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\nholders of the Company Public Warrants who exercise their Company Public Warrants to do so on a “cashless basis” in accordance with Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act and, in the event we so elect, we will not be required to file or maintain in effect a registration statement, but we will be required to use our best efforts to register the shares under applicable blue sky laws to the extent an exemption is not available. In no event will we be required to net cash settle any Company Public Warrant, or issue securities or other compensation in exchange for the Company Public Warrants in the event that we are unable to register or qualify the shares underlying the Company Public Warrants under applicable state securities laws and there is no exemption available. If the issuance of the shares upon exercise of the Company Public Warrants is not so registered or qualified or exempt from registration or qualification, the holder of such Company Public Warrant shall not be entitled to exercise such Company Public Warrant and such Company Public Warrant may have no value and expire worthless. In such event, holders who acquired their Company Public Warrants as part of a purchase of Company Public Units will have paid the full unit purchase price solely for the shares of the Company’s Class A Common Stock included in the Company Public Units. If and when the Company Public Warrants become redeemable by the Company, we may exercise our redemption right even if we are unable to register or qualify the underlying shares of the Company’s Class A Common Stock for sale under all applicable state securities laws. \n\n**_We may amend the terms of the Company Public Warrants in a manner that may be adverse to holders with the approval by the holders of at least 50% of the then-outstanding Company Public Warrants. As a result, the exercise price of a holder’s Company Public Warrants could be increased, the exercise period could be shortened and the number of shares of the Company’s Common Stock purchasable upon exercise of a Company Public Warrant could be decreased, all without the approval of that warrant holder._**\n\nThe Company Public Warrants were issued in registered form under the Existing Warrant Agreement. The Existing Warrant Agreement provides that the terms of the Company Public Warrants may be amended without the consent of any holder to cure any ambiguity or correct any defective provision but requires the approval by the holders of at least 50% of the then-outstanding Company Public Warrants to make any other change, including any change that adversely affects the interests of the registered holders. Accordingly, we may amend the terms of the Company Public Warrants in a manner adverse to a holder if holders of at least 50% of the then-outstanding Company Public Warrants approve of such amendment. Although our ability to amend the terms of the Company Public Warrants with the consent of at least 50% of the then-outstanding Company Public Warrants is unlimited, examples of such amendments could be amendments to, among other things, increase the exercise price of the Company Public Warrants, shorten the exercise period or decrease the number of shares of the Company’s Class A Common Stock purchasable upon exercise of a Company Public Warrant. \n\n**_We may redeem unexpired Company Public Warrants prior to their exercise at a time that is disadvantageous to warrant holders, thereby making such warrants worthless._**\n\nWe have the ability to redeem outstanding Company Public Warrants at any time after they become exercisable and prior to their expiration, at a price of $0.01 per warrant; provided that the last reported sales price of our Class A Common Stock equals or exceeds $18.00 per share (or as otherwise adjusted pursuant to the Existing Warrant Agreement) for any 20 trading days within a 30 trading-day period ending on the third trading day prior to the date on which we give proper notice of such redemption to the warrant holders and provided certain other conditions are met. During the most recent 60-day trading period, the price of our Class A Common Stock has remained below the threshold that would allow us to redeem the Public Warrants. If and when the Public Warrants become redeemable by us, we may exercise our redemption right even if we are unable to register or qualify the underlying securities for sale under all applicable state securities laws. Redemption of the outstanding Public Warrants could force the warrant holders: (i) to exercise their Public Warrants and pay the exercise price therefor at a time when it may be disadvantageous for them to do so; or (ii) to sell their Public Warrants at the then-current market price when they might otherwise wish to hold their Public Warrants. None of the Private Warrants will be redeemable by us so long as they are held by their initial purchasers or such initial purchasers’ permitted transferees. None of the Private Warrants will be redeemable by us so long as they are held by the Sponsor or its permitted transferees. \n\n71 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\nThe Company has no obligation to notify holders of the Public Warrants that they have become eligible for redemption. However, in the event the Company determined to redeem the Public Warrants, holders of the Public Warrants would be notified of such redemption as described in the Existing Warrant Agreement. Specifically, in the event that the Company elects to redeem all of the redeemable warrants as described above, the Company shall fix a date for the redemption (the “Redemption Date”). Notice of redemption shall be mailed by first class mail, postage prepaid, by the Company not less than 30 days prior to the Redemption Date to the registered holders of the redeemable warrants to be redeemed at their last addresses as they appear on the registration books. Any notice mailed in the manner provided in the Existing Warrant Agreement shall be conclusively presumed to have been duly given whether or not the registered holder received such notice. In addition, beneficial owners of the redeemable warrants will be notified of such redemption via the Company’s posting of the redemption notice to DTC. \n\n**_Because each Public Unit contains one-half of one Public Warrant and only a whole Public Warrant may be exercised, the Public Units may be worth less than Public Units of other blank check companies. _**\n\nEach Public Unit contains one-half of one Public Warrant. Because, pursuant to the Existing Warrant Agreement, the Public Warrants may only be exercised for a whole number of shares, only a whole Public Warrant may be exercised at any given time. This is different from other offerings similar to ours whose public units include one share of common stock and one public warrant to purchase one whole share. We have established the components of the Public Units in this way in order to reduce the dilutive effect of the Public Warrants upon completion of an initial business combination since the Public Warrants will be exercisable in the aggregate for one-half of the number of shares compared to Public Units that each contain a Public Warrant to purchase one whole share, thus making us, we believe, a more attractive business combination partner for target businesses. Nevertheless, this unit structure may cause our Public Units to be worth less than if they included a Public Warrant to purchase one whole share. \n\n**_Warrants will become exercisable for our Class A Common Stock, which would increase the number of shares eligible for future resale in the public market and result in dilution to our stockholders._**\n\nWe issued Public Warrants to purchase 6,250,000 shares of Class A Common Stock as part of our IPO and, on the IPO closing date, we issued Private Warrants to the Sponsor and the Underwriters to purchase in the aggregate 2,000,000 shares of our Class A Common Stock, in each case with a strike price of $11.50 per share. In addition, prior to consummating an initial business combination, nothing prevents us from issuing additional securities in a private placement so long as they do not participate in any manner in the Trust Account or vote as a class with the common stock on an initial business combination. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the shares of Class A Common Stock issuable upon exercise of our warrants will result in dilution to the then existing holders of Class A Common Stock of the Company and increase the number of shares eligible for resale in the public market. Sales of substantial numbers of such shares in the public market could adversely affect the market price of our Class A Common Stock. Since the Public Warrants began trading separately on December 7, 2021, their trading range has been $0.012 - $0.60, resulting in an average of $0.31 and an approximate value of $3,875,000. Since the Public Warrants are freely tradable, the number of Public Warrants outstanding is not dependent on the level of redemptions of Class A Common Stock. For more information on the Public Warrants, please see the Existing Warrant Agreement. \n\nThe Private Warrants are identical to the Public Warrants sold as part of the Public Units issued in our IPO except that, so long as they are held by the Sponsor, the Underwriters or their permitted transferees: (i) they will not be redeemable by us; (ii) they (including the Class A Common Stock issuable upon exercise of these warrants) may not, subject to certain limited exceptions, be transferred, assigned or sold by the Sponsor until 30 days after the completion of an initial business combination; (iii) they may be exercised by the holders on a net share (cashless) basis; and (iv) are subject to registration rights. \n\n72 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\n**_Our stockholders may be held liable for claims by third parties against us to the extent of distributions received by them upon redemption of their shares._**\n\nUnder the DGCL, stockholders may be held liable for claims by third parties against a corporation to the extent of distributions received by them in a dissolution. The pro rata portion of the Trust Account distributed to our Public Stockholders upon the redemption of our Public Shares in the event we do not complete an initial business combination by February 8, 2023 (or until May 8, 2023 if we extend the period of time to consummate our initial business combination pursuant to any further Extension Period) may be considered a liquidating distribution under Delaware law. If a corporation complies with certain procedures set forth in Section 280 of the DGCL intended to ensure that it makes reasonable provision for all claims against it, including a 60-day notice period during which any third-party claims can be brought against the corporation, a 90-day period during which the corporation may reject any claims brought, and an additional 150-day waiting period before any liquidating distributions are made to stockholders, any liability of stockholders with respect to a liquidating distribution is limited to the lesser of such stockholder’s pro rata share of the claim or the amount distributed to the stockholder, and any liability of the stockholder would be barred after the third anniversary of the dissolution. However, it is our intention to redeem our Public Shares as soon as reasonably possible following February 8, 2023 (or until May 8, 2023 if we extend the period of time to consummate our initial business combination pursuant to any further Extension Period) in the event we do not complete an initial business combination and, therefore, we do not intend to comply with the foregoing procedures. \n\nBecause we will not be complying with Section 280 of the DGCL, Section 281(b) of the DGCL requires us to adopt a plan, based on facts known to us at such time that will provide for our payment of all existing and pending claims or claims that may be potentially brought against us within the ten years following our dissolution. However, because we are a blank check company, rather than an operating company, and our operations are limited to searching for prospective target businesses to acquire, the only likely claims to arise would be from our vendors (such as lawyers, investment bankers, etc.) or prospective target businesses. If our plan of distribution complies with Section 281(b) of the DGCL, any liability of stockholders with respect to a liquidating distribution is limited to the lesser of such stockholder’s pro rata share of the claim or the amount distributed to the stockholder, and any liability of the stockholder would likely be barred after the third anniversary of the dissolution. We cannot assure you that we will properly assess all claims that may be potentially brought against us. As such, our stockholders could potentially be liable for any claims to the extent of distributions received by them (but no more) and any liability of our stockholders may extend beyond the third anniversary of such date. Furthermore, if the pro rata portion of our Trust Account distributed to our Public Stockholders upon the redemption of our Public Shares in the event we do not complete an initial business combination by February 8, 2023 (or until May 8, 2023 if we extend the period of time to consummate our initial business combination pursuant to any further Extension Period) is not considered a liquidating distribution under Delaware law and such redemption distribution is deemed to be unlawful, then pursuant to Section 174 of the DGCL, the statute of limitations for claims of creditors could then be six years after the unlawful redemption distribution, instead of three years, as in the case of a liquidating distribution. \n\n**_Our internal control over financial reporting may not be effective and our independent registered public accounting firm may not be able to certify as to their effectiveness, which could have a significant and adverse effect on our business and reputation._**\n\nAs a public company, we are required to comply with the SEC’s rules implementing Sections 302 and 404 of SOX, which require management to certify financial and other information in our quarterly and annual reports and provide an annual management report on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. To comply with the requirements of being a public company, the Company may be required to provide the management report on internal controls commencing with the annual report for fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, and we may need to undertake various actions, such as implementing additional internal controls and procedures and hiring additional accounting or internal audit staff. The standards required for a public company under Section 404 of SOX are significantly more stringent than those required of SMX as a privately held \n\n73 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\ncompany. Further, as an emerging growth company, our independent registered public accounting firm is not required to formally attest to the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 of SOX until the date we are no longer an emerging growth company. Our independent registered public accounting firm may issue a report that is adverse in the event that it is not satisfied with the level at which the controls of the Post-Combination Company are documented, designed or operating. \n\nTesting and maintaining these controls can divert our management’s attention from other matters that are important to the operation of our business. If we identify material weaknesses in the internal control over financial reporting of the Post-Combination Company or are unable to comply with the requirements of Section 404 of SOX or assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, or if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to express an opinion as to the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting when we no longer qualify as an emerging growth company, investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports and the market price of our common stock could be negatively affected, and we could become subject to investigations by the SEC or other regulatory authorities, which could require additional financial and management resources. \n\n**_The Company’s stockholders may be held liable for claims by third parties against the Company to the extent of distributions received by them._**\n\nIf the Company has not completed a business combination by February 8, 2023 (or until May 8, 2023 if it extends the period of time to consummate its initial business combination pursuant to any further Extension Period), the Company will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem 100% of the outstanding Public Shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including any interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account net of interest that may be used by the Company to pay its taxes payable and up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses, divided by the number of then outstanding Public Shares, which redemption will completely extinguish Public Stockholders’ rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of the Company’s remaining stockholders and the Lionheart Board, dissolve and liquidate, subject (in the case of (ii) and (iii) above) to the Company’s obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. \n\nIf the Company is forced to file a bankruptcy case or an involuntary bankruptcy case is filed against the Company which is not dismissed, any distributions received by stockholders could be viewed under applicable debtor/creditor and/or bankruptcy laws as either a “preferential transfer” or a “fraudulent conveyance.” As a result, a bankruptcy court could seek to recover all amounts received by the Company’s stockholders. Furthermore, because the Company intends to distribute the proceeds held in the Public Shares to the Company’s Public Stockholders promptly after expiration of the time the Company has to complete an initial business combination, this may be viewed or interpreted as giving preference to the Company’s Public Stockholders over any potential creditors with respect to access to or distributions from the Company’s assets. Furthermore, the Lionheart Board may be viewed as having breached their fiduciary duties to the Company’s creditors and/or may have acted in bad faith, and thereby exposing itself and the Company to claims of punitive damages, by paying Public Stockholders from the Trust Account prior to addressing the claims of creditors. The Company cannot assure you that claims will not be brought against it for these reasons. \n\n**Risks Related to Ownership of the Parent Shares Following the Business Combination**\n\n_In this section, unless otherwise noted or the context otherwise requires, “we”, “us”, and “our” refer to the Post-Combination Company._\n\n74 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\n**_A market for our securities may not continue, which would adversely affect the liquidity and price of our securities._**\n\nFollowing the Business Combination, the price of our securities may fluctuate significantly due to the market’s reaction to the Business Combination and general market and economic conditions. An active trading market for our securities following the Business Combination may never develop or, if developed, it may not be sustained. In addition, the price of our securities after the Business Combination can vary due to general economic conditions and forecasts, our general business condition and the release of our financial reports. Additionally, if our securities are not listed on, or become delisted from, Nasdaq for any reason, and are quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board, an inter-dealer automated quotation system for equity securities that is not a national securities exchange, the liquidity and price of our securities may be more limited than if we were quoted or listed on Nasdaq or another national securities exchange. You may be unable to sell your securities unless a market can be established or sustained. \n\n**_If the Business Combination’s benefits do not meet the expectations of investors, stockholders or financial analysts, the market price of our securities may decline._**\n\nIf the benefits of the Business Combination do not meet the expectations of investors or securities analysts, the market price of the Company’s securities prior to the closing of the Business Combination may decline. The market values of our securities at the time of the Business Combination may vary significantly from their prices on the date the BCA and the SID was executed, the date of this proxy statement/prospectus, or the date on which our stockholders vote on the Business Combination. \n\nIn addition, following the Business Combination, fluctuations in the price of our securities could contribute to the loss of all or part of your investment. Immediately prior to the Business Combination, there has not been a public market for SMX’s stock in the United States and trading in the shares of SMX in the ASX has not been active and trading in the shares of the Company’s Class A Common Stock has not been active. Accordingly, the valuation ascribed to SMX and the Company’s Class A Common Stock in the Business Combination may not be indicative of the price of the Post-Combination Company that will prevail in the trading market following the Business Combination. If an active market for our securities develops and continues, the trading price of our securities following the Business Combination could be volatile and subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control. Any of the factors listed below could have a material adverse effect on your investment in our securities and our securities may trade at prices significantly below the price you paid for them. In such circumstances, the trading price of our securities may not recover and may experience a further decline. \n\nBroad market and industry factors may materially harm the market price of our securities irrespective of our operating performance. The stock market in general and Nasdaq have experienced price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of the particular companies affected. The trading prices and valuations of these stocks, and of our securities, may not be predictable. A loss of investor confidence in the market for the stocks of other companies that investors perceive to be similar to the Post-Combination Company could depress our stock price regardless of our business, prospects, financial conditions or results of operations. A decline in the market price of our securities also could adversely affect our ability to issue additional securities and our ability to obtain additional financing in the future. \n\nIn the past, securities class action litigation has often been initiated against companies following periods of volatility in their stock price. This type of litigation could result in substantial costs and divert our management’s attention and resources and could also require us to make substantial payments to satisfy judgments or to settle litigation. \n\n75 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\n**_If, following the Business Combination, securities or industry analysts do not publish or cease publishing research or reports about the Post-Combination Company, its business, or its market, or if they change their recommendations regarding the Parent Shares adversely, then the price and trading volume of the Parent Shares could decline._**\n\nThe trading market for our Class A Common Stock, issuable upon exercise of the Parent Public Warrants, will be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts may publish about us, our business, our market, or our competitors. Securities and industry analysts do not currently, and may never, publish research on the Company or the Post-Combination Company. If no securities or industry analysts commence coverage of the Post-Combination Company, our stock price and trading volume would likely be negatively impacted. If any of the analysts who may cover the Post-Combination Company change their recommendation regarding our stock adversely, or provide more favorable relative recommendations about our competitors, the price of our Class A Common Stock, issuable upon exercise of the Parent Public Warrants, would likely decline. If any analyst who may cover the Company were to cease coverage of the Post-Combination Company or fail to regularly publish reports on it, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline. \n\n**Risks Related to Redemption**\n\n_In this section, unless otherwise noted or the context otherwise requires, “we”, “us”, and “our” refer to the Company or Lionheart._\n\n**_If third parties bring claims against the Company, the proceeds held in the Trust Account could be reduced and the per share redemption amount received by stockholders may be less than $10.10 per share._**\n\nThe Company’s placement of funds in the Trust Account may not protect those funds from third-party claims against the Company. Although the Company has sought and will continue to seek to have all vendors, service providers, prospective target businesses, including SMX, or other entities with which the Company does business execute agreements with the Company waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the Trust Account for the benefit of the Public Stockholders, such parties may not execute such agreements, or even if they execute such agreements they may not be prevented from bringing claims against the Trust Account, including, but not limited to, fraudulent inducement, breach of fiduciary responsibility or other similar claims, as well as claims challenging the enforceability of the waiver, in each case in order to gain advantage with respect to a claim against the Company’s assets, including the funds held in the Trust Account. If any third party refuses to execute an agreement waiving such claims to the monies held in the Trust Account, management will perform an analysis of the alternatives available to it and will only enter into an agreement with a third party that has not executed a waiver if management believes that such third party’s engagement would be significantly more beneficial to the Company than any alternative. Withum Smith+Brown, PC, our independent registered public accounting firm, did not execute agreements with the Company waiving such claims to the monies held in the Trust Account. \n\n**_The Company’s independent directors may decide not to enforce the indemnification obligations of the Sponsor, resulting in a reduction in the amount of funds in the Trust Account available for distribution to Public Stockholders._**\n\nIn the event that the proceeds in the Trust Account are reduced below the lesser of (i) $10.10 per Public Share or (ii) such lesser amount per share held in the Trust Account as of the date of the liquidation of the Trust Account due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, in each case net of the interest which may be withdrawn to pay taxes, and the Sponsor asserts that it is unable to satisfy its obligations or that it has no indemnification obligations related to a particular claim, the Company’s independent directors would determine whether to take legal action against the Sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations. \n\nWhile the Company currently expects that its independent directors would take legal action on its behalf against the Sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations to the Company, it is possible that the Company’s \n\n76 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\nindependent directors in exercising their business judgment may choose not to do so if, for example, the cost of such legal action is deemed by the independent directors to be too high relative to the amount recoverable or if the independent directors determine that a favorable outcome is not likely. If the Company’s independent directors choose not to enforce these indemnification obligations, the amount of funds in the Trust Account available for distribution to the Public Stockholders may be reduced below $10.10 per share. \n\n**_There is no guarantee that a Public Stockholder’s decision whether to redeem their Public Shares for a pro rata portion of the Trust Account will put such stockholder in a better future economic position._**\n\nNo assurance can be given as to the price at which a Public Stockholder may be able to sell the shares of our Class A Common Stock in the future following the completion of the Business Combination. Certain events following the consummation of any business combination, including the Business Combination, may cause an increase in the Company’s stock price, and may result in a lower value realized now than a stockholder might realize in the future had the stockholder not elected to redeem such stockholder’s Public Shares. Similarly, if a Public Stockholder does not redeem such person’s shares, such stockholder will bear the risk of ownership of the Class A Common Stock after the consummation of the Business Combination, and there can be no assurance that a stockholder can sell such person’s shares of Class A Common Stock in the future for a greater amount than the redemption price set forth in this proxy statement/prospectus. A Public Stockholder should consult such person’s own tax and/or financial advisor for assistance on how this may affect its individual situation. \n\n**_If the Public Stockholders fail to comply with the redemption requirements specified in this proxy statement/prospectus, they will not be entitled to redeem their Public Shares for a pro rata portion of the funds held in the Trust Account._**\n\nTo exercise their redemption rights, stockholders are required to deliver their stock, either physically or electronically using Depository Trust Company’s DWAC System, to the Company’s transfer agent two business days prior to the vote at the Special Meeting. If a holder properly seeks redemption as described in this proxy statement/prospectus and the Business Combination is consummated, the Company will redeem these shares for a pro rata portion of funds deposited in the Trust Account and the holder will no longer own such shares following the Business Combination. See the section entitled “ _The_ _Special Meeting of Lionheart Stockholders_ _—_ _Redemption Rights_ ” for additional information on how to exercise your redemption rights. \n\n**_If, before distributing the proceeds in the Trust Account to the Public Stockholders, the Company files a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against the Company that is not dismissed, the claims of creditors in such proceeding may have priority over the claims of the stockholders and the per share amount that would otherwise be received by the Company’s stockholders in connection with the Company’s liquidation may be reduced._**\n\nIf, before distributing the proceeds in the Trust Account to the Public Stockholders, the Company files a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against the Company that is not dismissed, the proceeds held in the Trust Account could be subject to applicable bankruptcy law and may be included in the Company’s bankruptcy estate and subject to the claims of third parties with priority over the claims of stockholders. To the extent any bankruptcy claims deplete the Trust Account, the per share amount that would otherwise be received by Company stockholders in connection with our liquidation may be reduced. \n\n**_If, after the Company distributes the proceeds in the Trust Account to the Public Stockholders, the Company files a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against the Company that is not dismissed, a bankruptcy court may seek to recover such proceeds, and the Company and the Lionheart Board may be exposed to claims of punitive damages._**\n\nIf, after the Company distributes the proceeds in the Trust Account to the Public Stockholders, the Company files a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against the Company that is not \n\n77 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\ndismissed, any distributions received by Company stockholders could be viewed under applicable debtor/creditor and/or bankruptcy laws as either a “preferential transfer” or a “fraudulent conveyance.” As a result, a bankruptcy court could seek to recover all amounts received by Company stockholders. In addition, the Lionheart Board may be viewed as having breached its fiduciary duty to the Company’s creditors and/or having acted in bad faith, thereby exposing itself and the Company to claims of punitive damages, by paying Public Stockholders from the Trust Account prior to addressing the claims of creditors. \n\n**_If you or a “group” of stockholders of which you are a part are deemed to hold an aggregate of more than 15% of the Public Shares, you (or, if a member of such a group, all of the members of such group in the aggregate) will lose the ability to redeem all such shares in excess of 15% of the Public Shares._**\n\nA Public Stockholder, together with any of such person’s affiliates or any other person with whom it is acting in concert or as a “group” (as defined in Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act), will be restricted from redeeming in the aggregate such person’s Public Shares or, if part of such a group, the group’s Public Shares, in excess of 15% of the Public Shares without our prior consent. Your inability to redeem any such excess Public Shares could result in you suffering a material loss on your investment in the Company if you sell such excess Public Shares in open market transactions. The Company cannot assure you that the value of such excess Public Shares will appreciate over time following the Business Combination or that the market price of the Public Shares will exceed the per-share redemption price. \n\nHowever, the stockholders’ ability to vote all of their Public Shares (including such excess shares) for or against the Business Combination Proposal is not restricted by this limitation on redemption. \n\n**_Unlike some other blank check companies, the Company does not have a specified maximum redemption threshold. The absence of such a redemption threshold will make it easier for us to consummate the Business Combination even if a substantial number of our stockholders redeem their shares._**\n\nUnlike some other blank check companies, the Company does not have a specified maximum redemption threshold, except that we will not redeem Public Shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001. Some other blank check companies’ structures disallow the consummation of a business combination if the holders of such companies’ public shares elect to redeem or convert more than a specified percentage of the shares sold in such companies’ initial public offering. Because we have no such maximum redemption threshold, we may be able to consummate the Business Combination even though a substantial number of our Public Stockholders have redeemed their shares. \n\n**_If a stockholder fails to receive notice of our offer to redeem our Public Shares in connection with the Business Combination, or fails to comply with the procedures for tendering its shares, such shares may not be redeemed._**\n\nIf, despite our compliance with the proxy rules, a stockholder fails to receive our proxy materials, such stockholder may not become aware of the opportunity to redeem his, her or its shares. In addition, the proxy materials that we are furnishing to holders of our Public Shares in connection with the Business Combination describes the various procedures that must be complied with in order to validly redeem Public Shares. In the event that a stockholder fails to comply with these procedures, his, her or its shares may not be redeemed. \n\n**Risks related to Tax**\n\n**_The enactment of legislation implementing changes in taxation of international business activities, the adoption of other corporate tax reform policies, or changes in tax legislation or policies could impact Parent’s future financial position and results of operations._**\n\nCorporate tax reform, base-erosion efforts and tax transparency continue to be high priorities in many tax jurisdictions where we have business operations. As a result, policies regarding corporate income and other taxes in numerous jurisdictions are under heightened scrutiny and tax reform legislation is being proposed or enacted in a number of jurisdictions. \n\n78 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\nIn 2015, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (the “OECD”) published final recommendations on base erosion and profit shifting (“BEPS”). These recommendations proposed the development of rules directed at counteracting the effects of tax havens and preferential tax regimes in countries around the world. Several of the areas of tax law on which the BEPS project focused have led or will lead to changes in the domestic law of individual OECD jurisdictions. These changes include (amongst others) restrictions on interest and other deductions for tax purposes, the introduction of broad anti-hybrid regimes and reform of controlled foreign corporation rules. Changes are also expected to arise in the application of certain double tax treaties, which may restrict the ability of certain members of Parent to rely on the terms of relevant double tax treaties in certain circumstances. Further, recent BEPS developments such as the OECD Inclusive Framework’s global tax reform statements in October 2021 include proposals for new profit allocation and nexus rules and for rules (including Pillar Two model rules released in December 2021) to ensure that the profits of multinational enterprises are subject to a minimum rate of tax. If these are enacted, we would expect Parent’s tax costs and operational expenses related to this complex compliance to increase. \n\nChanges of law in individual jurisdictions which may arise as a result of the BEPS project or other tax measures may ultimately increase the tax base of individual members of Parent in certain jurisdictions or the worldwide tax exposure of Parent. Changes of law may also include revisions to the definition of a “permanent establishment” and the rules for attributing profit to a permanent establishment. Other changes may focus on the goal of ensuring that transfer pricing outcomes are in line with value creation. \n\nSuch changes to tax laws could increase their complexity and the burden and costs of compliance. Additionally, such changes could also result in significant modifications to existing transfer pricing rules and could potentially have an adverse impact on Parent’s taxable profits in various jurisdictions. \n\n**_U.S. holders that directly or indirectly own 10% or more of our equity interests may be subject to adverse U.S. federal income tax consequences under rules applicable to U.S. shareholders of “controlled foreign corporations.”_**\n\nA non-U.S. corporation generally will be classified as a controlled foreign corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes (a “CFC”), if “10% U.S. equityholders” (as defined below) own, directly, indirectly or constructively, more than 50% of either (i) the total combined voting power of all classes of stock of such corporation entitled to vote or (ii) the total value of the stock of such corporation. We do not believe that Parent would be classified as a CFC at the time of Closing, although CFC status is determined after taking into account complex constructive ownership rules and, accordingly, there can be no assurance in this regard. However, certain of Parent’s non-U.S. subsidiaries may be classified as CFCs (as a result of the application of certain constructive ownership rules which treat Parent’s U.S. subsidiaries as owning the equity of those non-U.S. subsidiaries), and it is possible that we may be classified as a CFC in the future. The U.S. federal income tax consequences for U.S. holders who at all times are not 10% U.S. equityholders would not be affected by the CFC rules. However, a U.S. holder that owns (or is treated as owning, directly, indirectly or constructively, including by applying certain attribution rules) 10% or more of the combined voting power of all classes of our stock entitled to vote or the total value of our equity interests (including equity interests attributable to a deemed exercise of options and convertible debt instruments), or a “10% U.S. equityholder,” if we were classified as a CFC, would generally be subject to current U.S. federal income taxation on a portion of our applicable subsidiaries’ earnings and profits (as determined for U.S. federal income tax purposes) and our earnings and profits, regardless of whether such 10% U.S. equityholder receives any actual distributions (with certain exceptions in the case of CFCs attributed through downward attribution). In addition, if we were classified as a CFC, a portion of any gains realized on the sale of our common shares by a 10% U.S. equityholder may be treated as ordinary income. A 10% U.S. equityholder will also be subject to additional U.S. federal income tax information reporting requirements with respect to our subsidiaries that are classified as CFCs and with respect to us (if we or any of our subsidiaries were classified as a CFC) and substantial penalties may be imposed for noncompliance. We cannot provide any assurances that Parent will assist U.S. holders in determining whether Parent or any of its subsidiaries are treated as a CFC for U.S. federal income tax purposes or whether any U.S. holder is treated as a 10% U.S. equityholder with respect to any of such CFC or furnish to any holder information \n\n79 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\nthat may be necessary to comply with reporting and tax paying obligations if Parent, or any of its subsidiaries, is treated as a CFC for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Each U.S. holder should consult its own tax advisor regarding the CFC rules and whether such U.S. holder may be a 10% U.S. equityholder for purposes of these rules. \n\n**_Our U.S. stockholders may suffer adverse tax consequences if we are classified as a “passive foreign investment company.”_**\n\nA non-U.S. corporation generally will be treated as a “passive foreign investment company” (a “PFIC”), for U.S. federal income tax purposes, in any taxable year if either (1) at least 75% of its gross income for such year is passive income or (2) at least 50% of the value of its assets (generally based on an average of the quarterly values of the assets) during such year is attributable to assets that produce or are held for the production of passive income. Based on the current and anticipated composition of the income, assets and operations of Parent and its subsidiaries and certain factual assumptions, Parent does not expect to be treated as a PFIC for its taxable year that includes the date of the Business Combination. However, there can be no assurances in this regard, because PFIC status is determined annually and requires a factual determination that depends on, among other things, the composition of a company’s income, assets and activities in each taxable year, and can only be made annually after the close of each taxable year, and is thus subject to significant uncertainty. Furthermore, because the value of our gross assets is likely to be determined in part by reference to our market capitalization, a decline in the value of our ordinary shares may result in Parent becoming a PFIC. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that we will not be considered a PFIC for any taxable year. If we are a PFIC for any taxable year during which a U.S. holder (as defined in “ _Certain Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations_ ”) holds our ordinary shares, certain adverse U.S. federal income tax consequences could apply to such U.S. Holder. Prospective U.S. Holders should consult their tax advisors regarding the potential application of the PFIC rules to them. See “ _Certain Material_ _U.S.__Federal Income Tax Considerations — Material U.S. Federal Tax Considerations — Passive Foreign Investment Company Rules_ ” below. \n\n**_The Internal Revenue Service may not agree that Parent should be treated as a non-U.S. corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes. _**\n\nAlthough Parent is incorporated in Ireland, the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) may assert that it should be treated as a U.S. corporation (and therefore a U.S. tax resident) for U.S. federal income tax purposes pursuant to Section 7874 of the Code. For U.S. federal income tax purposes, a corporation is generally considered a U.S. “domestic” corporation (or U.S. tax resident) if it is organized in the United States, and a corporation is generally considered a “foreign” corporation (or non-U.S. tax resident) if it is not a U.S. corporation. Because Parent is an entity incorporated in Ireland, it would generally be classified as a foreign corporation (or non-U.S. tax resident) under these rules. Section 7874 of the Code provides an exception under which a foreign incorporated and foreign tax resident entity may, in certain circumstances, be treated as a U.S. corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes. \n\nAs more fully described in the section titled “ _Certain Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations — Material U.S. Federal Tax Considerations — U.S. Federal Income Tax Treatment of Parent_ ,” based on the terms of the Business Combination and certain factual assumptions, Parent is not currently expected to be treated as a U.S. corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Section 7874 of the Code after the Business Combination. However, the application of Section 7874 of the Code is complex and is subject to detailed regulations (the application of which is uncertain in various respects and would be impacted by changes in such U.S. Treasury Regulations with possible retroactive effect) and is subject to certain factual uncertainties. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the IRS will not challenge the status of Parent as a foreign corporation under Section 7874 of the Code or that such challenge would not be sustained by a court. \n\nIf the IRS were to successfully challenge under Section 7874 of the Code Parent’s status as a foreign corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, Parent and certain Parent shareholders would be subject to significant adverse tax consequences, including a higher effective corporate income tax rate on Parent and future \n\n80 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\nwithholding taxes on certain Parent shareholders, depending on the application of any income tax treaty that might apply to reduce such withholding taxes. \n\nSee “ _Certain Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations — Material U.S. Federal Tax Considerations — U.S. Federal Income Tax Treatment of Parent_ ” for a more detailed discussion of the application of Section 7874 of the Code to the Business Combination. Investors in Parent should consult their own tax advisors regarding the application of Section 7874 of the Code to the Business Combination. \n\n**_Section 7874 of the Code may limit the ability of Lionheart to use certain tax attributes following the Business Combination, increase Parent’s U.S. affiliates’ U.S. taxable income or have other adverse consequences to Parent and Parent’s shareholders._**\n\nFollowing the acquisition of a U.S. corporation by a foreign corporation, Section 7874 of the Code can limit the ability of the acquired U.S. corporation and its U.S. affiliates to use U.S. tax attributes (including net operating losses and certain tax credits) to offset U.S. taxable income resulting from certain transactions, as well as result in certain other adverse tax consequences, even if the acquiring foreign corporation is respected as a foreign corporation for purposes of Section 7874 of the Code. In general, if a foreign corporation acquires, directly or indirectly, substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a U.S. corporation and after the acquisition, the former stockholders of the acquired U.S. corporation hold at least 60% (by either vote or value) but less than 80% (by vote and value) of the shares of the foreign acquiring corporation by reason of holding shares in the acquired U.S. corporation, subject to other requirements, certain adverse tax consequences under Section 7874 of the Code may apply. \n\nIf these rules apply to the Business Combination, Parent and certain of Parent’s shareholders may be subject to adverse tax consequences including, but not limited to, restrictions on the use of tax attributes with respect to “inversion gain” recognized over a 10-year period following the transaction, disqualification of dividends paid from preferential “qualified dividend income” rates and the requirement that any U.S. corporation owned by Parent include as “base erosion payments” that may be subject to a minimum U.S. federal income tax any amounts treated as reductions in gross income paid to certain related foreign persons. Furthermore, certain “disqualified individuals” (including officers and directors of a U.S. corporation) may be subject to an excise tax on certain stock-based compensation held thereby at a rate of 20%. \n\nAs more fully described in the section titled “ _Certain Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations — Material U.S. Federal Tax Considerations — U.S. Federal Income Tax Treatment of Parent_ ,” based on the terms of the Business Combination and certain factual assumptions, Parent is not currently expected to be subject to these rules under Section 7874 of the Code after the Business Combination. \n\nHowever, even if Parent is not subject to the above adverse consequences under Section 7874, Parent may be limited in using its equity to engage in future acquisitions of U.S. corporations over a 36-month period following the Business Combination. If Parent were to be treated as acquiring substantially all of the assets of a U.S. corporation or U.S. partnership within a 36-month period after the Business Combination, the Section 7874 regulations would exclude certain shares of Parent attributable to the Business Combination for purposes of determining the Section 7874 percentage of that subsequent acquisition, making it more likely that Section 7874 of the Code will apply to such subsequent acquisition. \n\nSee “ _Certain Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations — Material U.S. Federal Tax Considerations — U.S. Federal Income Tax Treatment of Parent_ ” for a more detailed discussion of the application of Section 7874 of the Code to the Business Combination. Investors in Parent should consult their own advisors regarding the application of Section 7874 of the Code to the Business Combination. \n\n81 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\n**_The Business Combination may be treated as a taxable exchange to holders of Company Public Shares or Company Public Warrants._**\n\nThe Business Combination has been structured to qualify as a reorganization under Section 368(a) of the Code (a “Reorganization”) and the parties to the Business Combination Agreement adopted the agreement as a “plan of reorganization” within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section 1.368-2(g). In order for the Business Combination to so qualify, among other requirements, it is necessary that Parent either (i) continue Lionheart’s historic business or (ii) use a significant portion of Lionheart’s historic business assets in a business. There is no authority applying this test to the acquisition of a blank check company in a transaction comparable to the Business Combination. Consequently, it is unclear under applicable law whether Lionheart’s operations and assets acquired in the Business Combination will qualify as a historic business or historic business assets for this purpose. If they do not so qualify, the Business Combination will not qualify as a Reorganization. Additionally, in order for the Business Combination to qualify as a Reorganization, it is necessary that a substantial part of the value of the proprietary interests in Lionheart be preserved in the Business Combination. It is unclear whether Redemption Rights will be exercised by Company Public Stockholders to a degree that will prevent a substantial part of the value of the propriety interests in Lionheart from being preserved for this purpose. If it is not so preserved, then the Business Combination would not qualify as a Reorganization. \n\nNeither Parent, Lionheart, nor any other party to the Business Combination Agreement makes any representations or provides any assurances regarding the qualification of the Business Combination as a Reorganization. Furthermore, because of the legal and factual uncertainties described above, no opinion of counsel has or will be provided regarding the qualification of the Business Combination as a Reorganization and neither Lionheart nor Parent intends to file the statement described in Treasury Regulations Section 1.368-3(a), reporting the Merger as a reorganization. \n\nIn the event that the Business Combination does not meet the requirements of a Reorganization, the Business Combination is also structured to qualify, and in the opinion of our counsel will qualify, as a transaction described in Section 351(a) of the Code. \n\nSee “ _Certain Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations — Material U.S. Federal Tax Considerations — The Business Combination_ ” below for a more detailed discussion of the tax consequences to holders of Company Public Shares or Company Public Warrants. \n\n**_The Excise Tax included in the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 may impose a significant tax liability on the Company after the Business Combination._**\n\nOn August 16, 2022, President Biden signed into law the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the “IRA”), which, among other changes, generally imposes a 1% excise tax on the fair market value of stock repurchased by certain publicly-traded domestic corporations beginning in 2023, with certain exceptions (the “Excise Tax”). Because the Company is a publicly-traded Delaware corporation, the Company may be a “covered corporation” within the meaning of the IRA, and it is possible the Excise Tax will apply to any redemptions of Company Public Shares after December 31, 2022, including redemptions occurring in connection with the Business Combination, unless an exemption is available. Consequently, the value of your investment in our securities may decrease as a result of the Excise Tax. Further, the application of the Excise Tax in the event of a liquidation is uncertain absent further guidance. \n\nThe proceeds placed in the Trust Account shall not be used to pay for possible excise taxes or any other fees or taxes that may be levied on the Company pursuant to any current, pending or future rules or laws, including without limitation any excise tax due under the IRA on any redemptions or stock buybacks by the Company. However, the interest earned on the proceeds placed in the Trust Account may be used to pay any taxes that may be levied on the Company, including franchise taxes, income taxes and any excise taxes, including the possible Excise Tax. \n\n82 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\n**Risks related to Irish Law**\n\n**_Following consummation of the Business Combination, a transfer of Parent Shares or Parent Warrants, other than one effected by means of the transfer of book-entry interests in the Depository Trust Company, may be subject to Irish stamp duty._**\n\nSubmission will be made to the Irish Revenue Commissioners to confirm that transfers of the Parent Shares and Parent Warrants effected by means of the transfer of book-entry interests in the Depository Trust Company (“DTC”) will not be subject to Irish stamp duty. It is anticipated that the majority of the Parent Shares and Parent Warrants will be traded through DTC by brokers who hold such shares on behalf of customers. \n\nHowever, if you hold your Parent Shares or Parent Warrants directly rather than beneficially through DTC, any transfer of your Parent Shares or Parent Warrants could be subject to Irish stamp duty (currently at the rate of 1% of the higher of the price paid or the market value of the Parent Shares or Parent Warrants acquired). Payment of Irish stamp duty is generally a legal obligation of the transferee. The potential for stamp duty could adversely affect the price of your Post-Combination Company securities. \n\n**_If the Parent Shares or Parent Warrants are not eligible for deposit and clearing within the facilities of DTC, then transactions in the Parent Shares or Parent Warrants may be disrupted._**\n\nThe facilities of DTC are a widely-used mechanism that allow for rapid electronic transfers of securities between the participants in the DTC system, which include many large banks and brokerage firms. \n\nUpon the consummation of the Business Combination, the Parent Shares and Parent Warrants will be eligible for deposit and clearing within the DTC system. Parent expects to enter into arrangements with DTC whereby it will agree to indemnify DTC for any Irish stamp duty that may be assessed upon it as a result of its service as a depository and clearing agency for the Parent Shares and Parent Warrants. It is expected that these actions, among others, will result in DTC agreeing to accept the Parent Shares and Parent Warrants for deposit and clearing within its facilities upon the completion of the Business Combination. \n\nDTC is not obligated to accept the Parent Shares or Parent Warrants for deposit and clearing within its facilities upon the completion of the Business Combination and, even if DTC does initially accept the Parent Shares or Parent Warrants, it generally will have discretion to cease to act as a depository and clearing agency for the Parent Shares or Parent Warrants. If DTC determined prior to the completion of the Business Combination that the Parent Shares or Parent Warrants are not eligible for clearance within its facilities, then it is not expected that the transactions would be completed in their current form. However, if DTC determined at any time after the completion of the Business Combination that the Parent Shares or Parent Warrants were not eligible for continued deposit and clearance within its facilities, then the Parent Shares and Parent Warrants would not be eligible for continued listing on a U.S. securities exchange and trading in the Parent Shares or Parent Warrants would be disrupted. While Parent would pursue alternative arrangements to preserve the Post-Combination Company’s listing and maintain trading, any such disruption could have a material adverse effect on the trading price of the Parent Shares or Parent Warrants. \n\n**_The Post-Combination Company’s failure to meet the continued listing requirements of Nasdaq could result in a delisting of its securities._**\n\nIf, after listing on Nasdaq, the Parent fails to satisfy the continued listing requirements of Nasdaq such as the corporate governance requirements or the minimum share price requirement, Nasdaq may take steps to delist its securities. Such delisting would likely have a negative effect on the price of the securities and would impair your ability to sell or purchase the securities when you wish to do so. In the event of a delisting, the Parent can provide no assurance that any action taken by it to restore compliance with listing requirements would allow its securities to become listed again, stabilize the market price or improve the liquidity of its securities, prevent its securities from dropping below Nasdaq minimum share price requirement or prevent future non-compliance with Nasdaq’s \n\n83 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\nlisting requirements. Additionally, if the Parent’s securities are not listed on, or become delisted from, Nasdaq for any reason, and are quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board, an inter-dealer automated quotation system for equity securities that is not a national securities exchange, the liquidity and price of your securities may be more limited than if they were quoted or listed on Nasdaq or another national securities exchange. You may be unable to sell your securities unless a market can be established or sustained. \n\n**_The Post-Combination Company does not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future._**\n\nThe Company has never declared or paid any cash dividends on its capital stock and does not intend to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. The Post-Combination Company expects to retain future earnings, if any, to fund the development and growth of its business. Any future determination to pay dividends on the Post-Combination Company’s capital stock will be at the discretion of the Board. \n\n**_In certain limited circumstances, dividends paid by Parent may be subject to Irish dividend withholding tax._**\n\nParent currently does not expect to pay any cash dividends on Parent Shares. If Parent were to declare and pay dividends, in certain limited circumstances, dividend withholding tax (currently at a rate of 25%) may arise in respect of dividends paid on Parent Shares. A number of exemptions from dividend withholding tax exist such that shareholders resident in the U.S. and other exempt countries may be entitled to exemptions from dividend withholding tax. \n\nSubmission will be made to the Irish Revenue Commissioners to confirm that shareholders resident in the U.S. that hold their Parent Shares through DTC will not be subject to dividend withholding tax, provided the addressees of the beneficial owners of such Parent Shares in the records of the brokers holding such Parent Shares are recorded as being in the U.S. (and such brokers have further transmitted the relevant information to a qualifying intermediary appointed by Parent). It is expected that this confirmation should be granted. However, other holders of Parent Shares may be subject to dividend withholding tax, which could adversely affect the price of their Parent Shares. \n\n**_After the Business Combination, dividends received by Irish residents and certain other shareholders may be subject to Irish income tax._**\n\nShareholders entitled to an exemption from Irish dividend withholding tax on dividends received from Parent will not be subject to Irish income tax in respect of those dividends unless they have some connection with Ireland other than their shareholding in Parent (for example, they are resident in Ireland). Shareholders who receive dividends subject to Irish dividend withholding tax will generally have no further liability to Irish income tax on those dividends. \n\n**_Parent Shares or Parent Warrants received by means of a gift or inheritance could be subject to Irish capital acquisitions tax._**\n\nIrish capital acquisitions tax (“CAT”) could apply to a gift or inheritance of Parent Shares or Parent Warrants irrespective of the place of residence, ordinary residence or domicile of the parties. This is because Parent Shares or Parent Warrants will be regarded as property situated in Ireland. The person who receives the gift or inheritance has primary liability for CAT. Gifts and inheritances passing between spouses are exempt from CAT. Children have a tax-free threshold of €335,000 in respect of taxable gifts or inheritances received from their parents. \n\nIt is recommended that each shareholder consult his or her own tax advisor as to the tax consequences of holding Parent Shares or Parent Warrants in, and receiving distributions from, Parent. \n\n84 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\n**_The Post-Combination Company’s staggered board will limit your ability to influence corporate matters and could discourage others from pursuing any change of control transactions that holders of Parent Shares may view as beneficial._**\n\nThe Parent Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association will provide that the Post-Combination Company Board shall have three classes of directors with the directors of each class serving staggered three year terms. The Post-Combination Company’s staggered board may limit your ability to influence corporate matters and could also discourage others from pursuing any potential merger, takeover, or other change of control transactions, which could have the effect of depriving the holders of Parent Shares and Parent Warrants of the opportunity to sell their Parent Shares at a premium over the prevailing market price. Additionally, the Post-Combination Company’s staggered board may discourage proxy contests for the election of directors and purchases of substantial blocks of Parent Shares by making it more difficult for a potential acquirer to gain control of or influence with the Post-Combination Company Board. \n\n**_There will be material differences between your current rights as a holder of the Company’s securities and the rights one can expect as a holder of Parent securities, some of which may adversely affect you._**\n\nUpon completion of the Business Combination, Company stockholders will no longer be stockholders of the Company, a Delaware corporation, but will be shareholders of Parent, a public limited company incorporated in Ireland. There will be material differences between the current rights of the Company stockholders and the rights you can expect to have as a holder of the Parent Shares, some of which may adversely affect you. \n\nFor a more detailed discussion of the differences in the rights of Company stockholders and the Parent shareholders, see the section of this proxy statement/prospectus titled “ _Comparison of Corporate Governance and Shareholder Rights_ ”. \n\n**_Provisions in the Parent Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association and under Irish law could make an acquisition of the Post-Combination Company more difficult, may limit attempts by the Post-Combination Company shareholders to replace or remove the Post-Combination Company’s management, may limit shareholders’ ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with the Post-Combination Company or the Post-Combination Company’s directors, officers or employees, and may limit the market price of the Parent Shares and/or the Parent Warrants._**\n\nProvisions in the Parent Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control or changes in the Post-Combination Company’s management. The Parent Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association includes provisions that: \n\n• |  require that the Post-Combination Company Board be classified into three classes of directors with staggered three-year terms;   \n---|---  \n• |  permit the Post-Combination Company Board to establish the number of directors and fill any vacancies and newly created directorships; and   \n---|---  \n• |  prohibit shareholder action by written consent without unanimous approval of all holders of the Parent Shares.   \n---|---  \n  \n**_The Parent Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association contains exclusive forum provisions for certain claims, which could limit the Post-Combination Company’s shareholders’ ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with the Post-Combination Company or the Post-Combination Company’s directors, officers or employees._**\n\nThe Parent Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association provides that unless the Post-Combination Company consents in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the federal district courts of \n\n85 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\nthe United States of America shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be the exclusive forum for the resolution of any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Exchange Act or the Securities Act (the “Federal Forum Provision”). Further, Section 22 of the Securities Act creates concurrent jurisdiction for federal and state courts over all claims brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Securities Act or the rules and regulations thereunder. The Post-Combination Company’s decision to adopt the Federal Forum Provision followed a decision by the Supreme Court of the State of Delaware holding that such provisions are facially valid under Delaware law. While there can be no assurance that federal or state courts will follow the holding of the Delaware Supreme Court or determine that the Federal Forum Provision should be enforced in a particular case, application of the Federal Forum Provision means that suits brought by the Post-Combination Company’s shareholders to enforce any duty or liability created by the Securities Act must be brought in federal court and cannot be brought in state court. \n\nSection 27 of the Exchange Act creates exclusive federal jurisdiction over all claims brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or the rules and regulations thereunder and the Parent Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association confirms that the federal district courts of the United States of America will be the exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Exchange Act. Accordingly, actions by the Post-Combination Company’s shareholders to enforce any duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or the rules and regulations thereunder must be brought in federal court. \n\nAny person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring or holding any interest in any of the Post-Combination Company’s securities shall be deemed to have notice of and consented to the Post-Combination Company’s exclusive forum provisions, including the Federal Forum Provision. Additionally, the Post-Combination Company’s shareholders cannot waive compliance with the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder. These provisions may lead to the Post-Combination Company’s shareholders incurring increased costs if they were to bring a claim against the Post-Combination Company, and may limit the Post-Combination Company’s shareholders’ ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum they find favorable for disputes with the Post-Combination Company or the Post-Combination Company’s directors, officers, or other employees or agents, which may discourage lawsuits against the Post-Combination Company and the Post-Combination Company’s directors, officers and other employees and agents. Alternatively, if a court were to find the choice of forum provision contained in the Parent Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, the Post-Combination Company may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which may have an adverse effect on the Post-Combination Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations. \n\nAs a matter of Irish law, the Post-Combination Company’s shareholders are bound by the provisions of the Parent Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association. An Irish court would be expected to recognize the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal district courts of the United States of America in respect of causes of action arising under the Exchange Act or the Securities Act. \n\n**_As an Irish public limited company, certain capital structure decisions regarding the Post-Combination Company will require the approval of the shareholders of the Post-Combination Company, which may limit the Post-Combination Company’s flexibility to manage its capital structure._**\n\nParent is an Irish incorporated public limited company, and following consummation of the Business Combination, certain capital structure decisions regarding the Post-Combination Company will require the approval of the Post-Combination Company’s shareholders, which may limit our flexibility to manage our capital structure. Under Irish law, the directors of a company may only allot and issue “relevant securities” (comprising, subject to certain exceptions, new shares and rights to subscribe for, or convert any security into, new shares) once generally or specifically authorized to do so by its constitution or by a resolution approved by a simple majority of the votes cast at a general meeting of its shareholders at which a quorum is present, referred to under Irish law as an “ordinary resolution.” A general authorization may be granted in respect of up to the entirety of a company’s authorized but unissued share capital and for a maximum period of five years, at which point it must be renewed by another ordinary resolution. The Parent Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of \n\n86 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\nAssociation, which will be adopted shortly prior to the completion of the Business Combination, will authorize the Board to allot and issue new shares and rights to subscribe for, or convert any security into, new shares in the capital of the Post-Combination Company up to the maximum of the Post-Combination Company’s authorized but unissued share capital for a period of five years from the date of adoption. This authorization will need to be renewed by ordinary resolution upon its expiration and at periodic intervals thereafter. While an allotment authority may be given for up to five years at each renewal, governance considerations may result in renewals for shorter periods or in respect of less than the maximum permitted number of relevant securities being sought or approved. Any increase in the Post-Combination Company’s authorized share capital also requires to be approved by an ordinary resolution. \n\nSubject to certain exceptions, Irish law also provides shareholders with statutory preemption rights when “equity securities” (comprising, subject to certain exceptions, new shares, and rights to subscribe for, or convert any securities into, new shares) are issued for cash. However, it is possible for such statutory preemption rights to be generally or specifically disapplied in a company’s constitution or by a resolution approved by not less than 75% of the votes cast at a general meeting of its shareholders at which a quorum is present, referred to under Irish law as a “special resolution.” A general disapplication of pre-emption rights may be given in respect of up to the entirety of a company’s authorized but unissued share capital and for a maximum period of five years, at which point it must be renewed by another special resolution. The Parent Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association, which will be adopted shortly prior to the completion of the Business Combination, will disapply statutory preemption rights up to the maximum of the authorized but unissued share capital for a period of five years from the date of adoption. This disapplication will need to be renewed by special resolution upon its expiration and at periodic intervals thereafter. While a disapplication of statutory preemption rights may be given for up to five years at each renewal, governance considerations may result in renewals for shorter periods or in respect of less than the maximum permitted number of equity securities being sought or approved. \n\n**_Attempted takeovers of Post-Combination Company will be subject to the Irish Takeover Rules and will be under the supervisory jurisdiction of the Irish Takeover Panel._**\n\nThe Post-Combination Company will be subject to the Irish Takeover Rules, which regulate the conduct of takeovers of, and certain other relevant transactions affecting, Irish public limited companies listed on certain stock exchanges, including Nasdaq. The Irish Takeover Rules are administered by the Irish Takeover Panel, which has supervisory jurisdiction over such transactions. Among other matters, the Irish Takeover Rules operate to ensure that no offer is frustrated or unfairly prejudiced and, in situations involving multiple bidders, that there is a level playing field. For example, pursuant to the Irish Takeover Rules, the Board of Directors of Parent will not be permitted, without shareholder approval, to take certain actions which might frustrate an offer for Parent Shares once the Board of Directors of Parent has received an approach that might lead to an offer or has reason to believe that an offer is, or may be, imminent. \n\nUnder the Irish Takeover Rules, if an acquisition of Parent Shares were to increase the aggregate holdings of the acquirer (together with its concert parties) to 30% or more of the voting rights of Parent, such acquirer and, in certain circumstances, its concert parties would be required (except with the consent of the Irish Takeover Panel) to make an offer for the outstanding Parent Shares at a price not less than the highest price paid by such acquirer or its concert parties for Parent Shares during the previous 12 months. This requirement would also be triggered by the acquisition of Parent Shares by any person holding (together with its concert parties) between 30% and 50% of the voting rights of Parent if the effect of such acquisition were to increase that person’s voting rights by 0.05% within a 12-month period. \n\n**_Following consummation of the Business Combination, under the Irish Takeover Rules, a person, or persons acting in concert, who acquire(s), or consolidate(s), control of the Post-Combination Company may be required to make a mandatory cash offer for the remaining shares of the Post-Combination Company._**\n\nUnder the Irish Takeover Rules, in certain circumstances, a person, or persons acting in concert, who acquire(s), or consolidate(s), control of the Post-Combination Company may be required to make a mandatory \n\n87 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\ncash offer for the remaining shares of the Post-Combination Company at a price not less than the highest price paid for the shares by that person or its concert parties during the previous 12 months. Save with the consent of the Irish Takeover Panel, this mandatory offer requirement is triggered: (i) if an acquisition of shares would result in a person or persons acting in concert holding shares representing 30% or more of the voting rights of the Post-Combination Company and (ii) where a person, or persons acting in concert, already hold(s) shares representing 30% or more of the voting rights of the Post-Combination Company, if an acquisition of shares would result in the percentage of the voting rights of the Post-Combination Company held by such person, or persons acting in concert, increasing by more than 0.05% within a 12-month period. In the case of an issuance of new shares, the Irish Takeover Panel will typically waive the mandatory offer requirement in circumstances where the issuance has been approved in advance by simple majority vote given at a general meeting of the independent (i.e., not interested) Post-Combination Company shareholders convened in accordance with the requirements (including as to disclosure) of the Irish Takeover Rules. The mandatory offer requirements do not apply to a single holder, holding shares representing more than 50% of the voting rights of the Post-Combination Company. \n\n**_Anti-takeover provisions in the Parent Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association could make an acquisition of the Post-Combination Company more difficult._**\n\nThe Parent Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association contains provisions that may delay or prevent a change of control, discourage bids at a premium over the market price of the Parent Shares, adversely affect the market price of the Parent Shares, and adversely affect the voting and other rights of shareholders of the Post-Combination Company. These provisions include: (i) permitting the board of directors of the Post-Combination Company to issue preference shares without the approval of the Post-Combination Company’s shareholders, with such rights, preferences and privileges as they may designate; and (ii) allowing the board of directors of the Post-Combination Company to adopt a shareholder rights plan upon such terms and conditions as it deems expedient in the interests of the Post-Combination Company. \n\n**_Irish law requires the Post-Combination Company to have available “distributable profits” to pay dividends to shareholders and generally to make share repurchases and redemptions._**\n\nUnder Irish law, the Post-Combination Company may only pay dividends and make other distributions (and, generally, make share repurchases and redemptions) only out of “distributable profits” shown on its unconsolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with the Irish Companies Act and filed with the Irish Companies Registration Office. Distributable profits are the accumulated realized profits of the Post-Combination Company that have not previously been utilized in a distribution or capitalization less accumulated realized losses that have not previously been written off in a reduction or reorganization of capital, and include reserves created by way of a reduction of capital. In addition, no dividend may be paid or other distribution, share repurchase or redemption made by the Post-Combination Company unless the net assets of the Post-Combination Company are equal to, or exceed, the aggregate of the Post-Combination Company’s called up share capital plus its undistributable reserves and the dividend or other distribution, share repurchase or redemption does not reduce the Post-Combination Company’s net assets below such aggregate. Undistributable reserves include the un-denominated capital, the capital redemption reserve fund, and the amount by which the Post-Combination Company accumulated unrealized profits that have not previously been utilized by any capitalization exceed the Post-Combination Company’s accumulated unrealized losses that have not previously been written off in a reduction or reorganization of capital. \n\nThe Post-Combination Company, as a new parent company with no operational history, will have no distributable profits of its own. Accordingly, in order to pay dividends or make other distributions, share repurchases or redemptions, the Post-Combination Company will need to generate distributable profits from its business activities or otherwise create distributable profits by alternative means, including a reduction of capital. \n\n88 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\n**_Irish law differs from the laws in effect in the United States and may afford less protection to our shareholders._**\n\nThe Post-Combination Company will be an Irish incorporated public limited company. There is some uncertainty as to whether the courts of Ireland would recognize or enforce judgments of U.S. courts obtained against us or our directors or officers based on the civil liabilities provisions of the U.S. federal or state securities laws or hear actions against us or those persons based on those laws. The U.S. and Ireland do not currently have a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments (other than arbitration awards) in civil and commercial matters, and, accordingly, common law rules apply in determining whether a judgment of obtained in a U.S. court is enforceable in Ireland. Although there are processes under Irish law for enforcing a judgment of a U.S. court, including by seeking summary judgment in a new action in Ireland, those processes are subject to certain established principles and conditions, and there can be no assurance that an Irish court would enforce a judgment of a U.S. court in this way and thereby impose civil liberty on us or our directors or officers. \n\nAs an Irish company, the Post-Combination Company will be governed by the Irish Companies Act, which differs in some material respects from laws generally applicable to U.S. corporations and shareholders, including, among others, differences relating to interested director and officer transactions and shareholder lawsuits. Likewise, the duties of directors and officers of an Irish company generally are owed to the company only. Shareholders of Irish companies generally do not have a personal right of action against directors or officers of the company and may exercise such rights of action on behalf of the company only in limited circumstances. Accordingly, holders of our securities may have more difficulty protecting their interests than would holders of securities of a corporation incorporated in a jurisdiction of the U.S. \n\n**Risks related to the business and operations of Parent following the Transaction**\n\n_In this section, unless otherwise noted or the context otherwise requires, “we”, “us”, and “our” refer to the Post-Combination Company following the Business Combination._\n\n**_We are a rapidly growing company with a relatively limited operating history, which may result in increased risks, uncertainties, expenses and difficulties, and it may be difficult to evaluate our future prospects._**\n\nWe have experienced rapid growth in recent years in the markets we serve, including hiring additional employees, running multiple projects concurrently and expanding into new fields, and we plan to continue to expand into new markets. Our limited operating history may make it difficult to make accurate predictions about our future performance. Assessing our business and future prospects may also be difficult because of the risks and difficulties we face. These risks and difficulties include our ability to: \n\n• |  enter into new relationships and maintain existing relationships with clients and business partners;   \n---|---  \n• |  maintain cost-effective access to capital;   \n---|---  \n• |  expand the use and applicability of our technology;   \n---|---  \n• |  successfully build our brand and protect our reputation from negative publicity;   \n---|---  \n• |  successfully adjust our proprietary technology, products and services in a timely manner in response to changing market conditions;   \n---|---  \n• |  successfully compete with companies that are currently in, or may in the future enter, the business of providing traceability solutions;   \n---|---  \n• |  enter into new markets and introduce new products and services based on our technology;   \n---|---  \n• |  comply with and successfully adapt to complex and evolving legal and regulatory environments in our existing markets and ones we may enter in the future;   \n---|---  \n• |  attract, integrate and retain qualified employees and independent contractors; and   \n---|---  \n  \n89 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\n• |  effectively manage, scale and expand the capabilities of our teams, outsourcing relationships, third-party service providers, operating infrastructure and other business operations.   \n---|---  \n  \nIf we are not able to timely and effectively address these risks and difficulties as well as those described elsewhere in this “ _Risk Factors_ ” section, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected. \n\n**_If we fail to effectively manage our growth, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected._**\n\nAs described above, over the last several years, we have experienced rapid growth in our business and number of employees, and we expect to continue to experience growth in the future. This rapid growth has placed, and may continue to place, significant demands on our management, processes, systems and operational, technological and financial resources. Our ability to manage our growth effectively, integrate new employees, independent contractors and technologies into our existing business and attract new business partners and maintain relationships with existing business partners will require us to continue to retain, attract, train, motivate and manage employees and independent contractors and expand our operational, technological and financial infrastructure. Continued growth could strain our ability to develop and improve our operational, technological, financial and management controls, reporting systems and procedures, recruit, train and retain highly skilled personnel and maintain business partners’ and their customers’ satisfaction. \n\nWe may not have sufficient manufacturing capabilities for our markers and readers to satisfy demand for our products, including due to the Eastern-European issues, world politics, Covid-19 related issues, international freight issues, costs of goods and other external financial or political issues. We may be unable to control the availability or cost of producing such products. \n\nOur current manufacturing capabilities may not reach the required production levels necessary in order to meet growing demands for any products we may commission or future products we may develop. There can be no assurance that our commissioned products can be manufactured at the desired commercial quantities, in compliance with our requirements and at an acceptable cost. Any such failure could delay or prevent us from shipping said products and marketing the technologies in accordance with our target growth strategies. \n\nWhile we were able to date to find new employees, when required, Israeli (and other) high-tech employment atmosphere (including due to the post-Covid-19 pandemic and lack of available professionals) is making it harder and harder to find and retain new employees. Thus, risk exists that we will not be able to hire all the employees we seek to hire, in the timeframe required and anticipated, which may slow down our growth, cause increased costs and reduced profits or hinder our ability to duly and timely fulfil all tasks and growth plans. \n\nWe note that due to such employment atmosphere we may need to extend additional resources, including issuance of shares and options, and financial measures in order to create retention plans for key personnel. \n\nPart of our products are in the field of sustainability and circular economy and part of our growth engine is the upcoming world-wide legislation and regulations demanding sustainability and circular economy and carbon-free environment. While we are not relying on such upcoming legislation or regulations, slow legislation or promulgation process and changes in priorities (including due to the Covid-19 epidemic or the Eastern-European issues) may slow our growth. \n\nDue to the fact that we aim our sales efforts at large international market-maker conglomerates, our sales cycle is relatively slow and there is a larger risk that at any time, due to many reasons that are beyond our control, the sales cycle will be broken and all efforts will be lost. \n\nAny of the foregoing factors could negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. \n\n90 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\n**_If the Isorad Licence Agreement is terminated, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be harmed._**\n\nIn January 2015, SMX Israel entered a license agreement with Isorad Ltd (a company wholly owned by the State of Israel with rights to exclusively commercialize the Soreq Nuclear Research Center technology for civilian uses) (“Isorad”) to license the initial technology of tracking and tracing materials by observing and identifying markers (“Source IP”) and commercialize and develop the technology further (“Isorad Licence Agreement”). Under the Isorad Licence Agreement, the Source IP can be utilized in almost any industry and with any product. The Source IP has been the cornerstone for our technological developments. Since entering into the Isorad Licence Agreement, we filed over a hundred additional patent applications worldwide (most of which are irrelated to the Source IP). \n\nSpecifically as to Yahaloma, the royalty rate on gross sales of Yahaloma, to be paid by Yahaloma, are 4.2% (and not 2.2% that applies solely to SMX, its other affiliates and to other sublicensees). Upon the occurrence of an M&A event (as such event is defined in such agreement to include mergers, sale of all or substantially all the assets of Yahaloma and similar event), Isorad is entitled to a fee equal to 1% of the total consideration paid to, received by, or distributed to, Yahaloma and/or its shareholders and/or its affiliates in connection with the event, including, without limitation, all cash, securities or other property which is received by Yahaloma and/or its shareholders in connection with such event of two such events (i.e. twice) at its choice. \n\nThe Isorad License Agreement will continue in full force and effect in perpetuity unless terminated. If either party does not remedy a material breach of its obligations within 180 days of notice of the material breach, the non-defaulting party may terminate the Isorad License Agreement immediately. Isorad may terminate the agreement by providing 30 days prior written notice if the royalties payable to Isorad are nil in any semi-annual report or if we breach other certain obligations (such as a failure to maintain a patent or patent application in the previous semi-annual review period). If the Isorad License Agreement is terminated, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be harmed. \n\n**_If we fail to penetrate the full value chain manufacturing eco-system effectively, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected. _**\n\nValue based pricing may be necessary to enable roll-out across clients, creating challenges in full value capture and effective customer segmentation. Some end-markets (e.g. plastics) require high levels of penetration to support our full value proposition. A broad range of potential end-markets and clients with different value propositions and price sensitivities will require a substantial, high performing, commercial organization. \n\nIn order to maintain continuous growth there is a need to onboard more and more players from different parts of the value chain manufacturing eco-system with the final view of covering all links in the value chain manufacturing eco-system. This may be time and cost consuming and will require funding and personnel and we may not be able to achieve the full value chain penetration due to failure to attain funding or personnel or due to external circumstances, which may hinder our growth. \n\n**_The COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected, and will continue to affect, our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations. _**\n\nThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a widespread health crisis that has adversely affected businesses, economies and financial markets worldwide, placed constraints on the operations of businesses, decreased consumer mobility and activity, and caused significant economic volatility in the United States, Israel, Australia and international capital markets. We have followed guidance issued by the Australian and Israeli governments and the other local governments in territories in which we operate to protect our employees. As such, we have implemented work from home where possible, minimized face-to-face meetings and utilized video conference as much as possible and adhered to social distancing rules at our facilities while eliminating of all \n\n91 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\ninternational travel, which required us to use local representatives to handle presentations and demonstrations for oversees customers. As a result, we have experienced some difficulties in employee ability to efficiently collaborate to meet our customer needs, a difficulty in our efforts to recruit and hire qualified personnel during this time, and have recorded a minor decrease in expected growth in 2020 and 2021, both due to the lockdown and restrictions, and our customers postponing or being hesitant of making future financial, or other, commitments due to the need to put response to the pandemic at the forefront, hesitations that may continue, or reoccur, in the future. \n\nIn addition, and most importantly, the supply chain and international shipment crisis as well as the electronics components shortage crisis, a unique result of the COVID-19 pandemic which affected our market segment, has increased the lead time to obtain and the purchase prices of the component parts required for certain of our products, which has also negatively impacted the delivery time of our products to customers and our revenues and profitability. As long as the COVID-19 pandemic continues, the components’ lead time may be longer than normal and shortage in components may continue or get worse. \n\nWe cannot predict the other future potential, direct or indirect, impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business or operations, and there is no guarantee that any near-term trends in our results of operations will continue, particularly if the COVID-19 pandemic and the adverse consequences thereof worsen. Additional waves of infections, a continuation of the current environment, or any further adverse impacts caused by the COVID-19 pandemic could further impact employment rates, supply chains, priorities and the economy, affecting our customer base and divert customers’ discretionary spend to other uses, including for essential items. These events could impact our cash flows, results of operations and financial conditions and heighten many of the other risks described in this proxy statement/prospectus. \n\n**_Our operations in foreign jurisdictions will subject us to risks associated with operating in those jurisdictions and may adversely affect our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations._**\n\nAs we operate in foreign jurisdictions (such as Israel, Australia, France and Canada), we will be subject to those risks associated with operating in foreign jurisdictions. Such risks may include economic, social or political instability or change, hyperinflation, currency non-convertibility or instability and changes of laws affecting foreign ownership, government participation, taxation, working conditions, rates of exchange, exchange control, licensing, repatriation of income or return of capital, consumer health and safety or labor relations. While the jurisdictions in which we currently operate are economically stable, there is no certainty that political and economic conditions will remain stable. Any deterioration in political or economic conditions, including hostilities or terrorist activity may adversely affect our operations and profitability. There is a risk that the government of any such jurisdiction may change its policies regarding foreign investment, apply new or different taxes and levies, or make any other change which may have an adverse impact on our profitability. \n\nPrior to the Russian-Ukrainian dispute, SMX was cooperating with a Ukrainian entity in parallel with its activities in Israel and European entities for research and development for its readers. SMX was also reviewing potential relationships with entities in Russia, Belarus and Ukraine. As a result of the dispute, SMX put on hold its research and development in Ukraine while continuing its research and development activity in Israel and with European entities and undertook no business relationships with parties in those regions. It is yet unknown what other effects such dispute may have on other jurisdictions, mainly in Europe, and any such effect might affect our business and growth. We cannot predict the other future potential impacts of the dispute on our business or operations, especially if such dispute becomes more than a regional event. These events could impact our cash flows, business, results of operations and financial condition and heighten many of the other risks described in this prospectus. \n\nMoreover, events may occur within or outside the jurisdictions in which we operate that could impact those economies, our operations and the price of the Shares. These events include but are not limited to acts of terrorism, an outbreak of international hostilities, fires, floods, earthquakes, labor strikes, civil wars, natural \n\n92 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\ndisasters, outbreaks of disease or other natural or manmade events or occurrences that can have an adverse effect on the demand for our products and our ability to conduct business. While we seek to maintain insurance in accordance with industry practice to insure against the risks we consider appropriate after consideration of our needs and circumstances, no assurance can be given as to our ability to obtain such insurance coverage in the future at reasonable rates or that any coverage arranged will be adequate and available to cover any and all potential claims. The occurrence of an event that is not covered or fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. \n\n**_If we are unable to successfully identify and integrate acquisitions, our results of operations could be adversely affected._**\n\nAcquisitions may be a significant component of our growth strategy and from time to time we may seek to identify and complete acquisitions. Our future acquisitions may not be successful or may not generate the financial benefits that we expected we would achieve at the time of acquisition. In addition, there can be no assurance that we will be able to locate suitable acquisition candidates in the future or acquire them on acceptable terms or, because of competition in the marketplace. Acquisitions involve special risks, including, without limitation, the potential assumption of unanticipated liabilities and contingencies, difficulty in assimilating the operations and personnel of the acquired businesses, disruption of our existing business, dissipation of our limited management resources and impairment of relationships with employees and customers of the acquired business as a result of changes in ownership. While we believe that strategic acquisitions can improve our competitiveness and profitability, these activities could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. \n\nWe may incur significant costs such as transaction fees, professional service fees and other costs related to future acquisitions. We may also incur integration costs following the completion of any such acquisitions as we integrate the acquired business with the rest of our Company. Although we expect that the realization of efficiencies related to the integration of any acquired businesses will offset the incremental transaction and acquisition-related costs over time, this net financial benefit may not be achieved in the near term, or at all. \n\n**_The industry in which we operate is competitive, and if we fail to compete effectively, we could experience price reductions, reduced margins or loss of revenues._**\n\nGenerally, the track and trace and anti-counterfeit industry in which we operate is subject to global and domestic competition. We are unable to influence or control the conduct of our competitors and such conduct may detrimentally affect our financial and operating performance There are several competitors that operate in the anti-counterfeit and track-and-trace industries and if new competitors enter the market, or established companies develop new products and technologies that are superior to our current technology, our ability to exploit any technological advantage successfully may be affected. We may be unable to develop further products or keep pace with developments and may lose clients to competitors. If our competitors develop a more efficient business model or undertake a more aggressive marketing campaign, this is likely to affect our marketing strategies and results of operations adversely. \n\nThere is no guarantee that customers will adopt our products and we may be unable to compete successfully with more established track and trace and anti-counterfeit companies on price or quality or may be unsuited to the established preferences of potential customers. \n\n**_Our continued growth, including our ability to manage our operations and meet our strategic objectives, depends on retaining our current employees upon whom we are dependent and attracting and retaining qualified personnel, and we may not be able to do so at a rate that will enable us to stand up to our expected growth or cope with specific demands that may arise._**\n\nOur success depends to a large extent upon the skills and experience of our executive officers, management and sales, marketing, operations and scientific staff. We may not be able to attract or retain qualified employees \n\n93 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\ndue to the intense competition for qualified personnel in the technology industry, as well as to geographic considerations, our ability to offer competitive compensation and benefits, and other reasons. \n\nIf we are not able to attract and retain the necessary qualified personnel to manage our operations and accomplish our business objectives, we may experience constraints that will adversely affect our ability to manufacture, sell and market our products or to support research and development programs effectively. \n\nSMX has entered into employment contracts with several of its executives including Haggai Alon, its founder and Chief Executive Officer, and Limor Moshe Lotker, its Chief Financial Officer. Due to the specific knowledge and experience of these executives regarding the industry, technology and market generally and to our company specifically, the loss of the services of any one of these executives could have a material adverse effect on us. We have not obtained a key person insurance policy on any officer. \n\nAlthough our employment agreements contain non-compete clauses, Israeli law does not fully enforce employees’ non-compete obligations and may limit their application, including with regard to duration and scope. \n\nUnder Israeli case law an Israeli Court will usually only enforce non-compete provisions if the employee received specific consideration for it. While all of our employment agreements include specific provisions stipulating that special consideration was paid for the non-compete provision, a risk always exists that a Court will not enforce such. \n\n**_We may not be able to anticipate or adapt to consumer preferences which may have an adverse effect on our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations._**\n\nOur success upon completion of the business combination will depend on our ability to develop and commercialize our technology. A failure to successfully develop and commercialize our technology could lead to a loss of opportunities and adversely impact on our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations. \n\nThe global market for our technology is ever changing due to new technologies, new products, changes in regulations and other factors influencing market acceptance or market rejection of our technologies. This market volatility and risks exists despite our best efforts in relation to market research, promotion and sales efforts. \n\nOur business is dependent on consumer awareness and market acceptance of our products. We may not be able to anticipate and react to trends within the industries we target in a timely manner or accurately assess the impact that such trends may have on consumer preferences. Failure to respond to changes in consumer preferences or anticipate market trends may adversely affect our future revenues and performance. Although we have striven to establish market recognition for our products in the relevant industry, it is too early in the life cycle of our brand to determine whether markers, readers, blockchain technology and any further technology developed by us will achieve and maintain satisfactory levels of acceptance and sustained adoption by manufacturers and consumers. Our technology may not be accepted by the market or used in our proposed markets and industries. We may not be able to commercialize our products, which could adversely impact on business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations. \n\n**_We may not be able to adapt our markers to the needs of any customer or field which may have an adverse effect on our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations._**\n\nResearch and development tailoring costs are required to adapt marker and scanning technology to different materials and industrial/commercial environments, potentially increasing the cost and time to market as we scale across customers and verticals. If we are unable to adapt our markers to the needs of any customer or field due to the costs of doing so, our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. \n\n94 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\n**_We may need in the future to raise additional funds, inter alia, by equity, debt, or convertible debt financings, to support our growth, and those funds may be unavailable on acceptable terms, or at all. As a result, we may be unable to meet our future capital needs, which may limit our ability to grow and jeopardize our ability to continue our business._**\n\nWe plan to continue to make investments to support our growth and may require additional funds to respond to business challenges that may arise, including the need to develop new products and services, enhance our technology, scale and improve our operating infrastructure, or acquire complementary businesses and technologies. Accordingly, we may need to engage in equity, debt or convertible debt financings to secure additional funds. In raising additional funds by the issuance of equity securities or securities convertible into equity securities, our shareholders may experience dilution. Debt financing, such as credit facilities or corporate bonds, may involve covenants restricting our operations or our ability to incur additional debt. Debt financing may also require security arrangements including cash collateral agreements that restrict the availability of cash held as collateral which is the case for amounts we may borrow in the future. In addition, future equity financing or replacement or refinancing of any debt financings may not be available on terms favorable to us, or at all, and the fact that debt holders are repaid first may reduce our ability to raise a later equity financing and may limit the ability to distribute dividends. \n\nIf we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing at terms satisfactory to us when we require it, we may be unable to pursue certain business opportunities, supply proper service to our customers, and our ability to continue to support our business growth and the then current business and to respond to business challenges may be impaired and our business may be harmed. \n\n**_Legal proceedings, investigations or claims against us may be costly and time-consuming to defend and may harm our reputation and damage our business regardless of the outcome. In addition, our business and operations could be negatively affected if they become subject to any securities litigation or shareholder activism, which could cause us to incur significant expense, hinder execution of business and growth strategy and impact our share price._**\n\nWe are currently not aware of any risk of litigation against us, but we may be involved in litigation disputes with third parties including suppliers, customers, employees, former employees and government bodies in the ordinary course of business. The occurrence of a litigation dispute may be costly and impact on our reputation which may have a material adverse effect on our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations. Insurance might not cover such claims, might not provide sufficient payments to cover all the costs to resolve one or more such claims and might not continue to be available at terms acceptable to us. A claim brought against us for which we are uninsured or underinsured could result in unanticipated costs, potentially harming our business, cash flows, financial position and results of operations. \n\nAlthough not a director of that entity, Mr. Alon previously worked as the deputy general manager for business development of an Israeli public company, Plat Technologies International Ltd (“Plat”) which entered insolvency. In early 2017, an ILS 35.9 million shareholders claim was filed by the appointed Court officers at the end of the seven year statute of limitation period against 18 defendants, including Mr. Alon, regarding the collapse of Plat (“Claim”). The insurance policy covering directors and officers responded and are now handling the claim. Mr. Alon denies any wrongdoing and does not consider that he will be required to commit any significant time to the conduct of the Claim and therefore will not constrain his ability to perform his duties and obligations to SMX. The parties agreed to try and amicably resolve the dispute in mediation under which the insurance company agreed to consider taking upon itself any compensation as to the liability of Mr. Alon, if any, in such mediation proceedings. SMX is not a party to the Claim and the Claim does not relate to the business or the affairs of SMX. \n\n**_Our markers may contaminate or spoil the raw material into which our Marker is inserted, which could damage our reputation, subject us to product liability claims and result in a loss of revenue._**\n\nWhile we follow production protocols and conduct quality assurance tests, our markers may contaminate the raw material or certain raw material ingredients may be spoiled, contaminated by chemicals, microorganisms or \n\n95 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\ntoxins, or include foreign materials or substances. The risk of contamination may lead to product recalls or other interventions, which may cause serious damage to our reputation as a marking solution which does not affect the characteristics of the materials or products, or result in product liability claims and loss of revenue. \n\n**_Our markers may include hazardous materials which may put customers, employees and other parties in our supply chain at risk. If any person is harmed by hazardous materials in our markers, our reputation could be damaged and we could be subject to litigation which may adversely affect our business, cash flows, financial position and results of operations._**\n\nThe markers used by us are produced from materials chosen specifically for a specific application. Markers may, in some cases, include low concentrations of materials that may be deemed hazardous materials and the production of the markers by our employees can include dealing with hazardous materials. While manufacturing is conducted according to the material’s Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) and other relevant safety guidelines, a risk of health, even if minimal, may arise. While the hazardous materials are sent to the customers at a low concentration (of the marker), the risk of misuse or error in production may cause damage to our employees or customers, which may affect our expenses and production abilities. While we take safety provisions with respect to the hazardous materials used in our markers, these safety precautions may not be sufficient to prevent harm to our employees or customers from the production of or use of, respectively, our markers. While we are in compliance with the requirements of ISO 9001:2015 standard for quality management and quality assurance as well as safety measures instructed by an external safety engineer, such safety provisions may not be sufficient to prevent human error or other causes of damage. \n\n**_Our readers use x-rays and may be of danger if tampered with or otherwise not used in accordance with the user manual and safety rules. _**\n\nAlthough we supply customers with strict instructions for the use of our readers, and although we take measures to avoid misuse of the readers and minimize the risk of damage from misuse of the readers, users and others may suffer damage from not following such user instructions and may seek legal actions against us, even if such users or others are at fault. \n\n**_We may not be able to procure adequate insurance and any insurance we have or may have may not be of sufficient coverage_**\n\nWe and our subsidiaries seek to maintain appropriate policies of insurance consistent with those customarily carried by organizations in our industry sector, including product insurance, as well as cyber-risk and privacy-risk insurance. Any increase in the cost of insurance policies or the industry in which they operate could adversely affect our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations. Our insurance coverage may also be inadequate to cover losses we may sustain and the insurance company may refuse to provide coverage or demand excessive payment for such coverage. In particular, our insurance does not extend to any potential liability or claims made against us under our agreement with Isorad. Uninsured loss or a loss in excess of our insured limits could adversely affect our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations. \n\n**_Our risk management policies and procedures, and those of our third-party vendors upon which we rely, may not be fully effective in identifying or mitigating risk exposure. If our policies and procedures do not adequately protect us from exposure to these risks, we may incur losses that would adversely affect our financial condition, reputation and market share._**\n\nWe have developed risk management policies and procedures and we continue to refine such as we conduct our business. Our policies and procedures are meant to identify, monitor and manage risks may not be fully effective in mitigating our risk exposure. Further, as we are an R&D company and expand into new fields of business, our risk management policies and procedures may not be able to keep up with our current rapid rate of \n\n96 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\nexpansion adequately, and may not be adequate or sufficient to mitigate risks. Moreover, we are subject to the risks of errors and misconduct, including by our officers, employees and independent contractors, including fraud and non-compliance with policies. These risks are difficult to detect in advance and prevent or avoid, and could harm our business, results of operations or financial condition. Although we seek to maintain insurance and use other traditional risk-shifting tools when possible, such as third-party indemnification, where possible, to manage certain exposures, they are subject to terms such as deductibles, coinsurance, limits and policy exclusions, as well as risk of counterparty denial of coverage, default or insolvency. If our policies and procedures do not adequately protect us from exposure, and our exposure is not adequately covered by insurance or other risk-shifting tools, we may incur losses that would adversely affect our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations. \n\n**Risks Related to Technology, Intellectual Property and Data**\n\n**_We may be unable to, and it may be difficult and costly to, obtain, maintain, protect, or enforce our intellectual property and other proprietary rights sufficiently._**\n\nOur ability to operate our businesses depends, in part, upon our proprietary technology. We may be unable to protect our proprietary technology effectively, which would allow competitors to duplicate our technology and adversely affect our ability to compete with them. \n\nWe have applied for over a hundred patents. While we are not aware of any such patent applications or the technology infringing any third party’s patents, we have not undertaken an exhaustive assessment of existing patents to determine any overlapping technology or potential infringement, and we do not conduct a freedom to operate search or any other exhaustive search of patents that may limit our ability to supply solutions to specific customers or fields, as the costs of such would be prohibitive. Accordingly, there is a risk that a third party may claim that any patent application infringes that third party’s patent. Any event that would jeopardize our proprietary rights or any claims of infringement by third parties could have an adverse effect on our ability to market or exploit our technology. \n\nThere is no guarantee that our proposed patents that are the subject of the patent applications filed by us will provide adequate protection for our intellectual property, or that third parties will not infringe or misappropriate the patents or similar proprietary rights. In addition, there can be no assurance that we will not have to pursue litigation against other parties to assert our rights. There is no guarantee that any of the patents that have been applied for will be granted. If some or all of the patent applications are not granted, our ability to exploit our technology may be materially adversely affected. \n\n**_If third parties claim that we infringe upon or otherwise violate their intellectual property rights, our business could be adversely affected._**\n\nAlthough we are not aware of any infringement on the rights of third parties, we may in the future be subject to claims that we have infringed or otherwise violated third parties’ intellectual property rights. There is patent, copyright, and other intellectual property development and enforcement activity in our industry and relating to the advanced technology we use in our business. Our future success depends in part on not infringing upon or otherwise violating the intellectual property rights of others. From time to time, our competitors or other third parties (including non-practicing entities and patent holding companies) may contend that we are infringing upon or otherwise violating their intellectual property rights, or attack our pending or approved patents, and we may be found to be infringing upon or otherwise violating such rights or otherwise in legal claims regarding patents or other intellectual property rights. We may be unaware of the intellectual property rights of others that may cover some or all of our current or future technology or conflict with our rights, and the patent and other intellectual property rights of others may limit our ability to improve our technology and compete effectively. Any claims of intellectual property infringement or other intellectual property violations, even those without merit, could cause the incurrence of costs and other direct, or indirect, damage to us, including: \n\n• |  be expensive and time consuming to defend;   \n---|---  \n  \n97 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\n• |  cause us to cease making, licensing, or using any of our products that incorporate the challenged intellectual property;   \n---|---  \n• |  require us to modify, redesign, reengineer or rebrand our products, if feasible;   \n---|---  \n• |  damage our reputation;   \n---|---  \n• |  hinder our ability to market or sell our products and services;   \n---|---  \n• |  affect negotiations or executed agreements;   \n---|---  \n• |  cause increase to our insurance policies premium or refusal of insurance companies to insure us;   \n---|---  \n• |  divert management’s attention and resources; or   \n---|---  \n• |  require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements to obtain the right to use a third-party’s intellectual property.   \n---|---  \n  \nAny royalty or licensing agreements, if required, may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. A successful claim of infringement against us could result in our being required to pay significant damages, enter into costly settlement agreements, or prevent us from offering our solutions, any of which could have a negative impact on our operating profits and harm our future prospects. We may also be obligated to indemnify our customers or business partners in connection with any such litigation and to obtain licenses, modify our solutions, or refund fees, which could further exhaust our resources. Such disputes could also disrupt our solutions, adversely affecting our customer satisfaction and ability to attract customers. \n\n**_Under applicable employment laws, we may not be able to enforce covenants not to compete._**\n\nAs part of our employment agreements with our employees we have confidentiality obligations. These agreements generally prohibit our employees, if they cease working for us, from competing directly with us or working for our competitors for a limited period. We may be unable to enforce these agreements under the laws of the jurisdictions in which our employees work and it may be difficult for us to restrict our competitors from benefitting from the expertise our former employees or consultants developed while working for us. For example, Israeli labor Courts have required employers seeking to enforce non-compete undertakings of a former employee to demonstrate that the competitive activities of the former employee will harm one of a limited number of material interests of the employer which have been recognized by the courts, such as the protection of a company’s trade secrets or other proprietary knowhow. \n\n**Risks Related to Our Legal and Regulatory Environment**\n\n**_Litigation, regulatory actions, consumer complaints and compliance issues could subject us to significant fines, penalties, judgments, remediation costs and/or requirements resulting in increased expenses._**\n\nIn the ordinary course of business, we may be named as a defendant in various legal actions, including litigation or regulatory enforcement actions. All such legal actions are inherently unpredictable and, regardless of the merits of the claims, are often expensive, time-consuming, disruptive to our operations and resources, and distracting to management. \n\n**_Changes in laws, regulations and standards and failure to comply with laws, regulations and standards may adversely affect our financial and operating performance and profitability._**\n\nAny changes to the existing regulatory framework or the imposition of new legislation or regulations applicable to any of the industries in which SMX operates may adversely affect the financial and operating performance of SMX. This risk factor applies to government policy and legislative changes in the United States, Australia, Israel, as well as the other jurisdictions in which we currently operate, or will operate in the future, or jurisdictions in which our current or future customers may operate. \n\n98 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\nAdditionally, while we currently do not anticipate this, as the markers used in materials or products are of minuscule quantities, the markers may in the future be required to comply with health and safety laws in certain jurisdictions, and failure to comply with such laws may lead to penalties and other liabilities being imposed on us. In such circumstances, we may be required to suspend production or cease operations, which may lead to a materially adverse effect on our financial performance and profitability. \n\nWhile we are not aware of any regulation or similar restriction that currently materially limits our ability to use our markers, such regulation or similar restriction may in the future limit our ability to sell our products and may require us either to avoid marking certain material or require us to disclose data to certain entities for certification process that may be required in order for us to use our markers. \n\nThe readers use X-range ray technology, which may thus require in certain jurisdictions specific authorization in order to import, manufacture or use such readers. Such authorization process in each such jurisdiction may be time and resources consuming, but may also limit the ability of users to use the readers without proper qualifications, as well as may require, in certain jurisdictions the supervision of such use. \n\n**_Obligations and changes in laws or regulations relating to privacy, cybersecurity, and data protection, or any actual or deemed failure by us to comply with such laws and regulations that could adversely affect our business_**\n\nWe receive, collect, use, disclose, transmit, and store information, including certain sensitive data, relating to our customers and employees. Our collection and processing of such data in our business may subject us to certain state, federal, and international laws and regulations relating to privacy, cybersecurity, and data protection. These laws, rules, and regulations evolve frequently and their scope may continually change through new legislation, amendments to existing legislation, and changes in interpretation or enforcement, and may be inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another. \n\nChanges in laws or regulations relating to privacy, cybersecurity, and data protection, particularly any new or modified laws or regulations that require enhanced protection of certain types of data or new obligations with regard to data retention, transfer, or disclosure, could greatly increase the cost of our operations or prevent us from providing certain services. Complying with these requirements through changing our policies and practices may be onerous and costly. These changes may in turn impair our ability to offer our existing or planned products and services or increase our cost of doing business. Further, we may become subject to privacy and data security laws from jurisdictions outside of our standard business operations in. Despite our efforts to comply with any applicable laws, regulations, and other obligations relating to privacy, cybersecurity, and data protection, it is possible that our interpretations of the law, practices, or our network could be inconsistent with, or fail or be alleged to fail to meet all requirements of, such laws, regulations, or obligations. Our failure, or the failure by our business partners or customers using our services to comply with applicable laws or regulations or any other obligations relating to privacy, cybersecurity, and data protection or any compromise of security that results in unauthorized access to, or use or release of personal information or other data relating to consumers or other individuals, or the perception that any of the foregoing types of failure or compromise has occurred, could damage our reputation, discourage new and existing business partners and customers from working with us, or result in fines, investigations, or proceedings by governmental agencies and private claims and litigation, any of which could adversely affect our business, cash flows, financial condition, and results of operations. Even if not subject to legal challenge, the perception of privacy concerns, whether or not valid, may harm our reputation and brand and adversely affect our business, cash flows, financial condition, and results of operations. \n\nWe invest significant resources in information technology protection and security measures. If these measures are targeted or breached, we may incur significant legal and financial exposure as a result of ransomware, loss of information, and related litigation. Moreover, we hold data of our employees and customers and we invest significant resources in information technology protection and security measures to ensure that such data is safe. If these measures are targeted or breached, we may incur significant reputational damage and related legal and financial exposure. \n\n99 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\n**Risks Related to Our Operations in Israel**\n\n**_Conditions in Israel and relations between Israel and other countries could adversely affect our business._**\n\nCertain of our offices and R&D facilities are located in Israel. Accordingly, political, economic and military conditions in Israel and the surrounding region directly affect our business and operations and could materially and adversely affect our ability to continue to operate from Israel. Since the State of Israel was established in 1948, a number of armed conflicts have occurred between Israel and its Arab neighbors. In the event that our facilities are damaged as a result of hostile action or hostilities otherwise disrupt the ongoing operation of our facilities, our ability to continue our operations could be materially adversely affected. \n\nIn recent years, Israel has been engaged in sporadic armed conflicts with terrorist groups, including those that control the Gaza Strip and other regions close to Israel. In addition, Iran has threatened to attack Israel and may be developing nuclear weapons. Some of these hostilities were accompanied by missiles being fired from the Gaza Strip, Lebanon and Syria against civilian targets in various parts of Israel, including areas in which our employees and independent contractors are located, which negatively affected business conditions in Israel. Any hostilities involving Israel, regional political instability or the interruption or curtailment of trade between Israel and its trading partners could materially and adversely affect our operations and results of operations. \n\nOur commercial insurance does not cover losses that may occur as a result of events associated with war and terrorism. Although the Israeli government currently covers the reinstatement value of property damage and certain direct and indirect damages that are caused by terrorist attacks or acts of war, such coverage would likely be limited, may not be applicable to our business (either due to the geographic location of our offices or the type of business that we operate) and may not reinstate our loss of revenue or economic losses more generally. Furthermore, we cannot assure that this government coverage will be maintained or that it will sufficiently cover our potential damages, or whether such coverage would be timely provided. Any losses or damages incurred by us could have a material adverse effect on our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations. \n\nFurther, in the past, the State of Israel and Israeli companies have been subjected to economic boycotts. Several countries still restrict doing business with Israel and Israeli companies, and additional countries may impose restrictions on doing business with Israel and Israeli companies if hostilities in Israel or political instability in the region continues or increases. These restrictive laws and policies, or significant downturn in the economic or financial condition of Israel, could materially and adversely affect our operations and product development, and could cause our sales to decrease. \n\n**_A large concentration of our staff resides in Israel and many of our employees and independent contractors in Israel are required to perform military reserve duty, which may disrupt their work for us._**\n\nMany of our employees and independent contractors, including certain of our founders and certain members of our management team, operate from our headquarters that are located in central Israel. In addition, a number of our officers and directors are residents of Israel. Accordingly, political, economic and military conditions in Israel and the surrounding region may directly affect our business and operations. \n\nIn addition, many Israeli citizens are obligated to perform several days, and in some cases more, of annual military reserve duty each year until they reach the age of 40 (or older, for reservists who are military officers or who have certain occupations) and, in the event of a military conflict, may be called to active duty. In response to increases in terrorist activity, there have been periods of significant call-ups of military reservists. It is possible that there will be military reserve duty call-ups in the future. Our operations could be disrupted by such call-ups, particularly if such call-ups include the call-up of members of our management, and given the current shortage of talent in Israel due to the recent acceleration of activity in startups, especially in the technology space. Such disruption could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. \n\n100 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\n**Other Risks Associated with the Business of Parent**\n\n**_Lionheart stockholders may not realize a benefit from the Business Combination and any potential Pipe Financing commensurate with the ownership dilution they will experience in connection with the merger and a potential PIPE Financing._**\n\nIf the Post-Combination Company is unable to realize the full benefits currently anticipated from the Business Combination, Lionheart stockholders will have experienced substantial dilution of their ownership interests without receiving any commensurate benefit, or only receiving part of the commensurate benefit to the extent the Post-Combination Company is able to realize only part of the benefits currently anticipated from the Business Combination and any potential PIPE Financing. \n\n101 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\n**CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS**\n\nCertain statements in this proxy statement/prospectus may constitute “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

This proxy statement/prospectus provides Company stockholders with information they need to know to be able to vote or instruct their vote to be cast at the Special Meeting. \n\n**Date, Time and Place of the Special Meeting**\n\nThe Special Meeting will be held at 1:00 p.m. Eastern Time, on January 30, 2023 in virtual format. The Special Meeting can be accessed by visiting https://www.cstproxy.com/lionheartiii/2023, where Company stockholders will be able to listen to the meeting live and vote during the meeting. Additionally, Company stockholders have the option to listen to the Special Meeting by dialing 1 800-450-7155 (toll-free within the U.S. and Canada) or +1 857-999-9155 (outside of the U.S. and Canada, standard rates apply). The passcode for telephone access is 4747463#, but please note that Company stockholders who choose to participate telephonically cannot vote or ask questions. Please note that you will only be able to access the Special Meeting by means of remote communication. \n\n**Voting Power; Record Date**\n\nStockholders will be entitled to vote or direct votes to be cast at the Special Meeting if they owned shares of common stock at the close of business on January 6, 2023, the Record Date for the Special Meeting. Stockholders are entitled to one vote for each share of common stock owned at the close of business on the Record Date. If stockholders’ shares are held in “street name” or are in a margin or similar account, stockholders should contact their broker, bank, or other nominee to ensure that votes related to the shares they beneficially own are properly counted. On the Record Date, there were 16,025,000 shares of common stock outstanding, of which 12,500,000 were Public Shares, 3,125,000 were Founder Shares and 400,000 were Private Shares. \n\n**Purpose of the Special Meeting**\n\nCompany stockholders are being asked to vote on the following: \n\n• |  A proposal to adopt the BCA and the SID and the transactions contemplated thereby. See the section entitled “ _Proposal_ _No. 1_ _—_ _The Business Combination Proposal_.”   \n---|---  \n• |  A proposal to approve the adjournment of the Special Meeting to a later date or dates, if necessary, (A) to ensure that any supplement or amendment to the accompanying proxy statement/prospectus that the Lionheart Board has determined in good faith is required by applicable law to be disclosed to Company stockholders and for such supplement or amendment to be promptly disseminated to Company stockholders prior to the Special Meeting, (B) if, as of the time for which the Special Meeting is originally scheduled, there are insufficient shares of common stock represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct business at the Special Meeting or (C) to permit further solicitation and vote of proxies if there are insufficient votes for, or otherwise in connection with, the approval of the Business Combination Proposal or the Charter Approval Proposal. See the section entitled “ _Proposal No.__2_ _—_ _The Adjournment Proposal_.”   \n---|---  \n  \n**Vote of the Company’s Sponsor, Directors and Officers**\n\nThe Company has entered into a letter agreement with the Sponsor and our directors and officers, pursuant to which, among other things, each such person has agreed to vote all shares of our common stock owned by it, him or her in favor of the Proposals. However, we intend to waive such obligations of the Sponsor, our directors \n\n104 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\nand/or our officers to vote their shares of common stock in favor of the Proposals in respect of any shares purchased by such purchasers in Open Market Purchases. As a result, in addition to the shares of common stock held by the Sponsor and its officers and directors, Lionheart may need only 4,612,501, or 36.9% (assuming all outstanding shares are voted), or approximately 4.85% (assuming only the minimum number of shares representing a quorum are voted), of the Class A Common Stock to be voted in favour of the Business Combination in order to have the Business Combination approved. The Sponsor and our directors and officers have entered into a letter agreement with the Company pursuant to which they agreed to waive their redemption rights in connection with the consummation of the Business Combination with respect to any shares of common stock they may hold. The Underwriters have also agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to the Public Shares held by them, other than Public Shares held directly or indirectly by them on behalf of a third-party client. Such waivers are common in transactions of this sort and the Sponsor and our officers and directors and the Underwriters did not view the waiver as separate from the Business Combination as a whole and did not receive separate consideration for the waiver. The Founder Shares and Private Shares held by the Underwriters, the Sponsor and our directors and officers have no redemption rights upon our liquidation and will be worthless if no business combination is effected by us by February 8, 2023 (or until May 8, 2023 if Lionheart extends the period of time to consummate its initial business combination pursuant to any further Extension Period). However, the Underwriters, the Sponsor and our directors and officers are entitled to redemption rights upon our liquidation with respect to any Public Shares they may own. \n\n**Quorum and Required Vote for Proposals for the Special Meeting**\n\nA majority of the voting power of the common stock entitled to vote at the Special Meeting must be present, in person or represented by proxy at the Special Meeting to constitute a quorum and in order to conduct business at the Special Meeting. Abstentions and broker non-votes will be counted as present for the purpose of determining a quorum. The Underwriters, the Sponsor and our directors and officers, who currently own 22.0% of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock, will count towards this quorum. As of the Record Date for the Special Meeting, 8,012,501 shares of common stock would be required to be present in person or represented by proxy to achieve a quorum. \n\nThe approval of each of the Business Combination Proposal and the Adjournment Proposal, if presented, requires the affirmative vote (in person or by proxy) of the holders of a majority of the shares of Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock entitled to vote and actually cast thereon at the Special Meeting, voting as a single class. Accordingly, a stockholder’s failure to submit a proxy or to vote in person at the Special Meeting, as well as an abstention from voting and a broker non-vote with regard to each of the Business Combination Proposal or the Adjournment Proposal, if presented, will have no effect on such proposals. The Company has entered into a letter agreement with the Sponsor and our directors and officers pursuant to which, among other things, each such person has agreed to vote all shares of our common stock owned by it, him or her in favor of the Proposals. However, we intend to waive such obligations of the Sponsor, our directors and/or our officers to vote their shares of common stock in favor of the Proposals in respect of any shares purchased by such purchasers in Open Market Purchases. \n\nThe approval of the Director Election Proposal requires the affirmative vote (in person or by proxy) of the holders of a plurality of the outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock entitled to vote and actually cast thereon at the Special Meeting, voting as a single class. This means that the director nominees who receive the most affirmative votes will be elected. Stockholders may not cumulate their votes with respect to the election of directors. Accordingly, a stockholder’s failure to submit a proxy or to vote in person at the Special Meeting, as well as a withheld vote and a broker non-vote with regard to election of directors, will have no effect on the election of directors. Notwithstanding the approval of each of the seven director nominees to the Board in the Director Election Proposal, if the Business Combination is not consummated for any reason, the actions contemplated by the Director Election Proposal will not be effected. \n\nConsummation of the Business Combination is conditioned on the approval of the Business Combination Proposal at the Special Meeting, subject to the terms of the BCA and the SID. The Business Combination is not \n\n105 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\nconditioned on the Adjournment Proposal. If the Business Combination Proposal is not approved, the other proposals (except the Adjournment Proposal) will not be presented to the stockholders for a vote. \n\nIt is important for you to note that the consummation of the Business Combination is conditioned on the approval of the Business Combination Proposal at the Special Meeting, subject to the terms of the BCA and the SID. If the Company does not consummate the Business Combination and fails to complete an initial business combination by February 8, 2023 (or until May 8, 2023 if it extends the period of time to consummate its initial business combination pursuant to any further Extension Period), it will be required to dissolve and liquidate the Trust Account by returning the then remaining funds in such account to its Public Stockholders. \n\n**Recommendation of the Lionheart Board**\n\n**The Lionheart Board unanimously determined that the BCA and the SID and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Business Combination, were advisable, fair to, and in the best interests of, the Company and its stockholders. Accordingly, the Lionheart Board unanimously recommends that its stockholders vote “FOR” each of the Business Combination Proposal and the Adjournment Proposal, if presented.**\n\nIn considering the recommendation of the Lionheart Board to vote in favor of approval of the proposals, stockholders should keep in mind that the Sponsor and our directors and officers have interests in such proposals that are different from or in addition to (and which may conflict with) those of Company stockholders generally. Stockholders should take these interests into account in deciding whether to approve the proposals presented at the Special Meeting, including the Business Combination Proposal. See “ _The Business Combination_ _—_ _Interests of the Lionheart’s Directors and Officers in the Business Combination_ ” beginning on page 128. \n\n**Voting Your Shares – Stockholders of Record**\n\nIf your shares are owned directly in your name with our transfer agent, Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, you are considered, with respect to those shares, the “stockholder of record.” If your shares are held in a stock brokerage account or by a bank or other nominee or intermediary, you are considered the beneficial owner of shares held in “street name” and are considered a “non-record (beneficial) stockholder.” \n\nCompany stockholders of record may vote electronically at the Special Meeting or by proxy. The Company recommends that you submit your proxy even if you plan to attend the Special Meeting. If you submit a proxy, you may change your vote by submitting a later dated proxy before the deadline or by voting electronically at the Special Meeting. \n\nIf you are a Company stockholder of record, you may use the enclosed proxy card to tell the persons named as proxies how to vote your shares. If you properly complete, sign and date your proxy card, your shares will be voted in accordance with your instructions. The named proxies will vote all shares at the Special Meeting for which proxies have been properly submitted and not revoked. If you sign and return your proxy card but do not mark your card to tell the proxies how to vote, your shares will be voted “**FOR** ” each of the Proposals. \n\nYour shares will be counted for purposes of determining a quorum if you vote: \n\n• |  by submitting a properly executed proxy card (including via the Internet or by telephone); or   \n---|---  \n• |  electronically at the Special Meeting.   \n---|---  \n  \nAbstentions will be counted for determining whether a quorum is present for the Special Meeting. \n\nVoting instructions are printed on the proxy card you received. \n\n106 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\n**Voting Your Shares — Beneficial Owners**\n\nIf your shares are held in an account at a brokerage firm, bank, or other nominee, then you are the beneficial owner of shares held in “street name” and this proxy statement/prospectus is being sent to you by that broker, bank, or other nominee. The broker, bank, or other nominee holding your account is considered to be the stockholder of record for purposes of voting at the Special Meeting. As a beneficial owner, you have the right to direct your broker, bank, or other nominee regarding how to vote the shares in your account by following the instructions that the broker, bank, or other nominee provides you along with this proxy statement/prospectus. Your broker, bank, or other nominee may have an earlier deadline by which you must provide instructions to it as to how to vote your shares. As a beneficial owner, if you wish to vote at the Special Meeting, you will need to bring to the Special Meeting a legal proxy from your broker, bank, or other nominee authorizing you to vote those shares. That is the only way we can be sure that the broker, bank or nominee has not already voted your shares of common stock. \n\n**Revoking Your Proxy**\n\nIf you are a stockholder of record and you give a proxy, you may revoke it at any time before it is exercised by doing any one of the following: \n\n• |  you may send another proxy card with a later date;   \n---|---  \n• |  you may notify the Company’s Secretary in writing before the Special Meeting that you have revoked your proxy; or   \n---|---  \n• |  you may attend the Special Meeting and vote electronically by visiting and entering the control number found on your proxy card, voting instruction form or notice you previously received. Attendance at the Special Meeting will not, in and of itself, revoke a proxy.   \n---|---  \n  \nIf your shares are held in “street name” or are in a margin or similar account, you should contact your broker for information on how to change or revoke your voting instructions. \n\n**No Additional Matters**\n\n**The Special Meeting has been called only to consider the approval of the Business Combination Proposal and the Adjournment Proposal. Who Can Answer Your Questions About Voting Your Shares.**\n\nIf you are a stockholder and have any questions about how to vote or direct a vote in respect of your shares of common stock, you may contact our proxy solicitor, MacKenzie Partners, Inc.: \n\n1407 Broadway, 27th Floor \n\nNew York, New York 10018 \n\n(212) 929-5500 (Call Collect) \n\nor \n\n**Call Toll-Free (800) 322-2885 **\n\nEmail: \n\nproxy@mackenziepartners.com \n\n**Redemption Rights**\n\nHolders of Public Shares may seek to redeem their shares for cash, regardless of whether they vote for or against, or abstain from voting on, the Business Combination Proposal. Any stockholder holding Public Shares may demand that the Company redeem such shares for a pro rata portion of the Trust Account (which, for illustrative purposes, is anticipated to be approximately $10.20 per share as of January 6, 2023, the Record Date), calculated as of two business days prior to the anticipated consummation of the Business Combination. If a holder properly seeks redemption as described in this section and the Business Combination is consummated, the \n\n107 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\nCompany will redeem these shares for a pro rata portion of funds deposited in the Trust Account and the holder will no longer own these shares following the Business Combination. \n\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, a holder of Public Shares, together with any affiliate of his or any other person with whom he is acting in concert or as a “group” (as defined in Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act), will be restricted from seeking redemption rights with respect to more than 15% of the Public Shares without our prior consent. Accordingly, all Public Shares in excess of 15% held by a Public Stockholder, together with any affiliate of such holder or any other person with whom such holder is acting in concert or as a “group,” will not be redeemed for cash without our prior consent. \n\nThe Underwriters, the Sponsor and our directors and officers will not have redemption rights with respect to the Public Shares held by it, other than, in the case of the Underwriters, Public Shares held directly or indirectly by it on behalf of a third-party client. \n\nThe Public Stockholders may seek to redeem their shares for cash, regardless of whether they vote for or against, or abstain from voting on, the Business Combination Proposal. Holders may demand redemption by delivering their stock, either physically or electronically using Depository Trust Company’s DWAC System, to Continental Stock Transfer and Trust Company, the Company’s transfer agent, no later than the second business day preceding the vote on the Business Combination Proposal. If you hold the shares in street name, you will have to coordinate with your broker to have your shares certificated or delivered electronically. Certificates that have not been tendered (either physically or electronically) in accordance with these procedures will not be redeemed for cash. There is a nominal cost associated with this tendering process and the act of certificating the shares or delivering them through the DWAC system. The transfer agent will typically charge the tendering broker $80.00 and it would be up to the broker whether or not to pass this cost on to the redeeming stockholder. In the event the proposed Business Combination is not consummated this may result in an additional cost to stockholders for the return of their shares. \n\nAny request to redeem such shares, once made, may be withdrawn at any time up to the vote on the Business Combination Proposal. Furthermore, if a holder of a Public Share delivered its certificate in connection with an election of its redemption and subsequently decides prior to the applicable date not to elect to exercise such rights, it may simply request that the transfer agent return the certificate (physically or electronically). \n\nIf the Business Combination is not approved or completed for any reason, then the Public Stockholders who elected to exercise their redemption rights will not be entitled to redeem their shares for a pro rata portion of the Trust Account, as applicable. In such case, the Company will promptly return any shares delivered by Public Stockholders. \n\nThe closing price of the Class A Common Stock on January 6, 2023, the Record Date, was $10.27. The cash held in the Trust Account on such date is anticipated to be approximately $128.9 million ($10.31 per Public Share). Prior to exercising redemption rights, stockholders should verify the market price of the Class A Common Stock as they may receive higher proceeds from the sale of their Class A Common Stock in the public market than from exercising their redemption rights if the market price per share is higher than the redemption price. The Company cannot assure its stockholders that they will be able to sell their shares of common stock in the open market, even if the market price per share is higher than the redemption price stated above, as there may not be sufficient liquidity in its securities when its stockholders wish to sell their shares. \n\nIf a holder of Public Shares exercises its redemption rights, then it will be exchanging its shares of common stock for cash and will no longer own those shares. You will be entitled to receive cash for these shares only if you properly demand redemption no later than the second business day preceding the vote on the Business Combination Proposal by delivering your stock certificate (either physically or electronically) to the Company’s transfer agent prior to the vote at the Special Meeting, and the Business Combination is consummated. \n\n108 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\n**Abstentions and Broker Non-Votes **\n\nAbstentions and broker non-votes will have no effect on the Business Combination Proposal and the Adjournment Proposal. \n\nIn general, if your shares are held in “street” name and you do not instruct your broker, bank, or other nominee on a timely basis on how to vote your shares, your broker, bank, or other nominee, in its sole discretion, may either leave your shares unvoted or vote your shares on routine matters, but not on any non-routine matters. **None of the Proposals are routine matters. As such, without your voting instructions, your brokerage firm cannot vote your shares on any Proposal to be voted on at the Special Meeting.**\n\n**Appraisal or Dissenters’ Rights**\n\nHolders of our Class A Common Stock are not entitled to appraisal rights in connection with the Business Combination under the DGCL. Holders of our Class B Common Stock have appraisal rights in certain circumstances as provided for under the DGCL. \n\n**Proxy Solicitation Costs**\n\nThe Company is soliciting proxies on behalf of the Lionheart Board. This solicitation is being made by mail but also may be made by telephone or in person. The Company and its directors, officers and employees may also solicit proxies in person, by telephone or by other electronic means. The Company will bear the cost of the solicitation. \n\nThe Company has hired MacKenzie Partners, Inc., to assist in the proxy solicitation process. The Company will pay that firm a fee of up to $100,000, under normal circumstances. Such payment will be made from non-trust account funds. \n\nThe Company will ask banks, brokers and other institutions, nominees and fiduciaries to forward the proxy materials to their principals and to obtain their authority to execute proxies and voting instructions. The Company will reimburse them for their reasonable expenses. \n\n**The Initial Stockholders**\n\nAs of January 6, 2023, the Record Date, the Underwriters, the Sponsor, and our directors and officers were entitled to vote an aggregate of 3,125,000 Founder Shares and 400,000 Private Shares. Such shares currently constitute 22.0% of the outstanding shares of common stock. \n\n**Purchases of Shares**\n\nThe Sponsor, the Underwriters, SMX and/or their respective affiliates may purchase shares in privately negotiated transactions or in the open market either prior to or following the completion of the Business Combination, although they are under no obligation to do so. Such a purchase may include a contractual acknowledgement that such stockholder, although still the record holder of our shares is no longer the beneficial owner thereof and therefore agrees not to exercise its redemption rights. In the event shares are purchased in privately negotiated transactions from Public Stockholders who have already elected to exercise their redemption rights, such selling stockholders would be required to revoke their prior elections to redeem their shares. The purposes of such purchases would be to reduce the number of shares of Class A Common Stock that may be redeemed in connection with the Business Combination, and may include a business decision to increase such purchaser’s ownership at an attractive price. In addition, the Sponsor, the Underwriters, SMX, Parent and/or their respective affiliates may make Open Market Purchases, by purchasing shares of Class A Common Stock on the open market prior to the Special Meeting and separate from the redemption process conducted in connection with the Business Combination. The purposes of any Open Market Purchases would be to reduce the number of shares \n\n109 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\nof Class A Common Stock that may be redeemed in connection with the Business Combination, and may include a business decision to increase such purchaser’s ownership at an attractive price. The Sponsor, the Underwriters, SMX, Parent and/or their respective affiliates shall only make Open Market Purchases to the extent the price per Class A Common Stock so acquired is no higher than the redemption price that would be available in connection with the redemption procedures described in this proxy statement/prospectus. In addition, the Sponsor, the Underwriters, SMX, Parent and/or their respective affiliates will waive any redemption rights with respect to any shares of Class A Common Stock purchased in Open Market Purchases and will not vote any shares of Class A Common Stock purchased in Open Market Purchases in favor of the Proposals. While the exact nature of any such arrangements has not been determined as of the date of this proxy statement/prospectus, they might include, without limitation, arrangements to protect such investors or holders against potential loss in value of their shares, including the granting of put options and, with SMX’s consent, the transfer to such investors or holders of shares owned by the Sponsor for nominal value. \n\nEntering into any such arrangements may have a depressive effect on the common stock. For example, as a result of these arrangements, an investor or holder may have the ability to effectively purchase shares at a price lower than market and may therefore be more likely to sell the shares such person owns, either prior to or immediately after the Special Meeting. \n\nIf such transactions are effected, the consequence could be to cause the Business Combination to be approved in circumstances where such approval could not otherwise be obtained. Purchases of shares by the persons described above would allow them to exert more influence over the approval of the Business Combination Proposal and other Proposals and would likely increase the chances that such proposals would be approved. \n\nNo agreements dealing with the above arrangements or purchases have been entered into as of the date of this proxy statement/prospectus by the Sponsor, the Underwriters, SMX or any of their respective affiliates. Other than as described above, neither the Sponsor, the Underwriters, SMX or any of their respective affiliates currently has any intention to enter into any non-redemption combined arrangements with its investors. To the extent that the Sponsor, the Underwriters, SMX or its affiliates do decide to enter into such arrangements, the Company will file a Current Report on Form 8-K and will amend the proxy statement/prospectus, if such arrangements are entered into prior to effectiveness of the Registration Statement or file a proxy supplement, if such arrangements are entered into after effectiveness, to disclose any arrangements entered into or significant purchases made by any of the aforementioned persons that would affect the vote on the Business Combination Proposal or the satisfaction of any closing conditions. Any such report will include descriptions of any arrangements entered into or significant purchases by any of the aforementioned persons, as well as their potential impact to the Post Combination Company and its shareholders. \n\n110 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\n**THE BUSINESS COMBINATION**\n\nThe following is a discussion of the Business Combination and the material terms of the BCA and the SID. You are urged to read the BCA and the SID carefully and in its entirety, a copy of which is attached as Annex A to this proxy statement/prospectus. This summary does not purport to be complete and may not contain all of the information about the BCA and the SID that is important to you. This section is not intended to provide you with any factual information about the Company or SMX. Such information can be found elsewhere in this proxy statement/prospectus. \n\n**The Background of the Business Combination**\n\nThe proposed Business Combination was the result of an extensive search by Lionheart for a potential transaction using the network, investment and operating experience of its management team. With the assistance of the Sponsor, Lionheart explored approximately 30 potential targets as described in further detail in the following paragraphs. The terms of the proposed Business Combination with SMX were the result of extensive negotiations between Lionheart and SMX. The following is a brief description of the background of this process, all related transactions and the proposal of the Business Combination. Note that this description does not purport to describe every conversation among Lionheart, SMX and the other parties that were involved in the business combination search. \n\nLionheart is a blank check company that was formed on January 14, 2021, for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses, which is referred to as its initial business combination. \n\nEntities controlled by Sponsor have also sponsored three additional SPACs: Opes Acquisition Corp. (“Opes”), Lionheart Acquisition Corporation II (“LCAP”) and Lionheart IV Corp (“Lion IV”). Opes consummated its initial public offering in March 2018 and consummated its initial business combination in December 2020 with BurgerFi International, LLC, a leading multi-brand restaurant company that develops, markets and acquires fast-casual and premium-casual dining restaurant concepts around the world, including corporate-owned stores and franchises. LCAP consummated its initial public offering in August 2020 and consummated its initial business combination in May 2022 with MSP Recovery, Inc., a leading healthcare recoveries and data analytics company focusing on the Medicare, Medicaid and commercial insurance spaces. They are disrupting the antiquated healthcare reimbursement system, using data and analytics to identify and recover improper payments made by Medicare, Medicaid, and Commercial Health Insurers. Lion IV initially filed a registration statement with the SEC in March 2021. The registration statement was subsequently withdrawn in June 2022. Past performance by any of such SPAC entities should not be relied on as indicative of the future performance of an investment in Lionheart or the Post-Combination Company. \n\nOn January 27, 2021, the Sponsor purchased an aggregate of 2,875,000 Founder Shares for an aggregate purchase price of $25,000, or approximately $0.009 per share. On November, 3, 2021, Lionheart effected a stock dividend resulting in the Sponsor holding an aggregate of 3,125,000 Founder Shares. \n\nOn November 3, 2021, Lionheart completed its IPO, for which Nomura, Northland Securities, Inc. and Drexel Hamilton, LLC are entitled deferred underwriting commissions in connection with the consummation of Lionheart’s initial business combination. The only arrangements for stockholders to waive their redemption rights were entered into by the SPAC’s Initial Stockholders, officers and directors in connection with the IPO Letter Agreement, dated November 3, 2021. \n\nSimultaneously with the consummation of the IPO, Lionheart completed a private placement of 2,000,000 warrants at a price of $1.00 per Private Warrant and an aggregate of 400,000 Company Private Units to the Sponsor and Nomura at a price of $10.00 per Company Private Unit, consisting of one share of Class A Common Stock and one half of one redeemable warrant to purchase one share of Class A Common Stock at an exercise price of $11.50 per share, generating gross proceeds to Lionheart of $6,000,000. \n\n111 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\nPrior to the consummation of the IPO, neither Lionheart, nor anyone on its behalf, selected any specific target business or initiated any substantive discussions, directly or indirectly, with any target business with respect to a transaction with Lionheart. \n\nFollowing the IPO, Lionheart commenced a search for potential businesses and assets to acquire. Lionheart’s goal was to search for business combination targets in the applied technology sector or alternatively to pursue an acquisition in any business, industry, or sector well positioned to benefit from innovative digital technologies and technology-enhanced services and valued between approximately $200 million and $500 million or more, with a particular focus on businesses based in, or having connections to, the State of Israel. However, Lionheart was not limited by these target characteristics. \n\nIn evaluating potential businesses and assets to acquire, Lionheart, together with Lionheart’s advisory partners and the Sponsor, generally surveyed the landscape of potential acquisition opportunities based on their knowledge of and familiarity with the mergers and acquisitions marketplace. \n\nLionheart focused its search using the general criteria and guidelines identified in the IPO prospectus which it believed would be important in evaluating a prospective target, including, businesses that it believed: \n\n• |  are driving innovation across the technology sector;   \n---|---  \n• |  offer innovative software, hardware, products, operations, or services;   \n---|---  \n• |  have the potential for significant scalability across multiple platforms; and/or   \n---|---  \n• |  are established businesses poised for continued growth with a proper business model demonstrating room for growth and success following a business combination.   \n---|---  \n  \nIn addition, Lionheart focused its search on acquisition targets that it believed would benefit from Lionheart’s operating partners’ expertise, including those of the Sponsor and its affiliates, on a post-closing basis. The foregoing criteria were not exhaustive and evaluations relating to the merits of each potential business combination were based, to the extent relevant, on these general guidelines as well as other considerations, factors and criteria that Lionheart’s management and the Lionheart Board deemed relevant. \n\nDuring the search process, Lionheart conducted an evaluation of numerous potential targets. Lionheart management held meetings with 30 potential targets that were identified from a proprietary database maintained by Lionheart of approximately 130 potential targets and held multiple meetings with 17 of those 30 initial targets. The potential target companies were further narrowed down to 11 targets with which Lionheart entered into non-disclosure agreements, including SMX. The Sponsor and its affiliates were actively involved during this process. Based on assessments of the 11 targets with which Lionheart entered into non-disclosure agreements, including in respect of their product and market fit, growth potential, and management team strength, Lionheart held multiple meetings with six of those potential targets (including SMX) to evaluate the business of these targets further as well as to determine which targets had marketable stories for going public and were properly equipped to enter into a business combination within a reasonable time. Before entering into a non-binding letter of intent with SMX (as described below), Lionheart’s management team actively pursued select potential business combination targets, conducted preliminary due diligence on, had management meetings with, and negotiated preliminary terms of, potential transactions with such potential business combination targets, as further described below. Beginning shortly after the IPO, Lionheart held numerous meetings via teleconference among members of Lionheart’s management team, certain of Lionheart’s advisors, the Sponsor and its affiliates, and in some cases members of the Lionheart Board, in order to discuss matters relating to Lionheart’s initial business combination. Initially, such meetings were intended to allow management and certain of its advisors to provide updates regarding the status of the evaluation of, and outreach to, potential business combination targets. \n\nOf the six targets with which Lionheart held multiple meetings, Lionheart performed financial and operational due diligence on all six potential targets (including SMX). Out of those six potential targets, five proceeded to negotiate a letter of intent with Lionheart, with four (including SMX) signing a non-binding letter of intent. \n\n112 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\nOn February 8, 2022, Lionheart entered into a non-binding letter of intent with its first potential target, a company in the life science sector (“Potential Target A”), with an exclusivity provision in favor of Lionheart that initially expired on March 9, 2022, and was extended several times through and including May 31, 2022. This non-binding letter of intent was terminable by Lionheart (in its sole discretion) at any time if it no longer desired to pursue a potential business combination with Potential Target A. After Lionheart’s management team conducted extensive due diligence on Potential Target A and a go to market effort to gauge the ability to raise a private investment in public equity (“PIPE”) to fund such potential business combination, the Lionheart management team determined that a PIPE on the terms that were then available was not in the best interest of Lionheart and its stockholders. The discussions between Lionheart and Potential Target A were discontinued thereafter. \n\nOn April 8, 2022, Lionheart entered into a non-binding letter of intent with its second potential target, a company in the medical test equipment sector (“Potential Target B”), with an exclusivity provision in favor of Lionheart that expired on May 23, 2022. This non-binding letter of intent was terminable by Lionheart (in its sole discretion) at any time if it no longer desired to pursue a potential business combination with Potential Target B. After Lionheart’s management team conducted extensive due diligence and review of the financial projections of Potential Target B, both Potential Target B and Lionheart decided that Potential Target B would benefit by remaining a private company for some additional time before going public and the letter of intent with Potential Target B was terminated. \n\nOn April 23, 2022, Lionheart entered into a non-binding letter of intent with its third potential target, a company in the international fintech space (“Potential Target C”), with an exclusivity provision in favor of Lionheart that expired six months following the delivery by Potential Target C of PCAOB audited financial statements. This non-binding letter of intent was terminable by Lionheart (in its sole discretion) at any time if it no longer desired to pursue a potential business combination. For several weeks, representatives of Lionheart and Potential Target C engaged in discussions regarding terms for a potential business combination as well as Potential Target C’s business strategy and financial information, as Lionheart and its representatives conducted business and legal due diligence on Potential Target C. The discussions between Lionheart and Potential Target C were discontinued in early June 2022 due to the length of time it was expected to take for Potential Target C to complete its PCAOB audit and the letter of intent was terminated by Potential Target C on June 15, 2022. \n\nWith respect to SMX, on November 17, 2021, representatives of ClearThink Capital LLC (“ClearThink”), financial advisor to SMX, contacted members of the Lionheart management team with the intention of setting up an introductory call with SMX. \n\nOn December 2, 2021, representatives of ClearThink and Mr. Faquiry Diaz, Chief Operating Officer of Lionheart, met via telephonic conference, where ClearThink provided an overview of SMX’s business and explained that ClearThink had been retained by SMX to assist SMX in exploring a suitable merger partner for a business combination transaction. \n\nOn December 9, 2021, an introductory call took place between Mr. Diaz, Mr. Haggai Alon, the Chief Executive Officer of SMX, and a representative of ClearThink. Mr. Alon provided Mr. Diaz with an introductory overview of SMX’s business, which included a detailed review of SMX’s technology. Also on December 9, 2021, Lionheart and SMX entered into a mutual non-disclosure agreement. \n\nOn December 13, 2021, Lionheart was granted access to a virtual data room prepared by SMX so that Lionheart could begin to conduct an evaluation of the SMX business. Beginning in December and continuing until the signing of the BCA, the Lionheart management team and advisors conducted an extensive business and legal due diligence examination of the SMX business. \n\nOn January 26, 2021, ClearThink provided Lionheart with additional due diligence materials regarding SMX and participated in a due diligence call with members of the Lionheart management team. On February 3, \n\n113 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\n2022, representatives of ClearThink and Mr. Ophir Sternberg, the Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Lionheart, Mr. Paul Rapisarda, the Chief Financial Officer of Lionheart, and Mr. Diaz held a meeting at Lionheart’s offices in Miami to discuss SMX’s prospects, strategic relationships and amenability to a transaction. The parties also had preliminary discussions regarding the potential valuation of SMX in the transaction. \n\nOn February 22, 2022, Lionheart delivered an initial non-binding letter of intent to SMX, which included preliminary key terms of and conditions for a potential transaction, subject to the completion of due diligence and the negotiation of definitive agreements. The initial non-binding letter of intent provided for, among other things, a pre-money valuation of SMX of $250.0 million, payable in stock, up to $60.0 million in potential earn-out shares for the shareholders of SMX based on the post-closing company attaining stock prices of $19.00, $22.00 and $25.00 per share, a minimum cash requirement to close the business combination of $40.0 million and $30.0 million of additional investment through private placements. The initial non-binding letter of intent also provided for entry into support agreements, a registration rights agreement and a new management incentive plan, as well as the inclusion of a to be agreed upon board of directors of the post-closing company. The initial non-binding letter of intent included a sixty day exclusivity period in favor of Lionheart. The valuation of SMX included in the initial non-binding letter of intent was primarly based on Lionheart’s view of the potential future value of the SMX technology platform and not on particular financial forecasts or projections. Over the next two weeks, Lionheart, on the one hand, and SMX and its advisors on the other, negotiated the terms of the letter of intent. \n\nOn March 11, 2022, Lionheart entered into a non-binding letter of intent with SMX. The terms of the initial letter of intent were revised to include, among other things, up to $75.0 million in potential earn-out shares for the shareholders of SMX based on the post-closing company attaining stock prices of $16.00, $19.00 and $22.00 per share, the composition of the initial board of directors of the post-closing company and a forty-five day exclusivity period in favor of Lionheart. \n\nThe letter of intent with SMX was amended five times. On May 5, 2022, the parties amended the non-binding letter of intent to extend the exclusivity period to June 9, 2022. On May 17, 2022, the parties amended the non-binding letter of intent to eliminate the minimum cash condition required to close the proposed business combination in order to provide the parties with flexibility to address potential redemptions by Lionheart stockholders and changes in the PIPE market. On June 9, 2022, the parties amended the non-binding letter of intent to extend the exclusivity period to July 8, 2022. On June 23, 2022, the parties amended the non-binding letter of intent to reduce the pre-money valuation of SMX from $250.0 million to $200.0 million as a result of changes in the U.S. capital markets and the attendant valuations that were being supported for both technology and pre-revenue companies, to remove the $75.0 million in potential earn-out shares for the shareholders of SMX as a result of changes in the U.S. capital markets in recent de-SPAC transactions and the potential overhang that such earnout shares would cause, add $50.0 million in incentive compensation to Lionheart’s existing stockholders to incentivize the non-redemption of such stockholders shares as a result of increases in redemptions seen in recent de-SPAC transactions, remove the $30.0 million private placement, as a result of a decision of the parties to address a potential PIPE after the public announcement of the proposed business combination, and add that the management incentive plan include an initial funding of 15% of total outstanding shares with a 5% evergreen provision. The parties subsequently decided not to include the non-redemption incentives in the definitive transaction agreements and to address any potential non-redemption incentives at a future date. On July 7, 2022, the parties amended the non-binding letter of intent to extend the exclusivity period to August 8, 2022. We intend to inform the Public Shareholders of any non-redemption incentives prior to the special meeting by circulating an amended proxy statement/prospectus once it is confirmed. \n\nFollowing the signing of the letter of intent on March 11, 2022 and throughout the month of April and the first part of the month of May, the parties continued to engage in due diligence regarding SMX, its technology and prospects, and prepare an investor presentation for potential PIPE investors. \n\n114 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\nBeginning in early May 2022 and continuing through the end of that month, representatives of Lionheart, SMX, ClearThink and other advisors met or held discussions with potential investors and placement agents to explore a possible PIPE transaction in connection with the proposed business combination. After discussions with several potential investors and placement agents, Lionheart and SMX determined to address a potential PIPE after the public announcement of the proposed business combination, due primarily to the parties’ belief that they would be more successful in marketing a possible PIPE transaction at such time. Prior to the signing of the definitive transaction agreements, representatives of SMX continued to have discussions with one potential strategic partner regarding a PIPE transaction, but no agreement was reached. \n\nOn May 22 and 23, 2022, members of the management teams of Lionheart and SMX, as well as representatives of DLA Piper LLP, U.S., Australian and Irish counsel to Lionheart (“DLA Piper”), K&L Gates LLP, U.S. and Australian counsel to SMX (“K&L”), Arthur Cox, Irish counsel to SMX (“AC”), and Afik & Co., Israeli counsel to SMX (“Afik”), met to discuss the proposed structure for the Business Combination, which proposed structure is materially consistent with the final structure contained in the BCA and the SID. \n\nOn May 24, 2022, K&L provided an initial draft of the SID to Lionheart and DLA Piper, which initial draft had been prepared to broadly demonstrate how the proposed business combination would be structured from an Australian perspective. \n\nOn June 11, 2022, DLA Piper provided an initial draft of the BCA to SMX and K&L. The BCA was structured to incorporate many substantive terms from the SID given Australian requirements that such terms be contained in the SID itself. \n\nFrom June 13, 2022 to June 15, 2022, members of the Lionheart management team met with members of the SMX management team at SMX’s offices in Israel. While in Israel, Lionheart conducted extensive due diligence on SMX, including reviewing product demonstrations and meeting with members of SMX’s board of directors and advisory board. \n\nOn June 17, 2022, DLA Piper provided a revised draft of the SID to SMX and K&L, which included, among other things, a break fee provision. \n\nOn June 22, 2022, K&L provided revised drafts of the BCA and the SID to Lionheart and DLA Piper. The revised BCA included, among other things, revisions to the appraisal rights, expenses, tax treatment, closing conditions and termination provisions, as well as included representations and warranties of Merger Sub. The revised SID included, among other things, revisions to the option treatment, tax treatment and break fee provisions. \n\nOn June 23, 2022, the Lionheart Board held a special meeting to discuss the proposed business combination, at which members of the Lionheart management team and representatives of DLA Piper were present. At the meeting, members of the Lionheart management team provided the Lionheart Board with background on the proposed business combination, including the due diligence conducted to date, and representatives of DLA Piper reviewed the legal structure for the proposed business combination. In addition, Mr. Alon joined the meeting and provided the Lionheart Board with a detailed overview of SMX, its background and technology. At the conclusion of the meeting, the Lionheart Board instructed Lionheart management to continue to negotiate the terms of the proposed business combination with SMX and to engage an independent advisor to provide a fairness opinion to the Lionheart Board if the transaction were to move forward. \n\nOn June 24, 2022, Lionheart engaged Scura Partners as an independent advisor to provide the Lionheart Board with an opinion as to the fairness to Lionheart of the consideration to be paid in the Business Combination. Following its engagement, representatives of Scura Partners participated in various meetings with representatives of Lionheart and SMX in connection with the fairness opinion to be rendered by Scura Partners. For more information, see — _Opinion of Scura Partners LLC, the Lionheart Board Financial Advisor._\n\n115 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\nOn June 29, 2022, DLA Piper provided revised drafts of the BCA and the SID to SMX and K&L. The revised BCA included, among other things, revisions to the appraisal rights, representations and warranties, covenants and closing conditions provisions. The revised SID included, among other things, revisions to the option scheme, employment, exclusivity and break fee provisions. From this date through the signing of definitive transaction documents on July 26, 2022, DLA Piper and K&L, together with AC, Afik and Lionheart’s Israeli counsel, exchanged drafts of the BCA, the SID and the related ancillary documents to be entered into or agreed upon in connection with the transaction, including the Registration Rights Agreement, Lock-up Agreement and A&R Sponsor Agreement, initial drafts of which were provided by DLA Piper on July 15, 2022, and the Voting Agreement, an initial draft of which was provided by DLA Piper on July 18, 2022, and engaged in negotiations regarding the terms of the BCA, the SID and such other ancillary transaction documents. \n\nOn July 1, 2022, Lionheart engaged EF Hutton, a division of Benchmark Investments, LLC (“EF Hutton”), as its financial and capital markets advisor in connection with the Business Combination. Following its engagement, EF Hutton began to conduct due diligence on SMX in order to, among other things, assist the Company and SMX with preparing an investor presentation to describe the Business Combination and potentially marketing a PIPE and continued to engage with both the management teams of both Lionheart and SMX to prepare such presentation and related investor materials. \n\nOn July 15, 2022, the Lionheart Board held a special meeting to discuss the proposed business combination, at which members of the Lionheart management team and representatives of DLA Piper were present. At the meeting, members of the Lionheart management team provided the Lionheart Board with an update on the status of the negotiations and terms of the transaction. Representatives of DLA Piper described in detail for the Lionheart Board the legal structure for the proposed business combination and the various aspects of U.S., Australian and Irish law that were implicated by such structure, including the necessary approvals in each such jurisdiction. Representatives of DLA Piper also reviewed the then-current terms of the BCA, SID and related transaction documents and the results of DLA Piper’s due diligence review to date, including a discussion of due diligence that remained to be concluded. In addition, representatives of DLA Piper reviewed with the Lionheart Board their fiduciary duties in the context of a transaction of this nature. During the meeting, the Board engaged in a lengthy discussion of the potential benefits, risks and uncertainties of the proposed business combination. At the conclusion of the meeting, the Lionheart Board instructed the Lionheart management team and its advisors on certain negotiation points of the BCA, SID and related documents and directed them to continue to move forward with negotiating the potential transaction on the terms described. \n\nOn July 21, 2022, the Lionheart Board held a special meeting to discuss the proposed business combination, at which members of the Lionheart management team and representatives of EF Hutton, Scura Partners and DLA Piper were present. At the meeting, members of the Lionheart management team provided the Lionheart Board with an update on the status of the negotiations and terms of the transaction. Representatives of Scura Partners reviewed for the Lionheart Board the various financial methodologies used by Scura Partners in their analysis of the financial fairness of the proposed business combination. Representatives of EF Hutton reviewed for the Lionheart Board certain financial and strategic aspects of the proposed business combination, including a review of the sectors in which SMX operates and how SMX could be positioned in the U.S. public markets. Representatives of EF Hutton also discussed the current PIPE market and what financing may be available to the combined company. Representatives of DLA Piper updated the Lionheart Board on the then-current status of the transaction documentation and due diligence and developments on each since the previous meeting of the Lionheart Board. During the meeting, the Board again engaged in a lengthy discussion of the potential benefits, risks and uncertainties of the proposed business combination. At the conclusion of the meeting, the Lionheart Board unanimously expressed the view that the proposed business combination was in the best interests of Lionheart and its stockholders and directed Lionheart management and its advisors to move forward with negotiating the final aspects of the transaction on the terms described to the Lionheart Board and to seek to finalize transaction terms as promptly as practicable. \n\nOn July 24, 2022, the Lionheart Board held a special meeting to consider the proposed business combination and the entry into the BCA and SID, at which members of the Lionheart management team and \n\n116 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\nrepresentatives of Scura Partners and DLA Piper were present. At the meeting, members of the Lionheart management team provided the Lionheart Board with an update on the status of the final negotiations and terms of the proposed business combination. Representatives of Scura Partners reviewed with the Lionheart Board Scura Partners’ financial analysis summarized below under “— _Opinion of Scura Partners LLC, the Lionheart Board Financial Advisor_ ” and delivered to the Lionheart Board an oral opinion, subsequently confirmed by delivery of a written opinion dated as of July 24, 2022, that, as of that date and based upon and subject to the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered, and qualifications and limitations on the scope of review set forth in such opinion, (i) the consideration in the Business Combination is fair from a financial point of view to Lionheart and (ii) the fair market value of SMX equals or exceeds 80% of the amount held by Lionheart in trust for benefit of its public stockholders (excluding any deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on interest earned on the trust account). Representatives of DLA Piper reviewed the fiduciary duties of the directors in connection with their evaluation of the potential business combination and summarized the proposed final terms of the BCA, SID and related transaction documents. After considering the proposed terms of the BCA, SID and related transaction documents and the presentations of Scura Partners and DLA Piper, and taking into consideration the matters discussed during that meeting and prior meetings of the Lionheart Board, including the anticipated benefits and the potential risks and uncertainties related to the proposed business combination, the Lionheart Board unanimously determined that BCA, SID and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Business Combination and the Merger, are advisable and fair to and in the best interests of Lionheart and its stockholders, and the Lionheart Board unanimously approved and adopted the BCA, SID and the transactions contemplated thereby and determined to recommend that Lionheart stockholders approve the Business Combination. \n\nThe parties executed the BCA and SID early in the morning, U.S. time, on July 26, 2022, and Lionheart and SMX issued joint press releases in the U.S. and Australia announcing the parties’ entrance into the agreements. Also on July 26, 2022, Lionheart filed with the SEC a Current Report on Form 8-K describing the BCA and the SID and furnishing an investor presentation regarding the Business Combination, and SMX made corresponding filings with its regulator in Australia. \n\nOn January 8, 2023, the Company, SMX and Parent entered into the Deed of Variation to implement certain amendments to the SID that were requested by ASIC in connection with ASIC’s required review of the transaction, including changes to the definitions of “Lionheart Material Adverse Effect” and “SMX Material Adverse Effect”. All other terms of the SID remain unchanged. \n\n**Fairness Opinion of Scura Partners**\n\nLionheart retained Scura Partners to evaluate the fairness, from a financial point of view to the Company’s Shareholders of the merger consideration to be paid to such holders in the Transaction. \n\nOn July 24th, 2022 at a meeting of the Lionheart Board held to evaluate the SID and BCA, Scura Partners rendered to the Lionheart Board an oral opinion, which was confirmed by delivery of a written opinion dated July 24, 2022, to the effect that, as of that date and based on and subject to the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and qualifications and limitations on the review undertaken described in such opinion, (i) the consideration in the SID and BCA is fair from a financial point of view to the Company and (ii) the fair market value of SMX equals or exceeds 80% of the amount held by the Company in trust for benefit of its public stockholders (excluding any deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on interest earned on the trust account). \n\nThe full text of Scura Partners’ written opinion, dated July 24, 2022, which describes the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered, and qualifications and limitations on the review undertaken, is attached as Annex H and is incorporated by reference in this document. **The written opinion of Scura Partners, dated July 24, 2022 is set forth in Annex H. Scura Partners’ opinion was for the benefit of the Lionheart Board (in its capacity as such) and Scura Partners’ opinion was rendered to the Lionheart Board in connection with its evaluation of the SID and BCA and did not address any terms or other aspects (other than the consideration to the extent**\n\n117 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\n**expressly specified in Scura Partners’ opinion) of the transaction contemplated by the SID and BCA. Scura Partners’ opinion did not address Lionheart’s underlying business decision to effect such transaction or the relative merits of such transaction as compared to any alternative business strategies or transactions that might be available to Lionheart and did not address any legal, regulatory, tax, or accounting matters. Scura Partners’** **opinion is not intended to and does not constitute a recommendation to any Lionheart stockholder as to how** **such stockholder should vote or act with respect to the transaction or any matter relating thereto.** **Additionally, the opinion of Scura Partners was limited to the fairness, from a financial point of view to the Company, of the aggregate consideration to be paid pursuant to the SID and the BCA. Scura Partners did not express an opinion as to the fairness of the Transaction or any aspect or implication thereof to, or any other consideration of or relating to, the holders of any class of securities, creditors, or other constituencies of Empatan, the Company or SMX.**\n\nWith respect to the bullets listed below and in connection with rendering its opinion, although Scura Partners considered internal information provided to it with respect to the business, earnings, cash flow, assets, liabilities and prospects of SMX and discussions conducted with the management and representatives of SMX, Scura Partners created its own financial models that served as the basis for its analysis set forth below and the opinion it rendered to Lionheart’s board of directors. \n\nIn connection with its opinion, Scura Partners: \n\n• |  reviewed certain internal information relating to the business, earnings, cash flow, assets, liabilities and prospects of SMX furnished to Scura Partners by the Company, including financial and other forecasts provided to, or discussed with us by the management of the Company and the management of SMX;   \n---|---  \n• |  reviewed certain internal information relating to expenses expected to result from the transaction contemplated by the SID and BCA furnished to us by the Company;   \n---|---  \n• |  conducted discussions with members of the management and representatives of the Company and of SMX concerning the information described in the two foregoing bullet points;   \n---|---  \n• |  reviewed the Company’s and SMX’ capital structure furnished to us by the management of the Company both on a standalone basis pre-transaction and on a pro forma basis giving effect to the transaction contemplated by the SID and BCA;   \n---|---  \n• |  reviewed publicly available financial and stock market data of certain other companies in lines of business that Scura Partners deemed relevant;   \n---|---  \n• |  reviewed a draft, dated July 24, 2022, of the BCA; and   \n---|---  \n• |  conducted such other financial studies and analyses and took into account such other information as Scura Partners deemed appropriate.   \n---|---  \n  \nScura Partners, with Lionheart’s consent, relied upon the information supplied to, discussed with or reviewed by Scura Partners for purposes of its opinion as being complete and accurate in all material respects. Scura Partners did not assume any responsibility for independent verification of, and did not independently verify, any of such information. \n\nWith Lionheart’s consent, Scura Partners relied upon, without independent verification, the assessment of the Company and its legal, tax, regulatory and accounting advisors with respect to legal, tax, regulatory and accounting matters. In addition, Scura Partners relied upon, with Lionheart’s consent, the assessments of the management of the Company as to the existing technology, products and services of SMX and the validity of, and risks associated with, the future technology, products and services of SMX. Scura Partners assumed, with Lionheart’s consent, that there will be no developments with respect to any of the foregoing that would affect Scura Partners’ analyses or opinion. With Lionheart’s consent, Scura Partners assumed that (i) for purposes of Scura Partners’ analysis and to calculate the Company’s pro forma enterprise value, the Company will have cash, net of debt, of between $24.6 million and $135.8 million on its balance sheet at the consummation of the transaction contemplated by the SID and BCA, and (ii) any adjustments to the consideration in accordance with \n\n118 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\nthe BCA or otherwise would not be material to Scura Partners’ analysis or its opinion. In addition, Scura Partners relied upon, with Lionheart’s consent, the assessments of the management of the Company as to the Company’s ability to retain key employees of SMX. Scura Partners expressed no views as to the reasonableness of any financial or other forecasts or the assumptions on which they are based. In addition, with Lionheart’s consent, Scura Partners did not make any independent evaluation or appraisal of any of the assets or liabilities (contingent, derivative, off-balance-sheet, or otherwise) of SMX or the Company, nor had Scura Partners been furnished with any such evaluation or appraisal. \n\nFurther, Scura Partners’ opinion was necessarily based on economic, monetary, market and other conditions as in effect on, and the information made available to Scura Partners as of the date of its opinion. Scura Partners assumed no responsibility for updating its opinion based on developments after the date of its opinion. As stated above, Scura Partners’ opinion did not address the underlying business decision to effect the transactions contemplated by the SID and BCA or the relative merits of the same as compared to any alternative business strategies or transactions that might be available to the Company and does not address any legal, regulatory, tax, or accounting matters. \n\nWith Lionheart’s consent, Scura Partners did not opine on what the value of the shares of the Parent would be when issued pursuant to the transactions contemplated by the SID and BCA. Scura Partners did not express any opinion as to fair value or the solvency of SMX, the Parent or the Company following the closing of the transactions contemplated by the SID and BCA. In rendering its opinion, Scura Partners assumed, with Lionheart’s consent, that the final executed form of the BCA would not differ in any material respect from the draft that Scura Partners reviewed, that the transaction contemplated by the SID and BCA, including a possible PIPE Financing, will be consummated in accordance with its terms without any waiver or modification that could be material to Scura Partners’ analysis, and that the parties to the BCA will comply with all the material terms of the BCA. Scura Partners assumed, with Lionheart’s consent, that all governmental, regulatory, or other consents and approvals necessary for the completion of the transaction contemplated by the SID and BCA will be obtained except to the extent that could not be material to Scura Partners’ analysis. In addition, representatives of the Company advised Scura Partners, and Scura Partners assumed, with Lionheart’s consent, that the transaction contemplated by the SID and BCA will qualify as a tax free reorganization for income tax purposes in the United States, Australia, and Ireland. \n\n**_Summary of the Financial Analyses of Scura Partners_**\n\nIn preparing its opinion to the Lionheart Board, Scura Partners performed a variety of financial and comparative analyses and, for purposes of its opinion, used only those financial models that Scura Partners created. The summary set forth below does not purport to be a complete description of the financial analyses performed or factors considered by, and underlying Scura Partners’ opinion, nor does the order of the financial analyses described represent the relative importance or weight given to those financial analyses. The preparation of a financial opinion or analysis is a complex process involving various determinations as to the most appropriate and relevant methods of financial analysis and the application of those methods to the particular circumstances and, therefore, a financial opinion or analysis is not readily susceptible to summary description. In arriving at its opinion, Scura Partners considered the results of all of the analyses undertaken by it and assessed as a whole and did not draw, in isolation, conclusions from or with regard to any particular factor or method of analysis considered by it. Rather, Scura Partners made its determination as to fairness on the basis of its experience and professional judgment after considering the results of all of the analyses. Accordingly, Scura Partners believes that its analyses and factors summarized below must be considered as a whole and in context. Scura Partners further believes that selecting portions of its analyses and factors or focusing on information presented in tabular format, without considering all analyses and factors or the narrative description of the analyses and factors, could create a misleading or incomplete view of the processes underlying its analyses and opinion. \n\nIn performing its analyses, Scura Partners considered industry performance, general business, economic, market and financial conditions and other matters, existing as of the date of its opinion, many of which are \n\n119 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\nbeyond the control of Lionheart and SMX. No company, business or transaction reviewed is identical or directly comparable to Lionheart, SMX or their respective businesses or the transaction. Accordingly, an evaluation of these analyses is not entirely mathematical. Rather, the analyses involve complex considerations and judgments concerning business, financial and operating characteristics and other factors that could affect the public trading, acquisition or other values of the companies, businesses or transactions reviewed or views regarding the comparability of such companies, businesses or transactions. Accordingly, such analyses may not necessarily include all companies, businesses or transactions that could be deemed relevant. The estimates of the future performance of Lionheart and SMX in or underlying Scura Partners’ analyses and the ranges of valuations resulting from any particular analysis are not necessarily indicative of actual values or predictive of future results or values, which may be significantly more or less favorable than those estimates or those suggested by the analyses. In addition, analyses relating to the value of businesses or securities do not purport to be appraisals or to reflect the prices at which a company may actually be sold or the prices at which any securities have traded or may trade at any time in the future. Accordingly, the assumptions and estimates used in, and the ranges of valuations resulting from, any particular analysis described below are inherently subject to substantial uncertainty and should not be taken as the views of Scura Partners regarding the actual values of SMX or Lionheart. Except as otherwise noted, the following quantitative information, to the extent that it is based on market data, is based on market data as it existed on or before July 24, 2022, and is not necessarily indicative of current market conditions. \n\nScura Partners did not recommend that any specific consideration constituted the only appropriate consideration in the transaction. The type and amount of consideration payable in the transaction contemplated by the SID and BCA was determined through negotiations between Lionheart and SMX, rather than by any financial advisor, and was approved by the Lionheart Board. The decision to enter into the SID and BCA was solely that of the Lionheart Board and the SMX board of directors. Scura Partners’ opinion and analyses were only one of many factors considered by the Lionheart Board in its evaluation of the transaction and the consideration and should not be viewed as determinative of the views of the Lionheart Board or management with respect to the transaction or the consideration payable in the transaction. \n\n**_Financial Analysis_**\n\n**The summary of the financial analyses described in this section entitled “-****_Financial Analyses_****” is a summary of the material financial analyses provided by Scura Partners in connection with its opinion, dated July 24, 2022, to the Lionheart Board. The summary set forth below is not a comprehensive description of all analyses undertaken by Scura Partners in connection with its opinion, nor does the order of the analyses in the summary below indicate that any analysis was given greater weight than any other analysis. The financial analyses summarized below include information presented in tabular format. In order to fully understand Scura Partners’ financial analyses, the tables must be read together with the text of each summary. The tables alone do not constitute a complete description of the financial analyses performed by Scura Partners. Considering the data set forth in the tables below without considering the full narrative description of the financial analyses, including the methodologies and assumptions underlying the analyses, could create a misleading or incomplete view of the financial analyses performed by Scura Partners. Future results may differ from those described and such differences may be material.**\n\nFor purposes of the financial analyses described below in this section, the term “implied per share consideration” means approximately $10.00 per share of Lionheart common stock. \n\nThe financial data utilized for Lionheart in the financial analyses described below were based on, among other things: (i) certain internal information relating to the business, earnings, cash flow, assets, liabilities and prospects of SMX furnished to Scura Partners by the Company, including financial and other forecasts provided to, or discussed with Scura Partners by the management of the Company and the management of SMX; (ii) certain internal information relating to expenses expected to result from the Transaction furnished to Scura Partners by the Company; (iii) the Company’s and SMX’ capital structure furnished to us by the management of \n\n120 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\nthe Company both on a standalone basis pre-Transaction and on a pro forma basis giving effect to the Transaction; (iv) publicly available financial and stock market data of certain other companies in lines of business that Scura Partners deemed relevant; and (v) such other financial studies and analyses and such other information as Scura Partners deemed appropriate. \n\n**_Lionheart Financial Analyses_**\n\n_Comparable Public Companies Analysis_\n\nUsing public filings and other publicly available information, Scura Partners compared certain financial information of Lionheart to corresponding financial information for selected publicly traded companies that, based on Scura Partners’ professional judgment and experience, Scura Partners considered generally relevant for purposes of analysis. While the business of SMX is novel, it was Scura Partners’ belief that aspects to it were comparable to aspects of the supply chain solutions, tracking and marketing and industrial internet of things (“Industrial IoT”) industries. Scura then used a series of screens on Capital IQ to identify companies in those industries with publicly available information. That list is set out below. No companies were excluded, although forward estimates for revenue and EBITDA were not available for all companies. Scura Partners included companies in the supply chain solutions and Industrial IoT industries. Scura Partners did not include companies in the marking and tracking industries due to the lack of forecasts over the relevant period. The selected supply chain solution companies used in this analysis were as follows: Coupa Software Incorporated, The Descartes Systems Group Inc. Kinaxis Inc., SPS Commerce, Inc. and WiseTech Global Limited. The Industrial IoT companies used in this analysis were as follows: Impinj, Inc., PTC Inc., Samsara Inc., Tomra Systems ASA and Trimble Inc. These companies were identified in a presentation to the Lionheart Board of Directors on July 24, 2022. \n\nScura Partners selected the companies above because, among other things, the selected companies operate businesses similar in certain respects to the business of SMX. \n\nAs set forth in the table below, for each selected supply chain solutions company, Scura Partners calculated its enterprise value (defined as equity market value, plus debt, capitalized lease liabilities, preferred stock and minority interests, less cash and cash equivalents) as a multiple of its revenue for companies (reporting in U.S. GAAP) for fiscal year ends 2025, 2026 and 2027 (“Enterprise Value / 2025 Revenue”, “Enterprise Value / 2026 Revenue”, and “Enterprise Value / 2027 Revenue”). \n\nThe mean Enterprise Value / 2025 Revenue, Enterprise Value / 2026 Revenue, and Enterprise Value / 2027 Revenue multiples observed for the supply chain solutions peers were 7.8x, 6.3x and 4.6x, respectively. \n\n**(U.S. dollars in millions)**\n\n**EnterpriseValue** | **EnterpriseValue /Revenue2025** | **Revenue2025** | **EnterpriseValue /Revenue2026** | **Revenue2026** | **EnterpriseValue /Revenue2027** | **Revenue2027**  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \nCoupa Software Incorporated | $ | 6,099 | 4.9x | $ | 1,234 | 3.9x | $ | 1,576 | 3.2x | $ | 1,885  \nKinaxis Inc. | $ | 3,060 | 5.0x | $ | 607 | 4.4x | $ | 701 | 3.8x | $ | 813  \nThe Descartes Systems Group Inc. | $ | 5,455 | 8.5x | $ | 639 | 7.6x | $ | 721 | 6.7x | $ | 810  \nWiseTech Global Limited | $ | 9,830 | 12.8x | $ | 768 | 9.4x | $ | 1,044 | —   \n  \nExpected revenue was not available for SPS Commerce, Inc. for those periods. \n\nAs set forth in the table below, for each selected company, Scura Partners calculated its enterprise value (defined as equity market value, plus debt, capitalized lease liabilities, preferred stock and minority interests, less cash and cash equivalents) as a multiple of its EBITDA (defined as estimated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, and adjusted for lease expenses (excluding short-term and variable expenses) for companies reporting in U.S. GAAP) for fiscal year ends 2025, 2026 and 2027 (“Enterprise Value / 2025 EBITDA”, “Enterprise Value / 2026 EBITDA”, and “Enterprise Value / 2027 EBITDA”). \n\n121 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\nThe mean Enterprise Value / 2025 EBITDA, Enterprise Value / 2026 EBITDA, and Enterprise Value / 2027 EBITDA multiples observed for the supply chain solutions peers were 30.5x, 16.1x and 14.7x, respectively. \n\n**(U.S. dollars in millions)**\n\n**EnterpriseValue** | **EnterpriseValue /EBITDA2025** | **EBITDA2025** | **EnterpriseValue /EBITDA2025** | **EBITDA2026** | **EnterpriseValue /EBITDA2027** | **EBITDA2027**  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \nCoupa Software Incorporated | $ | 6,099 | 49.6x | $ | 123 | —  | —  | —  | —   \nThe Descartes Systems Group Inc. | $ | 5,455 | 19.4x | $ | 281 | 16.9x | $ | 322 | 14.7x | $ | 372  \nWiseTech Global Limited | $ | 9,830 | 22.5x | $ | 436 | 15.4x | $ | 640 | —  | —   \n  \nExpected EBITDA was not available for Kinaxis Inc and SPS Commerce, Inc. for those periods. \n\nAs set forth in the table below, for each selected Industrial IoT company, Scura Partners also calculated its enterprise value (defined as equity market value, plus debt, lease liabilities, preferred stock and minority interests, less cash and cash equivalents) as a multiple of its revenue. \n\nThe mean Enterprise Value / 2025 Revenue, Enterprise Value / 2026 Revenue, and Enterprise Value / 2027 Revenue multiples observed for the supply chain solutions peers were 5.1x, 5.5x and 5.0x. \n\n**EnterpriseValue** | **EnterpriseValue /Revenue2025** | **Revenue2025** | **EnterpriseValue /Revenue2025** | **Revenue2025** | **EnterpriseValue /Revenue2025** | **Revenue2027**  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \nTrimble Inc. | $ | 16,293 | 3.5x | $ | 4,640 | —  | —   \nPTC Inc. | $ | 13,748 | 5.3x | $ | 2,603 | 5.5x | $ | 2,503 | 4.97x | $ | 2,769  \nSamsara Inc. | $ | 6,566 | 6.6x | $ | 997 | —  | —   \n  \nExpected revenue was not available for Impinj, Inc and Tomra Systems ASA for those periods. \n\nAs set forth in the table below, for each selected company, Scura Partners calculated for Industrial IoT companies Enterprise Value / 2025 EBITDA, Enterprise Value / 2026 EBITDA, and Enterprise Value / 2027 EBITDA. Expected EBITDA was available only for PTC Inc. for those periods. \n\n**EnterpriseValue** | **EnterpriseValue /EBITDA2025** | **EBITDA2025** | **EnterpriseValue /EBITDA2025** | **EBITDA2026** | **EnterpriseValue /EBITDA2027** | **EBITDA2027**  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \nPTC Inc. | $ | 13,748 | 16.3x | $ | 844 | 14.8x | $ | 929 | 13.1x | $ | 1,050  \n  \nUsing its professional judgment and experience, Scura Partners applied a range of multiples of estimated EV/Revenue, derived from the EV/Revenue multiples of the selected supply chain solution companies resulting in a range of implied equity value of SMX common stock of $534 million to $1,876 million. Using its professional judgment and experience, Scura Partners applied a range of multiples of estimated EV/Revenue, derived from the EV/Revenue multiples of the selected industrial IoT chain solution companies resulting in a range of implied equity value of SMX common stock of $602 million to $1,623 million. Using its professional judgment and experience, Scura Partners applied a range of multiples of estimated EV/EBITDA, derived from the EV/EBITDA multiples of the selected industrial IoT chain solution companies resulting a range of implied equity value of SMX common stock of $374 million to $857 million. Using its professional judgment and experience, Scura Partners applied a range of multiples of estimated EV/EBITDA, derived from the EV/EBITDA multiples of the selected industrial IoT chain solution companies resulting in a range of implied equity value of SMX common stock of $267 million to $640 million. \n\n122 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\n_Equity Market Capitalization_\n\nScura Partners reviewed the the trading price and volume for SMX on the Australian Securities Exchange over the last two years along with the related news and regulatory filings. Scura Partners believed, based on its experience and professional judgment, that this information did not accurately reflect the value of SMX and therefore was not relevant for purposes of this analysis. \n\n_Precedent Transactions Analysis_\n\nScura Partners did not identify transactions involving companies with publicly available financial information that Scura Partners believed, based on its experience and professional judgment, to be generally relevant for purposes of this analysis. \n\n_Discounted Cash Flow Analysis_\n\nScura Partners performed a discounted cash flow (“DCF”) analysis of SMX using a financial forecast that Scura Partners developed with the guidance of Lionheart’s management and other information and data provided by the Lionheart’s management to calculate the estimated present value of the future unlevered after-tax free cash flows projected to be generated by SMX. Based on the information provided by the Company’s management, with the consent of the Board, Scura Partners assumed that the Business Combination would close on or about December 31st 2022. Scura Partners performed DCF analyses for two sets of periods (i) the term of January 1, 2022 through FY2027 and (ii) the period from FY2028 forward. \n\nIn performing the DCF analysis of SMX, Scura Partners utilized a range of discount rates between 13.4% and 17.4%. A mid-range discount rate of 15.4% was calculated based on an estimate of SMX’ weighted average cost of capital (“WACC”), arrived at using the capital asset pricing model, incorporating: \n\n(i) |  an unlevered beta of 1.02x based on the unlevered beta of comparable companies;   \n---|---  \n(ii) |  a risk-free rate of return of 3.43% based on the yield on the 20-year U.S. treasury bond as of June 4, 2021;   \n---|---  \n(iii) |  a market return (Rm) of 8.92% based on the 20 year average return on the S&P 500 index.;   \n---|---  \n(iv) |  a size premium of between 2% and 4% estimated based on the market return premium assigned to businesses (public companies) with an enterprise value between $200 million and $1.0 billion;   \n---|---  \n(v) |  the assumption that SMX’ capital structure would be funded with equity through the end of each set of periods.   \n---|---  \n  \nThe assumption that a portion of the capital structure would be funded by debt would have led to a lower WACC and a higher DCF net present value for SMX. Such a change would not have affected Scura Partners’ opinion. Scura Partners estimated the range of discount rates using the mid-range discount rate and based on its experience and professional judgement. \n\nIn performing the DCF analysis of SMX, Scura Partners applied multiples of between 20.0x and 30.0x (the “Terminal Value Multiples”) to FY2027 EBITDA, representing the value of SMX derived for the period from FY2028 forward (the “Terminal Value”). Scura Partners derived a mid-range Terminal Value Multiple of 24.9x based on historical EBITDA trading multiples for selected publicly traded companies. Based on its experience and professional judgement, Scura Partners estimated a range of Terminal Value Multiples using the mid-range terminal value multiple. \n\nIn performing the DCF analysis of SMX, Scura Partners utilized Company management’s estimated cash tax rate for SMX of 12.5%. \n\n123 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\nAfter-tax free cash flows from each period in each set were discounted to December 31, 2022 using the mid-period convention. Terminal Value for each set were discounted from the end of the relevant fiscal year to December 31, 2022. \n\nUsing an assumption of cash and cash equivalents of $4 million, the Discounted Cash Flow Analysis indicated the following implied total equity value for SMX: \n\n_(USD millions)_\n\n**Weighted Average Cost of Capital**  \n---  \n13.7 | %  | 14.7 | %  | 15.7 | %  | 16.7 | %  | 17.7 | %   \n**Equity Value** | 676 | 647 | 619 | 592 | 567  \n**EBITDA Exit Multiple**  \n**20.0x** | **22.5x** | **25.0x** | **27.5x** | **30.0x**  \n**Equity Value** | 498 | 558 | 619 | 679 | 740  \n**Size Premium**  \n**2.0%** | **2.5%** | **3.0%** | **3.5%** | **4.0%**  \n**Equity Value** | 647 | 632 | 619 | 605 | 592  \n  \nThe discounted Terminal Value represents approximately 98.4% of SMX’s equity value, assuming the mid-range WACC and Terminal Value Multiple. \n\n**_General_**\n\nIn connection with Scura Partners’ services as a financial advisor to the Lionheart Board, Lionheart agreed to pay Scura Partners an aggregate fee of $200,000. In addition, Lionheart has agreed to reimburse certain of Scura Partners’ expenses arising, and to indemnify Scura Partners against certain liabilities that may arise, out of Scura Partners’ engagement. \n\nScura Partners, as part of its investment banking business, is continually engaged in the valuation of businesses and their securities in connection with mergers and acquisitions, negotiated underwritings, secondary distributions of listed and unlisted securities, private placements, leveraged buyouts, and valuations for estate, corporate and other purposes. In the two-year period prior to the date of Scura Partners’ opinion, Scura Partners has not provided any investment banking services to Lionheart. In the two-year period prior to the date of Scura Partners’ opinion, Scura Partners has not been engaged to provide financial advisory or other services to Lionheart or SMX and Scura Partners has not received any compensation from Lionheart or SMX during this period. In addition, in the ordinary course, Scura Partners’ employees may trade securities of Lionheart, SMX and certain of their respective affiliates for their own accounts and, accordingly, may at any time hold a long or short position in such securities. The issuance of Scura Partners’ opinion was approved by the Opinion Committee of Scura Partners. \n\nScura Partners is an internationally recognized investment banking firm providing a full range of financial advisory and other services. Scura Partners was selected to act as investment banker to Lionheart because of its qualifications, expertise and reputation in investment banking and mergers and acquisitions generally and in particular, as an advisor to companies in Lionheart’s sector, as well as its familiarity with the business of Lionheart. \n\nScura Partners’ engagement and its written opinion are for the benefit of the Lionheart Board (in its capacity as such) and its written opinion was rendered to the Lionheart Board in connection with its evaluation of the transaction. Scura Partners’ opinion is not intended to and does not constitute a recommendation to any Lionheart stockholder as to how such stockholder should vote or act with respect to the transaction or any matter relating thereto. \n\n124 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\n**Lionheart’s Board of Directors’ Reasons for the Approval of the Business Combination**\n\nIn reaching its unanimous resolution (i) determining that the BCA, the SID and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Business Combination and the issuance of shares in connection therewith, are fair and advisable to, and in the best interests of, the Company and its stockholders and (ii) recommending that Company stockholders adopt the BCA and the SID and approve the Business Combination and the other transactions contemplated by the BCA and the SID, the Lionheart Board consulted with the Company’s legal and financial advisors in connection with its evaluation of the BCA, the SID and the Business Combination, reviewed the results of due diligence conducted by the Company’s management, together with its legal and financial advisors and considered a range of factors, including, but not limited to, the factors discussed below. In light of the large number and wide variety of factors considered in connection with its evaluation of the Business Combination, the Lionheart Board did not consider it practicable to, and did not attempt to, quantify or otherwise assign relative weights to the specific factors that it considered in reaching its determination and supporting its decision. The Lionheart Board viewed its decision as being based on all of the information available and the factors presented to and considered by it. In addition, individual directors may have given different weight to different factors. \n\nThe officers and directors of Lionheart have substantial experience with mergers and acquisitions and in evaluating the operating and financial merits of companies from a wide range of industries and concluded that their experience and backgrounds enabled them to make the necessary analyses and determinations regarding the Business Combination with SMX. In analyzing the Business Combination, the Lionheart Board conducted due diligence on the Company and researched the industry in which it operates and concluded that the Business Combination was in the best interest of stockholders. \n\nIn the prospectus for the IPO, the Company identified general criteria and guidelines that the Company believed would be important in evaluating prospective target businesses. The Company indicated its intention to acquire companies that it believes possess the following characteristics: \n\n• |  consider reasonably accepted valuation standards and methodologies to seek businesses, as determined in the sole discretion of the Company’s officers and directors.   \n---|---  \n• |  businesses that have generated attractive unit economics at scale, have established and growing revenue streams. The Company did not expect to acquire startup companies, companies with speculative business plans or companies that are excessively leveraged.   \n---|---  \n• |  businesses that have a leading, growing or unique niche market position in their respective sectors. The Company expected to analyze the strengths and weaknesses of target businesses relative to their competitors and seek to invest in one or more businesses that demonstrate advantages when compared to their competitors, including capable management team, defensible proprietary technology, strong adoption rates and relevant domain expertise.   \n---|---  \n• |  businesses that have experienced management teams or those that provide a platform to assemble an effective and capable management team. The Company expected to focus on management teams with a track record of driving revenue growth and creating value for their stockholders.   \n---|---  \n• |  businesses that will benefit from being publicly listed and can effectively utilize the broader access to capital and the public profile to grow and accelerate shareholder value creation.   \n---|---  \n• |  companies that have a leading or niche market position and that demonstrate advantages when compared to their competitors, which may help to create barriers to entry against new competitors.   \n---|---  \n• |  businesses that have historically generated, or has the near-term potential to generate, strong and sustainable free cash flow.   \n---|---  \n  \nIn considering the Business Combination, the Lionheart Board considered a number of factors pertaining to the Business Combination as generally supporting its decision to enter into the BCA, the SID and the transactions \n\n125 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\ncontemplated thereby, including, but not limited to, the following factors (not necessarily in order of relative importance): \n\n• |  **Reasonableness of the aggregate consideration to be paid to the Stockholders under the BCA and the SID**. Following a review of the financial data provided to the Company, including certain unaudited financial information and models regarding SMX (including, where applicable, the assumptions underlying such unaudited financial information and models) and the Company’s due diligence review of SMX’s business, the Lionheart Board determined that the consideration to be paid to the SMX shareholders was reasonable in light of such data and financial information. In this context “reasonable” means (i) given the uniqueness of the SMX business model, that the work done by the third party due diligence advisors supported the “reasonableness” of the assumptions used to validate the business model, (ii) that the variables considered by the Lionheart Board in relation to the financial analysis for the SMX business were a reasonable basis to compute the valuation, and (iii) given the inherent uncertainties in any long-term projections, particularly in a business like SMX’s where there is limited historical financial information to extrapolate.   \n---|---  \n• |  **Due Diligence.** The Company’s management and advisors conducted due diligence examinations of SMX, including: commercial, financial, legal and regulatory due diligence, and extensive discussions with SMX’s management and the Company’s management and legal advisors concerning such due diligence examinations of SMX.   \n---|---  \n• |  **Industry and Trends.** SMX’s business is based in a blockchain and technology industry focused on supply chain integrity , and that the Lionheart Board considers attractive, and which, following a review of industry trends and other industry factors (including, among other things, historic and projected market growth), the Lionheart Board believes has continued growth potential in future periods.   \n---|---  \n• |  **Opportunity to introduce an attractive asset class to public investors that has historically been transacted in non-US public market settings.** The Company’s belief that recent transactions involving SPACs indicate a market trend to bring companies with novel business models and innovative asset classes to the US public markets.   \n---|---  \n• |  **Negotiated Transaction.** The Lionheart Board considered the terms and conditions of the BCA, the SID and the related agreements and the transactions contemplated thereby, each party’s representations, warranties and covenants, the conditions to each party’s obligation to consummate the Business Combination and the termination provisions, as well as the strong commitment by both the Company and SMX to complete the Business Combination. The Lionheart Board also considered the financial and other terms of the Business Combination and the fact that such terms and conditions are reasonable and were the product of arm’s length negotiations between SMX and the Company.   \n---|---  \n• |  **Other Alternatives.** After a review of other business combination opportunities reasonably available to the Company, the Lionheart Board believes that the proposed Business Combination represents the best potential business combination reasonably available to the Company taking into consideration, among other things, the timing and likelihood of accomplishing the goals of any alternatives.   \n---|---  \n• |  **Post-Closing Governance**. The fact that the Sponsor had negotiated the right to nominate three members of the Board following the Business Combination, which the Lionheart Board believes will allow for the Post-Combination Company to benefit from the Sponsor’s professional relationships to identify potential board members that will have appropriate industry and/or financial knowledge and professional experience to oversee the Post-Combination Company and drive returns for stockholders.   \n---|---  \n• |  **Limitations of Review**. The Lionheart Board considered what they were presented and did obtain a fairness opinion from Scura Partners. The opinion confirmed that (i) the consideration is in the Transactions is fair from a financial point of view to the Company, (ii) the fair market value of SMX equals or exceeds 80% of the amount held by the Company in trust for the benefit of its public stockholders (excluding any deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on interest earned on the trust account) and (iii) the Transaction is fair to all of Lionheart Stockholders and SMX Shareholders, collectively as a group, as opposed to shareholders that are unaffiliated with the Sponsor and its affiliates.   \n---|---  \n  \n126 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\nThe Lionheart Board also considered various uncertainties and risks and other potentially negative factors concerning the Business Combination, including, but not limited to, the following: \n\n• |  **Benefits May Not Be Achieved**. The potential benefits of the Business Combination may not be fully achieved or may not be achieved within the expected timeframe.   \n---|---  \n• |  **Regulation**. The risk that changes in the regulatory and legislative landscape or new industry developments may adversely affect the projected financial results and the other business benefits anticipated to result from the Business Combination.   \n---|---  \n• |  **Stockholder Vote.** The Company’s stockholders may fail to approve the proposals necessary to effect the Business Combination.   \n---|---  \n• |  **Closing Conditions**. The completion of the Business Combination is conditioned on the satisfaction of certain closing conditions that are not within the Company’s control, including the receipt of certain required regulatory approvals.   \n---|---  \n• |  **Litigation Related to the Business Combination.** The possibility of litigation challenging the Business Combination or that an adverse judgment granting permanent injunctive relief could indefinitely enjoin consummation of the Business Combination.   \n---|---  \n• |  **Listing Risks.** The challenges associated with preparing SMX, for the applicable disclosure and listing requirements to which SMX will be subject as a publicly traded company.   \n---|---  \n• |  **Market Volatility** : The possibility that the SPAC market experiences volatility and disruptions, causing deal disruption.   \n---|---  \n• |  **Liquidation**. The risks and costs to the Company if the Business Combination is not completed, including the risk of diverting management focus and resources from other business combination opportunities, which could result in the Company being unable to effect an initial business combination by February 8, 2023 (or until May 8, 2023 if the Company extends the period of time to consummate its initial business combination pursuant to any further Extension Period).   \n---|---  \n• |  **Fees and Expenses**. The fees and expenses associated with completing the Business Combination. In addition, the Lionheart Board considered the fact that the Underwriters have contingent fees owing to it upon the successful completion of the Business Combination, consisting of deferred underwriting fees of approximately $4,375,000.   \n---|---  \n  \nIn addition to considering the factors described above, the Lionheart Board also considered other factors, including, without limitation: \n\n• |  **Interests of Certain Persons.** The Sponsor, our officers and certain of our directors may have interests in the Business Combination (see “— _Interests of Lionheart’s Directors and Officers in the Business Combination_ ”).   \n---|---  \n• |  **Other Risk Factors.** Various other risk factors associated with the business of SMX, as described in the section entitled “ _Risk Factors_ ” appearing elsewhere in this proxy statement/prospectus.   \n---|---  \n• |  **Fairness Opinion**. Scura Partners LLC provided its Fairness Opinion to the Lionheart Board that, subject to the assumptions, qualifications, limitations and other matters set forth in the opinion, (i) the consideration in the Transactions is fair from a financial point of view to the Company and (ii) the fair market value of SMX equals or exceeds 80% of the amount held by the Company in trust for benefit of its public stockholders (excluding any deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on interest earned on the trust account). Additionally, the opinion of Scura Partners was limited to the fairness, from a financial point of view to the Company, of the aggregate consideration to be paid pursuant to the SID and the BCA. Scura Partners did not express an opinion as to the fairness of the Transaction or any aspect or implication thereof to, or any other consideration of or relating to, the holders of any class of securities, creditors, or other constituencies of Empatan, the Company or SMX.   \n---|---  \n  \n127 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\nThe Lionheart Board concluded, in its business judgment, that the potential benefits that it expects the Company and its stockholders to achieve as a result of the Business Combination outweigh the potentially negative and other factors associated with the Business Combination. Accordingly, the Lionheart Board unanimously determined that the Business Combination and the transactions contemplated by the BCA and the SID are fair and advisable to, and in the best interests of, the Company and its stockholders. \n\n**Satisfaction of 80% Test**\n\nThe Nasdaq rules require that the Company’s initial business combination must occur with one or more operating businesses or assets with a fair market value equal to at least 80% of the net assets held in the Trust Account (net of amounts disbursed to management for working capital purposes and excluding the amount of any deferred underwriting discount held in the Trust Account) at the time of the Company’s signing a definitive agreement in connection with its initial business combination. As of July 26, 2022, the date of the execution of the BCA and the SID, the value of the net assets held in the Trust Account was approximately $126,250,000 (excluding approximately $4,375,000 of deferred underwriting discount held in the Trust Account) and 80% thereof represents approximately $101,000,000. In reaching its conclusion that the Business Combination meets the 80% asset test, the Lionheart Board used as a fair market value the enterprise value of approximately $244,400,000, which was implied based on the terms of the transactions agreed to by the parties in negotiating the BCA and the SID. The enterprise value consists of an implied equity value of approximately $360,300,000. In determining whether the enterprise value described above represents the fair market value of SMX, the Lionheart Board considered all of the factors described in this section, including review of the Fairness Opinion, and the section of this proxy statement/prospectus entitled “ _The Business Combination Agreement and Scheme Implementation Deed_ ” and the fact that the purchase price for SMX was the result of an arm’s length negotiation. As a result, the Lionheart Board concluded that the fair market value of the business acquired was significantly in excess of 80% of the net assets held in the Trust Account (net of amounts disbursed to management for working capital purposes and excluding the amount of any deferred underwriting discount held in the Trust Account). \n\n**Interests of Lionheart’s Directors and Officers in the Business Combination**\n\nThe Sponsor and our directors and officers have interests in the Business Combination that are different from or in addition to (and which may conflict with) your interests. You should take these interests into account in deciding whether to approve the Proposals. As a result of such interests, the Sponsor and our directors and officers may be incentivized to complete a business combination with a less favorable combination partner or on terms less favorable to public stockholders rather than fail to complete a business combination by February 8, 2023 (or until May 8, 2023 if we extend the period of time to consummate our initial business combination pursuant to any further Extension Period) (or such later date as may be approved by the Company’s stockholders) and be forced to liquidate and dissolve the Company. These interests include: \n\n• |  the fact that our Initial Stockholders have agreed not to redeem any of the Founder Shares in connection with a stockholder vote to approve the proposed Business Combination;   \n---|---  \n• |  the fact that Ophir Sternberg, Roger Meltzer and Thomas Hawkins will serve as directors of the Post-Combination Company. Ophir Sternberg, Roger Meltzer and Thomas Hawkins are affiliated with the Company. Ophir Sternberg currently serves as the Company’s Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer and Roger Meltzer and Thomas Hawkins currently serve as directors of the Company;   \n---|---  \n• |  the fact that the Sponsor paid an aggregate of $25,000 for 2,875,000 Founder Shares in January 2021, resulting in the Sponsor holding an aggregate of 2,875,000 Founder Shares. Without giving effect to the sales or transfer of Founder Shares to Nomura and in connection with the IPO to certain insiders, the remaining 3,125,000 Founder Shares will have a significantly higher value at the time of the Business Combination, which if unrestricted and freely tradable would be valued at approximately $31,125,000 but, given the restrictions on such shares, we believe such shares have less value. In addition, given the differential in the purchase price that our Sponsor paid for the Founder Shares as compared to the price of the units sold in the IPO and the substantial number of shares of Class A   \n---|---  \n  \n128 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\nCommon Stock that our Sponsor will receive upon conversion of the Founder Shares in connection with the Business Combination, our Sponsor and its affiliates may earn a positive rate of return on their investment even if the common stock of the combined company trades below the price initially paid for the units in the IPO and the Public Stockholders experience a negative rate of return following the completion of the Business Combination;   \n---  \n• |  the fact that our Initial Stockholders have agreed to waive their rights to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account with respect to their Founder Shares if we fail to complete an initial business combination by February 8, 2023 (or until May 8, 2023 if we extend the period of time to consummate our initial business combination pursuant to any further Extension Period) (or such later date as may be approved by the Company’s stockholders);   \n---|---  \n• |  the fact that the Sponsor paid an aggregate of $2,000,000 for 2,000,000 Company Private Warrants to purchase shares of Class A Common Stock and such Company Private Warrants will expire worthless if a business combination is not consummated by February 8, 2023 (or until May 8, 2023 if we extend the period of time to consummate our initial business combination pursuant to any further Extension Period);   \n---|---  \n• |  the fact that the Sponsor paid an aggregate of $2,750,000 for Company Private Units comprised of 275,000 shares of Class A Common Stock and 137,500 Company Private Warrants to purchase shares of Class A Common Stock and that such Company Private Warrants will expire worthless if a business combination is not consummated by February 8, 2023 (or until May 8, 2023 if we extend the period of time to consummate our initial business combination pursuant to any further Extension Period);   \n---|---  \n• |  the continued right of the Sponsor to hold Class A Common Stock and the shares of Class A Common Stock to be issued to the Sponsor upon exercise of its Company Private Warrants following the Business Combination, subject to certain lock-up periods;   \n---|---  \n• |  if the Trust Account is liquidated, including in the event we are unable to complete an initial business combination within the required time period, the Sponsor has agreed to indemnify us to ensure that the proceeds in the Trust Account are not reduced below $10.10 per Public Share, or such lesser per Company Public Share amount as is in the Trust Account on the liquidation date, by the claims of prospective target businesses with which we have entered into an acquisition agreement or claims of any third party (other than our independent public accountants) for services rendered or products sold to us, but only if such a vendor or target business has not executed a waiver of any and all rights to seek access to the Trust Account;   \n---|---  \n• |  the Sponsor (including its representatives and affiliates) and the Company directors and officers, are, or may in the future become, affiliated with entities that are engaged in a similar business to the Company. For example, each of the Company’s officers may be considered an affiliate of the Sponsor, which is a blank check company incorporated for the purpose of effecting their respective initial business combinations. In addition, Mr. Meltzer serves on the board of directors of Haymaker Acquisition Corp. III, a blank check company incorporated for the purpose of effecting a business combination. The Sponsor and the Company’s directors and officers are not prohibited from sponsoring, or otherwise becoming involved with, any other blank check companies prior to the Company completing its initial business combination. Moreover, certain of the Company’s directors and officers have time and attention requirements for certain other companies. The Company’s directors and officers also may become aware of business opportunities which may be appropriate for presentation to the Company and the other entities to which they owe certain fiduciary or contractual duties. Accordingly, they may have had conflicts of interest in determining to which entity a particular business opportunity should be presented;   \n---|---  \n  \nAccordingly, they may have had conflicts of interest in determining to which entity a particular business opportunity should be presented. These conflicts may not be resolved in the Company’s favor and such potential business opportunities may be presented to other entities prior to their presentation to the Company, subject to applicable fiduciary duties.

The approximate value of Sponsor’s interest in the Post Combination Company is $34,000,000 million, consisting of 3,400,000 shares of Class B Common Stock at a price of $10.00 per share, which will automatically convert into Shares of Class A Common Stock at the Closing of the Business Combination. The cost basis of this investment was approximately $4.78 million, consisting of 3,125,000 Founder Shares at $0.008, per share, or $25,000, 275,000 private placement units at $10.00 per unit, or $2,750,000, plus 2,000,000 private warrants at a price of $1.00 per warrant, or $2,000,000;   \n---|---  \n• |  that, at the closing of the Business Combination we will enter into the amended and restated registration rights agreement (“Registration Rights Agreement”), substantially in the form attached as _Annex E_ to this proxy statement/prospectus, with the Sponsor and our directors and officers, which provides for registration rights to such persons and their permitted transferees;   \n---|---  \n• |  that, Ophir Sternberg entered into a chairman agreement (“Chairman Agreement”), with Parent and Faquiry Diaz entered into an independent contractor agreement, with Parent, which provides for certain services to the Post-Combination Company and a grant of restricted stock units in the Post-Combination Company; and   \n---|---  \n• |  that, each independent directors of the Post-Combination Company will be granted restricted stock units in the Post-Combination Company.   \n---|---  \n  \nThese conflicts may not be resolved in the Company’s favor and such potential business opportunities may be presented to other entities prior to their presentation to the Company, subject to applicable fiduciary duties.

Based on IFRS 3’s provisions, such a transaction is accounted for in the consolidated financial statements of the Parent (the legal acquirer) as a continuation of the financial statements of SMX (the legal acquiree), together with a deemed issuance of shares by SMX at fair value and a re-capitalization of its equity. This deemed issuance of shares is in fact both an equity transaction under IAS 32 (receiving the net assets of Lionheart, primarily cash) and an equity-settled share-based payment transaction under IFRS 2 (receiving the listing status of the Parent/Lionheart). The difference between the fair value of the shares deemed to have been issued by SMX and the fair value of Lionheart’s identifiable net assets represents a payment for the service of obtaining a stock exchange listing for its shares and a cost of raising capital. Transaction costs are allocated on a relative fair value basis of the amounts allocated to each equity transaction as mentioned above, such that the amount attributed to the equity transaction is deducted from equity and the amount attributed to the listing service is charged as expense in profit or loss. For purposes of the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information, it is assumed that the fair value of each individual SMX ordinary share issued to Lionheart Stockholder is equal to the fair value of each individual SMX ordinary share resulting from the $200 million proforma combined enterprise value assigned to SMX in the Business Combination Agreement. \n\n**Vote Required for Approval**\n\nThe affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock that are voted at the Special Meeting, voting as a single class, is required to approve the Business Combination Proposal. \n\nFailure to submit a proxy or to vote in person at the Special Meeting, abstentions and broker non-votes will have no effect on the Business Combination Proposal. \n\nThe Business Combination is conditioned upon the approval of the Business Combination Proposal, subject to the terms of the BCA and the SID. If the Business Combination Proposal is not approved, the other Proposals (except the Adjournment Proposal, as described below) will not be presented to the stockholders for a vote. \n\n**Recommendation of Lionheart’s Board of Directors**\n\n**THE LIONHEART BOARD UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS THAT THE STOCKHOLDERS VOTE “FOR” THE APPROVAL OF THE BUSINESS COMBINATION PROPOSAL.**\n\n131 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\n**THE BUSINESS COMBINATION AGREEMENT AND SCHEME IMPLEMENTATION DEED**\n\n_This section of the proxy statement/prospectus describes the material provisions of the BCA and the SID, but does not purport to describe all of the terms of the BCA and the SID.

This discussion applies only to Lionheart Securities, Parent Shares and Parent Warrants held as capital assets for U.S. federal income tax purposes (generally, property held for investment) and does not discuss all aspects of U.S. federal income taxation that might be relevant to holders in light of their particular circumstances or status, including alternative minimum tax and Medicare contribution tax consequences, or holders who are subject to special rules, including: \n\n• |  brokers, dealers and other investors that do not own their Lionheart Securities, Parent Shares or Parent Warrants as capital assets;   \n---|---  \n• |  traders in securities that elect to use a mark-to-market method of accounting for their securities holdings;   \n---|---  \n• |  tax-exempt organizations, qualified retirement plans, individual retirement accounts or other tax-deferred accounts;   \n---|---  \n• |  banks or other financial institutions, underwriters, insurance companies, real estate investment trusts or regulated investment companies;   \n---|---  \n• |  U.S. expatriates or former long-term residents of the United States;   \n---|---  \n• |  persons that own (directly, indirectly, or by attribution) 5% or more (by vote or value) of the Company Public Shares or, following the Business Combination, the Parent Shares;   \n---|---  \n• |  partnerships or other pass-through entities for U.S. federal income tax purposes, or beneficial owners of partnerships or other pass-through entities;   \n---|---  \n• |  persons holding Lionheart Securities, Parent Shares or Parent Warrants as part of a straddle, hedging or conversion transaction, constructive sale, or other arrangement involving more than one position;   \n---|---  \n• |  persons required to accelerate the recognition of any item of gross income with respect to Lionheart Securities, Parent Shares or Parent Warrants as a result of such income being recognized on an applicable financial statement;   \n---|---  \n• |  persons whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar;   \n---|---  \n• |  persons that received Lionheart Securities, Parent Shares or Parent Warrants as compensation for services; or   \n---|---  \n• |  controlled foreign corporations or passive foreign investment companies.   \n---|---  \n  \nThis discussion is based on the Code, its legislative history, existing and proposed Treasury regulations promulgated under the Code (the “Treasury Regulations”), published rulings by the IRS and court decisions, all as of the date hereof. These laws are subject to change, possibly on a retroactive basis. This discussion is necessarily general and does not address all aspects of U.S. federal income taxation, including the effect of the U.S. federal alternative minimum tax, or U.S. federal estate and gift tax, or any state, local or non-U.S. tax laws to a holder of Lionheart Securities, Parent Shares or Parent Warrants. We have not and do not intend to seek any rulings from the IRS regarding the Business Combination. Additionally, we have not sought, and will not seek, an opinion of counsel, and the completion of the Business Combination is not conditioned on the receipt of an IRS ruling or opinion of counsel. There is no assurance that the IRS will not take positions concerning the tax consequences of the Business Combination that are different from those discussed below, or that any such different positions would not be sustained by a court. \n\n149 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\nExcept as specifically provided in the section titled “ _— Non-U.S. Holders_” below, the discussion below applies only to U.S. holders. For purposes of this discussion, a U.S. holder means a beneficial owner of Lionheart Securities, Parent Shares or Parent Warrants that is, for U.S. federal income tax purposes: \n\n• |  an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States;   \n---|---  \n• |  a corporation (or other entity taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes) created or organized in or under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia;   \n---|---  \n• |  an estate whose income is subject to U.S. federal income tax regardless of its source; or   \n---|---  \n• |  a trust if (1) a U.S. court can exercise primary supervision over the trust’s administration and one or more U.S. persons are authorized to control all substantial decisions of the trust; or (2) the trust has a valid election in effect under applicable Treasury Regulations to be treated as a U.S. person.   \n---|---  \n  \nHolders who are not U.S. holders should consult with their own tax advisors regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of exercising redemption rights, of the Business Combination, and of holding Parent securities, including U.S. federal withholding tax that may be imposed on any amounts received on a redemption of Company Public Shares that are characterized as dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes and the consequences of holding Lionheart Securities or Parent securities for non-U.S. holders who are engaged in a trade or business within the United States. \n\nALL HOLDERS OF LIONHEART SECURITIES SHOULD CONSULT WITH THEIR OWN TAX ADVISORS REGARDING THE TAX CONSEQUENCES TO THEM OF THE BUSINESS COMBINATION AND CONSIDERATIONS RELATING TO THE OWNERSHIP AND DISPOSITION OF PARENT SHARES AND PARENT WARRANTS, INCLUDING THE EFFECTS OF U.S. FEDERAL, STATE, AND LOCAL AND NON-U.S. TAX LAWS. \n\n**_U.S. Federal Income Tax Treatment of Parent_**\n\nA corporation is generally considered for U.S. federal income tax purposes to be a tax resident in the jurisdiction of its organization or incorporation. Accordingly, under the generally applicable U.S. federal income tax rules, Parent, which is organized under the laws of Ireland, would be classified as a non-U.S. corporation (and, therefore, not a U.S. tax resident) for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Section 7874 of the Code provides an exception to this general rule (more fully discussed below), under which a non-U.S. incorporated entity may, in certain circumstances, be treated as a U.S. corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes. These rules are complex and there is limited guidance regarding their application. \n\nUnder Section 7874, a corporation created or organized outside the United States (i.e., a non-U.S. corporation) will nevertheless be treated as a U.S. corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes (and, therefore, as a U.S. tax resident subject to U.S. federal income tax on its worldwide income) if each of the following three conditions are met: (i) the non-U.S. corporation, directly or indirectly, acquires substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a U.S. corporation (including through the acquisition of all of the outstanding shares of the U.S. corporation); (ii) the non-U.S. corporation’s “expanded affiliated group” does not have “substantial business activities” in the non-U.S. corporation’s country of organization or incorporation and tax residence relative to the expanded affiliated group’s worldwide activities (this test is referred to as the “substantial business activities test”); and (iii) subject to the Third Country Rule discussed below, after the acquisition, the former stockholders of the acquired U.S. corporation hold at least 80% (by either vote or value) of the shares of the non-U.S. acquiring corporation by reason of holding shares in the U.S. acquired corporation (taking into account the receipt of the non-U.S. corporation’s shares in exchange for the U.S. corporation’s shares) as determined for purposes of Section 7874 (this test is referred to as the “Ownership Test”). \n\nFor purposes of Section 7874, the first condition described above will be met with respect to the Business Combination because Parent will acquire indirectly all of the assets of Lionheart through the Business \n\n150 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\nCombination, and Parent, including its “expanded affiliated group,” is not expected to satisfy the substantial business activities test upon consummation of the Business Combination. As a result, whether Section 7874 will apply to cause Parent to be treated as a U.S. corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes following the Business Combination should depend on the satisfaction of the Ownership Test. \n\nBased upon the terms of the Business Combination, the rules for determining share ownership under Section 7874 and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder, and certain factual assumptions, Lionheart and Parent currently expect that the Section 7874 ownership percentage of the Lionheart stockholders in Parent should be less than 80%. \n\nEven so, Treasury Regulations promulgated under Section 7874 include a rule that generally provides that, if (i) there is an acquisition of a U.S. corporation by a non-U.S. corporation in which the Section 7874 ownership percentage is at least 60% (without the application of the Third Party Rule, as defined below), and (ii) in a related acquisition, the non-U.S. corporation acquires another non-U.S. corporation and the acquiring non-U.S. corporation is not subject to tax as a resident in the foreign country in which the acquired non-U.S. corporation was subject to tax as a resident prior to the acquisition, then stock of the acquiring non-U.S. corporation held by former stockholders of the acquired non-U.S. corporation by reason of having held stock in the acquired non-U.S. corporation is excluded in applying the Ownership Test. This rule is referred to herein as the “Third Country Rule.” If applicable, the Third Country Rule increases the Section 7874 ownership percentage and generally results in the acquiring non-U.S. corporation meeting the Ownership Test. \n\nBecause Parent is acquiring SMX as part of the Business Combination, and SMX is not subject to tax as a resident of Ireland (the country in which Parent is subject to tax as a resident), the stock of Parent held by former SMX shareholders by reason of having held stock in SMX is excluded from applying the Ownership Test, the Third Country Rule could apply to the Business Combination if the Section 7874 ownership percentage of Lionheart stockholders in Parent were at least 60%. Based upon the terms of the Business Combination, the rules for determining share ownership under Section 7874 and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder, and certain factual assumptions, Lionheart and Parent currently expect that the Section 7874 ownership percentage of the Lionheart stockholders in Parent should be less than 60%. \n\nAccordingly, Parent is not expected to be treated as a U.S. corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Section 7874. However, whether the Ownership Test has been satisfied must be finally determined after completion of the Business Combination, by which time there could be adverse changes to the relevant facts and circumstances. Further, for purposes of determining the ownership percentage of former Lionheart stockholders for purposes of Section 7874, former Lionheart stockholders will be deemed to own an amount of Parent Shares in respect to certain redemptions by Lionheart prior to the Business Combination. In addition, as discussed above, the rules for determining ownership under Section 7874 are complex, unclear and the subject of ongoing regulatory change. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the IRS would not assert a contrary position to those described above or that such an assertion would not be sustained by a court. \n\nIf Parent were to be treated as a U.S. corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, it could be subject to substantial liability for additional U.S. income taxes, and the gross amount of any dividend payments to its non-U.S. holders could be subject to 30% U.S. withholding tax, depending on the application of any income tax treaty that might apply to reduce the withholding tax. \n\nThe remainder of this discussion assumes that Parent will not be treated as a U.S. corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Section 7874. \n\n**_The Business Combination_**\n\n_Qualification of the Business Combination as a Reorganization_\n\nThe Business Combination has been structured to qualify as a reorganization under Section 368(a) of the Code (a “Reorganization”) and the parties to the Business Combination Agreement adopted the agreement as a \n\n151 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\n“plan of reorganization” within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section 1.368-2(g). In order for the Business Combination to so qualify, among other requirements, it is necessary that Parent either (i) continue Lionheart’s historic business or (ii) use a significant portion of Lionheart’s historic business assets in a business. There is no authority applying this test to the acquisition of a blank check company in a transaction comparable to the Business Combination. Consequently, it is unclear under applicable law whether Lionheart’s operations and assets acquired in the Business Combination will qualify as a historic business or historic business assets for this purpose. If they do not so qualify, the Business Combination will not qualify as a Reorganization. Additionally, in order for the Business Combination to qualify as a Reorganization, it is necessary that a substantial part of the value of the proprietary interests in Lionheart be preserved in the Business Combination. It is unclear whether Redemption Rights will be exercised by Company Public Stockholders to a degree that will prevent a substantial part of the value of the propriety interests in Lionheart from being preserved for this purpose. If it is not so preserved, then the Business Combination would not qualify as a Reorganization. \n\nNeither Parent, Lionheart, nor any other party to the Business Combination Agreement makes any representations or provides any assurances regarding the qualification of the Business Combination as a Reorganization. Furthermore, because of the legal and factual uncertainties described above, no opinion of counsel has or will be provided regarding the qualification of the Business Combination as a Reorganization and neither Lionheart nor Parent intends to file the statement described in Treasury Regulations Section 1.368-3(a), reporting the Merger as a reorganization. \n\nIn the event that the Business Combination does not meet the requirements of a Reorganization, the Business Combination has been structured to qualify, and in the opinion of our counsel will qualify, as a transaction described in Section 351(a) of the Code. \n\nIN LIGHT OF THE FOREGOING AND BECAUSE THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION IS INTENDED AS A GENERAL SUMMARY ONLY, EACH HOLDER OF LIONHEART SECURITIES IS URGED TO CONSULT SUCH HOLDER’S OWN TAX ADVISOR REGARDING THE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE BUSINESS COMBINATION AND OF HOLDING PARENT SHARES OR PARENT WARRANTS, INCLUDING STATE, LOCAL AND NON-U.S. TAX CONSEQUENCES, AND ANY TAX REPORTING REQUIREMENTS OF THE BUSINESS COMBINATION AND ANY RELATED TRANSACTIONS IN LIGHT OF SUCH HOLDER’S OWN TAX SITUATION. \n\n_Consequences if the Business Combination Qualifies as a Reorganization_\n\nIf the Business Combination qualifies as a Reorganization, subject to the discussion regarding the application of Section 367 of the Code to the Business Combination below, the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Business Combination would generally be as follows: (i) a U.S. Holder of Company Public Shares who receives Parent Shares in exchange for his or her Company Public Shares would not recognize gain or loss in respect of such exchange; (ii) a U.S. Holder of Company Public Warrants whose Company Public Warrants are assumed by Parent would not recognize gain or loss in respect of such assumptions; (iii) the aggregate tax basis of the Parent shares or warrants that are received in the Business Combination by each U.S. Holder would be equal to the aggregate tax basis of the Lionheart shares or warrants surrendered in exchange for such Parent shares or warrants; and (iv) the holding period for the Parent shares or warrants received in the Business Combination would include the period during which the Lionheart shares or warrants surrendered in exchange for such Parent shares or warrants were held, provided that such Parent share or warrants were held as capital assets at the time of the Business Combination. \n\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, for the reasons described below relating to Parent’s status as a foreign corporation and the application of Section 367 of the Code, even if the Business Combination qualifies as a Reorganization, the Business Combination could still be taxable for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Because Parent is a foreign corporation, the additional requirements of Section 367(a) of the Code described below must be satisfied in order for the Business Combination to be tax-deferred for U.S. holders of Company Public Shares or Company Public Warrants. \n\n152 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\n_Consequences if the Business Combination does not Qualify as a Reorganization_\n\nThe Business Combination has been structured to qualify, and in the opinion of our counsel will qualify as a transaction described in Section 351(a) of the Code, subject to the discussion regarding the application of Section 367 of the Code to the Business Combination below, a U.S. holder that receives Parent Shares in exchange for Company Public Shares and whose Company Public Warrants automatically convert into a Parent Warrants should recognize gain (but not loss) in an amount equal to the lesser of: (i) the amount of gain realized by such holder (generally, the excess (if any) of (x) the sum of the fair market values of the Parent Shares and the Parent Warrants received by such holder over (y) such holder’s aggregate adjusted tax basis in the Company Public Shares and Purchaser Warrants exchanged therefor) and (ii) the fair market value of the Parent Warrants received by such holder in such exchange. To determine the amount of gain, if any, that such U.S. holder must recognize, the holder must compute the amount of gain or loss realized as a result of the Business Combination on a share-by-share and warrant-by-warrant basis by allocating the aggregate fair market value of: (i) the Parent Shares and (ii) the Parent Warrants received by such U.S. holder among the Company Public Shares and Company Public Warrants owned by such U.S. holder immediately prior to the Business Combination in proportion to their fair market values. Any loss realized by a U.S. holder would not be recognized. In this case, the holding period of the Parent Shares received in the Business Combination should include the holding period during which the Company Public Shares exchanged therefore were held by such U.S. holder, and the holding period of Parent Warrants received in the Business Combination should begin on the day after the Business Combination. \n\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, for the reasons described below relating to Parent’s status as a foreign corporation and the application of Section 367 of the Code, the Business Combination could still be taxable for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Because Parent is a foreign corporation, the additional requirements of Section 367(a) of the Code described below must be satisfied in order for the Business Combination to be tax-deferred for U.S. holders of Company Public Shares or Company Public Warrants. \n\n_Section 367(a)_\n\nSection 367(a) of the Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder, in certain circumstances described below, impose additional requirements for a U.S. holder to qualify for tax-deferred treatment with respect to the exchange of Company Public Shares and/or Company Public Warrants in the Business Combination. \n\nSection 367(a) of the Code generally requires a U.S. holder of stock or warrants in a U.S. corporation to recognize gain (but not loss) when such stock or warrants are exchanged for stock or warrants of a non-U.S. corporation in an exchange that would otherwise qualify for tax-deferred treatment (such as pursuant to a reorganization under Section 368 of the Code or a transaction described in Section 351(a) of the Code) and any of the following is true: (i) the U.S. corporation fails to comply with certain reporting requirements; (ii) U.S. holders of stock or warrants of the acquired U.S. corporation receive more than 50% (by vote or value) of the stock or warrants of the non-U.S. corporation; (iii) U.S. persons that are officers, directors, or 5% or greater shareholders of the acquired U.S. corporation own more than 50% (by vote or value) of the stock or warrants of the non-U.S. corporation immediately after the acquisition; (iv) such U.S. holder is a 5% (by vote or value) or greater shareholder of the acquired U.S. corporation and fails to enter into a 5-year gain recognition agreement with the IRS to recognize gain with respect to the acquired U.S. corporation stock or warrants exchanged in the acquisition; or (v) the U.S. and non-U.S. corporations (and other relevant parties) fail to meet the “active trade or business test.” For purposes of the foregoing ownership percentage thresholds, certain constructive ownership rules apply that may treat a holder as owning stock that person does not directly own. A holder of an acquired U.S. corporation is presumed to be a U.S. person unless that person signs an ownership statement certifying certain information, including its residency. The “active trade or business test” generally requires (A) that the non-U.S. corporation (and its qualified subsidiaries) be engaged in an “active trade or business” outside of the U.S. for the 36-month period immediately before the exchange and that neither the transferors nor the non-U.S.\n\n153 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\ncorporation has an intention to substantially dispose of or discontinue such trade or business, and (B) that the fair market value of the non-U.S. corporation be at least equal to the fair market value of the U.S. corporation, as specifically determined for purposes of Section 367 of the Code, as of the closing of the exchange (the “substantiality test”). For purposes of applying the substantiality test to the Business Combination, the fair market value of Lionheart generally will be deemed to include the value of any non-ordinary course distributions, as determined under applicable Treasury Regulations, made by Lionheart during the 36-month period ending on the closing of the Business Combination. Because of the inherently factual nature of these tests under the applicable Treasury Regulations, and the fact that these tests are generally applied based on the relevant facts at the time of, and following, the completion of the Business Combination, counsel is unable to opine on the application of Section 367(a) of the Code to the exchange by a U.S. holder of Company Public Shares and/or Company Public Warrants in the Business Combination. \n\nTo the extent that a U.S. holder of Company Public Shares and/or Company Public Warrants is required to recognize gain under Section 367(a) of the Code for any of the foregoing reasons, such U.S. holder generally would recognize gain, if any, (but not loss) in an amount equal to the excess of (i) the sum of the fair market value of the Parent Shares received and/or Parent Warrants deemed received by such U.S. holder, over (ii) such U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in the Company Public Shares exchanged and/or Company Public Warrants deemed exchanged therefore. Any such gain would generally be capital gain and would be long-term capital gain if the U.S. holder’s holding period for the Company Public Shares and/or Company Public Warrants was more than one year at the time of the Business Combination. It is unclear whether the redemption rights with respect to the Company Public Shares have suspended the applicable holding period for this purpose. The U.S. holder’s tax basis in the Parent Shares and/or Parent Warrants received in the exchange would be equal to the fair market value of such Parent Shares and/or Parent Warrants at the time of the Business Combination. \n\nThe rules dealing with Section 367(a) of the Code discussed above are very complex and are affected by various factors in addition to those described above. Accordingly, you are strongly urged to consult your own tax advisor concerning the application of these rules to your exchange of Company Public Shares and/or Company Public Warrants under your particular circumstances, including, if you believe you may be a 5% or greater shareholder and the possibility of entering into a “gain recognition agreement” under applicable Treasury Regulations. \n\n**_Redemption of Company Public Shares_**\n\nIn the event that a U.S. holder of Company Public Shares exercises such holder’s right to have such holder’s Company Public Shares redeemed pursuant to the redemption provisions described herein, the treatment of the transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes will depend on whether the redemption qualifies as a sale of such stock pursuant to Section 302 of the Code or whether the U.S. holder will be treated as receiving a corporate distribution. Whether that redemption qualifies for sale treatment will depend largely on the total number of shares of Company Public Shares treated as held by the U.S. holder (including any stock constructively owned by the U.S. holder as a result of, among other things, owning warrants) relative to all the shares of Company Public Shares both before and after the redemption. The redemption of stock generally will be treated as a sale of the stock (rather than as a corporate distribution) if the redemption is “substantially disproportionate” with respect to the U.S. holder, results in a “complete termination” of the U.S. holder’s interest in Lionheart or is “not essentially equivalent to a dividend” with respect to the U.S. holder. These tests are explained more fully below. \n\nIn determining whether any of the foregoing tests are satisfied, a U.S. holder takes into account not only stock actually owned by the U.S. holder, but also shares of Company Public Shares that are constructively owned by such U.S. holder. A U.S. holder may constructively own, in addition to stock owned directly, stock owned by certain related individuals and entities in which the U.S. holder has an interest or that have an interest in such U.S. holder, as well as any stock the U.S. holder has a right to acquire by exercise of an option, which generally would include common stock that could be acquired pursuant to the exercise of the Company Public Warrants. In order to meet the substantially disproportionate test, the percentage of Lionheart’s outstanding voting stock \n\n154 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\nactually and constructively owned by the U.S. holder immediately following the redemption of Company Public Shares must, among other requirements, be less than 80% of the percentage of Lionheart’s outstanding voting stock actually and constructively owned by the U.S. holder immediately before the redemption. There will be a complete termination of a U.S. holder’s interest if either all the shares of Company Public Shares actually and constructively owned by the U.S. holder are redeemed or all the shares of Company Public Shares actually owned by the U.S. holder are redeemed and the U.S. holder is eligible to waive, and effectively waives in accordance with specific rules, the attribution of stock owned by certain family members and the U.S. holder does not constructively own any other stock. The redemption of the Company Public Shares will not be essentially equivalent to a dividend if a U.S. holder’s redemption results in a “meaningful reduction” of the U.S. holder’s proportionate interest in Lionheart. Whether the redemption will result in a meaningful reduction in a U.S. holder’s proportionate interest in Lionheart will depend on the particular facts and circumstances. However, the IRS has indicated in a published ruling that even a small reduction in the proportionate interest of a small minority stockholder in a publicly held corporation who exercises no control over corporate affairs may constitute such a “meaningful reduction.” A U.S. holder should consult with its own tax advisors as to the tax consequences of redemption. \n\nIf the redemption qualifies as a sale of stock by the U.S. holder under Section 302 of the Code, the U.S. holder generally will be required to recognize gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between the amount of cash received and the tax basis of the shares of Company Public Shares redeemed. Such gain or loss should be treated as capital gain or loss if such shares were held as a capital asset on the date of the redemption. A U.S. holder’s tax basis in such holder’s shares of Company Public Shares generally will equal the cost of such shares. A U.S. holder that purchased Lionheart Units would have been required to allocate the cost between the shares of Company Public Shares and the Company Public Warrants comprising the units based on their relative fair market values at the time of the purchase. \n\nIf the redemption does not qualify as a sale of stock under Section 302 of the Code, then the U.S. holder will be treated as receiving a corporate distribution. Such distribution generally will constitute a dividend for U.S. federal income tax purposes to the extent paid from current or accumulated earnings and profits, as determined under U.S. federal income tax principles. Distributions in excess of current and accumulated earnings and profits will constitute a return of capital that will be applied against and reduce (but not below zero) the U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in such U.S. holder’s Company Public Shares. Any remaining excess will be treated as gain realized on the sale or other disposition of the Company Public Shares. Special rules apply to dividends received by U.S. holders that are taxable corporations. After the application of the foregoing rules, any remaining tax basis of the U.S. holder in the redeemed Company Public Shares will be added to the U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in its remaining stock, or, to the basis of stock constructively owned by such holder if the stock actually owned by the holder is completely redeemed. \n\nAdditionally, as the result of recently enacted legislation, if the redemption were to occur after December 31, 2022, the Excise Tax may apply to the Business Combination which may have a material impact on a holder’s economic return. U.S. holders should consult their own tax advisors regarding the potential impact to them if such Excise Tax were to apply. \n\n**_Distributions on Parent Shares_**\n\nSubject to the discussion under the section entitled “ _— Passive Foreign Investment Company Rules_ ” below, the gross amount of any distribution on Parent Shares that is made out of Parent’s current or accumulated earnings and profits (as determined for U.S. federal income tax purposes) generally will be taxable to a U.S. holder as ordinary dividend income on the date such distribution is actually or constructively received. Any such dividends generally will not be eligible for the dividends received deduction allowed to corporations in respect of dividends received from other U.S. corporations. To the extent that the amount of the distribution exceeds Parent’s current and accumulated earnings and profits (as determined under U.S. federal income tax principles), such excess amount will be treated first as a non-taxable return of capital to the extent of the U.S. holder’s tax basis in its Parent Shares, and thereafter as capital gain recognized on a sale or exchange. \n\n155 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\nSubject to the discussion under the section entitled “ _— Passive Foreign Investment Company Rules_ ” below, dividends received by non-corporate U.S. holders (including individuals) from a “qualified foreign corporation” may be eligible for reduced rates of taxation, provided that certain holding period requirements and other conditions are satisfied. For these purposes, a non-U.S. corporation will be treated as a qualified foreign corporation if it is eligible for the benefits of a comprehensive income tax treaty with the United States that meets certain requirements. There is currently an income tax treaty between the United States and Ireland. Notwithstanding, there can be no assurances that Parent will be eligible for benefits of an applicable comprehensive income tax treaty with the United States. A non-U.S. corporation is also treated as a qualified foreign corporation with respect to dividends it pays on shares that are readily tradable on an established securities market in the United States. U.S. Treasury guidance indicates that shares listed on Nasdaq (which Parent Shares are expected to be) will be considered readily tradable on an established securities market in the United States. There can be no assurance that Parent Shares will be considered readily tradable on an established securities market in future years. Non-corporate U.S. holders that do not meet a minimum holding period requirement during which they are not protected from the risk of loss or that elect to treat the dividend income as “investment income” pursuant to Section 163(d)(4) of the Code (dealing with the deduction for investment interest expense) will not be eligible for the reduced rates of taxation regardless of Parent’s status as a qualified foreign corporation. In addition, the rate reduction will not apply to dividends if the recipient of a dividend is obligated to make related payments with respect to the positions in substantially similar or related property. This disallowance applies even if the minimum holding period has been met. Parent will not constitute a qualified foreign corporation for purposes of these rules if it is a passive foreign investment company for the taxable year in which it pays a dividend or for the preceding taxable year. See the section entitled “ _— Passive Foreign Investment Company Rules_ ” below. \n\nSubject to certain conditions and limitations, withholding taxes, if any, on dividends paid by Parent may be treated as foreign taxes eligible for credit against a U.S. holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability under the U.S. foreign tax credit rules. For purposes of calculating the U.S. foreign tax credit, dividends paid on Parent Shares will generally be treated as income from sources outside the United States and will generally constitute passive category income. The rules governing the U.S. foreign tax credit are complex. U.S. holders should consult their own tax advisors regarding the availability of the U.S. foreign tax credit under particular circumstances. \n\nAdditionally, as the result of recently enacted legislation, if the redemption were to occur after December 31, 2022, the Excise Tax may apply to the Business Combination which may have a material impact on a holder’s economic return. U.S. holders should consult their own tax advisors regarding the potential impact to them if such Excise Tax were to apply. \n\n**_Sale, Exchange, Redemption or Other Taxable Disposition of Parent Shares and Parent Warrants_**\n\nSubject to the discussion under the section entitled “ _— Passive Foreign Investment Company Rules_ ” below, a U.S. holder generally will recognize gain or loss on any sale, exchange, redemption or other taxable disposition of Parent Shares or Parent Warrants in an amount equal to the difference between (i) the amount realized on the disposition and (ii) such U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in such shares and/or warrants. Any gain or loss recognized by a U.S. holder on a taxable disposition of Parent Shares or Parent Warrants generally will be capital gain or loss and will be long-term capital gain or loss if the holder’s holding period in such shares and/or warrants exceeds one year at the time of the disposition. Preferential tax rates may apply to long-term capital gains of non-corporate U.S. holders (including individuals). The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations. Any gain or loss recognized by a U.S. holder on the sale or exchange of Parent Shares or Parent Warrants generally will be treated as U.S. source gain or loss. \n\n**_Exercise or Lapse of a Parent Warrant_**\n\nExcept as discussed below with respect to the cashless exercise of a Parent Warrant, a U.S. holder generally will not recognize gain or loss upon the acquisition of a Parent Share on the exercise of a Parent Warrant for \n\n156 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\ncash. A U.S. holder’s tax basis in Parent Shares received upon exercise of the Parent Warrant generally should be an amount equal to the sum of the U.S. holder’s tax basis in the Parent Warrant exchanged therefore and the exercise price. The U.S. holder’s holding period for a Parent Share received upon exercise of the Parent Warrant will begin on the date following the date of exercise (or possibly the date of exercise) of the Parent Warrant and will not include the period during which the U.S. holder held the Parent Warrant. If a Parent Warrant is allowed to lapse unexercised, a U.S. holder generally will recognize a capital loss equal to such holder’s tax basis in the Parent Warrant. \n\nThe tax consequences of a cashless exercise of a Parent Warrant are not clear under current tax law. A cashless exercise may be tax-deferred, either because the exercise is not a gain realization event or because the exercise is treated as a recapitalization for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In either tax-deferred situation, a U.S. holder’s basis in the Parent Shares received would equal the holder’s basis in the Parent Warrants exercised therefore. If the cashless exercise were treated as not being a gain realization event, a U.S. holder’s holding period in the Parent Shares would be treated as commencing on the date following the date of exercise (or possibly the date of exercise) of the Parent Warrants. If the cashless exercise were treated as a recapitalization, the holding period of the Parent Shares would include the holding period of the Parent Warrants exercised therefore. \n\nIt is also possible that a cashless exercise of a Parent Warrant could be treated in part as a taxable exchange in which gain or loss would be recognized. In such event, a U.S. holder would recognize gain or loss with respect to the portion of the exercised Parent Warrants treated as surrendered to pay the exercise price of the Parent Warrants (the “surrendered warrants”). The U.S. holder would recognize capital gain or loss with respect to the surrendered warrants in an amount generally equal to the difference between (i) the fair market value of the Parent Shares that would have been received with respect to the surrendered warrants in a regular exercise of the Parent Warrants and (ii) the sum of the U.S. holder’s tax basis in the surrendered warrants and the aggregate cash exercise price of such warrants (if they had been exercised in a regular exercise). In this case, a U.S. holder’s tax basis in the Parent Shares received would equal the U.S. holder’s tax basis in the Parent Warrants exercised plus (or minus) the gain (or loss) recognized with respect to the surrendered warrants. A U.S. holder’s holding period for the Parent Shares would commence on the date following the date of exercise (or possibly the date of exercise) of the Parent Warrants. \n\nDue to the absence of authority on the U.S. federal income tax treatment of a cashless exercise of warrants, there can be no assurance which, if any, of the alternative tax consequences and holding periods described above would be adopted by the IRS or a court of law. Accordingly, U.S. holders should consult their own tax advisors regarding the tax consequences of a cashless exercise of Parent Warrants. \n\n**_Possible Constructive Distributions_**\n\nThe terms of each Parent Warrant provide for an adjustment to the number of Parent Shares for which the Parent Warrant may be exercised or to the exercise price of the Parent Warrant in certain events, as discussed in the section entitled “ _Description of Parent Securities_.” An adjustment which has the effect of preventing dilution generally is not taxable. A U.S. holder of a Parent Warrant would, however, be treated as receiving a constructive distribution from Parent if, for example, the adjustment increases the holder’s proportionate interest in Parent’s assets or earnings and profits (e.g., through an increase in the number of Parent Shares that would be obtained upon exercise of such warrant) as a result of a distribution of cash to the holders of the Parent Shares which is taxable to the U.S. holders of such shares as described under the section entitled “ _— Distributions on Parent Shares_ ” above. Such constructive distribution would be subject to tax as described under that section in the same manner as if the U.S. holder of such warrant received a cash distribution from Parent equal to the fair market value of such increased interest. The rules regarding constructive distributions are complex. U.S. holders should consult their own tax advisors regarding the application of the rules to them in light of their own circumstances. \n\n157 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\n**_Passive Foreign Investment Company Rules_**\n\n_Generally._ The treatment of U.S. holders of the Parent Shares could be materially different from that described above if Parent is treated as a passive foreign investment company (a “PFIC”), for U.S. federal income tax purposes. A PFIC is any foreign corporation with respect to which either: (i) 75% or more of the gross income for a taxable year constitutes passive income for purposes of the PFIC rules, or (ii) 50% or more of such foreign corporation’s assets in any taxable year (generally based on the quarterly average of the value of its assets during such year) is attributable to assets, including cash, that produce passive income or are held for the production of passive income. Passive income generally includes dividends, interest, certain royalties and rents, annuities, net gains from the sale or exchange of property producing such income and net foreign currency gains. The determination of whether a foreign corporation is a PFIC is based upon the composition of such foreign corporation’s income and assets (including, among others, its proportionate share of the income and assets of any other corporation in which it owns, directly or indirectly, 25% (by value) of the stock), and the nature of such foreign corporation’s activities. A separate determination must be made after the close of each taxable year as to whether a foreign corporation was a PFIC for that year. Once a foreign corporation qualifies as a PFIC it is, with respect to a shareholder during the time it qualifies as a PFIC, and subject to certain exceptions, always treated as a PFIC with respect to such shareholder, regardless of whether it satisfied either of the qualification tests in subsequent years. \n\nBased on the projected composition of Parent’s income and assets, including goodwill, Parent does not expect to be classified as a PFIC for its taxable year that includes the date of the Business Combination. The tests for determining PFIC status are applied annually after the close of the taxable year, and it is difficult to predict accurately future income and assets relevant to this determination. The fair market value of the assets of Parent is expected to depend, in part, upon (a) the market value of the Parent Shares, and (b) the composition of the assets and income of Parent. Further, because Parent may value its goodwill based on the market value of the Parent Shares, a decrease in the market value of the Parent Shares and/or an increase in cash or other passive assets (including as a result of the Business Combination) would increase the relative percentage of its passive assets. Moreover, any interest income that Parent earns on its cash deposits would generally be treated as passive income and increase the risk that Parent would be treated as a PFIC. The application of the PFIC rules is subject to uncertainty in several respects and, therefore, no assurances can be provided that the IRS will not assert that Parent is a PFIC for the taxable year that includes the date of the Business Combination or in a future year. \n\nIf Parent is or becomes a PFIC during any year in which a U.S. holder holds Parent Shares, there are three separate taxation regimes that could apply to such U.S. holder under the PFIC rules, which are the (i) excess distribution regime (which is the default regime), (ii) mark-to-market regime and (iii) QEF regime (as defined below). A U.S. holder who holds (actually or constructively) stock in a foreign corporation during any year in which such corporation qualifies as a PFIC is subject to U.S. federal income taxation under one of these three regimes. The effect of the PFIC rules on a U.S. holder will depend upon which of these regimes applies to such U.S. holder. However, dividends paid by a PFIC are generally not eligible for the lower rates of taxation applicable to qualified dividend income (“QDI”) under any of the foregoing regimes. \n\n_Excess Distribution Regime._ If a U.S. holder does not make a mark-to-market election, as described below, the U.S. holder will be subject to the default “excess distribution regime” under the PFIC rules with respect to (i) any gain realized on a sale or other disposition (including a pledge) of Parent Shares, and (ii) any “excess distribution” received on Parent Shares (generally, any distributions in excess of 125% of the average of the annual distributions on Parent Shares during the preceding three years or the U.S. holder’s holding period, whichever is shorter). Generally, under this excess distribution regime: \n\n• |  the gain or excess distribution will be allocated ratably over the period during which the U.S. holder held Parent Shares;   \n---|---  \n• |  the amount allocated to the current taxable year, will be treated as ordinary income; and   \n---|---  \n• |  the amount allocated to prior taxable years will be subject to the highest tax rate in effect for that taxable year, and the interest charge generally applicable to underpayments of tax will be imposed on the resulting tax attributable to each such year.   \n---|---  \n  \n158 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\nThe tax liability for amounts allocated to years prior to the year of disposition or excess distribution will be payable generally without regard to offsets from deductions, losses and expenses. In addition, gains (but not losses) realized on the sale of Parent Shares cannot be treated as capital gains, even if you hold the shares as capital assets. Further, no portion of any distribution will be treated as QDI. \n\n_Mark-to-Market Regime._ Alternatively, a U.S. holder may make an election to mark marketable shares in a PFIC to market on an annual basis. PFIC shares generally are marketable if: (i) they are “regularly traded” on a national securities exchange that is registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission or on the national market system established under Section 11A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934; or (ii) they are “regularly traded” on any exchange or market that the Treasury Department determines to have rules sufficient to ensure that the market price accurately represents the fair market value of the stock. It is expected that Parent Shares, which are expected to be listed on Nasdaq, will qualify as marketable shares for the PFIC rules purposes, but there can be no assurance that Parent Shares will be “regularly traded” for purposes of these rules. Pursuant to such an election, a U.S. holder would include in each year as ordinary income the excess, if any, of the fair market value of such stock over its adjusted basis at the end of the taxable year. A U.S. holder may treat as ordinary loss any excess of the adjusted basis of the stock over its fair market value at the end of the year, but only to the extent of the net amount previously included in income as a result of the election in prior years. A U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in the PFIC shares will be increased to reflect any amounts included in income, and decreased to reflect any amounts deducted, as a result of a mark-to-market election. Any gain recognized on a disposition of Parent Shares will be treated as ordinary income and any loss will be treated as ordinary loss (but only to the extent of the net amount of income previously included as a result of a mark-to-market election). A mark-to-market election only applies for the taxable year in which the election was made, and for each subsequent taxable year, unless the PFIC shares ceased to be marketable or the IRS consents to the revocation of the election. U.S. holders should also be aware that the Code and the Treasury Regulations do not allow a mark-to-market election with respect to stock of lower-tier PFICs that is non-marketable. There is also no provision in the Code, Treasury Regulations or other published authority that specifically provides that a mark-to-market election with respect to the stock of a publicly traded holding company (such as Parent) effectively exempts stock of any lower-tier PFICs from the negative tax consequences arising from the general PFIC rules. U.S. holders should consult their own tax advisors to determine whether the mark-to-market tax election is available to them and the consequences resulting from such election. In addition, U.S. holders of Parent Warrants will not be able to make a mark-to-market election with respect to their Parent Warrants. \n\n_QEF Regime._ Alternatively, a U.S. holder of a PFIC may avoid the adverse PFIC tax consequences described above in respect of stock of the PFIC (but not warrants) by making and maintaining a timely and valid qualified electing fund (“QEF”) election (if eligible to do so) to include in income its _pro rata_ share of the PFIC’s net capital gains (as long-term capital gain) and other earnings and profits (as ordinary income), on a current basis, in each case whether or not distributed, in the first taxable year of the U.S. Holder in which or with which the PFIC’s taxable year ends and each subsequent taxable year. In order to comply with the requirements of a QEF election, a U.S. Holder must receive a PFIC Annual Information Statement from the PFIC. Parent does not presently intend to provide a PFIC Annual Information Statement in order for U.S. Holders to make or maintain a QEF election. However, as described above, Parent does not expect to be classified as a PFIC for the taxable year that includes the Business Combination. \n\n_PFIC Reporting Requirements._ A U.S. holder of Parent Shares will be required to file an annual report on IRS Form 8621 containing such information with respect to its interest in a PFIC as the IRS may require. Failure to file IRS Form 8621 for each applicable taxable year may result in substantial penalties and result in the U.S. holder’s taxable years being open to audit by the IRS until such Forms are properly filed. \n\n**_Additional Reporting Requirements_**\n\nCertain U.S. holders holding specified foreign financial assets with an aggregate value in excess of the applicable dollar thresholds are required to report information to the IRS relating to Parent Shares, subject to \n\n159 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\ncertain exceptions (including an exception for Parent Shares held in accounts maintained by U.S. financial institutions), by attaching a complete IRS Form 8938 to their tax return, for each year in which they hold Parent \n\nShares. Substantial penalties apply to any failure to file IRS Form 8938, unless the failure is shown to be due to reasonable cause and not willful neglect. Also, in the event a U.S. holder does not file IRS Form 8938 or fails to report a specified foreign financial asset that is required to be reported, the statute of limitations on the assessment and collection of U.S. federal income taxes of such U.S. holder for the related taxable year may not close before the date which is three years after the date on which the required information is filed. U.S. holders should consult their tax advisors regarding the effect, if any, of these rules on the ownership and disposition of Parent Shares. \n\nCertain U.S. holders may be required to file an IRS Form 926 (Return by a U.S. Transferor of Property to a Foreign Corporation) to report a transfer of property to Parent. Substantial penalties may be imposed on a U.S. holder that fails to comply with this reporting requirement and the statute of limitations on the assessment and collection of U.S. federal income taxes will be extended in the event of any such failure to comply. \n\n**_Non-U.S. Holders _**\n\nThis section applies to non-U.S. holders. For purposes of this discussion, a “non-U.S. holder” means a beneficial owner (other than a partnership or an entity or arrangement so characterized for U.S. federal income tax purposes) of Parent Shares or Parent Warrants that is not a U.S. holder, including: \n\n• |  a nonresident alien individual, other than certain former citizens and residents of the United States;   \n---|---  \n• |  a foreign corporation; or   \n---|---  \n• |  a foreign estate or trust;   \n---|---  \n  \nbut, generally, does not include an individual who is present in the United States for 183 days or more in the taxable year of disposition. \n\n_Non-U.S. Holders Exercising Redemption Rights with Respect to Company Public Shares. _The characterization for U.S. federal income tax purposes of the redemption of a non-U.S. holder’s Company Public Shares generally will correspond to the U.S. federal income tax characterization of such a redemption of a U.S. holder’s Company Public Shares, as described above under “— _Redemption of Company Public Shares_.” Any redeeming non-U.S. holder generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on any gain recognized as a result of the redemption or be able to utilize a loss in computing such non-U.S. holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability unless one of the exceptions described below under “— _Ownership and Disposition of Parent Shares and Parent Warrants by Non-U.S. Holders_” applies in respect of such gain or loss. \n\n_Ownership and Disposition of Parent Shares and Parent Warrants by Non-U.S. Holders. _A non-U.S. holder of Parent Shares will generally not be subject to U.S. federal income tax or, subject to the discussion below under “ _— Information Reporting and Backup Withholding_ ,” U.S. federal withholding tax on any dividends received on Parent Shares or any gain recognized on a sale or other disposition of Parent Shares (including, any distribution to the extent it exceeds the adjusted basis in the non-U.S. holder’s Parent Shares) unless the dividend or gain is effectively connected with the non-U.S. holder’s conduct of a trade or business in the United States and, if required by an applicable tax treaty, is attributable to a permanent establishment maintained by the non-U.S. holder in the United States. In addition, special rules may apply to a non-U.S. holder that is an individual present in the United States for 183 days or more during the taxable year of the sale or disposition, and certain other requirements are met. Such holders should consult their own tax advisors regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the sale or disposition of Parent Shares. \n\nDividends and gains that are effectively connected with a non-U.S. holder’s conduct of a trade or business in \n\nthe United States (and, if required by an applicable income tax treaty, are attributable to a permanent establishment or fixed base in the United States) generally will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at the same \n\n160 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\nregular U.S. federal income tax rates applicable to a comparable U.S. holder and, in the case of a non-U.S. holder that is a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, also may be subject to an additional branch profits tax at a 30% rate or a lower applicable tax treaty rate. \n\nThe U.S. federal income tax treatment of a non-U.S. holder’s exercise of a Parent Warrant, or the lapse of a Parent Warrant held by a non-U.S. holder generally will correspond to the U.S. federal income tax treatment of the exercise or lapse of a warrant by a U.S. holder, as described under “ _— Exercise or Lapse of a Parent Warrant_ ,” above, although to the extent a cashless exercise results in a taxable exchange, the consequences would be similar to those described in the preceding paragraphs above for a non-U.S. holder’s gain on the sale or other disposition of the Parent Shares and Parent Warrants. \n\n**_Information Reporting and Backup Withholding_**\n\nInformation reporting requirements may apply to cash received in redemption of Company Public Shares, dividends received by U.S. holders of Parent Shares, and the proceeds received on the disposition of Parent Shares effected within the United States (and, in certain cases, outside the United States), in each case other than U.S. holders that are exempt recipients (such as corporations). Backup withholding (currently at a rate of 24%) may apply to such amounts if the U.S. holder fails to provide an accurate taxpayer identification number (generally on an IRS Form W-9 provided to the paying agent of the U.S. holder’s broker) or is otherwise subject to backup withholding. Any redemptions treated as dividend payments with respect to Company Public Shares and Parent Shares and proceeds from the sale, exchange, redemption or other disposition of Parent Shares may be subject to information reporting to the IRS and possible U.S. backup withholding. U.S. holders should consult their own tax advisors regarding the application of the U.S. information reporting and backup withholding rules. \n\nInformation returns may be filed with the IRS in connection with, and non-U.S. holders may be subject to backup withholding on amounts received in respect of their Company Public Shares, Company Public Warrants or their Parent Shares, unless the non-U.S. holder furnishes to the applicable withholding agent the required certification as to its non-U.S. status, such as by providing a valid IRS Form W-8BEN, IRS Form W-8BEN-E or IRS Form W-8ECI, as applicable, or the non-U.S. holder otherwise establishes an exemption. Dividends paid with respect to Parent Shares and proceeds from the sale of other disposition of Parent Shares received in the United States by a non-U.S. holder through certain U.S.-related financial intermediaries may be subject to information reporting and backup withholding unless such non-U.S. holder provides proof of an applicable exemption or complies with certain certification procedures described above, and otherwise complies with the applicable requirements of the backup withholding rules. \n\nBackup withholding is not an additional tax. Amounts withheld as backup withholding may be credited against the holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability, and a holder may obtain a refund of any excess amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules by timely filing the appropriate claim for a refund with the IRS and furnishing any required information. \n\n**_FATCA_**\n\nSections 1471 through 1474 of the Code and the Treasury regulations and administrative guidance promulgated thereunder (commonly referred to as the “Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act” or “FATCA”) generally impose U.S. federal withholding tax of 30% on certain withholdable payments to a “foreign financial institution” (as defined in the Code) (an “FFI”) unless the FFI (1) enters into an agreement with the IRS (or is subject to an applicable intergovernmental agreement) to withhold on certain payments and to collect and provide to the IRS (or local revenue authorities, as required under an applicable intergovernmental agreement) information regarding United States persons who hold accounts with the FFI and its affiliates (including certain foreign entities owned by United States persons), and (2) provides the payor with a properly completed IRS Form W-8BEN-E to document its status or the FFI otherwise qualifies for an exemption. This IRS Form W-8BEN-E must include the FFI’s Global Intermediary Identification Number, which is obtained by registering with the IRS. \n\n161 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\nFATCA may also impose a 30% withholding tax on withholdable payments to a “non-financial foreign entity” (as defined in the Code) unless the entity provides the withholding agent with a properly completed IRS Form W-8BEN-E certifying that it does not have any “substantial United States owners” (as defined in the Code) or identifying its direct and indirect substantial United States owners or the entity otherwise qualifies for an exemption. \n\nFor purposes of FATCA, “withholdable payments” generally include U.S.-source payments otherwise subject to non-resident withholding tax (e.g., U.S. source interest or dividends), and, subject to the proposed Treasury regulations discussed below, payments of gross proceeds from the sale or other disposition of any property of a type that can produce U.S. source interest or dividends (e.g., retirements and redemptions of indebtedness, sales of securities, or redemptions of stock in a U.S. corporation), even if the payment would otherwise not be subject to U.S. non-resident withholding tax (e.g., because it is capital gain). \n\nWhile withholding under FATCA would have applied also to payments of gross proceeds from the sale or other disposition of property, proposed Treasury regulations eliminate FATCA withholding on payments of gross proceeds entirely. Taxpayers generally may (but are not required to) rely on these proposed Treasury regulations until final Treasury regulations are issued. Redeeming non-U.S. holders are encouraged to consult with their own tax advisors regarding the possible application of FATCA to redemptions of Company Public Shares. \n\n162 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\n**CERTAIN MATERIAL IRISH TAX CONSIDERATIONS TO NON-IRISH HOLDERS **\n\n**Scope**\n\nThe following is a summary of the anticipated material Irish tax consequences of the Transactions to certain Non-Irish Holders of Lionheart shares, Lionheart warrants and/or SMX Shares and the acquisition, ownership and disposal of Parent Shares and Parent Warrants received by such holders pursuant to the Transactions. The summary is based upon Irish tax laws and the practice of the Irish Revenue Commissioners in effect on the date of this proxy statement/prospectus and submissions which will be made to the Irish Revenue Commissioners. Changes in law and/or administrative practice may result in a change in the tax consequences described below, possibly with retrospective effect. \n\nA “ _Non-Irish Holder_” is an individual who beneficially owns their Lionheart shares, Lionheart warrants and/or SMX Shares, and who will beneficially own their Parent Shares and/or Parent Warrants, that is neither a resident nor ordinarily resident in Ireland for Irish tax purposes and does not hold their Lionheart shares, Lionheart warrants and/or SMX Shares, and will not hold their Parent Shares and/or Parent Warrants, in connection with a trade carried on by such person through an Irish branch or agency. \n\nThis summary does not constitute tax advice and is intended only as a general guide. The summary is not exhaustive and securityholders should consult their tax advisors about the Irish tax consequences (and tax consequences under the laws of other relevant jurisdictions) of the business combination and of the acquisition, ownership and disposal of Parent Shares and Parent Warrants. The summary applies only to Non-Irish Holders who hold their Lionheart shares, Lionheart warrants and/or SMX Shares, and will own their Parent Shares and/or Parent Warrants, as capital assets and does not apply to other categories of Non-Irish Holders, such as dealers in securities, trustees, insurance companies, collective investment schemes and Non-Irish Holders who acquired, or are deemed to have acquired, their Lionheart shares, Lionheart warrants and/or SMX Shares or who will, or who will be deemed to, acquire their Parent Shares and/or Parent Warrants by virtue of an Irish office or employment (performed or carried on to any extent in Ireland). \n\nThe summary does not, except where expressly stated, consider the position of Non-Irish Holders who hold their Parent Shares and/or Parent Warrants directly (and not beneficially through a broker or custodian (through DTC)). The Irish tax consequences of transactions in Parent Shares and/or Parent Warrants held directly are generally negative when compared with Parent Shares and/or Parent Warrants held through DTC. Any Non-Irish Holder contemplating holding their Parent Shares and/or Parent Warrants directly should consult their personal tax advisors as to the Irish tax consequences of acquiring, owning and disposing of such Parent Shares and/or Parent Warrants. \n\n**Irish Tax on Chargeable Gains (Irish CGT)**\n\nThe following, to the extent it constitutes matters of Irish law and legal conclusions, is the opinion of Arthur Cox LLP regarding the anticipated material Irish CGT consequences of the Transactions to certain Non-Irish Holders of Lionheart shares, Lionheart warrants and/or SMX Shares. \n\nThe current rate of tax on chargeable gains (where applicable) in Ireland is 33%. \n\nNon-Irish Holders of Lionheart shares, Lionheart warrants and/or SMX Shares will not be subject to Irish CGT in respect of any gain realized on the automatic conversion of their Lionheart shares or their SMX Shares into Parent Shares, or on the automatic adjustment of their Lionheart warrants into Parent Warrants, in each case by virtue of the Transactions, provided that the Lionheart shares, Lionheart warrants and/or SMX Shares neither (a) were used in or for the purposes of a trade carried on by such Non-Irish Holder through an Irish branch or agency, nor (b) were used, held or acquired for use by or for the purposes of an Irish branch or agency. \n\nNon-Irish Holders further will not be within the territorial scope of a charge to Irish CGT on a subsequent disposal of their Parent Shares and/or Parent Warrants, provided that such Parent Shares and/or Parent Warrants \n\n163 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\nneither (a) were used in or for the purposes of a trade carried on by such Non-Irish Holder through an Irish branch or agency, nor (b) were used, held or acquired for use by or for the purposes of an Irish branch or agency. \n\n**Stamp Duty**\n\nThe rate of stamp duty (where applicable) on transfers of shares or warrants of Irish incorporated companies is 1% of the greater of the price paid or market value of the shares or warrants acquired. Where Irish stamp duty arises it is generally a liability of the transferee. However, in the case of a gift or transfer at less than fair market value, all parties to the transfer are jointly and severally liable. \n\nNo stamp duty is expected to be payable on the automatic conversion of the Lionheart shares into Parent Shares, the automatic adjustment of the Lionheart warrants into Parent Warrants or the issue of Parent Shares to the SMX shareholders, pursuant to the business combination. \n\nIrish stamp duty may be payable in respect of transfers of Parent Shares and Parent Warrants, depending on the manner in which the Parent Shares and Parent Warrants are held. Parent expects to enter into arrangements with DTC to allow the Parent Shares and Parent Warrants to be settled through the facilities of DTC. As such, the discussion below discusses separately the securityholders who hold their shares through DTC and those who do not. \n\n**_Parent Shares or Parent Warrants Held Through DTC_**\n\nSubmission will be made to the Irish Revenue Commissioners to confirm that transfers of Parent Shares and Parent Warrants effected by means of the transfer of book entry interests in DTC will not be subject to Irish stamp duty. It is expected that this confirmation should be granted, in which case a transfer of Parent Shares and/or Parent Warrants effected by means of the transfer of book-entry interests in DTC will not be subject to Irish stamp duty. \n\n**_Parent Shares or Parent Warrants Held Outside of DTC or Transferred Into or Out of DTC_**\n\nA transfer of Parent Shares or Parent Warrants where any party to the transfer holds such Parent Shares or Parent Warrants outside of DTC may be subject to Irish stamp duty. \n\nShould the confirmation from the Irish Revenue Commissioners be granted, holders of Parent Shares or Parent Warrants wishing to transfer their Parent Shares or Parent Warrants into (or out of) DTC may do so without giving rise to Irish stamp duty provided that: \n\n• |  there is no change in the beneficial ownership of such shares as a result of the transfer; and   \n---|---  \n• |  the transfer into (or out of) DTC is not effected in contemplation of a sale of such shares or warrants by a beneficial owner to a third party.   \n---|---  \n  \nDue to the potential Irish stamp charge on transfers of Parent Shares held outside of DTC, it is strongly recommended that those securityholders who do not hold their Lionheart securities or SMX Shares through DTC (or through a broker who in turn holds such shares through DTC) should to the extent possible arrange for the transfer of their Lionheart securities or SMX Shares (as applicable) into DTC as soon as possible and before the business combination is consummated. \n\n**Withholding Tax on Dividends (DWT)**\n\nDistributions made by Parent will, in the absence of one of many exemptions, be subject to DWT, currently at a rate of 25%. \n\n164 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\nFor DWT and Irish income tax purposes, a distribution includes any distribution that may be made by Parent to holders of Parent Shares, including cash dividends, non-cash dividends and additional stock taken in lieu of a cash dividend. Where an exemption from DWT does not apply in respect of a distribution made to a holder of Parent Shares, Parent is responsible for withholding DWT prior to making such distribution. \n\n**_General Exemptions_**\n\nIrish domestic law provides that a non-Irish resident holder of Parent Shares is not subject to DWT on distributions received from Parent if such holder of Parent Shares is beneficially entitled to the distribution and is either: \n\n• |  a person (not being a company) resident for tax purposes in a Relevant Territory (including the United States) and is neither resident nor ordinarily resident in Ireland (for a list of Relevant Territories for DWT purposes, please see Annex I to this proxy statement/prospectus);   \n---|---  \n• |  a company resident for tax purposes in a Relevant Territory, provided such company is not under the control, whether directly or indirectly, of a person or persons who is or are resident in Ireland;   \n---|---  \n• |  a company that is controlled, directly or indirectly, by persons resident in a Relevant Territory and who is or are (as the case may be) not controlled by, directly or indirectly, persons who are not resident in a Relevant Territory;   \n---|---  \n• |  a company whose principal class of shares (or those of its 75% direct or indirect parent) is substantially and regularly traded on a stock exchange in Ireland, on a recognized stock exchange either in a Relevant Territory or on such other stock exchange approved by the Irish Minister for Finance; or   \n---|---  \n• |  a company that is wholly owned, directly or indirectly, by two or more companies where the principal class of shares of each of such companies is substantially and regularly traded on a stock exchange in Ireland, a recognized stock exchange in a Relevant Territory or on such other stock exchange approved by the Irish Minister for Finance   \n---|---  \n  \nand provided, in all cases noted above (but subject to “ _— Shares Held by U.S. Resident Shareholders_ ” below), Parent or, in respect of Parent Shares held through DTC, any qualifying intermediary appointed by Parent, has received from the holder of such Parent Shares, where required, the relevant DWT Forms prior to the payment of the distribution. In practice, in order to ensure sufficient time to process the receipt of relevant DWT Forms, the holders of Parent Shares, where required, should furnish the relevant DWT Form to: \n\n• |  its broker (and the relevant information is further transmitted to any qualifying intermediary appointed by Parent) before the record date for the distribution (or such later date before the distribution payment date as may be notified to the holder of Parent Shares by the broker) if its Parent Shares are held through DTC; or   \n---|---  \n• |  Parent’s transfer agent before the record date for the distribution if its Parent Shares are held outside of DTC.   \n---|---  \n  \nLinks to the various DWT Forms are available at: http://www.revenue.ie/en/tax/dwt/forms/index.html. The information on such website does not constitute a part of, and is not incorporated by reference into, this proxy statement/prospectus. \n\nFor non-Irish resident holders of Parent Shares that cannot avail themselves of one of Ireland’s domestic law exemptions from DWT, it may be possible for such holder of Parent Shares to rely on the provisions of a double tax treaty to which Ireland is party to reduce the rate of DWT. \n\n**_Parent Shares Held by U.S. Resident Shareholders_**\n\nSubmission will be made to the Irish Revenue Commissioners to confirm that distributions paid in respect of Parent Shares that are owned by a U.S. resident and held through DTC will not be subject to DWT provided the \n\n165 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\naddress of the beneficial owner of such Parent Shares in the records of the broker holding such Parent Shares is in the United States (and such broker has further transmitted the relevant information to a qualifying intermediary appointed by Parent). It is strongly recommended that such holders of Parent Shares, including Lionheart and SMX securityholders who are U.S. residents and who receive Parent Shares pursuant to the business combination, ensure that their information is properly recorded by their brokers (so that such brokers can further transmit the relevant information to a qualifying intermediary appointed by Parent). \n\nSubmission will be made to the Irish Revenue Commissioners to confirm that distributions paid in respect of Parent Shares that are held outside of DTC and are owned by a former Lionheart or SMX securityholder who is a resident of the United States will not be subject to DWT if such holder of Parent Shares provides a completed IRS Form 6166 or a valid DWT Form to Parent’s transfer agent to confirm its U.S. residence and claim an exemption. It is strongly recommended that Lionheart and/or SMX securityholders who are U.S. residents and who receive Parent Shares pursuant to the business combination (which are to be held outside of DTC) provide the appropriate completed IRS Form 6166 or DWT Form to Parent’s transfer agent as soon as possible after receiving their Parent Shares. \n\nIf any holder of Parent Shares that is resident in the United States receives a distribution from which DWT has been withheld, the holder of Parent Shares should generally be entitled to apply for a refund of such DWT from the Irish Revenue Commissioners, provided the holder of Parent Shares is beneficially entitled to the distribution. \n\n**_Parent Shares Held by Residents of Relevant Territories Other Than the United States_**\n\nHolders of Parent Shares who are residents of Relevant Territories, other than the United States, must satisfy the conditions of one of the exemptions referred to above under the heading “ _— General Exemptions_ ”, including the requirement to furnish valid DWT Forms, in order to receive distributions without suffering DWT. If such holders of Parent Shares hold their Parent Shares through DTC, they must provide the appropriate DWT Forms to their brokers (so that such brokers can further transmit the relevant information to a qualifying intermediary appointed by Parent) before the record date for the distribution (or such later date before the distribution payment date as may be notified to holder of Parent Shares by the broker). If such holders of Parent Shares hold their Parent Shares outside of DTC, they must provide the appropriate DWT Forms to Parent’s transfer agent before the record date for the distribution. It is strongly recommended that such holders of Parent Shares including Lionheart and/or SMX securityholders who are residents of Relevant Territories other than the United States and who receive Parent Shares pursuant to the business combination complete the appropriate DWT Forms and provide them to their brokers or Parent’s transfer agent, as the case may be, as soon as possible after receiving their Parent Shares. \n\nIf any holder of Parent Shares who is resident in a Relevant Territory receives a distribution from which DWT has been withheld, the holder of Parent Shares may be entitled to a refund of DWT from the Irish Revenue Commissioners provided the holder of Parent Shares is beneficially entitled to the distribution. \n\n**_Shares Held by Other Persons_**\n\nHolders of Parent Shares that do not fall within any of the categories specifically referred to above may nonetheless fall within other exemptions from DWT. If any holders of Parent Shares are exempt from DWT, but receive distributions subject to DWT, such holders of Parent Shares may apply for refunds of such DWT from the Irish Revenue Commissioners. \n\nDistributions paid in respect of Parent Shares held through DTC that are owned by a partnership formed under the laws of a Relevant Territory and where all the underlying partners are resident in a Relevant Territory will be entitled to exemption from DWT if all of the partners complete the appropriate DWT Forms and provide them to their brokers (so that such brokers can further transmit the relevant information to a qualifying \n\n166 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\nintermediary appointed by Parent) before the record date for the distribution (or such later date before the distribution payment date as may be notified to the holder of Parent Shares by the broker). If any partner is not a resident of a Relevant Territory, no part of the partnership’s position is entitled to exemption from DWT. \n\n**_Qualifying Intermediary_**\n\nPrior to paying any distribution, Parent will put in place an agreement with an entity that is recognized by the Irish Revenue Commissioners as a “qualifying intermediary,” which will provide for certain arrangements relating to distributions in respect of Parent Shares that are held through DTC, which are referred to as the “Deposited Securities.” The agreement will provide that the qualifying intermediary shall distribute or otherwise make available to Cede & Co., as nominee for DTC, any cash dividend or other cash distribution with respect to the Deposited Securities after Parent delivers or causes to be delivered to the qualifying intermediary the cash to be distributed. \n\nParent will rely on information received directly or indirectly from its qualifying intermediary, brokers and its transfer agent in determining where holders of Parent Shares reside, whether they have provided the required U.S. tax information and whether they have provided the required DWT Forms. Holders of Parent Shares that are required to file DWT Forms in order to receive distributions free of DWT should note that such forms are generally valid, subject to a change in circumstances, until December 31 of the fifth year after the year in which such forms were completed. \n\n**Income Tax on Dividends Paid on Parent Shares**\n\nIrish income tax may arise for certain persons in respect of distributions received from Irish resident companies. \n\nA Non-Irish Holder that is entitled to an exemption from DWT will generally have no Irish income tax or universal social charge liability on a distribution from Parent. A Non-Irish Holder that is not entitled to an exemption from DWT, and therefore is subject to DWT, generally will have no additional Irish income tax liability or liability to universal social charge. The DWT deducted by Parent discharges the Irish income tax liability and liability to universal social charge. \n\n**Capital Acquisitions Tax (CAT)**\n\nCAT comprises principally gift tax and inheritance tax on property situated in Ireland for CAT purposes or otherwise within the territorial scope of CAT. CAT could apply to a gift or inheritance of Parent Shares and Parent Warrants because Parent Shares and Parent Warrants are regarded as property situated in Ireland for CAT purposes. The person who receives the gift or inheritance has primary liability for CAT. \n\nCAT is currently levied at a rate of 33% on the value of any taxable gift or inheritance above certain tax-free thresholds. The appropriate tax-free threshold depends upon (1) the relationship between the donor and the donee and (2) the aggregation of the values of previous taxable gifts and inheritances received by the donee from persons within the same group threshold. Gifts and inheritances passing between spouses are exempt from CAT, as are gifts to certain charities. Children have a lifetime tax-free threshold of €335,000 in respect of taxable gifts or inheritances received from their parents. There is also a “small gift exemption” from CAT whereby the first €3,000 of the taxable value of all taxable gifts taken by a donee from any one donor, in each calendar year, is exempt from CAT and is also excluded from any future aggregation. This exemption does not apply to an inheritance. \n\n**THE IRISH TAX CONSIDERATIONS SUMMARIZED ABOVE ARE FOR GENERAL INFORMATION ONLY AND ARE NOT INTENDED TO PROVIDE ANY DEFINITIVE TAX REPRESENTATIONS TO HOLDERS. EACH LIONHEART AND SMX SECURITYHOLDER SHOULD CONSULT HIS OR HER TAX ADVISOR AS TO THE PARTICULAR CONSEQUENCES THAT MAY APPLY TO SUCH SECURITYHOLDER.**\n\n167 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\n**UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED COMBINED FINANCIAL INFORMATION**\n\n**Introduction**\n\nLionheart and SMX are providing the following unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information to aid you in your analysis of the financial aspects of the Transactions. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information has been derived from the historical financial statements of Lionheart and SMX and the related notes included elsewhere in this proxy statement/prospectus and should be read in conjunction with the accompanying notes to the pro forma financial information. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information should also be read together with “ _Lionheart’s Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations_ ” and “ _Security Matters’ Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations_ ,” and other financial information included elsewhere in this proxy statement/prospectus. \n\nThe following unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements present the combination of certain financial information of Lionheart and SMX, adjusted to give effect to the Transactions. The following unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information has been prepared in accordance with Article 11 of Regulation S-X as amended by the final rule, Release No. 33-10786 “Amendments to Financial Disclosures about Acquired and Disposed Businesses.” \n\nLionheart was formed as a Delaware corporation on January 14, 2021. Lionheart was formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization, or similar business combination with one or more businesses or entities. \n\nSecurity Matters Limited is a company incorporated under the laws of Australia and provides one solution to solve both authentication and track and trace challenges in order to uphold supply chain integrity and provide quality assurance and brand accountability to producers of goods. Its technology works as a track and trace system using a marker, a reader and an algorithm to identify embedded sub-molecular particles in order to track and trace different components along a production process (or any other marked good along a supply chain) to the end producer. \n\nThe unaudited pro forma condensed combined statement of financial position as of June 30, 2022 combines the consolidated historical statements of financial position of SMX and the historical balance sheet of Lionheart on a pro forma basis as if the Transactions had been consummated on June 30, 2022. \n\nThe unaudited pro forma condensed combined statement of operations for the six months ended June 30, 2022 and for the year ended December 31, 2021 combines the consolidated historical statement of operations of SMX and Lionheart for such periods on a pro forma basis as if the Transactions had been consummated on January 1, 2021. \n\nThe unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information has only been presented for illustrative purposes. The financial results may have been different had SMX and Lionheart been combined. You should not rely on the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information as being indicative of the historical results that would have been achieved had SMX and Lionheart been combined or the future results that SMX will experience after giving effect to the Transactions. Further, the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information may not be useful in predicting the future financial condition and results of operations of SMX after giving effect to the Transactions. The actual financial position and results of operations of SMX may differ significantly from the pro forma amounts reflected herein due to a variety of factors. \n\nThe unaudited pro forma adjustments represent SMX management’s estimates based on information available as of the date of the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information and is subject to, and may differ materially from, the information presented as additional information becomes available and analyses are performed. SMX’s management believes that its assumptions and methodologies provide a \n\n168 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\nreasonable basis for presenting all of the significant effects of the Transactions based on information available to SMX’s management at this time and that the pro forma adjustments give appropriate effect to those assumptions and are properly applied in the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information. \n\nUnder all redemption scenarios, the Transactions will be accounted for as an assets acquisition, with no goodwill or other intangible assets recorded, in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”). \n\nThe unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information has been prepared using the assumptions below with respect to the potential redemption of Lionheart’s Class A Common Stock: \n\n• |  **Assuming No Redemptions** : This presentation assumes that no Lionheart Public Stockholder exercises redemption rights with respect to his, her or its Lionheart Class A Common Stock.   \n---|---  \n• |  **Assuming 25% Redemptions** : This presentation assumes that Lionheart Public Stockholders holding 3,125,000 Lionheart Class A Common Stock will exercise their redemption rights for $32,500,000 of funds in the Trust Account, resulting in $93,750,000 remaining in the Trust Account.   \n---|---  \n• |  **Assuming 75% Redemptions:** This presentation assumes that Lionheart Public Stockholders holding 9,375,000 Lionheart Class A Common Stock will exercise their redemption rights for $93,750,000 of funds in the Trust Account, resulting in $32,500,000 remaining in the Trust Account.   \n---|---  \n• |  **Assuming Maximum Redemptions** : This presentation assumes that Lionheart Public Stockholders holding 11,000,000 Lionheart Class A Common Stock will exercise their redemption rights for $111,250,000 of funds in the Trust Account, resulting in $15,000,000 remaining in the Trust Account. The Business Combination Agreement provides that consummating the Transactions is conditioned upon Lionheart having net tangible assets of at least $5,000,001 (as determined in accordance with Rule 3a51-1(g)(1) of the Exchange Act) immediately after the Effective Time.   \n---|---  \n  \nThe actual redemptions will be within the scenarios described above; however, there can be no assurance regarding which scenario will be closest to the actual results. Under all scenarios presented, SMX is considered the accounting acquirer, as further discussed in “Accounting for the Transactions” below. \n\nThis information should be read together with the following: \n\n• |  SMX’s audited financial statements and related notes as of December 2021 and for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020;   \n---|---  \n• |  SMX’s unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes as of June 30, 2022 and for the periods ended June 30, 2022 and 2021   \n---|---  \n• |  “ _Security Matters’ Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations_ ”;   \n---|---  \n• |  Lionheart’s audited financial statements and related notes as of December 31, 2021 and for the period from January 14, 2021 (inception) through December 31, 2021;   \n---|---  \n• |  Lionheart’s unaudited condensed financial statements and related notes as of June 30, 2022 and for the periods ended June 30, 2022 and 2021;   \n---|---  \n• |  _“Lionheart’s Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations_ ”; and   \n---|---  \n• |  other financial information included elsewhere in this proxy statement/prospectus.   \n---|---  \n  \n**Accounting for the Transactions**\n\nSMX will account for the merger using the reverse acquisition method in accordance with the principles of IFRS 3. This results in SMX being identified as the accounting acquirer, and the Parent/Lionheart being identified as \n\n169 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\nthe accounting acquirees. Under the reverse acquisition method, the accounting acquirer is deemed to have issued shares to obtain control of the acquirees. However, since the Parent and Lionheart are not businesses as defined in IFRS 3, the transaction is not a business combination. Based on IFRS 3’s provisions, such a transaction is accounted for in the consolidated financial statements of the Parent (the legal acquirer) as a continuation of the financial statements of SMX (the legal acquiree), together with a deemed issuance of shares by SMX at fair value and a re-capitalization of its equity. This deemed issuance of shares is in fact both an equity transaction under IAS 32 (receiving the net assets of Lionheart, primarily cash) and an equity-settled share-based payment transaction under IFRS 2 (receiving the listing status of the Parent/Lionheart). The difference between the fair value of the shares deemed to have been issued by SMX and the fair value of Lionheart’s identifiable net assets represents a payment for the service of obtaining a stock exchange listing for its shares, and not considered a cost of raising capital. Therefore, it is expensed immediately to profit or loss at Closing Date. Transaction costs are allocated on a relative fair value basis of the amounts allocated to each equity transaction as mentioned above, such that the amount attributed to the equity transaction is deducted from equity and the amount attributed to the listing service is charged as expense in profit or loss. The determination of SMX as the accounting acquirer is based on an evaluation of the following facts and circumstances: \n\n• |  SMX Shareholders will have the largest voting rights in Parent after giving effect to the Transactions, under all redemption scenarios;   \n---|---  \n• |  SMX accounts for the majority of representatives in the governing body of the Parent, the Board of Directors;   \n---|---  \n• |  SMX’s senior management will continue in their respective roles in the Parent after giving effect to the Transactions;   \n---|---  \n• |  SMX’s operations will substantially comprise the ongoing operations of SMX after giving effect to the Transactions; and   \n---|---  \n• |  SMX is the larger entity, in terms of substantive operations and employee base.   \n---|---  \n

Company is to engage in any lawful act or activity for which corporations may be organized under the General Corporation Law of Delaware  \n**SHAREHOLDER VOTING** |  Except where a greater majority is

decided by a resolution approved by a simple majority of votes cast, in person or by proxy, at a general meeting of Post-Combination Company shareholders at which a quorum is present (referred to under Irish law as an “ordinary resolution”). An ordinary resolution is needed, among other matters, to appoint a Post-Combination Company director (where the appointment is by shareholders), to remove a Post-Combination Company director and to provide, vary or renew the Post-Combination Company directors’ authority to allot relevant securities. Irish law requires approval of certain matters by a resolution approved by not less than 75% of the votes cast, in person or by proxy, at a general meeting of shareholders at which a quorum is present (referred to under Irish law as a “special resolution”).

Mergers in which less than 20% of the acquirer’s stock is issued generally do not require acquirer stockholder approval. Mergers in which one corporation owns 90% or more of a second corporation may be completed without the vote of the second corporation’s board of directors or stockholders.  \n**SPECIAL VOTE REQUIRED FOR COMBINATIONS WITH INTERESTED SHAREHOLDERS** | A corporation may not engage in a business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years after the time of the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder.  \n**SHAREHOLDER RIGHTS PLAN** | Subject to applicable law, the Parent Amended Memorandum and Articles of Association provides the Post-Combination Company Board with the power to adopt a shareholder rights’ plan upon such terms as the Post-Combination Company Board deems expedient in the best interests of the Post-Combination Company, and to exercise any power of the Post-Combination Company to grant rights (including approving the execution of any documents relating  \n  \n179 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\n_Post-Combination Company Shareholders_ |  _Lionheart Stockholders_  \n---|---  \nto the grant of such rights) to subscribe for Parent Shares or preference shares in the capital of the Post-Combination Company in accordance with the terms of such rights’ plan. The Post-Combination Company’s ability to adopt a rights’ plan or to take other anti-takeover measures after the Board has received an approach which may lead to an offer or has reason to believe an offer is, or may be, imminent would be restricted by the frustrating actions’ prohibition of the Irish Takeover Rules. A number of Irish companies have pre-existing rights’ plans, which automatically trigger in specified circumstances without the need for a target board decision (other than a decision to disarm), although the validity of these plans has not been tested with the Irish Takeover Panel or in the Irish courts.  \n**APPRAISAL RIGHTS** | Stockholders have appraisal rights in certain circumstances as provided for under the DGCL.  \n**SHAREHOLDER CONSENT TO ACTION WITHOUT MEETING** | As set out in the Parent Amended Memorandum and Articles of Association, for so long as the Post-Combination Company has more than one shareholder, any action required or permitted to be taken by the holders of shares of the Post-Combination Company requires the unanimous consent of the holders of the Parent Shares before the shareholders may act by way of written resolution in lieu of holding a duly called annual or extraordinary general meeting of such shareholders. | As set out in the charter, except as may be otherwise provided for any action required or permitted to be taken by the stockholders of the Company must be effected by a duly called annual or special meeting of such stockholders and may not be effected by written consent of the stockholders other than with respect to the Company’s Class B Common Stock with respect to which action may be taken by written consent.  \n**MEETINGS OF SHAREHOLDERS** | The quorum is set in the Parent Amended Memorandum and Articles of Association.

At such adjourned meeting at which a quorum shall be present or represented any business may be transacted which might have been transacted at the meeting as originally notified.  \n**DISTRIBUTIONS AND DIVIDENDS; REPURCHASES AND REDEMPTIONS** |  Under Irish law, the Post-Combination Company may only pay dividends and make other distributions (and, generally, make share repurchases and redemptions) out of distributable profits. In addition, no dividend may be paid or other distribution, share repurchase or redemption made by the Post-Combination Company unless the net assets of the Post-Combination Company are equal to, or exceed, the aggregate of the Post-Combination Company’s called-up share capital plus its un-distributable reserves and the dividend or other distribution, share repurchase or redemption does not reduce the Post-Combination Company’s net assets below such aggregate. The Parent Amended Memorandum and Articles of Association authorizes the Board to pay such dividends as appears to the Board to be justified by the profits of the Post-Combination Company. The Board may also recommend a dividend to be approved and declared by the Post-Combination Company shareholders at a general meeting, provided that no such dividend may exceed the amount recommended by the Board. | Stockholders have the right to receive dividends to the extent declared by the board of directors.  \n  \n181 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\n_Post-Combination Company Shareholders_ |  _Lionheart Stockholders_  \n---|---  \n**NUMBER OF DIRECTORS** |  Under the Parent Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association, the number of directors shall from time to time be not less than two nor more than seven.

Each of the successors elected to replace the class of directors whose term expires at that annual meeting shall be elected for a three-year term or until the election and qualification of their respective successors in office, subject to their earlier death, resignation or removal.  \n**VACANCIES ON BOARD OF DIRECTORS** | Any vacancy on the Board, including a vacancy that results from an increase in the number of directors or a vacancy that results from the removal of a director in accordance with the Parent Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association, may be filled by a majority of the directors then in office or by ordinary resolution of the shareholders (i.e., a simple majority of the members attending and voting).

Any or all of the other directors may be removed from office at any time, but only for cause and only by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the voting power of all then outstanding shares of the capital stock entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class.  \n**COMMITTEES** | Under the Parent Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association, the directors of Post-Combination Company may establish one or more committees  \n  \n183 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\n_Post-Combination Company Shareholders_ |  _Lionheart Stockholders_  \n---|---  \nconsisting in whole or in part of members of the Board.

We have neither engaged in any operations nor generated any revenue to date. Based on our business activities, we are a “shell company” as defined under the Securities Exchange Act, because we have no operations and nominal assets consisting solely of cash and/or cash equivalents. Our management team has an extensive track record of acquiring attractive assets at disciplined valuations, investing in growth while fostering financial discipline and improving business results. \n\n**Company History**\n\nIn January 2021, our Sponsor purchased an aggregate of 2,875,000 Founder Shares of Class B Common Stock, for an aggregate purchase price of $25,000 or approximately $0.009 per share. \n\nOn November 8, 2021 (the “** _IPO Closing Date_** ”), we consummated our IPO of 12,500,000 Public Units of the Company, including 1,000,000 Public Units issued pursuant to the full exercise of the underwriter’s over-allotment option. Each Public Unit consists of one share of Class A Common Stock, and one-half of one redeemable Public Warrant, each whole Public Warrant entitling the holder thereof to purchase one share of Class A Common Stock at an exercise price of $11.50 per share (subject to adjustment). The Public Units were sold at a price of $10.00 per Public Unit, generating gross proceeds to us of $125,000,000. \n\nSimultaneously with the IPO Closing Date, we completed the private sale (the “** _Private Placement_** ”) of 2,000,000 Company Private Warrants at a price of $1.00 per Company Private Warrant and the sale of 400,000 Company Private Units in a private placement to our Sponsor and Nomura, Northland Securities, Inc. and Drexel Hamilton, LLC, the underwriters of the IPO (the “** _IPO Underwriters_** ”), generating gross proceeds of $6,000,000. The Company Private Units are identical to the Company Public Units sold in the Public Offering, and the Company Private Warrants are identical to the Company Public Warrants except that the Company Private Warrants that so long as they are held by our Sponsor, the IPO Underwriters or their respective permitted transferees, the private shares and the private warrants (including the Class A common stock issuable upon the exercise of the private warrants) may not be transferred, assigned or sold until 30 days after the completion of our initial business combination. The sale of the Company Private Units was made pursuant to the exemption from registration contained in Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act. \n\nOn the IPO Closing Date, $126,250,000 of the gross proceeds from the Public Offering and the sale of the Company Private Units was deposited in the Trust Account with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company acting as trustee (the “** _Trustee_** ”), and we had $1,736,730 of cash held outside of the Trust Account, after payment of costs related to the Public Offering, and available for working capital purposes. We incurred $7,388,270 in transaction costs related to the Public Offering, including $2,500,000 of underwriting fees, $4,375,000 of deferred underwriting fees and $513,270 of other offering costs. \n\nFunds held in the Trust Account have been invested only in U.S. government securities, within the meaning set forth in Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act, with a maturity of 185 days or less or in any open-ended investment company that holds itself out as a money market fund, selected by the Company meeting the conditions of Rule 2a-7 of the Investment Company Act, as determined by the Company, until the earlier of: (i) the completion of an initial business combination, (ii) the redemption of any public shares properly submitted in connection with a stockholder vote to amend our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation \n\n191 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\n(a) to modify the substance or timing of the ability of holders of our public shares to seek redemption in connection with an initial business combination or our obligation to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete a Business Combination within 12 months from the closing of the Public Offering (or up to 18 months if we extend the period of time to consummate our initial business combination pursuant to any six additional one-month extension periods, (for a total of up to 18 months from the closing of the IPO Closing Date) to complete our initial business combination; provided that at the beginning of each one-month extension, our Sponsor (or its designees) must deposit into the Trust Account funds equal to thirty-three hundredths of one percent (0.33%) of the gross proceeds of the Public Offering (including such proceeds from the exercise of the IPO Underwriters’ over-allotment option in full) for each one-month extension of the time period to complete our initial business combination, in each case, in exchange for a non-interest bearing, unsecured promissory note (the “** _Extension Period_** ”) or (b) with respect to any other provision relating to stockholders’ rights or pre-business combination activity, and (iii) the redemption of our public shares if we are unable to complete our initial business combination within 12 months from the IPO Closing Date (or up to 18 months if we extend the period of time to consummate our initial business combination pursuant to any Extension Period), subject to applicable law. \n\n**Redemption Rights for Holders of Public Shares**\n\nWe will provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their shares of Class A Common Stock upon the completion of our initial business combination at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account as of two business days prior to the consummation of the initial business combination including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to us to pay our taxes, divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, subject to the limitations described herein. The amount in the Trust Account will initially be approximately $10.10 per public share. The per-share amount we will distribute to investors who properly redeem their shares will not be reduced by the deferred underwriting commissions we will pay to the IPO Underwriters. Our Sponsor, officers, directors have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to any founder shares, private shares and any public shares held by them in connection with the completion of our initial business combination. \n\n**Limitation on Redemption Rights**\n\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, if we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that a public stockholder, together with any affiliate of such stockholder or any other person with whom such stockholder is acting in concert or as a “group” (as defined under Section 13 of the Exchange Act), will be restricted from seeking redemption rights with respect to more than an aggregate of 15% of the shares sold in our Public Offering, which we refer to as the “Excess Shares.” Such restriction shall also be applicable to our affiliates. \n\nWe believe this restriction will discourage stockholders from accumulating large blocks of shares, and subsequent attempts by such holders to use their ability to exercise their redemption rights against a proposed initial business combination as a means to force us or our management to purchase their shares at a significant premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. Absent this provision, a public stockholder holding more than an aggregate of 15% of the shares sold in the Public Offering could threaten to exercise its redemption rights if such holder’s shares are not purchased by us or our management at a premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. By limiting our stockholders’ ability to redeem no more than 15% of the shares sold in the Public Offering without our prior consent, we believe we will limit the ability of a small group of stockholders to unreasonably attempt to block our ability to complete our initial business combination, particularly in connection with an initial business combination with a target that requires as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash. However, we would not be restricting our stockholders’ ability to vote all of their shares (including Excess Shares) for or against our initial business combination. \n\n192 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\n**Submission of Business Combination to a Stockholder Vote**\n\nThe Special Meeting to which this filing relates is to solicit your approval of the Business Combination. The Public Stockholders are not required to vote against the Business Combination in order to exercise their redemption rights. If the Business Combination is not completed, then Public Stockholders who elected to exercise their redemption rights will not be entitled to receive such payments. The Company has entered into a letter agreement with the Sponsor and our directors and officers pursuant to which, among other things, each such person has agreed to vote all shares of our common stock owned by it, him or her in favor of the Proposals. However, we intend to waive such obligations of the Sponsor, our directors and/or our officers to vote their shares of common stock in favor of the Proposals in respect of any shares purchased by such purchasers in Open Market Purchases. As a result, in addition to the shares of common stock held by the Sponsor and its officers and directors, Lionheart may need only 4,612,501, or 36.9% (assuming all outstanding shares are voted), or approximately 4.85% (assuming only the minimum number of shares representing a quorum are voted), of the Class A Common Stock to be voted in favour of the Business Combination in order to have the Business Combination approved. \n\n**Permitted Purchases of Our Securities**\n\nIf we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our initial stockholders, directors, officers, advisors or their affiliates may purchase public shares or public warrants in privately negotiated transactions or in the open market either prior to or following the completion of our initial business combination. There is no limit on the number of shares our initial stockholders, directors, officers, advisors or their affiliates may purchase in such transactions, subject to compliance with applicable law and Nasdaq rules. However, they have no current commitments, plans or intentions to engage in such transactions and have not formulated any terms or conditions for any such transactions. If they engage in such transactions, they will not make any such purchases when they are in possession of any material nonpublic information not disclosed to the seller or if such purchases are prohibited by Regulation M under the Exchange Act. We do not currently anticipate that such purchases, if any, would constitute a tender offer subject to the tender offer rules under the Exchange Act or a going-private transaction subject to the going-private rules under the Exchange Act; however, if the purchasers determine at the time of any such purchases that the purchases are subject to such rules, the purchasers will comply with such rules. Any such purchases will be reported pursuant to Section 13 and Section 16 of the Exchange Act to the extent such purchasers are subject to such reporting requirements. None of the funds held in the Trust Account will be used to purchase public shares or public warrants in such transactions prior to completion of our initial business combination. \n\nThe purpose of any such purchases of shares could be to vote such shares in favor of the initial business combination and thereby increase the likelihood of obtaining stockholder approval of the initial business combination or to satisfy a closing condition in an agreement with a target that requires us to have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash at the closing of our initial business combination, where it appears that such requirement would otherwise not be met. The purpose of any such purchases of public warrants could be to reduce the number of public warrants outstanding or to vote such warrants on any matters submitted to the warrantholders for approval in connection with our initial business combination. Any such purchases of our securities may result in the completion of our initial business combination that may not otherwise have been possible. In addition, if such purchases are made, the public “float” of our shares of Class A Common Stock or warrants may be reduced and the number of beneficial holders of our securities may be reduced, which may make it difficult to maintain or obtain the quotation, listing or trading of our securities on a national securities exchange. \n\nOur Sponsor, officers, directors and/or their affiliates anticipate that they may identify the stockholders with whom our Sponsor, officers, directors or their affiliates may pursue privately negotiated purchases by either the stockholders contacting us directly or by our receipt of redemption requests submitted by stockholders following \n\n193 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\nour mailing of proxy materials in connection with our initial business combination. To the extent that our Sponsor, officers, directors, advisors or their affiliates enter into a private purchase, they would identify and contact only potential selling stockholders who have expressed their election to redeem their shares for a pro rata share of the Trust Account or vote against our initial business combination, whether or not such stockholder has already submitted a proxy with respect to our initial business combination. Our Sponsor, officers, directors, advisors or their affiliates will only purchase shares if such purchases comply with Regulation M under the Exchange Act and the other federal securities laws. \n\nAny purchases by our Sponsor, officers, directors and/or their affiliates who are affiliated purchasers under Rule 10b-18 under the Exchange Act will only be made to the extent such purchases are able to be made in compliance with Rule 10b-18, which is a safe harbor from liability for manipulation under Section 9(a)(2) and Rule 10b-5 of the Exchange Act. Rule 10b-18 has certain technical requirements that must be complied with in order for the safe harbor to be available to the purchaser. Our Sponsor, officers, directors and/or their affiliates will not make purchases of our Class A Common Stock if the purchases would violate Section 9(a)(2) or Rule 10b-5 of the Exchange Act. \n\nAny such purchases will be reported pursuant to Section 13 and Section 16 of the Exchange Act to the extent such purchases are subject to such reporting requirements. \n\n**Redemption of Public Shares and Liquidation if no Initial Business Combination**\n\nOur second amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that we will have only 12 months from the closing of the Public Offering (or up to 18 months if we extend the period of time to consummate our initial business combination pursuant to any Extension Period) to complete our initial business combination. If we are unable to complete our initial business combination within such 18-month period, we will: (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, subject to lawfully available funds therefor, redeem 100% of the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to us to pay our taxes (less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders’ rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our Board, dissolve and liquidate, subject in each case to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. There will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect to our warrants, which will expire worthless if we fail to complete our initial business combination within the 18-month time period. \n\nOur Sponsor, officers and directors have agreed to waive their rights to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account with respect to any Founder Shares and private shares held by them if we fail to complete our initial business combination within 12 months from the closing of the Public Offering (or up to 18 months if we extend the period of time to consummate our initial business combination pursuant to any Extension Period). However, if our Sponsor, officers and directors acquire public shares at a later date, they will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account with respect to such public shares if we fail to complete our initial business combination within the allotted 18-month time period. \n\nOur Sponsor, officers and directors have agreed, pursuant to a written agreement with us, that they will not propose any amendment to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation (i) to modify the substance or timing of the ability of holders of our public shares to seek redemption in connection with our initial business combination or our obligation to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination within 12 months from the closing of the Public Offering (or up to 18 months if we extend the period of time to consummate our initial business combination pursuant to any Extension Period) or (ii) with respect to any \n\n194 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\nother provision relating to stockholders’ rights or pre-initial business combination activity, unless we provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem their shares of Class A Common Stock upon approval of any such amendment at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to us to pay our taxes, divided by the number of then outstanding public shares. However, we may not redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 upon consummation of our initial business combination and after payment of underwriters’ fees and commissions (so that we are not subject to the SEC’s “penny stock” rules). If this optional redemption right is exercised with respect to an excessive number of public shares such that we cannot satisfy the net tangible asset requirement (described above), we would not proceed with the amendment or the related redemption of our public shares at such time. \n\nWe expect that all costs and expenses associated with implementing our plan of dissolution, as well as payments to any creditors, will be funded from amounts remaining out of the approximately $1,736,730 of proceeds held outside the Trust Account, although we cannot assure you that there will be sufficient funds for such purpose. We will depend on sufficient interest being earned on the proceeds held in the Trust Account to pay any tax obligations we may owe. However, if those funds are not sufficient to cover the costs and expenses associated with implementing our plan of dissolution, to the extent that there is any interest accrued in the Trust Account not required to pay taxes on interest income earned on the Trust Account balance, we may request the Trustee to release to us an additional amount of up to $100,000 of such accrued interest to pay those costs and expenses. \n\nIf we were to expend all of the net proceeds of the Public Offering and the sale of the Company Private Units, other than the proceeds deposited in the Trust Account, and without taking into account interest, if any, earned on the Trust Account, the per-share redemption amount received by stockholders upon our dissolution would be approximately $10.10. The proceeds deposited in the Trust Account could, however, become subject to the claims of our creditors which would have higher priority than the claims of our public stockholders. We cannot assure you that the actual per-share redemption amount received by stockholders will not be substantially less than $10.10. Under Section 281(b) of the DGCL, our plan of dissolution must provide for all claims against us to be paid in full or make provision for payments to be made in full, as applicable, if there are sufficient assets. These claims must be paid or provided for before we make any distribution of our remaining assets to our stockholders. While we intend to pay such amounts, if any, we cannot assure you that we will have funds sufficient to pay or provide for all creditors’ claims. \n\nAlthough we will seek to have all vendors, service providers, prospective target businesses or other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the Trust Account for the benefit of our public stockholders, there is no guarantee that they will execute such agreements or even if they execute such agreements that they would be prevented from bringing claims against the Trust Account including but not limited to fraudulent inducement, breach of fiduciary responsibility or other similar claims, as well as claims challenging the enforceability of the waiver, in each case in order to gain an advantage with respect to a claim against our assets, including the funds held in the Trust Account. If any third party refuses to execute an agreement waiving such claims to the monies held in the Trust Account, our management will perform an analysis of the alternatives available to it and will only enter into an agreement with a third party that has not executed a waiver if management believes that such third party’s engagement would be significantly more beneficial to us than any alternative. Examples of possible instances where we may engage a third party that refuses to execute a waiver include the engagement of a third-party consultant whose particular expertise or skills are believed by management to be significantly superior to those of other consultants that would agree to execute a waiver or in cases where management is unable to find a service provider willing to execute a waiver. We are not aware of any product or service providers who have not or will not provide such waiver other than the underwriters of our Public Offering and our independent registered public accounting firm. \n\n195 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\nIn addition, there is no guarantee that such entities will agree to waive any claims they may have in the future as a result of, or arising out of, any negotiations, contracts or agreements with us and will not seek recourse against the Trust Account for any reason. Our Sponsor has agreed that it will be liable to us if and to the extent any claims by a third party for services rendered or products sold to us, or a prospective target business with which we have entered into a written letter of intent, confidentiality or similar agreement or business combination agreement, reduce the amount of funds in the Trust Account to below the lesser of (i) $10.10 per public share and (ii) the actual amount per public share held in the Trust Account as of the date of the liquidation of the Trust Account, if less than $10.10 per share due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, less taxes payable, provided that such liability will not apply to any claims by a third party or prospective target business who executed a waiver of any and all rights to the monies held in the Trust Account (whether or not such waiver is enforceable) nor will it apply to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of our Public Offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. However, we have not asked our Sponsor to reserve for such indemnification obligations, nor have we independently verified whether our Sponsor has sufficient funds to satisfy its indemnity obligations and believe that our Sponsor’s only assets are securities of the Company. Therefore, we cannot assure you that our Sponsor would be able to satisfy those obligations. None of our officers or directors will indemnify us for claims by third parties including, without limitation, claims by vendors and prospective target businesses. \n\nIn the event that the proceeds in the Trust Account are reduced below (i) $10.10 per public share or (ii) such lesser amount per public share held in the Trust Account as of the date of the liquidation of the Trust Account, due to reductions in value of the trust assets, in each case net of the amount of interest which may be withdrawn to pay taxes, and our Sponsor asserts that it is unable to satisfy its indemnification obligations or that it has no indemnification obligations related to a particular claim, our independent directors would determine whether to take legal action against our Sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations. While we currently expect that our independent directors would take legal action on our behalf against our Sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations to us, it is possible that our independent directors in exercising their business judgment may choose not to do so if, for example, the cost of such legal action is deemed by the independent directors to be too high relative to the amount recoverable or if the independent directors determine that a favorable outcome is not likely. We have not asked our Sponsor to reserve for such indemnification obligations and we cannot assure you that our Sponsor would be able to satisfy those obligations. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that due to claims of creditors the actual value of the per-share redemption price will not be less than $10.10 per public share. \n\nWe will seek to reduce the possibility that our sponsor will have to indemnify the trust account due to claims of creditors by endeavoring to have all vendors, service providers (except for our Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm), prospective target businesses or other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to monies held in the trust account. Our sponsor will also not be liable as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of the Public Offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. We will have access to up to approximately $1,750,000 from the proceeds of the Public Offering with which to pay any such potential claims (including costs and expenses incurred in connection with our liquidation, currently estimated to be no more than approximately $100,000). In the event that we liquidate and it is subsequently determined that the reserve for claims and liabilities is insufficient, stockholders who received funds from our trust account could be liable for claims made by creditors. In the event that our offering expenses and other operating costs exceed our estimate of $750,000, we may fund such excess with funds from the funds not to be held in the trust account. In such case, the amount of funds we intend to be held outside the trust account would decrease by a corresponding amount. Conversely, in the event that the offering expenses and other operating costs are less than our estimate of $750,000, the amount of funds we intend to be held outside the trust account would increase by a corresponding amount. \n\nUnder the DGCL, stockholders may be held liable for claims by third parties against a corporation to the extent of distributions received by them in a dissolution. The pro rata portion of our Trust Account distributed to our public stockholders upon the redemption of our public shares in the event we do not complete our initial \n\n196 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\nbusiness combination within 12 months from the closing of the Public Offering (or up to 18 months if we extend the period of time to consummate our initial business combination pursuant to any Extension Period) may be considered a liquidating distribution under Delaware law. If the Company complies with certain procedures set forth in Section 280 of the DGCL intended to ensure that it makes reasonable provision for all claims against it, including a 60-day notice period during which any third-party claims can be brought against the Company, a 90-day period during which the Company may reject any claims brought, and an additional 150-day waiting period before any liquidating distributions are made to stockholders, any liability of stockholders with respect to a liquidating distribution is limited to the lesser of such stockholder’s pro rata share of the claim or the amount distributed to the stockholder, and any liability of the stockholder would be barred after the third anniversary of the dissolution. \n\nFurthermore, if the pro rata portion of our Trust Account distributed to our public stockholders upon the redemption of our public shares in the event we do not complete our initial business combination within 12 months from the closing of the Public Offering (or up to 18 months if we extend the period of time to consummate our initial business combination pursuant to any Extension Period), is not considered a liquidating distribution under Delaware law and such redemption distribution is deemed to be unlawful (potentially due to the imposition of legal proceedings that a party may bring or due to other circumstances that are currently unknown), then pursuant to Section 174 of the DGCL, the statute of limitations for claims of creditors could then be six years after the unlawful redemption distribution, instead of three years, as in the case of a liquidating distribution. If we are unable to complete our initial business combination within 12 months from the closing of the Public Offering (or up to 18 months if we extend the period of time to consummate our initial business combination pursuant to any Extension Period), we will: (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter subject to lawfully available funds therefor, redeem 100% of the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to us to pay our taxes (less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders’ rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our Board, dissolve and liquidate, subject in each case to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. Accordingly, it is our intention to redeem our public shares as soon as reasonably possible following the expiration of such 18-month period and, therefore, we do not intend to comply with those procedures. As such, our stockholders could potentially be liable for any claims to the extent of distributions received by them (but no more) and any liability of our stockholders may extend well beyond the third anniversary of such date. \n\nBecause we will not be complying with Section 280 of the DGCL, Section 281(b) requires us to adopt a plan, based on facts known to us at such time that will provide for our payment of all existing and pending claims or claims that may be potentially brought against us within the subsequent 10 years. However, because we are a blank check company, rather than an operating company, and our operations will be limited to searching for prospective target businesses to acquire, the only likely claims to arise would be from our vendors (such as lawyers, investment bankers, etc.) or prospective target businesses. As described above, pursuant to the obligation contained in our underwriting agreement, we will seek to have all vendors, service providers, prospective target businesses or otherentities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the Trust Account. As a result of this obligation, the claims that could be made against us are significantly limited and the likelihood that any claim that would result in any liability extending to the Trust Account is remote. Further, our Sponsor may be liable only to the extent necessary to ensure that the amounts in the Trust Account are not reduced below (i) $10.10 per public share or (ii) such lesser amount per public share held in the Trust Account as of the date of the liquidation of the Trust Account, due to reductions in value of the trust assets, in each case net of the amount of interest withdrawn to pay taxes and will not be liable as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of the \n\n197 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\nPublic Offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. In the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, our Sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third-party claims. \n\nIf we file a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, the proceeds held in the Trust Account could be subject to applicable bankruptcy law, and may be included in our bankruptcy estate and subject to the claims of third parties with priority over the claims of our stockholders. To the extent any bankruptcy claims deplete the Trust Account, we cannot assure you we will be able to return $10.10 per share to our public stockholders. Additionally, if we file a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, any distributions received by stockholders could be viewed under applicable debtor/creditor and/or bankruptcy laws as either a “preferential transfer” or a “fraudulent conveyance.” As a result, a bankruptcy court could seek to recover some or all amounts received by our stockholders. Furthermore, our Board may be viewed as having breached its fiduciary duty to our creditors and/or may have acted in bad faith, thereby exposing itself and our company to claims of punitive damages, by paying public stockholders from the Trust Account prior to addressing the claims of creditors. We cannot assure you that claims will not be brought against us for these reasons. \n\nOur public stockholders will be entitled to receive funds from the Trust Account only upon the earlier to occur of: (i) the completion of our initial business combination, (ii) the redemption of any public shares properly tendered in connection with a stockholder vote to amend any provisions of our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation (A) to modify the substance or timing of the ability of holders of our public shares to seek redemption in connection with our initial business combination or our obligation to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination within 12 months from the closing of the Public Offering (or up to 18 months if we extend the period of time to consummate our initial business combination pursuant to any Extension Period) or (B) with respect to any other provision relating to stockholders’ rights or pre-initial business combination activity, and (iii) the redemption of all of our public shares if we are unable to complete our business combination within 12 months from the closing of the Public Offering (or up to 18 months if we extend the period of time to consummate our initial business combination pursuant to any Extension Period), subject to applicable law. In no other circumstances will a stockholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the Trust Account. However, in the event we seek stockholder approval in connection with our initial business combination, a stockholder’s voting in connection with the initial business combination alone will not result in a stockholder’s redeeming its shares to us for an applicable pro rata share of the Trust Account. \n\nSuch stockholder must have also exercised its redemption rights as described above. These provisions of our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation, like all provisions of our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation, may be amended with a stockholder vote. \n\n**Facilities**\n\nOur executive offices are located at 4218 NE 2nd Avenue, Miami, Florida 33137, and our telephone number is (305) 573-3900. Our executive offices are provided to us by our Sponsor. Commencing on November 2, 2021, we have agreed to pay our Sponsor a total of $15,000 per month for office space, utilities and secretarial and administrative support. We consider our current office space adequate for our current operations. \n\n**Employees**\n\nWe currently have three officers. These individuals are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters but they intend to devote as much of their time as they deem necessary to our affairs until we have completed our initial business combination. The amount of time they will devote in any time period will vary based on whether a target business has been selected for our initial business combination and the stage of the initial business combination process we are in. We do not intend to have any full-time employees prior to the completion of our initial business combination. \n\n198 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\n**Legal Proceedings**\n\nThere is no material litigation, arbitration or governmental proceeding currently pending against us or any members of our management team in their capacity as such. From time to time we may become involved in legal proceedings or may be subject to claims arising in the ordinary course of our business. Although the results of litigation and claims cannot be predicted with certainty, we currently believe that the final outcome of these ordinary course matters will not have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition or cash flows. Regardless of the outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on us because of defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources and other factors. \n\n199 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\n**MANAGEMENT OF THE COMPANY**\n\n_In this section “we,” “us,” “our” or the “Company” refer to the Company prior to the Business Combination and “Board” refers to the Board of Directors of the Company prior to the Business Combination._\n\n**Directors and Executive Officers**\n\nThe Company’s current directors and executive officers are as follows: \n\n**Name** | **Age** |  **Position**  \n---|---|---  \nOphir Sternberg | 51 | Chairman of the Board of Directors, President and Chief Executive Officer  \nPaul Rapisarda | 67 | Chief Financial Officer  \nFaquiry Diaz | 47 | Chief Operating Officer  \nJames Anderson | 72 | Director  \nThomas Byrne | 59 | Director  \nThomas Hawkins | 60 | Director  \nRoger Meltzer | 70 | Director  \n  \n**_Ophir Sternberg_** , our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer since inception, has over 28 years of experience acquiring, developing, repositioning and investing in all segments of the real estate industry, including office, industrial, retail, hospitality, ultra-luxury residential condominiums and land acquisitions.

Each member of our board of directors will be elected at our annual meetings. In accordance with Nasdaq corporate governance requirements, we are not required to hold an annual meeting until one year after our first fiscal year end following our listing on Nasdaq. \n\nOur officers are appointed by the board of directors and serve at the discretion of the board of directors, rather than for specific terms of office. Our board of directors will be authorized to appoint persons to the offices set forth in our bylaws as it deems appropriate. Our bylaws provides that our officers may consist of a Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, President, Vice Presidents, Secretary, Treasurer, Assistant Secretaries and such other offices as may be determined by the board of directors. \n\n**Director Independence**\n\nNasdaq listing standards require that a majority of our board of directors be independent. An “independent director” is defined generally as a person other than an officer or employee of the company or its subsidiaries or any other individual having a relationship, which, in the opinion of the company’s board of directors, would interfere with the director’s exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director. Our board of directors has determined that James Anderson, Thomas Byrne, Thomas Hawkins and Roger Meltzer are “independent directors” as defined in the Nasdaq listing standards and applicable SEC rules. Our independent directors will have regularly scheduled meetings at which only independent directors are present. \n\n**Officer and Director Compensation**\n\nNone of our officers or directors has received any cash compensation for services rendered to us. We have agreed to pay our Sponsor a total of $15,000 per month for office space, utilities and secretarial and administrative support. Upon completion of our initial business combination or our liquidation, we will cease paying these monthly fees. In addition, we may pay our Sponsor or any of our existing officers or directors, or any entity with which they are affiliated, a finder’s fee, consulting fee or other compensation in connection with identifying, investigating and completing our initial business combination. These individuals will also be reimbursed for any out of pocket expenses incurred in connection with activities on our behalf, such as identifying potential target businesses and performing due diligence on suitable business combinations. Our audit committee will review on a quarterly basis all payments that were made to our Sponsor, officers, directors or our or their affiliates and will determine which fees and expenses and the amount of expenses that will be reimbursed. \n\nAfter the completion of our initial business combination, directors or members of our management team who remain with us may be paid consulting or management fees from the combined company. All of these fees \n\n203 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\nwill be fully disclosed to stockholders, to the extent then known, in the tender offer materials or proxy solicitation materials furnished to our stockholders in connection with a proposed business combination. We have not established any limit on the amount of such fees that may be paid by the combined company to our directors or members of management. It is unlikely the amount of such compensation will be known at the time of the proposed business combination, because the directors of the post-combination business will be responsible for determining officer and director compensation. Any compensation to be paid to our officers will be determined, or recommended to our Board for determination, either by a compensation committee constituted solely by independent directors or by a majority of the independent directors on our Board. \n\nWe do not intend to take any action to ensure that members of our management team maintain their positions with us after the consummation of our initial business combination, although it is possible that some or all of our officers and directors may negotiate employment or consulting arrangements to remain with us after our initial business combination. The existence or terms of any such employment or consulting arrangements to retain their positions with us may influence our management’s motivation in identifying or selecting a target business but we do not believe that the ability of our management to remain with us after the consummation of our initial business combination will be a determining factor in our decision to proceed with any potential business combination. We are not party to any agreements with our officers and directors that provide for benefits upon termination of employment. \n\n**Committees of our Board of Directors**\n\nOur Board has two standing committees: an audit committee and a compensation committee. Subject to phase-in rules and a limited exception, the rules of Nasdaq and Rule 10A-3 of the Exchange Act require that the audit committee of a listed company be comprised solely of independent directors, and the rules of Nasdaq require that the compensation committee of a listed company be comprised solely of independent directors. \n\n_Audit Committee_\n\nWe have established an audit committee of the board of directors. Thomas Byrne, Thomas Hawkins and Roger Meltzer are members of our audit committee, and Thomas Byrne will chair the audit committee. Under the Nasdaq listing standards and applicable SEC rules, we are required to have at least three members of the audit committee, all of whom must be independent. Each of Thomas Byrne, Thomas Hawkins and Roger Meltzer meets the independent director standard under Nasdaq listing standards and under Rule 10-A-3(b)(1) of the Exchange Act. \n\nEach member of the audit committee is financially literate and our Board has determined that Thomas Byrne qualifies as an “audit committee financial expert” as defined in applicable SEC rules. \n\nWe adopted an audit committee charter, which details the principal functions of the audit committee, including: \n\n• |  the appointment, compensation, retention, replacement, and oversight of the work of the independent auditors and any other independent registered public accounting firm engaged by us;   \n---|---  \n• |  pre-approving all audit and permitted non-audit services to be provided by the independent auditors or any other registered public accounting firm engaged by us, and establishing pre-approval policies and procedures;   \n---|---  \n• |  reviewing and discussing with the independent auditors all relationships the auditors have with us in order to evaluate their continued independence;   \n---|---  \n• |  setting clear hiring policies for employees or former employees of the independent auditors;   \n---|---  \n• |  setting clear policies for audit partner rotation in compliance with applicable laws and regulations;   \n---|---  \n  \n204 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\n• |  obtaining and reviewing a report, at least annually, from the independent auditors describing (i) the independent auditor’s internal quality-control procedures and (ii) any material issues raised by the most recent internal quality-control review, or peer review, of the audit firm, or by any inquiry or investigation by governmental or professional authorities within the preceding five years respecting one or more independent audits carried out by the firm and any steps taken to deal with such issues;   \n---|---  \n• |  reviewing and approving any related party transaction required to be disclosed pursuant to Item 404 of Regulation S-K promulgated by the SEC prior to us entering into such transaction; and   \n---|---  \n• |  reviewing with management, the independent auditors, and our legal advisors, as appropriate, any legal, regulatory or compliance matters, including any correspondence with regulators or government agencies and any employee complaints or published reports that raise material issues regarding our financial statements or accounting policies and any significant changes in accounting standards or rules promulgated by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, the SEC or other regulatory authorities.   \n---|---  \n  \n_Compensation Committee_\n\nWe have established a compensation committee of the board of directors. James Anderson, Thomas Byrne and Thomas Hawkins are members of our compensation committee. Under the Nasdaq listing standards and applicable SEC rules, we are required to have at least two members of the compensation committee, all of whom must be independent. James Anderson, Thomas Byrne and Thomas Hawkins are independent and James Anderson will chair the compensation committee. \n\nWe adopted a compensation committee charter, which details the principal functions of the compensation committee, including: \n\n• |  reviewing and approving on an annual basis the corporate goals and objectives relevant to our Chief Executive Officer’s compensation, evaluating our Chief Executive Officer’s performance in light of such goals and objectives and determining and approving the remuneration (if any) of our Chief Executive Officer based on such evaluation;   \n---|---  \n• |  reviewing and approving on an annual basis the compensation of all of our other officers;   \n---|---  \n• |  reviewing on an annual basis our executive compensation policies and plans;   \n---|---  \n• |  implementing and administering our incentive compensation equity-based remuneration plans;   \n---|---  \n• |  assisting management in complying with our proxy statement and annual report disclosure requirements;   \n---|---  \n• |  approving all special perquisites, special cash payments and other special compensation and benefit arrangements for our officers and employees;   \n---|---  \n• |  if required, producing a report on executive compensation to be included in our annual proxy statement; and   \n---|---  \n• |  reviewing, evaluating and recommending changes, if appropriate, to the remuneration for directors.   \n---|---  \n  \nNotwithstanding the foregoing, as indicated above, other than (i) the payment to our sponsor of $15,000 per month, for up to 12 months, for office space, utilities and secretarial and administrative support and reimbursement of expenses, and (ii) the payment of a finder’s fee to one or more of the independent directors to the extent such director(s) render services in connection with locating the target business with which a successful business combination transaction is consummated, no compensation of any kind, including finders, consulting or other similar fees, will be paid to any of our existing stockholders, officers, directors or any of their respective affiliates, prior to, or for any services they render in order to effectuate the consummation of an initial business \n\n205 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\ncombination. Accordingly, it is likely that prior to the consummation of an initial business combination, the compensation committee will only be responsible for the review and recommendation of any compensation arrangements to be entered into in connection with such initial business combination. \n\nThe charter provides that the compensation committee may, in its sole discretion, retain or obtain the advice of a compensation consultant, legal counsel or other adviser and will be directly responsible for the appointment, compensation and oversight of the work of any such adviser. However, before engaging or receiving advice from a compensation consultant, external legal counsel or any other adviser, the compensation committee will consider the independence of each such adviser, including the factors required by Nasdaq and the SEC. \n\n**Director Nominations**\n\nWe do not have a standing nominating committee. In accordance with Rule 5605(e)(2) of the Nasdaq rules, a majority of a listed company’s independent directors may recommend a director nominee for selection by the board of directors. Our Board believes that the independent directors can satisfactorily carry out the responsibility of properly selecting or approving director nominees without the formation of a standing nominating committee. As there is no standing nominating committee, we do not have a nominating committee charter in place. \n\nOur Board will also consider director candidates recommended for nomination by our stockholders during such times as they are seeking proposed nominees to stand for election at the next annual meeting of stockholders (or, if applicable, a special meeting of stockholders). Our stockholders that wish to nominate a director for election to the Board are advised to follow the procedures set forth in our bylaws. \n\nWe have not formally established any specific, minimum qualifications that must be met or skills that are necessary for director nominees. In general, in identifying and evaluating nominees for director, our Board considers educational background, diversity of professional experience, knowledge of our business, integrity, professional reputation, independence, wisdom, and the ability to represent the best interests of our stockholders. \n\n**Code of Ethics**\n\nWe adopted a Code of Ethics applicable to our directors, officers and employees, and we have filed a copy of our Code of Ethics as an exhibit to this Annual Report on Form 10-K. You will be able to review our Code of Ethics by accessing our public filings at the SEC’s web site at www.sec.gov. In addition, a copy of our Code of Ethics will be provided without charge upon request from us. We intend to disclose any amendments to or waivers of certain provisions of our Code of Ethics in a Current Report on Form 8-K.\n\n**Conflicts of Interest**\n\nEach of our officers and directors presently has, and any of them in the future may have additional, fiduciary or contractual obligations to other entities pursuant to which such officer or director is or will be required to present a business combination opportunity. If these entities decide to pursue any such opportunity, we may be precluded from pursuing such opportunities. Accordingly, if any of our officers or directors becomes aware of a business combination opportunity which is suitable for an entity to which he or she has then-current fiduciary or contractual obligations to present the opportunity to such entity, he or she may honor his or her fiduciary or contractual obligations to present such opportunity to such entity first, and only present it to us if such entities reject the opportunity and he or she determines to present the opportunity to us. These conflicts may not be resolved in our favor and a potential target business may be presented to another entity prior to its presentation to us. Our sponsor and directors and officers are also not prohibited from sponsoring, investing or otherwise becoming involved with, any other blank check companies, including in connection with their initial business combinations, prior to us completing our initial business combination. Our management team, in their capacities \n\n206 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\nas directors, officers or employees of our sponsor or its affiliates or in their other endeavors, may choose to present potential business combinations to the related entities described above, current or future entities affiliated with or managed by our sponsor, or third parties, before they present such opportunities to us, subject to his or her fiduciary duties under Delaware law and any other applicable fiduciary duties. For example, Messrs. Sternberg and Rapisarda are currently officers or directors of the Company and each owes fiduciary duties to the Company, which may compete with us for acquisition opportunities. We believe, however, that the fiduciary duties or contractual obligations of our officers or directors will not materially affect our ability to complete our initial business combination. Our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that we renounce our interest in any corporate opportunity offered to any director or officer unless such opportunity is expressly offered to such person solely in his or her capacity as a director or officer of our company and such opportunity is one we are legally and contractually permitted to undertake and would otherwise be reasonable for us to pursue, and to the extent the director or officer is permitted to refer that opportunity to us without violating another legal obligation. For additional discussion on how our board of directors considered the conflicts of interest described in this section see “Lionheart’s Board of Directors’ Reasons for the Approval of the Business Combination.” \n\nIn March 2020, Mr. Sternberg became Chairman of OPES. On June 30, 2020, OPES announced a definitive agreement to merge with BurgerFi. The OPES-BurgerFi merger closed on December 16, 2020. Mr. Sternberg remains the Executive Chairman of the post-combination company, BurgerFi. In addition, since its inception in December 2019, Mr. Sternberg has been the Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Lionheart II, a SPAC. Lionheart II completed its initial public offering in August 2020, in which it sold 23,000,000 units (including the exercise of the underwriters’ over-allotment option), each unit consisting of one share of Lionheart II Class A common stock and one-half of one redeemable warrant for one share of Lionheart II Class A common stock, for an offering price of $10.00 per unit, generating aggregate proceeds of $230,000,000. Lionheart II’s units, shares of Class A common stock and warrants currently trade on Nasdaq under the symbols “LIONU,” “LION” and “LIONW,” respectively. On July 12, 2021, Lionheart II announced a $32.6 billion business combination with MSP Recovery, a leader in data-driven solutions that recovers improperly paid benefits on behalf of Medicare, Medicaid and other commercial payers. The Lionheart II-MSP merger closed on May 23, 2022. The combined company is listed on Nasdaq under the ticker symbol “MSPR.” \n\n_Chairman Agreement_\n\nMr. Ophir Sternberg and Parent entered into a Chairman Agreement (the “Chairman Agreement”). Pursuant to the Chairman Agreement, beginning at the closing of the Business Combination, Mr. Sternberg will serve as the Chairman of the Board of Directors of Parent (the “Parent Board”) for so long as he serves as a member of the Parent Board, unless he is earlier terminated. Mr. Sternberg will not receive any cash compensation for his service on the Parent Board nor will he be entitled to participate in any employee benefit plans of Parent. \n\nThe Chairman Agreement provides that Mr. Sternberg will be granted restricted stock units of Parent representing 3% of the issued and outstanding Parent Shares as of the grant date in accordance with and subject to the terms and conditions of the Parent’s 2022 Incentive Plan. Mr. Sternberg’s restricted stock units are subject to time-based vesting, as follows: 20% vest on the grant date, and the remaining restricted stock units will vest in quarterly installments thereafter over a period of three years subject to his continued service on the Parent Board as of each vesting date subject to earlier vesting as forth below. \n\nIn the event of the expiration or termination of the Chairman Agreement for any reason other than termination for Cause (as defined in the Chairman Agreement), any unvested outstanding equity awards held by Mr. Sternberg will immediately vest and become nonforfeitable. In the event of the termination of the Chairman Agreement by Parent for Cause, all unvested outstanding equity awards will be cancelled and forfeited, and Mr. Sternberg will not be entitled to any payment in connection therewith. \n\nThe Chairman Agreement states that Mr. Sternberg will honor his confidentiality obligations after the termination of his services. \n\n207 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\n_Independent Contractor Agreement_\n\nMr. Faquiry Diaz and Parent entered into an independent contractor agreement (the “Independent Contractor Agreement”). The Independent Contractor Agreement provides for an initial term of three years that automatically renews for one-year terms thereafter, so long as Ophir Sternberg is the Chairman of the Parent Board. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Independent Contractor Agreement is terminable by either party at any time, with or without Cause (as defined in the Independent Contractor Agreement), effective upon notice to the other party. \n\nIn exchange for his services, Mr. Diaz Cala will be compensated and reimbursed in the total amount of $84,000, annually, payable in twelve equal monthly payments. In addition, the Independent Contractor Agreement provides that Mr. Diaz Cala will be granted restricted stock units of Parent representing 1% of the issued and outstanding Parent Shares as of the grant date in accordance with and subject to the terms and conditions of Parent’s 2022 Incentive Plan. Mr. Diaz Cala’s restricted stock units are subject to time-based vesting, as follows: 20% vest on the grant date, and the remaining restricted stock units will vest in quarterly installments thereafter over a period of three years subject to his continued service on the Parent Board as of each vesting date subject to earlier vesting as set forth below. \n\nIn the event of the termination of the Independent Contractor Agreement by Parent without Cause or upon a Change in Control (each such term as defined in the Independent Contractor Agreement), any unvested outstanding equity awards held by Mr. Diaz Cala will immediately vest and become nonforfeitable. In the event of the termination of the Independent Contractor Agreement for Cause by the Company or for any reason by Mr. Diaz Cala, all unvested outstanding equity awards will be cancelled and forfeited without consideration. \n\nThe Independent Contractor Agreement also contains non-solicitation and non-competition covenants, generally prohibiting Mr. Diaz Cala from (i) soliciting or hiring employees or business contacts during the one-year period that follows the termination of the Independent Contractor Agreement and (ii) directly or indirectly competing with Parent during the term of the Independent Contractor Agreement. In addition, the Independent Contractor Agreement states that Mr. Diaz Cala will honor his confidentiality obligations after the termination of his services. \n\nThe only discussions involving continuing employment or involvement for any persons affiliated with Lionheart before the Business Combination were with Ophir Sternberg relating to the Chairman Agreement with Parent and with Faquiry Diaz relating to an independent contractor agreement, with Parent, which provides for certain services to the Post-Combination Company. There has not been any formal or informal commitment to retain any financial advisors after the Business Combination, and there are no pre-existing relationships between Lionheart (or individuals affiliated with Lionheart) and additional investors. \n\nInvestors should also be aware of the following other potential conflicts of interest: \n\n• |  None of our officers or directors is required to commit his or her full time to our affairs and, accordingly, may have conflicts of interest in allocating his or her time among various business activities.   \n---|---  \n• |  In the course of their other business activities, our officers and directors may become aware of investment and business opportunities which may be appropriate for presentation to us as well as the other entities with which they are affiliated. Our management may have conflicts of interest in determining to which entity a particular business opportunity should be presented.   \n---|---  \n• |  Our Sponsor, officers and directors have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to any Founder Shares, private shares and any public shares held by them in connection with the consummation of our initial business combination. Additionally, our Sponsor, officers and directors have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to any Founder Shares and private shares held by them if we fail to consummate our initial business combination within 18 months after the IPO   \n---|---  \n  \n208 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\nClosing Date. If we do not complete our initial business combination within such 18-month period, the proceeds of the sale of the Company Private Units held in the Trust Account will be used to fund the redemption of our public shares, and the Company Private Warrants will expire worthless. With certain limited exceptions, the Founder Shares will not be transferable, assignable by our Sponsor until the earlier of: (A) six months after the completion of our initial business combination or (B) subsequent to our initial business combination, (x) if the last reported sale price of our Class A Common Stock equals or exceeds $12.00 per share (as adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like) for any 20 trading days within any 30-trading day period commencing at least 30 days after our initial business combination, or (y) the date on which we complete a liquidation, merger, capital stock exchange, reorganization or other similar transaction that results in all of our stockholders having the right to exchange their shares of common stock for cash, securities or other property. With certain limited exceptions, the private shares and the private warrants and the Class A Common Stock underlying such warrants, will not be transferable, assignable or saleable by the initial purchasers of the Company Private Units or their permitted transferees until 30 days after the completion of our initial business combination. Since our Sponsor and officers and directors may directly or indirectly own common stock and warrants following our Public Offering, our officers and directors may have a conflict of interest in determining whether a particular target business is an appropriate business with which to effectuate our initial business combination. Permitted transferees of the Founder Shares would be subject to the same restrictions   \n---  \n• |  Our officers and directors may have a conflict of interest with respect to evaluating a particular business combination if the retention or resignation of any such officers and directors was included by a target business as a condition to any agreement with respect to our initial business combination.   \n---|---  \n• |  Our Sponsor, officers or directors may have a conflict of interest with respect to evaluating a business combination and financing arrangements as we may obtain loans from our sponsor or an affiliate of our sponsor or any of our officers or directors to finance transaction costs in connection with an intended initial business combination. Up to $1,500,000 of such loans may be convertible into units, at a price of $10.00 per unit, or warrants, at a price of $1.00 per warrant, at the option of the lender. The units would be identical to the private placement units and the warrants would be identical to the private placement warrants.   \n---|---  \n  \nThe conflicts described above may not be resolved in our favor. \n\nIn general, officers and directors of a corporation incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware are required to present business opportunities to a corporation if: \n\n• |  the corporation could financially undertake the opportunity;   \n---|---  \n• |  the opportunity is within the corporation’s line of business; and   \n---|---  \n• |  it would not be fair to our company and its stockholders for the opportunity not to be brought to the attention of the corporation.   \n---|---  \n  \nAccordingly, as a result of multiple business affiliations, our officers and directors may have similar legal obligations relating to presenting business opportunities meeting the above-listed criteria to multiple entities. Furthermore, our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that we renounce our interest in any corporate opportunity offered to any director or officer unless such opportunity is expressly offered to such person solely in his or her capacity as a director or officer of our company and such opportunity is one we are legally and contractually permitted to undertake and would otherwise be reasonable for us to pursue, and to the extent the director or officer is permitted to refer that opportunity to us without violating another legal obligation. \n\n209 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\nBelow is a table summarizing the entities to which our executive officers and directors currently have fiduciary duties or contractual obligations: \n\n**Individual** |  **Entity** |  **Entity’s Business** |  **Affiliation**  \n---|---|---|---  \n**_Ophir Sternberg_** | BurgerFi International, Inc. | Restaurant chain company | Executive Chairman  \nMSP Recovery, Inc. |  Legal Services  |  Director  \nLionheart Capital LLC | Real estate investment firm | Chief Executive Officer  \nLionheart Management LLC | Real estate holding company | Manager  \nOut of the Box Ventures LLC | Retail space redevelopment company | Manager  \nWhitecap Lofts, LLC | Retail space redevelopment company | Manager  \n6610 Mooretown Road, LLC | Retail real estate company | Manager  \nContrarian Retail Partners, LLC | Retail real estate company | Chairman  \nOZ Holdings of Miami, LLC | Retail real estate company | Chief Executive Officer  \nLionheart MH, LLC | Retail real estate company | Chief Executive Officer  \n4701 N Meridian, LLC | Retail real estate company | Chief Executive Officer  \nStar Mountain Properties, LLC | Retail real estate company | Chief Executive Officer  \nChicago LH Ventures, LLC | Retail real estate company | Chief Executive Officer  \n4300 NE 2nd, LLC | Retail real estate company | Chief Executive Officer  \n**_Paul Rapisarda_** | Lionheart Capital LLC | Real estate investment firm | Chief Financial Officer  \nLionheart Management LLC | Real estate holding company | Chief Financial Officer  \nOut of the Box Ventures LLC | Retail space redevelopment company | Chief Financial Officer  \nGarrison Capital Advisors LLC | Financial consulting and advisory services company | Sole Member  \nWhitecap Lofts, LLC | Retail space redevelopment company | Chief Financial Officer  \n6610 Mooretown Road, LLC | Retail real estate company | Chief Financial Officer  \nContrarian Retail Partners, LLC | Retail real estate company | Chief Financial Officer  \n**_Faquiry Diaz_** | Lionheart Capital LLC | Real estate investment firm | Chief Operating Officer  \nBurgerFi International, Inc. | Restaurant chain company | Chief of Mergers and Acquisitions and Corporate Strategy  \n**_Thomas Byrne_** | Kaptyn Holding Corp. | Electric Vehicle Rideshare Company | Co-Founder and Chief Strategy Officer  \nNew River Capital Partners, LP | Private Equity Fund | General Partner  \nITC Learning LLC | Online learning company | Board of Managers  \nCrystal Team LTD (T/A LDN CBD) | CBD Retailer | Director  \nThe Transformational Travel Council SPC | Educational Company | Director  \n  \n210 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\n**Individual** |  **Entity** |  **Entity’s Business** |  **Affiliation**  \n---|---|---|---  \nFriends of Birch State Park 501(c)(3) | Fundraising | Treasurer and Director  \n**_Thomas Hawkins_** |  MSP Recovery, Inc. |  Legal Services | Director  \nAlumni Association of the University of Michigan | Educational Outreach | Director  \nJumptuit Inc. | Data Analytics Technology Company | Director  \n**_Roger Meltzer, Esq._** | DLA Piper LLP (US) | Legal services | Partner  \nHaymaker Acquisition Corp.

These entities may compete with us for acquisition opportunities. If these entities decide to pursue any such opportunity, we may be precluded from pursuing such opportunities. \n\nThe Company has limited the application of the “corporate opportunity” doctrine in the Existing Charter. The corporate opportunity doctrine generally provides that, as part of his or her duty of loyalty to the corporation and its stockholders, a director may not take a business opportunity for his or her own if: (1) the corporation is financial able to exploit the opportunity; (2) the opportunity is within the corporation’s line of business; (3) the corporation has an interest or expectancy in the opportunity; and (4) by taking the opportunity for his or her own, the self-interest of the director will be brought into conflict with the director’s duties to the Corporation. Section 122(17) of the DGCL expressly permits a Delaware corporation to renounce in its certificate of incorporation any interest or expectancy of the corporation in, or in being offered an opportunity to participate in, specified business opportunities or specified classes or categories of business opportunities that are presented to the corporation or its officers, directors or stockholders. Accordingly, the Existing Charter provides that the corporate opportunity doctrine shall not apply with respect to the Company or any of its officers or directors. The Company does not believe that the limitation of the application of the corporate opportunity doctrine in the Existing Charter had any impact on its search for a potential business combination. \n\nWe are not prohibited from pursuing an initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers or directors. However, in the event we seek to complete our initial business combination with such a company, we, or a committee of independent directors, would obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm that is a member of FINRA or from an independent accounting firm, that such an initial business combination is fair to our company from a financial point of view. \n\nIn the event that we submit our initial business combination to our public stockholders for a vote, our sponsor, officers and directors have agreed to vote any founder shares and private shares held by them and any public shares purchased during or after the Public Offering (including in open market and privately negotiated transactions) in favor of our initial business combination. \n\n211 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\n**Limitation on Liability and Indemnification of Officers and Directors**\n\nOur second amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that our officers and directors will be indemnified by us to the fullest extent authorized by Delaware law, as it now exists or may in the future be amended. In addition, our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that our directors will not be personally liable for monetary damages to us or our stockholders for breaches of their fiduciary duty as directors, unless they violated their duty of loyalty to us or our stockholders, acted in bad faith, knowingly or intentionally violated the law, authorized unlawful payments of dividends, unlawful stock purchases or unlawful redemptions, or derived an improper personal benefit from their actions as directors. \n\nWe will enter into agreements with our officers and directors to provide contractual indemnification in addition to the indemnification provided for in our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation. Our bylaws also permit us to secure insurance on behalf of any officer, director or employee for any liability arising out of his or her actions, regardless of whether Delaware law would permit such indemnification. We have purchased a policy of directors’ and officers’ liability insurance that insures our officers and directors against the cost of defense, settlement or payment of a judgment in some circumstances and insures us against our obligations to indemnify our officers and directors. \n\nThese provisions may discourage stockholders from bringing a lawsuit against our directors for breach of their fiduciary duty. These provisions also may have the effect of reducing the likelihood of derivative litigation against officers and directors, even though such an action, if successful, might otherwise benefit us and our stockholders. Furthermore, a stockholder’s investment may be adversely affected to the extent we pay the costs of settlement and damage awards against officers and directors pursuant to these indemnification provisions. \n\nWe believe that these provisions, the directors’ and officers’ liability insurance and the indemnity agreements are necessary to attract and retain talented and experienced officers and directors. \n\n212 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\n**LIONHEART’S MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS**\n\n_The following discussion and analysis of the Company’s financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the Company’s financial statements and the notes thereto contained elsewhere in this proxy statement/prospectus. Certain information contained in the discussion, including, but not limited to, those described under the heading “Risk Factors” and analysis set forth below includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. References in this section to “Lionheart,” “we,” “us,” “our” and “the Company” are intended to mean the business and operations of the Company._\n\n**Overview**\n\nWe are a blank check company formed under the laws of the State of Delaware on January 14, 2021 for the purpose of entering into a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses or entities. We intend to effectuate the Business Combination using cash from the proceeds of the IPO and the sale of the Private Placement Warrants, our capital stock, debt or a combination of cash, stock and debt. \n\nWe expect to continue to incur significant costs in the pursuit of our acquisition plans. We cannot assure you that our plans to complete a Business Combination will be successful. \n\n**Results of Operations**\n\nWe have neither engaged in any operations nor generated any revenues to date. Our only activities from January 14, 2021 (inception) through September 30, 2022 were organizational activities, those necessary to prepare for the IPO, described below, and identifying a target company for a Business Combination. We do not expect to generate any operating revenues until after the completion of our Business Combination. We generate non-operating income in the form of interest income on marketable securities held in the Trust Account. We incur expenses as a result of being a public company (for legal, financial reporting, accounting and auditing compliance), as well as for due diligence expenses. \n\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2022, we had net loss of $1,870,904, which consisted of operating costs of $2,327,837 and a provision for income taxes of $101,735, offset by interest earned on marketable securities held in the Trust Account of $558,668. \n\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2022, we had net loss of $3,223,607, which consisted of operating costs of $3,840,607 and a provision for income taxes of $115,301, offset by interest earned on marketable securities held in the Trust Account of $732,301. \n\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2021, we had net loss of $2,830, which consisted of operating and formation costs. \n\nFor the period from January 14, 2021 (inception) through September 30, 2021, we had net loss of $3,859, which consisted of operating and formation costs. \n\n**Liquidity and Capital Resources**\n\nOn November 8, 2021, we consummated the IPO of 12,500,000 Units, which includes the full exercise by the underwriter of its over-allotment option in the amount of 1,000,000 Units, at $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of $125,000,000. Simultaneously with the closing of the IPO, we consummated the sale of 2,000,000 Private Placement Warrant at a price of $1.00 per Private Placement Warrant and the sale of 400,000 Private Placement Units in a private placement to the Sponsor, Nomura, and the Underwriters, generating gross proceeds of $6,000,000. \n\n213 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\nFollowing the IPO on November 8, 2021, including the full exercise of the over-allotment option, and the Private Placement, a total of $126,250,000 (or $10.10 per Unit) was placed in the Trust Account. We incurred $7,438,270 in IPO related costs, including $2,500,000 of underwriting fees, $4,375,000 of deferred underwriting fees, and $513,270 of other offering costs. \n\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2022, cash used in operating activities was $911,630. Net loss of $3,223,607 was affected by interest earned on marketable securities held in the Trust Account of $732,301. Changes in operating assets and liabilities used $3,044,278 of cash for operating activities. \n\nFor the period from January 14, 2021 (inception) through September 30, 2021, cash used in operating activities was $410. Net loss of $3,859 was affected by changes in operating assets and liabilities, which provided $3,449 of cash for operating activities. \n\nAs of September 30, 2022, we had marketable securities held in the Trust Account of $126,983,891 (including approximately $734,000 of interest income) consisting of money market funds primarily invested in U.S. Treasury Bills. Interest income on the balance in the Trust Account may be used by us to pay taxes. Through September 30, 2022, we have not withdrawn any interest earned from the Trust Account. \n\nWe intend to use substantially all of the funds held in the Trust Account, including any amounts representing interest earned on the Trust Account (less income taxes payable), to complete our Business Combination. To the extent that our capital stock or debt is used, in whole or in part, as consideration to complete our Business Combination, the remaining proceeds held in the Trust Account will be used as working capital to finance the operations of the target business or businesses, make other acquisitions and pursue our growth strategies. \n\nAs of September 30, 2022, we had cash of $490,218. We intend to use the funds held outside the Trust Account primarily to identify and evaluate target businesses, perform business due diligence on prospective target businesses, travel to and from the offices, plants or similar locations of prospective target businesses or their representatives or owners, review corporate documents and material agreements of prospective target businesses, and structure, negotiate and complete a Business Combination. \n\nIn order to fund working capital deficiencies or finance transaction costs in connection with a Business Combination, the Sponsor, or certain of our officers and directors or their affiliates may, but are not obligated to, loan us funds as may be required. If we complete a Business Combination, we would repay such loaned amounts. In the event that a Business Combination does not close, we may use a portion of the working capital held outside the Trust Account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our Trust Account would be used for such repayment. Up to $1,500,000 of such Working Capital Loans may be convertible into units of the post-Business Combination entity at a price of $10.10 per unit. The units would be identical to the Private Placement Units. \n\n**Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements **\n\nWe have no obligations, assets or liabilities, which would be considered off-balance sheet arrangements as of September 30, 2022. We do not participate in transactions that create relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, often referred to as variable interest entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements. We have not entered into any off-balance sheet financing arrangements, established any special purpose entities, guaranteed any debt or commitments of other entities, or purchased any non-financial assets. \n\n**Contractual obligations**\n\nWe do not have any long-term debt, capital lease obligations, operating lease obligations or long-term liabilities, other than an agreement to pay the Sponsor a total of $15,000 per month for office space, utilities and \n\n214 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\nsecretarial and administrative support. We began incurring these fees on November 2, 2021 and will continue to incur these fees monthly until the earlier of the completion of the Business Combination and our liquidation. \n\nThe underwriters are entitled to a deferred fee of $0.35 per Unit, or $4,375,000 in the aggregate. The deferred fee will become payable to the underwriters from the amounts held in the Trust Account solely in the event that the Company completes a Business Combination, subject to the terms of the underwriting agreement. \n\n**Critical Accounting Policies**\n\nThe preparation of condensed financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and income and expenses during the periods reported. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates. We have identified the following critical accounting policies: \n\n_Class A Common Stock Subject to Possible Redemption_\n\nWe account for our common stock subject to possible conversion in accordance with the guidance in Accounting Standards Codification (“** _ASC_** ”) Topic 480 “Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity.” Common stock subject to mandatory redemption is classified as a liability instrument and measured at fair value. Conditionally redeemable common stock (including common stock that features redemption rights that are either within the control of the holder or subject to redemption upon the occurrence of uncertain events not solely within our control) is classified as temporary equity. At all other times, common stock is classified as stockholders’ equity. Our common stock features certain redemption rights that are considered to be outside of our control and subject to occurrence of uncertain future events. Accordingly, common stock subject to possible redemption is presented at redemption value as temporary equity, outside of the stockholders’ deficit section of our condensed balance sheets. \n\n_Net Loss Per Common Share_\n\nWe comply with accounting and disclosure requirements of FASB ASC Topic 260, “Earnings Per Share”. We have two classes of shares, which are referred to as Class A common stock and Class B common stock. Income and losses are shared pro rata between the two classes of shares. Net income (loss) per common share is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of common stock outstanding for the period. Accretion associated with the redeemable shares of Class A common stock is excluded from earnings per share as the redemption value approximates fair value. \n\n_Recent Accounting Standards_\n\nManagement does not believe that there are any other recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting standards, that if currently adopted, would have a material effect on our condensed financial statements. \n\n215 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\n**MANAGEMENT OF THE POST-COMBINATION COMPANY FOLLOWING THE BUSINESS COMBINATION**\n\n_References in this section to “we,” “our,” “us” and the “Company” generally refer to SMX and its consolidated subsidiaries prior to the Business Combination and to the Post-Combination Company and its consolidated subsidiaries after giving effect to the Business Combination._\n\n**Management and Board of Directors**\n\nThe following sets forth certain information, as of January 19, 2023, concerning the persons who are expected to serve as executive officers and members of the Board following the consummation of the Business Combination.

Its vision is to build confidence in the era of the digital economy, enabling parties to maintain trust in physical assets and processes. Its transformative solution aims at building on the principles of The United Nations’ Sustainability Development Goals, particularly Goal 12: “Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns” that can create value for participants in the circular economy. As an increasing number of industries and sectors are committing to using recycled material and realizing the broader strategic vision of net zero carbon emissions, SMX believes its solution is the next generation for sustainability and the circular economy. \n\n**History**\n\nSMX Israel was incorporated in 2014 to provide brand protection and supply chain integrity solutions to businesses. It provides these solutions through the commercialization of the initial technology of tracking and tracing materials by observing and identifying markers (the “Source IP”). SMX’s Source IP was initiated from the Soreq Nuclear Research Center, an Israeli government research and development institute for nuclear and photonic technologies under the Israeli Atomic Energy Commission (“Soreq”). In January 2015, SMX Israel entered into the Isorad License Agreement with Isorad Ltd. (an IP holding company of Soreq) to license the Source IP and develop and commercialize the technology (the “Isorad License Agreement”). Under the Isorad License Agreement, as amended, the Source IP can be utilized in almost any industry and with any product. \n\nIn 2018, SMX Israel merged into Security Matters Limited, an Australian company, to effect a listing on the Australian Securities Exchange under the symbol “ASX: SMX.” SMX has four wholly owned subsidiaries: Security Matters Ltd., an Israeli company, Security Matters France, a French company, Security Matters Canada Ltd., a Canadian company, and SMX Beverages Pty Ltd., an Australian company. It also holds 50% of Yahaloma Technologies Inc., a Canadian company and 44.4% of trueGold Consortium Pty Ltd., an Australian company. \n\n**Overview**\n\nSMX provides one solution to solve both authentication and track and trace challenges in order to uphold supply chain integrity and provide quality assurance and brand accountability to producers of goods. Its technology works as a track and trace system using a marker, a reader and an algorithm to identify embedded sub-molecular particles in order to track and trace different components along a production process (or any other marked good along a supply chain) to the end producer. \n\nIts proprietary marker system embeds a permanent or removable (depending on the needs of the customer) mark on solid, liquid or gaseous objects or materials. Each marker is comprised of a combination of marker codes such that each marker is designed to be unique and unable to be duplicated. The marker system is coupled with an innovative patented reader that responds to signals from the marker and, together with a patented algorithm, captures the details of the product retrieved and stored on a blockchain digital ledger. Each marker can be stored, either locally on the reader and on private servers, cloud servers or on a blockchain ledger, to protect data integrity and custody. \n\n**Business Model**\n\nSMX’s business model targets leading brands and manufacturers (as opposed to directly targeting consumers) in order to create a new market standard for circular economy solutions, brand authentication and \n\n220 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\nsupply chain integrity. SMX offers both business-to-business sales and “white label” solutions, depending on the needs of customers and the ultimate end use based on either a fixed fee or volume-based revenue model (or both). \n\nSMX may work directly with the manufacturer of the products or through the manufacturer’s raw material supplier so that the manufacturer is not required to change (or is required to make no more than minimal changes to) its manufacturing process in order to implement SMX technology in the production process. Gaining the trust of raw material producers is the first stage, which in turn allows for credibility and trust when supplying solutions to brand owners, manufacturers and suppliers, which is a key step for its success. \n\n**Product and Applications**\n\n**_Product_**\n\nSMX provides a solution comprised of three components: (1) a physical or chemical marker system coupled with (2) a reader and connected to (3) a blockchain digital platform. \n\n_Markers_\n\nMarkers are embedded sub-molecular particles applied to a solid, liquid or gas. SMX uses various building blocks, comprised of a variety of molecules, to serve as markers for materials and products. For each project, its team selects a combination of molecules based on the specification of the customer and marked material (for example, the marked medium, the production process, the end use of the product and regulatory requirements, among others). SMX’s innovative reader can identify the marker and identify a response at a sub molecular building block level, designed to make the marker identification more accurate. \n\nThe ability to more accurately identify the concentration level of a marker allows SMX to use numerous markings from a variety of different molecules. This enables it to not only identify the marker, but also identify the concentration within a product within a pre-defined range and “read” whether the marked material was diluted (authenticating not only the marked goods but also identifying the quantity). \n\nBased on the specifications of the marked product, SMX can mark materials based on several techniques, allowing its solution to be implemented across materials and processes. Markers can carry information denoting each origins of manufacture, product provenance, date of production and many other types of data, depending on customer needs. \n\nSMX can produce either permanent or removable markers that can be applied either topically or internally to material in any state of matter (solid, liquid or gas) to form an “Intelligence on Things,” or “IOT2” marking system. The IOT2 concept involves marking products during or after the manufacturing process by inserting or applying materials to the products and encoding information through this process, namely by the treatment of materials or affixing and embedding product authentication security devices. The IOT2 concept allows for materials in a wide variety of products to be protected against counterfeiting, tampering, and diversion, and to help ensure the integrity of genuine products and manage the supply chain and logistics processes. \n\nThe marker supports invisible, indelible, and non-damaging tracking of distinctive molecules designed to ensure uniqueness and prevent duplication or counterfeiting. The marker is designed to not in any way affect the properties of the material it is applied to – it simply becomes a part of that material. The molecules are designed to be inert, inactive, and invisible to the human eye. \n\n_Readers_\n\nMarkers are embedded in the material and can only be read by designated readers. A reader scans for the existence of markers. If the reading satisfies a pre-determined condition set by SMX (which can be \n\n221 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\nprogrammed), than the reader can identify the marked product and convey information about such product to the customer. \n\nSMX currently utilizes an x-ray wave reader that is modified according to its specifications to allow it to scan its proprietary markers. The reader and SMX’s algorithm are designed to make its detection method unique and prevent duplication or interference with its markers. The reader is available as hand-held device or industrial apparatus for large-scale applications, with the ability to read the embedded material data from a physical or chemical marker without requiring lengthy and expensive laboratory testing for confirmation. \n\n_Platform_\n\nBlockchain technology is a ledger of records, which are linked and designed to be secured using cryptography from third party infrastructure and SMX’s architecture. SMX can record a marker manifestation on the blockchain and store this information in cloud computing data storage. It has developed an algorithm designed to securely connect its reader to an existing platform (licensed from a SaaS provider) and record changing ownership and other information to the blockchain. Once SMX’s blockchain solution is implemented, a marked good or material is scanned in order to identify the marker, the results can be verified on the blockchain in order to confirm the data embedded in it, such as the identity of the producer, date of production, supplier and past owners. During the same scan, the reader can record to the blockchain a change of location or ownership of the marked product or material. \n\nThe IOT2 concept mentioned above also refers to the retrieving, analyzing and processing of encoded information embedded on products and product components and uploading such information to a cloud computing system or to a distributed blockchain system, creating a digital twin to a physical product for the purpose of product authentication, brand protection, tracking and tracing products and product components, supply chain management, and logistical processes. \n\n**_Applications_**\n\nSMX’s solution offers the following applications across industries: \n\n_Process Tracing_\n\nProcess tracing involves the upstream marking of raw material and blockchain-backed scanning throughout processing stages to allow for full traceability of raw material across its life cycle. Manufacturers are under increasing consumer and regulatory pressure to prove material provenance in order to be able to certify compliance with environmental, social and governance, or ESG, sourcing practices and carbon content of finished goods. Through upstream marking of raw material and blockchain-backed scanning throughout the processing stages, SMX’s technology enables real tracking and tracing of materials, including the source of those materials. Additionally, SMX’s technology enables manufacturers to know whether any used items are theirs and enables them to pay third parties to collect their used products, creating a market for collecting used products and selling them to other manufacturers. \n\n_Authentication_\n\nGrowing concerns about component tampering along high security or critical infrastructure product supply chains and increasing counterfeit issues for high value density products are also issues that SMX’s marking and authenticating process is designed to address. Manufacturers can validate product authenticity to their customers by marking final products or prime components and scanning the marker at a retail location or as part of the process of recycling their products. \n\n222 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\n_Sustainability and Circular Economics_\n\nThe end-to-end technology solution covers three product lifecycles to enhance the circular economy from raw material to manufacturing/production, packaging, and end-of-life, enabling it to re-enter the economy for recycling or reuse. By marking upstream raw material and later scanning recycled content at waste collection points, an advanced sorting of materials is enabled which can increase the value of recycled content and in turn help to increase global recycling rates and recycled content certification. \n\n**Key Strengths**\n\n**_Innovative Technology_**\n\nSMX’s technology can serve various manufacturers’ needs such as brand protection, authentication, track and trace for supply chain integrity and quality assurance. This technology has the potential to disrupt several industries and enable manufacturers and brand owners to be better able to protect their products. \n\n**_Growing Addressable Market_**\n\nThe circular economy represents a potential opportunity for global economic growth as society moves towards a more sustainable future and as manufacturers and other entities come under increasing consumer and regulatory pressure to comply with ESG sourcing practices. \n\n**_Experienced Development Technology Team_**\n\nSMX’s technology team is an experienced team of professionals, with a track record in the industrial sector and governmental agencies. \n\n**_Cross Segment Activity and Collaborative Relationships_**\n\nSMX’s technology is applicable for multiple industries. The growth potential of the Company is derived from the ability of SMX to provide an adaptive solution for multiple market segments, based on a unified technology solution. SMX also has collaborative relationships with leading companies which can provide it with access to various entities to which to sell its technology. This is part of the Company’s strategy to create strategic partnerships with market leaders across its main segments of activity. \n\n**_Sustainability_**\n\nSMX believes regulatory and consumer pressure to increase recycling rates of high-pollution materials, such as plastics and rubber as well as growing sustainability concerns and requirements to preserve resources and minimize pollution are important drivers for our growth. Thus, any such sustainability regulations and consumer pressure promoting solutions that enable the circular economy, including the solutions that SMX offers, can help to drive our growth. \n\n**Business Strategy**\n\nSMX’s roadmap for entry into markets it identifies is as follows: \n\n**_Market Leader Adoption_**\n\nAdoption of the solution by a market leader that provides a “seal of approval” that the technology is valid for the industry and generates added value. \n\n223 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\n**_Becoming an Industry Standard_**\n\nLeverage the market leader’s position in the market to increase adoption by other companies along the value chain. \n\n**_Regulator Adoption_**\n\nIn the future, SMX aims to become the preferred solution by regulators and professional associations in each industry. \n\n**Research and Development**\n\nGiven the varied needs of different industries, SMX’s research and development processes are divided according to industry. \n\n**_Plastics, Rubber and Other Materials_**\n\nIn 2022, SMX completed a successful trial of marking recycled plastics by studying the impact of gravimetric and volumetric feeding methods on final Post Consumer Recyclate, or PCR, readings. The compounding master batch and extrusion processes of these trials were performed on a pilot scale in a fully commercial and industrial facility. SMX’s team demonstrated its ability to manage the process remotely, indicating the viability of industrial scale adoption. \n\nThe successful trial provides plastic manufacturer and importing companies with a proof of concept, enabling them to more accurately identify and audit, via an automated transparent reporting system, the polymer type, number of loops and the amount of recycled content despite the size and color of the plastic. As a result, SMX is positioning itself to be able to offer plastic manufacturing and importing companies the ability to promote their operations as being sustainable and environmentally friendly. Combined with its ability to digitally certify the materials, SMX is also positioning itself to offer these companies the ability to avoid human/manual-paper auditing and use technology/automated auditing, which helps to reduce the potential for human errors and can provide for cost savings. \n\n**_Gold and Other Metals_**\n\n__Gold__\n\nSMX formed a joint initiative with Perth Mint to develop a mine-to-marketplace ethical gold supply chain technology solution. Since the incorporation of trueGold Consortium Pty Ltd (“trueGold”) in June 2020, this research and development project aims to promote a ‘mine to product’ transparency solution dedicated to responsible mining of materials. SMX’s track & trace technology provides information on the origin of the materials and how they move across production and distribution chains towards recycling and back to refining. \n\nOn July 29, 2020, SMX signed a shareholders’ agreement with W.A. Mint Pty Ltd. (“Perth Mint”) and trueGold. The shareholders’ agreement and the ancillary agreements discuss the establishment of a new entity – trueGold – by SMX and Perth Mint. SMX granted to trueGold, subject to the terms of the license agreement, an exclusive, worldwide, perpetual license to use SMX’s technology for the purpose of commercializing it within the industry comprising gold as a precious metal (as elaborated below). SMX owns any development of its intellectual property and, while trueGold owns all generated data it creates, trueGold granted to SMX a free non-exclusive, irrevocable, perpetual, royalty free license to use the generated data, subject to regulatory requirements and to the extent that it relates to the Isorad License Agreement technology or SMX’s technology. The parties agreed that neither of Perth Mint or SMX are required to provide any funding to trueGold and that any investment by any of them in trueGold from time to time will be by way of in-kind contributions. Third party equity investors will contribute the working capital will fund R&D, development capital and other expenses in accordance with the business plan. \n\nOther than with the consent of the other shareholders or between affiliates (defined, inter alia, as a related body corporate of a shareholder; a company in which the shareholder beneficially owns 50% or more of the \n\n224 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\nissued shares) a transfer of shares will be done subject to a right of first refusal of the other shareholders, whom will also have tag-along rights and a drag-along (as elaborated below). Under the constitution (as amended in July, 2022, to add the specific right of SMX to purchase shares before any other shareholders) any shareholder wishing to transfer shares must notify the board of directors and, before the board of directors authorize the transfer of any share or shares, the share or shares must first have been offered to SMX (for its own benefit and unless SMX is 50% owned by one entity), and if SMX does not notify within 30 days that it wishes to purchase, then to all other shareholders (including SMX) at a price to be agreed on by the transferor and the directors of trueGold. If the transferor and the directors of trueGold are unable to agree on a price, the price of the relevant shares will be a price which: represents a fair market price; and is determined by expert determination administered by the Australian Disputes Centre (ADC) in accordance with the ADC Rules for Expert Determination which are operating at the time the matter is referred to ADC, which Rules are incorporated into the constitution of trueGold. The determination of such person in relation to the price of the relevant shares will be final and binding on all shareholders. \n\nSubject to certain terms and conditions, a drag-along right is established under which where shareholders wish to dispose of all of their share to a third party that wishes to acquire 100% of trueGold and 75% or more of the aggregate number of shares on issue at that time agreed, the remaining shareholders may be forced to transfer to the third party all of the shares held by each of the remaining shareholders. In case of a deadlock (defined as a case where the board of directors disagrees on a material matter regarding the fundamental operation of trueGold or the business and cannot resolve the disagreement within 10 business days of the disagreement first arising), if the shareholders are unable to reach agreement on any matter, a dispute resolution mechanism was created. \n\nThe board of directors of trueGold was agreed to consist of not less than three and not more than seven. The initial board is be comprised as follows: SMX may appoint (remove or replace) up to two directors; Zeren Browne; Perth Mint may appoint (remove or replace) up to two directors; and Hugh Morgan, who is a non-executive, independent chair. A list of resolutions was set, which require a board majority including at least one SMX appointed director and one Perth Mint appointed director. Another list of resolutions was set, which require a resolution carried by a majority of the shareholders including SMX and Perth Mint. trueGold and Yahaloma (defined below) agreed to bear the payments to Soreq related thereto of 4.2% of its revenues. SMX’s CEO, Mr. Haggai Alon, provides CEO services to trueGold and reports to the board of directors of trueGold. \n\n__Non-Ferrous Metals__\n\nOn November 29, 2022, SMX signed a products distribution and SAAS reseller agreement with Sumitomo Corporation, a Japanese corporation. Under such agreement, SMX appointed Sumitomo to act as SMX’s exclusive, worldwide distributor to market and sell markers, readers and SMX services to customers for application in the Non-Ferrous Metals Market (as defined below) only, subject to the customer entering into with SMX its standard product license agreement. The “Non-Ferrous Metals Market” is defined as all supply chain market segments of the industry for aluminum, copper, lead, nickel, zinc, molybdenum, cobalt, lithium and tin. \n\nThe price at which SMX shall sell products to Sumitomo and the license fee at which SMX shall license SMX products and SMX service to Sumitomo shall be a discount of the invoices issued to the customers. \n\nGenerally, the agreement shall remain in effect for an initial term of five years from the effective date of first commercial sale by SMX to Sumitomo of any products. The companies have agreed that over the coming years there is a target to reach US$35 million in sales. \n\n**_Alcoholic Beverages_**\n\nIn December 2021, SMX acquired all the holdings SMX Beverages Pty Ltd, a joint venture incorporated in February 2020 for the promotion of solutions in the alcoholic beverage industries including in relation to the prevention of counterfeit alcoholic beverages, circular economy concepts and packaging and supply chain within those industries. \n\n225 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\n**_Diamonds and Precious Stones_**\n\nOn April 30, 2019, Security Matters Ltd. signed an agreement with Trifecta Industries Inc. (“Trifecta”) for the commercialization of Security Matters Ltd’s trace technology in the diamonds and precious stone industry. Under the terms of the agreement, Security Matters Ltd and Trifecta established a new entity – Yahaloma Technologies Inc. (“Yahaloma”), which is equally held by Security Matters Limited and Trifecta. \n\nBoth parties covenanted not to pursue the use of SMX’s technology for diamonds and precious stones, or any other venture related to the testing of the origin of diamonds or precious stone, other than through the Yahaloma. Additionally, in agreement with Isorad, all rights in and to any intellectual property related to the diamonds and precious stones industry that is developed by or for Yahaloma is jointly owned in equal parts by the SMX, Yahaloma and Soreq. \n\nSMX continues to develop the technology and will supply Yahaloma technical services. SMX bears the cost of such R&D services but the agreed hourly costs of SMX’s staff is recorded as a shareholders loan of SMX to Yahaloma, once the first USD 250,000 to be paid by Trifecta are exhausted (which is yet to happen). Trifecta supplies Yahaloma diamonds and other raw materials, which remain in the ownership of Trifecta. If SMX causes damage to such diamonds during the R&D process, this will be reported the Trifecta and the damage recorded as a shareholders loan of Trifecta to Yahaloma. Trifecta will supply Yahaloma services of business development. Trifecta bears the cost of such services but the agreed hourly costs of Trifecta’s staff is recorded as a shareholders loan of Trifecta to Yahaloma. Management of Yahaloma is agreed to be jointly, with certain special resolutions requiring agreement of both parties. Actual day-to-day management is in Canada. \n\nIn addition to the shareholders loan extended by man-hours as stipulated above, the parties covenanted to extend up to USD 1 million to Yahaloma (USD 350,000 by SMX and USD 650,000 by Trifecta, with USD 250,000 extended by Trifecta registered as capital and all other funds as shareholders loans). Funds were agreed to be injected upon reaching certain milestones. The SMX loan of USD 350,000 are to be injected only upon reaching future milestones and only if such funds will be required, which stage has not yet arrived. Such SMX loan will bear an interest rate of 5% per annum. Upon Yahaloma being able to repay the shareholders loans, first a sum of USD 250,000 will be repaid to Trifecta and then all other shareholders loans will be repaid pro-rata. Only after repayment of all shareholders loans will Yahaloma distribute profits. \n\nA party may not transfer its shares to others without the prior approval of the other party other than a transfer to an affiliate (defined as an entity directly or indirectly controlled by a party or directly or indirectly controls such party or is directly or indirectly controlled by a person which also, directly or indirectly, controls such person) done after 30 days notice to the other party, and after the affiliate agrees to adopt the agreement. \n\nYahaloma agreed to bear the payments to Soreq related thereto (as described in “Gold and Other Metals” above). \n\n**_Electronics_**\n\nSMX has joined an alliance formed by six founding partners, among them the World Business Council for Sustainable Development, to set a shared vision for a circular economy for electronics, called the Circular Electronics Partnership. This group of global companies has been brought together to reduce e-waste and to commit to a roadmap for a circular economy for electronics by 2030. \n\n**_Fashion_**\n\nIn December 2020, SMX announced that it had launched a Fashion Sustainability Competence Centre to enable fashion brands globally, to transition successfully to a sustainable circular economy by being able to identify the origination of their raw materials and hence, recycle their own unsold and/or end-of-life merchandise \n\n226 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\n(garments, footwear and accessories including sunglasses) back into new high-quality materials and new fashion merchandise.

The pricing model is expected to be comprised of three components: \n\n• |  set-up fee (for initial consultations);   \n---|---  \n• |  marker implementation fee (typically on a per item or per kg basis) and sale or lease of readers; and   \n---|---  \n• |  service fee (for reading, blockchain services and other support services).   \n---|---  \n  \nPricing may also include an annual license fee, payment of royalties, pay-per-read, or other models. \n\n**_Target Industries_**\n\n_Fashion_\n\nFor the fashion industry, SMX’s technology enables authentication from raw materials to retail stores and beyond: \n\n![LOGO](g381455g01a95.jpg)\n\nIts technology targets the luxury fashion industry by enabling high-end brands to: \n\n• |  verify the origin of raw materials to prevent fraud;   \n---|---  \n• |  control material usage during the manufacturing process;   \n---|---  \n• |  track a product’s journey from the first point of manufacturing to delivery to customers.   \n---|---  \n• |  share information on product traceability with customers to prevent fraud in returned products;   \n---|---  \n• |  generate secondary and reseller demand by demonstrating product authenticity; and   \n---|---  \n• |  improve upcycling and recycling processes through material recognition, grading, and recycled content certification.   \n---|---  \n  \n235 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\n_Electronics_\n\nFor the electronics industry, SMX’s technology enables end-to-end traceability and authentication from raw material to point of use. \n\n![LOGO](g381455g01a96.jpg)\n\nIts technology targets semiconductor manufacturers enabling a manufacturer to: \n\n• |  verify the origin of raw material;   \n---|---  \n• |  control material usage;   \n---|---  \n• |  demonstrate product authenticity along its supply chain;   \n---|---  \n• |  detect tampering during use (e.g., when giving products off-premises for maintenance or other reasons); and   \n---|---  \n• |  implement upcycling and/or recycling programs through material recognition, grading, and recycled content certification.   \n---|---  \n  \n236 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\n_Gold and Other Metals_\n\nSMX’s technology allows for the tracing of gold or other metals from mine to consumer. \n\n![LOGO](g381455g01a97.jpg)\n\nIts technology enables gold refineries, mining companies, and bullion banks to: \n\n• |  prove the origin and mine location of the gold;   \n---|---  \n• |  facilitate the sale or trading of gold from ESG-compliant mines; and   \n---|---  \n• |  demonstrate that their products are ESG-compliant to customers and end-users.  \n---|---  \n  \n237 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\n_Plastics, Rubber and Other Materials_\n\nGiven the challenges around mechanical recycling, chemical recycling is emerging as a promising solution to help tackle the global challenge associated with single use plastic waste. An embedded chemical marker allows for better tracking, monitoring and sorting of post-consumer plastic with the Circular Value Chain Approach. SMX’s technology is applicable throughout the life cycle of the material or product, from raw material to production to recycling. Its technology enables plastic footprint transparency and traceability along the supply chain. \n\n![LOGO](g381455g01a98.jpg)\n\nIts digital twin technology can address a key challenge of the first step to identify, track and trace commodities produced in emerging countries for use in the developed countries, such as rubber or food commodities (e.g., cocoa, soy, and palm oil). The creation of a digital twin for each physical good enables participants in the value chain to come together and form the global ledger for the goods. As a number of industries and sectors are increasing their commitments to recycling, many companies are realizing the need for sustainability and circular economies. \n\n**Competition**\n\nArmed with its various products and designs, SMX believes it possesses a unique combination of knowledge and features. It has established an innovative, cross- segment technology, developed over several years by an experienced and dedicated team of scientists, which it believes create a barrier to entry to its competitors. \n\nSMX’s product is currently undergoing pilot projects with customers with strong international presence. The customizable nature of its technology allows SMX to embed the technology in multiple products, from silk to rubber to diamonds to gold to plastics, across multiple segments. \n\nSMX is constantly striving to improve its competitive status in the market by: \n\n• |  entering into agreements or arrangements with large and high-profile customers in the industry, which it believes enhances its status and reputation in multiple markets and provides opportunities to enter into new agreements or arrangements with new customers;   \n---|---  \n  \n238 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\n• |  entering into agreements or arrangements with strategic partners in order to strengthen its position to become the new industry standard; and   \n---|---  \n• |  Providing high level development and support services to customers, to promote customer retention, and encourage its customers to rely on SMX to use its technologies for future projects.   \n---|---  \n  \n**Facilities**\n\nSMX’s main business activities are conducted at its headquarters at in central Israel. It leases 363 square meters of office space at this location under a lease until May 31, 2027, with an option to SMX to extend the lease with an additional rental fee of 10% for an additional five years. SMX also leases an additional adjacent building of 146 square meters where it conducts research and development activities. SMX has the option to exit the lease in March 2023. The lessor (who represented that he is not aware of any such impending circumstances) has the right to shorten the lease with 90 days-notice if it is demanded by a government entity to evacuate the premises, to change the agreement or to pay fines due to the agreement. SMX believes that its current facilities are suitable and sufficient to meet its anticipated needs for the foreseeable future. \n\n**Government Royalty Obligations and Regulations**\n\n**_Israeli R &D Law _**\n\nThe Government of Israel encourages research and development projects oriented towards products for export or projects which will otherwise benefit the Israeli economy. This is conducted by the Israel Innovation Authority (IIA), which replaced the former Office of the Chief Scientist (OCS). \n\nUnder Israeli laws with respect to research and development, which is referred to as R&D Law, a royalty of between 3% to 5% applies to the net sales of products developed from a project funded by the IIA, beginning with the commencement of sales of products developed with grant funds and ending when a dollar-linked amount equal to 100% of the grant plus interest at LIBOR has been repaid. The terms of the R&D Law also place restrictions on the location of the manufacturing of products developed with government grants, which, in general, must be performed in Israel, and on the transfer to third parties of technologies developed through projects in which the government participates. SMX’s research and development team will remain in Israel and all funds previously received by way of a grant from IIA have been invested in Israel. \n\nThe IIA has published a directive incorporating most of the former provisions, including those with respect to transfer of manufacturing rights, transfer of know-how and others. These provisions include limitations and requirements for payment with respect to outsourcing or transferring development or manufacturing activities with respect to any product or technology outside of Israel, and change in control in companies which received government funding from the OCS or IIA, which may impair ability to sell technology assets outside of Israel or to outsource, transfer develop or manufacture with respect to any product or technology that received government funding under the R&D Law outside of Israel, or consummate a change in control in the Company, all without prior approval of the IIA. \n\nIn May 2017, the IIA published the Rules for Granting Authorization for Use of Know-How Outside of Israel, or the Licensing Rules. The Licensing Rules enable the approval of licensing arrangements and other arrangements for granting of an authorization to an entity outside of Israel to use know-how developed under research and development programs funded by the IIA. Subject to payment of a “License Fee” to the IIA, at a rate that will be determined by the IIA in accordance with the Licensing Rules, the IIA may now approve arrangements for the license of know-how outside of Israel. This allows companies that have received IIA support to commercialize know-how in a manner which was not previously available. In addition, the IIA has recently published a directive incorporating most of the former provisions, including those with respect to transfer of manufacturing rights, transfer of know-how and others. \n\n239 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\nSMX had one approved project with the IIA (project number 55715, approved on November 23, 2015) of a 40% grant out of a project of up to approximately $400 thousand under which it received $196 thousand in prior years. SMX passed a final review by the IIA and no additional funding is expected to be received under the project. \n\nSMX is obligated to pay 3% of our relevant revenues for the first three years, and 4% of the relevant revenues for further years, until repayment of the entire grant, being $196 thousand. To date we paid about $1 thousand out of such amount. \n\n**_Approved Enterprise_**\n\nThe Israeli Encouragement of Capital Investments Law, 1959, is intended to encourage investment in industry in Israel in national priority areas, to promote economic initiatives while giving preference to advanced and innovative industries, and to strengthen development areas. Based on the Investment Law, the Investment Center may, on application, grant the status of “Approved Enterprise” for Capital Investments in industry and tourism. Certificates of approval are issued and such approval entitles the project to receive substantial support from the State. The support may be in the form of reduced taxation, investment grants or other benefits specifically designed to encourage capital investment in Israel. Such State support is conditional on certain restrictions on the activities of a supported company, which restrictions may not easily be alleviated. \n\nIn December 2016, SMX received approval as an Approved Enterprise (File 24638, Plan 429, Motion 120941) for the building of a factory for the marking of materials with an investment of ILS 3,700,000, provided that at least 24% of the investment will be financed by the issuance of new shares. Due to changes in our activity plans, we did not pursue such project and did not take any funds under such Approved Enterprise. \n\n**_Isorad License Agreement_**\n\nUnder the Isorad License Agreement (as amended), SMX received from Isorad an exclusive, worldwide, royalty-bearing license, to make use of (including, without limitation, to develop, manufacture, use, market, offer for sale, sell, export and import in the field of marking methods) US patent number 8158432 B2 and the technology derived from it can be utilized in almost any industry and with any product. Additionally, any uses for the Israeli Security Forces and/or its purposes will be conducted via us at a “cost plus” price to be agreed. While Isorad and Soreq reserve the right to freely continue to research and develop the technology, SMX has a right of first offer to any newly developed technology. If the Source IP is developed further by Soreq and Soreq wishes to commercialize the new technology, then Soreq must offer the right to commercialize the new technology to SMX in the first instance. \n\nSMX and its affiliate are to pay Isorad royalties for 25 years as of January 1, 2020 in the amount of 2.2% of all gross sales by the Company, our affiliates or sublicensees and after 25 years the license becomes royalty-free. Gross sales are defined under the Isorad License Agreement to include the total amount invoiced or received by SMX and/or its affiliates, including, without limitation, for sale of products and provision of services. If SMX charges a fee for sublicensing or an option for a sublicense, for which it does not pay the 2.2% royalty described above, such income will be subject to royalty payment of 15% of the amounts received. The royalties for revenues from sub-licensing the technology are payable as of January 1, 2020. \n\nUpon the occurrence of the next M&A event (as such event is defined in such agreement to include mergers, sale of all or substantially all the assets of ours and similar event) SMX is to pay a cash amount equal to 1.5% of the Exit Consideration (as such term is defined in such agreement). Additionally, Isorad was issued 864,000 options to purchase shares of SMX and is entitled to receive 1% of any amount actually received against equity or other funding convertible into equity at the closing of the transaction and any amount actually received against equity or other funding during a period of 13 months thereafter (to be paid after reaching an aggregated received amount of US$27 million, or at the end of such 13 months, the earlier thereof). This will not apply to any future offer of shares, merger or sale of assets thereafter. \n\n240 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\nUnder the Isorad Agreement, Isorad can only refuse to approve a sublicense based on governmental defense, security, governmental policy, political and other official State of Israel policy considerations. A sublicensee cannot further grant, directly or indirectly, to any third party any sublicense or rights to the technology and cannot further assign the sublicense agreement. \n\nSpecifically as to Yahaloma, the royalty rate on gross sales of Yahaloma, to be paid by Yahaloma, are 4.2% (and not 2.2% that applies solely to SMX, its other affiliates and to other sublicensees). Upon the occurrence of an M&A event (as such event is defined in such agreement to include mergers, sale of all or substantially all the assets of Yahaloma and similar event), Isorad is entitled to a fee equal to 1% of the total consideration paid to, received by, or distributed to, Yahaloma and/or its shareholders and/or its affiliates in connection with the event, including, without limitation, all cash, securities or other property which is received by Yahaloma and/or its shareholders in connection with such event of two such events (i.e. twice) at its choice. \n\nThe Isorad License Agreement will continue in full force and effect until terminated pursuant to its terms. If either party does not remedy a material breach of its obligations within 180 days of notice of the material breach, the non-defaulting party may terminate the Isorad License Agreement immediately. Isorad may terminate the agreement by providing 30 days prior written notice if the royalties payable to Isorad are $nil in any semi-annual report and we have breached other certain obligations (such as a failure to maintain a patent or patent application in the previous semi-annual review period). \n\nSMX has provided broad indemnities to Isorad and Soreq and their related parties under the terms of the Isorad License Agreement. The Isorad License Agreement is governed by the laws of Israel. \n\n**_Safety Certifications and Permits_**\n\nSMX is in compliance with the requirements of the ISO 9001:2015 standard for quality management and quality assurance. The ISO organization promotes worldwide proprietary, industrial and commercial standards. SMX is examined annually to verify that we comply with the ISO standards of excellence, safety, quality, process management and risks management. \n\nUnder the provisions of the Israeli Non Ionizing Radiation Law, and the Work Safety regulations (regarding employment safety and health of those working with non-ionizing radiation), the Company is required to hold a valid license for operations involving non ionizing radiation as well as employ a safety expert with qualifications as defined by the law. As of May 8, 2022, SMX has a valid license for operations involving non ionizing radiation and employs a safety expert as required by law. Additionally, the import and use of its readers may be subject to a license requirement in certain jurisdictions, which requirement may change from one jurisdiction to another. \n\n**Employees**\n\nAs of August 10, 2022, SMX had 28 employees, 26 full time employees and 2 part time employees located in Israel. SMX also has two employees in Australia and one in France. \n\nNone of SMX’s employees are members of a union or subject to the terms of a collective bargaining agreement. In Israel, SMX is subject to certain Israeli labor laws, regulations and Labor Court precedent rulings, as well as certain provisions of collective bargaining agreements applicable to SMX by virtue of extension orders issued in accordance with relevant labor laws by the Israeli Ministry of Economy and Industry, and which apply such agreement provisions to SMX employees even though they are not part of a union that has signed a collective bargaining agreement. \n\nAll of SMX’s employment and consulting agreements include standard non-compete and intellectual property assignment provisions, as well as strict confidentiality obligations. The enforceability of non-compete provisions may be limited by Israeli law. \n\n241 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\nSMX has a diversity policy in effect, last updated and approved by the board on February 7, 2021, according to which we are committed to gender diversity across its Board of Directors, senior management team and across its entire workforce, with a particular goal of increasing the representation of women in all areas. \n\n**Legal Proceedings**\n\nFrom time to time, SMX may become involved in legal proceedings or may be subject to claims arising in the ordinary course of our business. Although the results of these proceedings and claims cannot be predicted with certainty, SMX currently believes that the final outcome of these ordinary course matters will not have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition or cash flows. Regardless of the outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on us because of defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources and other factors. \n\n242 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\n**SECURITY MATTERS’ MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS**\n\n_The following discussion and analysis provide information which Security Matters’ management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of Security Matters’ consolidated results of operations and financial condition. This discussion and analysis should be read together with the section of this proxy statement/prospectus entitled “Selected Historical Consolidated Financial Information of Security Matters” and the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes of Security Matters that are included elsewhere in this proxy statement/prospectus. This discussion and analysis should also be read together with the section of this proxy statement/prospectus entitled “Business of Security Matters” and the unaudited condensed combined pro forma financial information as of and for the and for the six months ended June 30, 2022 and for the year ended December 31, 2021 in the section of this proxy statement/prospectus entitled “Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Information”.

See the section entitled “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements”. Actual results and timing of selected events may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those set forth under “Risk Factors” or elsewhere in this proxy statement/prospectus._\n\n**Overview**\n\nSecurity Matters Limited (“Security Matters” or “SMX” and together with its subsidiaries, the “Company” or the “Group”) was incorporated in May 2018 under Australian law. Security Matters’ registered address is K&L Gates Level 25, 525 Collins Street Melbourne, Victoria 3000, Australia. In October 2018, the Company was listed to the Australian Stock Exchange (“ASX”) under the symbol SMX. \n\nWe engage in research and development to permanently and irrevocably “mark” any object, either solid, liquid or gas, allowing identification, circularity, proof of authenticity, tracking supply chain movements and quality assurance Each marker is comprised of a combination of marker codes such that each marker is designed to be unique and unable to be duplicated. The marker system is coupled with an innovative patented reader that responds to signals from the marker and, together with a patented algorithm, captures the details of the product retrieved and stored on a blockchain digital ledger. Each unique marker can be stored, either locally on the reader and on private servers, cloud servers or on a blockchain ledger to store and protect data integrity and custody. We endeavor to provide one solution which we believe is the next generation solution for sustainability and the circular economy that is designed to solve both authentication and track-and-trace challenges in order to uphold supply chain integrity and provide quality assurance and brand accountability to producers of raw materials and goods. \n\nOur transformative solution aims at building on the principles of The United Nations’ Sustainability Development Goals, particularly Goal 12: “Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns” to enable a transition from both a linear- and regulatory-driven linear to a business-to-business driven closed loop Circular Value Chain Approach, or CVCA, that can create value for participants in the circular economy. With the creation of a digital “twin” of physical goods – participants in the value chain can rely on a global ledger for numerous materials and goods, with Security Matters providing a platform designed for safe and secure transactions. An increasing number of industries and sectors, from plastics to mining, are committing to recycled materials and realize the broader strategic vision of net zero carbon emissions. We offer an end-to-end turnkey solution comprised of three components: (1) a physical or chemical marker system coupled with (2) a unique reader and connected to (3) a blockchain digital platform. \n\n**Business Combination and Public Company Costs**\n\nOn July 26, 2022, Security Matters and Lionheart, amongst others, entered into a business combination agreement (“BCA”) and accompanying scheme implementation deed , as may be amended, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time (“SID”) pursuant to which SMX will list on NASDAQ via a newly-formed \n\n243 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\nIrish company (“Empatan”) currently named “Empatan Public Limited Company.” Under the BCA, a wholly owned subsidiary of Empatan will merge with and into Lionheart, with Lionheart surviving the merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Empatan, and existing Lionheart stockholders receiving Empatan Shares in exchange for their existing Lionheart shares and existing Lionheart warrant holders having their warrants automatically adjusted to become exercisable in respect of Empatan Shares instead of Lionheart shares, as further described in the BCA, subject to Lionheart stockholder approval and the satisfaction of various other conditions. Under the SID, SMX has agreed to propose a scheme of arrangement under Part 5.1 of the Australian Corporations Act (“Scheme”) and capital reduction (“Capital Reduction”) which, if implemented, will result in all shares in SMX being cancelled in return for the issue of Empatan Shares, with SMX then issuing a share to Empatan (resulting in SMX becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of Empatan), subject to the satisfaction of various conditions, including: Receipt of required regulatory approvals; the approval of shareholders of SMX and stockholders of Lionheart; no material adverse effect, prescribed events or breaches of representations and warranties; interdependence of the SID and BCA completing successfully; and other customary conditions to a scheme of arrangement, such as Australian court approval and an independent expert confirming that the transaction is in the best interests of SMX shareholders. \n\nAll options on issue in the SMX Employee Share Option Plan (“ESOP”) will be cancelled by private agreement and the holders of the ESOP options will be issued equivalent options in Empatan. In addition, SMX has agreed to have non-ESOP options in SMX cancelled by private agreement or, if necessary, implement an option scheme under Part 5.1 of the Australian Corporations Act (“Option Scheme”) which, if implemented, will result in the SMX options held by participants in the Option Scheme being cancelled, and such participants receiving Empatan Shares on the basis of a Black-Scholes valuation for each tranche, subject to SMX option holder approval, Court approval and the satisfaction of various conditions. \n\nThe SID contains customary exclusivity provisions in favor of both parties including ‘no-shop’ and ‘no-talk’ restrictions, ‘no due diligence’, a notification obligation, and matching right. A break fee of US$2 million is payable by SMX to Lionheart and vice versa in certain circumstances including, where directors withdraw their recommendations, where a party engages in a competing acquisition and where a party breaches the SID. \n\n**Recent Developments**\n\nIn August 2022, SMX entered into a Standby Equity Facility to raise up to US$1,400,000 (AU$2,000,000) for the period until October 31, 2022. Under the Standby Equity Facility, SMX retains full control of the subscription process, with the discretion as to whether to request share placements, the timing of the share placements and the maximum number of shares to be requested to be issued under each placement; the purchase price per SMX share is of 91.5% of the of the volume weighted average price of SMX’s shares during the relevant valuation period with a floor price of AU$0.17 (approximately US$0.12). Until October 24th, the Company raised the net amount of $224,000. \n\nSMX and Parent entered into binding loan agreements on August 24, 2022 and September 05, 2022, with three private investors and entered into a note dated September 06, 2022, with one of such private investors. The investors agreed to lend the Company an aggregated amount of $2.5 million which bears interest of 10% per annum (paid quarterly in arrears) with 50% of the loan to be repaid on the first anniversary of the date of issue and 50% on the earlier of (i) the second anniversary of the date of issue, and (ii) a change in control event (which does not include the Business Combination). It has also been agreed that each investor will receive warrants to subscribe for Parent Shares and a first priority security interest in the shares of the Company’s interest in trueGold Consortium Pty Ltd. The investors may redeem part of the warrants at closing of the Business Combination. \n\n**Key Factors Affecting Operating Results**\n\nSecurity Matters believes that its performance and future success depend on several factors that present significant opportunities for us but also pose risks and challenges, including those discussed below and in the section of this proxy statement/prospectus titled “ _Risk Factors_.” \n\n244 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\n_Commercial Agreements_\n\nSMX’s technology seeks to enable global companies across various industries to transition more successfully to a sustainable circular economy. By adopting SMX’s technology, they can be able to tangibly measure and track the raw material from origination, through the supply chain and at the end of life—where the amount of material recycled/reused from that product item can be measured and as well as the number of times that specific material/item has been recycled/reused. \n\nDue to the fact that we aim our sales efforts at large international market-makers conglomerates, our sale cycle is relatively slow and there is a larger risk that at any time, due to many reasons that are beyond our control, the sale cycle will be broken and all efforts will be lost. \n\nSMX has received interest in its technology from several international market-makers conglomerates as well as parties interested in making such technology a market standard, which will greatly assist the creation of future income. Any delays in the successful completion of projects or the creation of a market standard, as well as the materialization of any of the risks described in the Risk Factors chapter herein may impact the ability to generate revenue. \n\n**Business Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic and the Conflict in Ukraine **\n\nAs a result of the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic and the Russian invasion of Ukraine, economic uncertainties have arisen which may negatively affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. These uncertainties include, among other things, downturns in the financial markets or in economic conditions, increases in oil prices, inflation, increases in interest rates, supply chain disruptions, and declines in consumer confidence and spending. Since the COVID-19 pandemic started, SMX prepares its global operations to disruptive situation, as such some of the actions taken, creating supplier relationships on various regions close to main clients and across all lines of activities. SMX expanded the portfolio of its potential readers’ and markers’ providers and has developed a whole methodology how to support and work remotely with a client. Although One of the SMX’s Readers’ providers is located in Kiev, Ukraine, there was no material change with the supply of the readers as the supplier also maintains operations in Czech. We have assessed that the COVID-19 pandemic and the conflict in Ukraine did not have a material or direct impact on our operations or financial position. The duration of uncertainties and the ultimate financial effects resulting from the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and the conflict in Ukraine cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. We will continue to monitor these situations very closely and implement further measures if we believe they are required. \n\n245 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\n**Components of Operating Results**\n\nThe results of operations presented below should be reviewed in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes included elsewhere in this proxy statement/prospectus.

The Company expects that its research and development expenses will increase as the Company continues to develop its products and recruit additional research and development employees. \n\nThe Company’s research and development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2021, amounted to $2,039 thousand representing an increase of $350 thousand, or 21%, compared to $1,689 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase of $609 thousand in wages and salaries related expenses reflecting an increase in the number of research and development employees, and an increase of $122 thousand in subcontractors’ payments. The reimbursement from paid pilots and proof of concept projects increased in $543 thousand. \n\nThe Company’s research and development expenses for six the months ended June 30, amounted to $933 thousand representing an increase of $48 thousand, or 5%, compared to $885 thousand for the six months ended June 30, 2021. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase of $412 thousand in wages and salaries related expenses reflecting an increase in the number of research and development employees, and an increase of $105 thousand in research expenses that were offset against the reimbursement from paid pilots and proof of concept projects that increased in $465 thousand. \n\nThe Company is engaged in Proof of Concept (POC) agreements according to which it receives funds for financing research and development expenses from prospective customers. Those funds are reimbursements for expenses and therefore are offset against the related R&D expenses in profit or loss. In 2021 the reimbursement from paid pilots and proof of concept projects increased by $543 thousand and in the six months ended June 30, 2022 the reimbursement increased by $465 thousand compared to the six months ended June 30, 2021. \n\n**_General and Administrative Expenses_**\n\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist primarily of professional services fees, wages and salary related expenses, share-based compensation, facility-related costs, insurance and other general and administrative expenses. \n\nThe Company’s general and administrative expenses totaled $2,482 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2021, a net increase of $35 thousand, or 1%, compared to $2,447 for the year ended December 31, 2020. The net increase was primarily attributable to an increase of $343 thousand in wages and salaries related expenses reflecting an increase in the number of employees offset by decrease of $168 thousand in professional services and decrease of $105 thousand in share-based compensation expenses. \n\n247 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\nThe Company’s general and administrative expenses totaled $1,200 thousand for the six months ended June 30, 2022, a decrease of $138 thousand, or 10%, compared to $1,338 for the six months ended June 30, 2021. The decrease was primarily attributable to an increase of $105 thousand in wages and salaries related expenses reflecting an increase in the number of employees offset by decrease of $162 thousand in share-based compensation. \n\n**_Selling and Marketing Expenses_**\n\nSales and marketing expenses consist primarily of digital advertising, business development’s consultants and travel abroad. \n\nThe Company’s selling and marketing expenses totaled $453 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2021, an increase of $26 thousand, or 6%, compared to $427 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2020 and was primarily due to an increase in digital advertising cost associated with our marketing efforts. \n\nThe Company’s selling and marketing expenses totaled $378 thousand for six months ended June 30, 2022, an increase of $181 thousand, or 92%, compared to $197 thousand for the six months ended June 30, 2021 and was primarily due to an increase in digital advertising cost associated with our marketing efforts. \n\n**_Finance Income and Expenses_**\n\nFinance income, net consists primarily of exchange rate differences between ILS and AUD, interests on borrowings, fees and commissions to banks and income on short-term deposits. \n\nThe Company’s finance income totaled $237 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2021, an increase of $170 thousand, or 254%, compared to $67 for the year ended December 31, 2020. The finance income for the six months ended June 30, 2022 totaled $105 thousand, an increase of $60 thousand, or 133%, compared to $45 thousand for the six months ended 30 June, 2021. The increase is primarily due to exchange rate differences between ILS and AUD. \n\nThe Company’s finance expense totaled $101 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2021, an increase of $22 thousand or 28%, compared to $79 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2020. The finance expense for the six months ended June 30, 2022 totaled $36 thousand, an increase of $31 thousand, or 620%, compared to $5 thousand for the six months ended 30 June, 2021. The increase is related to bank commissions and interest. \n\n**_Share of Net Loss of Associated Companies_**\n\nShare of net loss of associated companies consists of equity loss from associated joint venture activity for the year ended on December 31, 2021 at the amount of $101 thousand. As of June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the carrying amount of the investment in associated companies is $116 thousand and $147 thousand, respectively. \n\n**_Income Tax_**\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, the Company estimated carry forward tax losses of approximately $17,659 thousand (December 31, 2020: $13,151 thousand) and as of June 30, 2022, the Company estimated carry forward tax losses of approximately $19,927 thousand (June 30, 2021: $15,306 thousand) which may be carried forward and offset against taxable income for an indefinite period in the future. The Group did not recognize deferred tax assets relating to carry forward losses in the financial statements because their utilization in the foreseeable future is not probable. \n\n248 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\n**_Net Loss attributable to shareholders_**\n\nAs a result of the forgoing, our net loss for the year ended December 31, 2021, was $4,939 thousand, compared to $4,573 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of 366$ thousand, or 8%. June 30, 2022, was $2,442 thousand, compared to $2,380 thousand for the six months ended June 30, 2021, an increase of 62$ thousand, or 3%. \n\n**Liquidity and Capital Resources**\n\n**_Overview_**\n\nSince our inception through June 30, 2022, the Company has funded its operations principally through the issuance of ordinary shares and warrants, convertible notes, loans from related parties and reimbursement from prospected customers for paid pilots and proof-of-concept projects. As of June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the Company had $859 thousand and $4,171 thousand, respectively, in cash and cash equivalents. \n\nThe table below presents our cash flows for the periods indicated: \n\n**For the Six MonthsEnded June 30,** | **For the Year EndedDecember 31,**  \n---|---  \n_U.S. dollars in thousands_ | **2022** | **2021** | **2021** | **2020**  \nNet cash used in operating activities | 2,862 | 2,386 | 3,908 | 3,515  \nNet cash used in investing activities | 966 | 901 | 1,765 | 958  \nNet cash provided by financing activities | 542 | 4,388 | 6,118 | 6,701  \nNet increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents | (3,286 | )  | 1,101 | 445 | 2,228  \n  \n**_Operating Activities_**\n\nNet cash used in operating activities was $3,908 thousand during the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to net cash used in operating activities of $3,515 thousand during the year ended December 31, 2020. Net cash used in operating activities was $2,862 thousand during the six months ended June 30, 2022 compared to net cash used in operating activities of $2,386 thousand during the six months ended June 30, 2021. The increase was primarily used for payment of salaries and related personnel expenses, research and development, subcontractors, consultants and materials. \n\n**_Investing Activities_**\n\nNet cash used in investing activities was $1,765 thousand during the year ended December 31, 2021 and consisted of cost of capitalized development expenses in the amount of $1,468 thousand and $297 thousand used for purchasing property, plant and equipment. Net cash used in investing activities was $958 thousand during the year ended December 31, 2020, consisted of cost of capitalized development expenses in the amounts of $723 thousand and $235 thousand, which were used for purchasing property and equipment. \n\nNet cash used in investing activities was $966 thousand during the six months ended June 30, 2022 and consisted of cost of capitalized development expenses in the amount of $783 thousand and $183 thousand used for purchasing property, plant and equipment. Net cash used in investing activities was $901 thousand during the six months ended June 30, 2021 consisted of cost of capitalized development expenses in the amounts of $810 thousand and $91 thousand, which were used for purchasing property and equipment. \n\n**_Financing Activities_**\n\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $6,118 thousand during the year ended December 31, 2021, consisted mainly of $5,892 thousand proceeds from net issuance of shares and warrants and $395 thousand of net proceeds from the exercise of warrants, which was partially offset by payment of $98 thousand for lease liabilities and loan repayment to related parties of $103 thousand. \n\n249 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $6,701 thousand during the year ended December 31, 2020, consisted mainly of $6,857 thousand proceeds from net issuance of shares and warrants which was partially offset by payment of $12 thousand for lease liabilities and loan repayment to related parties of $144 thousand. \n\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $542 thousand during the six months ended June 30, 2022, consisted mainly of $581 thousand proceeds from issuance of convertible notes, which was partially offset by payment of $39 thousand for lease liabilities. \n\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $4,388 thousand during the six months ended June 30, 2021, consisted mainly of $4,110 thousand net proceeds from issuance of shares and $328 thousand proceeds from exercise of options, which was partially offset by payment of $50 thousand for lease liabilities. \n\n**_Current Outlook_**\n\nThe Company has funded its operations to date primarily from the issuance of ordinary shares, warrants, issuance of convertible notes, loans from related parties and reimbursement from customers for paid pilots and proof-of-concept projects. The Company has incurred losses and generated negative cash flows from operations since inception in 2015. Since the Company’s inception, it has not generated significant revenue from the sale of products. \n\nAs of June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the Company had $859 thousand and $4,171 thousand, respectively, in cash and cash equivalents. The Company expects that its existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to fund its current operations until the end of 2023. In addition, the Company’s operating plans may change as a result of many factors that may currently be unknown to it, and it may need to seek additional funds sooner than planned. The Company’s future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including: \n\n• |  the successful consummation of the merger transaction with Lionheart according to the business combination agreement;   \n---|---  \n• |  the progress and costs of our research and development activities;   \n---|---  \n• |  the costs of filing, prosecuting, enforcing and defending patent claims and other intellectual property rights;   \n---|---  \n• |  the potential costs of contracting with third parties to provide marketing and distribution services for us or for building such capacities internally; and   \n---|---  \n• |  the magnitude of our general and administrative expenses.   \n---|---  \n  \nUntil the Company can generate significant recurring revenues and profit, the Company expects to satisfy its future cash needs through capital raisings and shareholders’ financial support. The Company cannot be certain that additional funding will be available when needed, on acceptable terms, if at all. If funds are not available, the Company may be required to delay or reduce the scope of research or development plans. \n\n**Contractual Obligations**\n\n**_Leases_**\n\nSecurity Matters Ltd. is a party to a lease agreement dated January 14, 2020 and amended as of December 24, 2020 (the “Lease”). Under the Lease, it is obligated to pay ILS 253 thousand plus VAT per year. The Lease will expire on May 31, 2027, with an additional option of 5 years, unless terminated by the landlord due to a requirement of a governmental authority to modify or terminate the Lease, pursuant to the terms of the lease. \n\n**_Related Party Borrowings_**\n\nAs discussed in “Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions—SMX Related Party Transactions” below, in 2015, Security Matters Ltd. signed an agreement to receive a loan of ILS 2 Million (US$512,558 at \n\n250 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\n2015) from Kibbutz Ketura, an entity associated with Mr. Hofland, and Kibbutz Degania A, an entity associated with Mr. Bader on back-to-back terms from a third party (the Kamea Fund). The loan bears an interest at an annual rate of 4%. The balance as of December 31, 2021 was US$269,311 (including provision for bonus at the amount US$87,311), and as of December 31, 2020 was US$279,939. The balances include interest and there was no change in the interest rate. The loan was fully repaid in August 2022. \n\nIn consideration with providing the funding, Security Matters Ltd. agreed to provide, as additional consideration, a bonus payment on the occurrence of an exit or major liquidity event. The bonus payment is capped at ILS 3 Million (approximately US$965,000) per each of Kibbutz Ketura and Kibbutz Degania A (together, the “Bonus Payments”). The Bonus Payments are intended to operate in one of the two trigger events: (i) dividend distributions by Security Matters Ltd.; or (ii) the sale of shares by either Kibbutz Ketura and Kibbutz Degania A in Security Matters Ltd. (either in the event of a takeover or otherwise). Only if the aggregate amounts of one of the two trigger events exceeds the investment of Kibbutz Ketura and Kibbutz Degania A in Security Matters Ltd. (by loan or shares), the either party would be entitled to the Bonus Payment. \n\nIn August 2022, the Company signed an addendum to the loan agreement that reduces the total amount of the Bonus payment to ILS 2.5 million (US$770 thousand), that will be paid upon the completion of the Business Combination. If the Business Combination will not be completed, the terms of the Bonus payment will return as were prior to the recent signed addendum. For more information on the Bonus Payments, see Note 10 to the Security Matters Limited Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\nAdditionally, Kibbutz Ketura provides administrative services for Security Matters Ltd. for which it was paid $ 39,225 and $ 57,944 in 2021 and 2020, respectively, and $ 21,476 and $15,814 in the six months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Until 2020, Security Matters Ltd.’s lab was located in Kibbutz Ketura. \n\n**_Government Grants_**\n\nAs of June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the Company has a contingent liability of $174 and $196 thousand respectively, for government grant it received for the use of research and development activities from Israel Innovation Authority (IIA). The Company is subject to paying 3% of its relevant revenues for the first three years, and 4% of the relevant revenues for further years, until repayment of the entire grant. \n\n**Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements **\n\nIn January 2015, the Company entered an agreement with Isorad Ltd. (a company wholly owned by the State of Israel with rights to exclusively commercialize the Soreq Research Center technology for civilian uses), according to which the Company was granted technological license in return for future royalties based on 2.2% of Gross sales by the Company and its affiliates and after 25 years the license becomes royalty-free. Upon the occurrence of an M&A event (as such event is defined in the agreement to include mergers, sale of all or substantially all the assets of ours and similar event), in the first M&A event, the Company is to pay a consideration equal to 1% of the amount received or transferred and in the second M&A event, a consideration equal to 2% of the amount received or transferred. This will not apply to any future offer of shares, merger or sale of assets thereafter. \n\n**Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk**\n\nThe Company is exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of business. Market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates. Our market risk exposure is primarily a result of U.S. dollar/ILS Israeli Shekels exchange rates, which is discussed in detail in the following paragraph. \n\n251 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\n**_Foreign Currency Exchange Risk_**\n\n_Currency Fluctuations_\n\nThe Company’s operating expenses are denominated mainly in ILS, and therefore are currently subject to foreign currency risk. We have been affected by changes in the rate of ILS currency compared to the U.S. dollar, as the ILS decreased against the U.S. dollar by approximately 3% in 2021 and 7% in 2020, and increased in 13% and 1% in the six months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. \n\nThe Company’s policy is not to enter into any currency hedging transactions, and we cannot assure you that we will not be adversely affected by currency fluctuations in the future. \n\n**_Credit risk_**\n\nCredit risk is a risk of financial loss if a counterparty or customer fails to meet its contractual obligations. We closely monitor the activities of our counterparties and control the access to its intellectual property which enables it to ensure a prompt collection. Our main financial assets are cash and cash equivalents as well as other receivables and represent the Company’s maximum exposure to credit risk in connection with its financial assets. Wherever possible and commercially practical, the Company holds cash with major and sound financial institutions in Israel and Australia. \n\n**_Liquidity Risk_**\n\nLiquidity risk is the risk that we will encounter in meeting our obligations associated with our financial liabilities that are settled by delivering cash or another financial asset. The Company has procedures to minimize that risk by maintaining sufficient cash and other highly liquid current assets and by having available an adequate amount of committed credit facilities. For more details, please refer to the section titled, “Liquidity and Capital Resources”. \n\n**Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates**\n\nThe Company’s consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 and for the six months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021 have been prepared in accordance with IFRS as issued by the IASB. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make critical judgements in applying Security Matters’ accounting policies and make critical assumptions and estimates concerning future events. Assumptions and estimates may differ from the actual results and are continually evaluated and adjusted based on historical experience and other factors. Such assumptions and estimates have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year. \n\nIntangible Assets \n\nThe Company capitalizes costs for its developed projects when specific criteria are met. Initial capitalization of costs is based on management’s judgement that technological and economic feasibility is achievable, usually when a product development project has reached a defined milestone according to an established project management model. The management makes assumptions regarding the expected future economic benefit to be derived from the intangible asset and therefore whether the capitalized costs are expected to be recovered. \n\nThis amount of capitalized costs includes significant investment in the development of marking and reading capabilities in the subject material. Prior to being marketed, the Company will obtain a proof-of-concept pilot with an industry leading partner. The innovative nature of the product gives rise to some judgement as to whether the proof-of-concept will be successful such that it will lead to obtaining commercial contracts with customers. See also Note 2 - Intangible Assets. \n\n252 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\nThe Management bases its estimates on historical experience, assumptions, and information currently available and deemed to be reasonable at the time the financial statements are prepared. However, actual amounts may differ from the estimated amounts as more detailed information becomes available. Estimates and assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis and, if necessary, changes are recognized in the period in which the estimate is revised. \n\nShare based payment \n\nThe Company measures the share-based expense and the cost of equity-settled transactions with employees and service providers by reference to the fair value of the equity instruments at the date at which they are granted. The Company selected the Black-Scholes model as the Company’s option pricing model to estimate the fair value of the company’s options awards. The model is based on share price, grant date and on assumptions regarding expected volatility, expected life of the options, expected dividend, and a no risk interest rate. As for granted options which are settled in equity instruments, the fair value of the options at the grant date is charged to the statement of comprehensive loss over the vesting period. Non-market vesting conditions are taken into account by adjusting the number of equity instruments expected to vest at each reporting date so that, ultimately, the cumulative amount recognized over the vesting period is based on the number of options that eventually vest. \n\n**Reimbursement of research and development expenses**\n\nReimbursements in proof of concept (POC) agreements of expenditures on research and development in order to achieve commercial agreement once this activity will be result successful, are offset in profit or loss against the related expenses (research and development expenses). Any IP generated from this activity remains at the ownership of the company. \n\n**Intangible assets**\n\nIntangible assets include capitalized technology development costs. Expenditures on research activities are recognized in profit or loss as incurred. Expenditures on internally developed products are mainly employee salaries and legal fees for filing of patents and are capitalized when the Company demonstrates all the following criteria: \n\na. |  The technical feasibility of completing the intangible asset so that it will be available for use or sale .   \n---|---  \nb. |  The intention to complete the intangible asset and use or sell it.   \n---|---  \nc. |  The ability to use or sell the intangible asset .   \n---|---  \nd. |  The probability of the intangible asset to generate future economic benefits. Among other things, the Company considers the existence of a market for the output of the intangible asset or the intangible asset itself or, if it is to be used internally, the usefulness of the intangible asset .   \n---|---  \ne. |  The availability of adequate technical, financial and other resources to complete the development and to use or sell the intangible asset.   \n---|---  \nf. |  The ability to measure reliably the expenditures attributable to the intangible asset during its development .   \n---|---  \n  \nThe recognition criteria above are considered by the Company at each stage of development to determine when the criteria have been initially met in full. \n\nThe technical feasibility criteria is determine to be met when a the milestone of initial marking and reading capabilities is satisfied. The milestone’s identification occurs only following a detailed broad mapping of the raw material characteristics and establishing the formula for the chemical marker architecture to be embedded into the raw material based on industry standards and regulations. The result is the initial evidence that the x-ray algorithm of the designated reader is in a stage that can identify the marker and convey information. At this stage, the Company believes that the technical feasibility of completing the development for use is probable. \n\n253 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\nThe Company notes that technical feasibility has been established and the achieved technology is ready for the next stage which consists of performing a proof-of-concept pilot with an industry partner, in order to adapt the technology for the relevant industry and adjust the development to meet the industry’s needs. \n\nCurrently, the Company’s capitalized development activities focus on: \n\n1. |  Development of marker architecture to be embedded topically or in-situ (application) for each material/product within the optimal industrial manufacturing phase, based on industry standards and regulations.   \n---|---  \n2. |  Semi Industrial scale – technology implementation in semi industrial production.   \n---|---  \n3. |  Development of a digital platform to support the end-to-end traceability from raw material to final product to recycling.   \n---|---  \n  \nThe Company’s management has the full intention to complete the development of the technology and ultimately to sell it. This intention is demonstrated by initiating partnerships with industry market leaders and continuing the development into the next phase. The Company’s intention is also reflected in the Company’s approved budget. \n\nThe Company’s management intends to concentrate its future sales and marketing efforts in the U.S. market, including recruitment of sales and marketing personnel. It plans to advance successful proof-of-concept pilots performed with industry leading partners, and further advance its innovative technology and commercialization efforts and collaborations in the segments relevant to its technology. \n\nThe Company’s business model targets leading brands and manufacturers in order to create a new market standard for circular economy solutions, brand authentication and supply chain integrity. The Company’s technology is applicable for multiple industries such as gold, fashion, electronics and circular economy – plastic and rubber. The Company is able to provide an adaptive solution for multiple market segments, based on a unified technology solution, through collaborative relationships with leading market companies which provide it with access to various potential entities to sell its solution. This is part of the Company’s strategy to create strategic partnerships with market leaders across its main segments of activity. The Company believes that this close collaboration with market leaders, and developing a product that meets their requests, suggest that there is a strong potential market for its development. \n\nAdequate technical and financial resources are available to complete the development; the development will be completed by the Company’s technology team which consists of professional experienced scientists and engineers, with a track record in the industrial sector and with financial resources successfully raised through the issuance of ordinary shares and loans. The Company has already accomplished its core technology development and is currently focused on development of specific adjustments for different market segments. This stage is focused and short-termed, therefore, management believes that limited financial resources are required for completing the development and that there is high probability for commencing commercial agreements following the successful proof-of-concept pilots. \n\nThe Company has financial systems in place that allow it to maintain records in sufficient detail that enable it to measure reliably the expenditures attributable to the intangible asset during its development . \n\nDevelopment expenditures not satisfying all the above criteria are recognized in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income as incurred. \n\n**Subsequent measurement**\n\nIn subsequent periods, capitalized development expenditures are measured at cost less accumulated amortization and accumulated impairment losses. \n\n254 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\nAn asset is ready for its intended use, when the developed technology becomes operational and the Company completes an initial customization for a client’s specific needs, which means that the technology is fully implemented in the customer’s manufacturing processes and ready for its intended use. The management estimates that in approximately two years such customization will be completed and amortization will commence. \n\nIntangible assets with a finite useful life are amortized over their estimated useful lives and reviewed for impairment whenever there is an indication that the asset may be impaired. The amortization period and the amortization method for an intangible asset are reviewed at least at each year end. \n\nThe carrying amount of these assets is reviewed whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. If the asset is considered to be impaired, the amount of any impairment is measured as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the impaired asset. An expenditure incurred in development activities, including the Company’s softwaredevelopment is capitalized only where it clearly increases the economic benefits to be derived from the asset to which it relates, the expenditure will lead to new or substantially improved products, the products are technically and commercially feasible and the Company has sufficient resources to complete the development and reach the stage for which the product is ready for use. \n\nAll other expenditure, including those incurred in order to maintain an intangible assets current level of performance, is expensed as incurred. \n\n**Recent Accounting Pronouncements**\n\nFor a discussion of the Company’s new or recently adopted accounting pronouncements, see “Note 2—Significant Accounting Policies” to our consolidated financial statements included in this proxy statement/ prospectus. \n\n255 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\n**EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION**\n\n**SMX Executive Officer and Director Compensation**\n\nThe aggregate compensation paid by SMX to SMX’s directors for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021 was US$161,222. The compensation amount included 257,562 shares and 167,000 options that were granted to its directors as a group. \n\nThe aggregate compensation paid by SMX to SMX’s senior executive officers for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021 was approximately US$521,845.

It is expected that the executive compensation program will include: \n\n• |  annual base salaries;   \n---|---  \n• |  performance bonus opportunities, potentially in cash and/or equity awards;   \n---|---  \n• |  long term incentive compensation in the form of stock options, restricted stock and stock appreciation awards, among others, and   \n---|---  \n• |  with regard to key executive officers, formal employment arrangements to include change of control provisions.   \n---|---  \n  \n_Director Compensation_\n\nFor the first year after the closing of the transaction, each independent director will be granted restricted stock units in an amount equal to $100,000 divided by the closing price on the last trading day of the fiscal year, generally to vest on the one-year anniversary of the date of grant and be settled in ordinary shares, subject to such director’s continuous services as a director until such time and earlier vesting due to a change of control. In addition, each committee chair will be entitled to receive an additional grant annually of restricted stock units in an amount equal to $10,000 divided by the closing price on the last trading day of the fiscal year, subject to the same terms listed in the prior sentence. Messrs. Alon and Sternberg and Ms. Browne will not receive any director compensation as their compensation is governed by their individual employment agreements. \n\n256 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\n**MANAGEMENT**\n\nParent was formed on July 1, 2022 as a public company under the name Empatan Public Limited Company, incorporated in Ireland.

Wasserstrom, LLC (“Wasserstrom”), to represent Lionheart Capital and its affiliated companies, as corporate general counsel and otherwise in connection with any corporate and/or transactional matters as requested by Lionheart Equities. The engagement letter between Lionheart Equities and Wasserstrom is for an indefinite period only subject to termination rights of either party, of which no termination has occurred since the agreement was executed. Jessica Wasserstrom, the principal of Wasserstrom, currently holds the title of Chief Legal Officer of Lionheart Equities and its affiliated companies. \n\nIn connection therewith, Wasserstrom was specifically engaged by the Company to provide counsel for general corporate legal matters, including related to mergers and acquisitions activity and, as such, may be deemed to be a related party of the Company. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, the Company incurred an aggregate of $25,000 and $465,000 of legal fees from Wasserstrom, which were recorded within accrued expenses and remain unpaid and outstanding as of June 30, 2022. \n\n_Chairman Agreement_\n\nMr. Ophir Sternberg and Parent entered into a Chairman Agreement (the “Chairman Agreement”). Pursuant to the Chairman Agreement, beginning at the closing of the Business Combination, Mr. Sternberg will serve as the Chairman of the Board of Directors of Parent (the “Parent Board”) for so long as he serves as a member of the Parent Board, unless he is earlier terminated. Mr. Sternberg will not receive any cash compensation for his service on the Parent Board nor will he be entitled to participate in any employee benefit plans of Parent. \n\nThe Chairman Agreement provides that Mr. Sternberg will be granted restricted stock units of Parent representing 3% of the issued and outstanding Parent Shares as of the grant date in accordance with and subject to the terms and conditions of the Parent’s 2022 Incentive Plan. Mr. Sternberg’s restricted stock units are subject to time-based vesting, as follows: 20% vest on the grant date, and the remaining restricted stock units will vest in quarterly installments thereafter over a period of three years subject to his continued service on the Parent Board as of each vesting date subject to earlier vesting as forth below. \n\nIn the event of the expiration or termination of the Chairman Agreement for any reason other than termination for Cause (as defined in the Chairman Agreement), any unvested outstanding equity awards held by Mr. Sternberg will immediately vest and become nonforfeitable. In the event of the termination of the Chairman Agreement by Parent for Cause, all unvested outstanding equity awards will be cancelled and forfeited, and Mr. Sternberg will not be entitled to any payment in connection therewith. \n\nThe Chairman Agreement states that Mr. Sternberg will honor his confidentiality obligations after the termination of his services. \n\n_Independent Contractor Agreement_\n\nMr. Faquiry Diaz and Parent entered into an independent contractor agreement (the “Independent Contractor Agreement”). The Independent Contractor Agreement provides for an initial term of three years that automatically renews for one-year terms thereafter, so long as Ophir Sternberg is the Chairman of the Parent Board. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Independent Contractor Agreement is terminable by either party at any time, with or without Cause (as defined in the Independent Contractor Agreement), effective upon notice to the other party. \n\nIn exchange for his services, Mr. Diaz Cala will be compensated and reimbursed in the total amount of $84,000, annually, payable in twelve equal monthly payments. In addition, the Independent Contractor \n\n260 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\nAgreement provides that Mr. Diaz Cala will be granted restricted stock units of Parent representing 1% of the issued and outstanding Parent Shares as of the grant date in accordance with and subject to the terms and conditions of Parent’s 2022 Incentive Plan. Mr. Diaz Cala’s restricted stock units are subject to time-based vesting, as follows: 20% vest on the grant date, and the remaining restricted stock units will vest in quarterly installments thereafter over a period of three years subject to his continued service on the Parent Board as of each vesting date subject to earlier vesting as set forth below. \n\nIn the event of the termination of the Independent Contractor Agreement by Parent without Cause or upon a Change in Control (each such term as defined in the Independent Contractor Agreement), any unvested outstanding equity awards held by Mr. Diaz Cala will immediately vest and become nonforfeitable. In the event of the termination of the Independent Contractor Agreement for Cause by the Company or for any reason by Mr. Diaz Cala, all unvested outstanding equity awards will be cancelled and forfeited without consideration. \n\nThe Independent Contractor Agreement also contains non-solicitation and non-competition covenants, generally prohibiting Mr. Diaz Cala from (i) soliciting or hiring employees or business contacts during the one-year period that follows the termination of the Independent Contractor Agreement and (ii) directly or indirectly competing with Parent during the term of the Independent Contractor Agreement. In addition, the Independent Contractor Agreement states that Mr. Diaz Cala will honor his confidentiality obligations after the termination of his services. \n\nThe only discussions involving continuing employment or involvement for any persons affiliated with Lionheart before the Business Combination were with Ophir Sternberg relating to the Chairman Agreement with Parent and with Faquiry Diaz relating to an independent contractor agreement, with Parent, which provides for certain services to the Post-Combination Company. There has not been any formal or informal commitment to retain any financial advisors after the Business Combination, and there are no pre-existing relationships between Lionheart (or individuals affiliated with Lionheart) and additional investors. \n\n**SMX Related Party Transactions**\n\n**_Borrowings from related parties:_**\n\nIn 2015, Security Matters Ltd. signed an agreement to receive a loan of ILS 2 Million (US$512,558 at 2015) from Kibbutz Ketura, an entity associated with Mr. Hofland, and Kibbutz Degania A, an entity associated with Mr. Bader on back-to-back terms from a third party (the Kamea Fund). The loan bears an interest at an annual rate of 4%. The loan was fully repaid in August 2022. Thebalance as of December 31, 2021 was US$269,311 (including provision for bonus at the amount US$87,311), and as of December 31, 2020 was US$279,939. The balance includes interest and there was no change in the interest rate**.**\n\nIn consideration with providing the funding, Security Matters Ltd. agreed to provide, as additional consideration, a bonus payment on the occurrence of an exit or major liquidity event. The bonus payment is capped at ILS 3 Million (approximately US$965,000) per each of Kibbutz Ketura and Kibbutz Degania A (together, the “Bonus Payments”). The Bonus Payments are intended to operate in one of the two trigger events: (i) dividend distributions by Security Matters Ltd.; or (ii) the sale of shares by either Kibbutz Ketura and Kibbutz Degania A in Security Matters Ltd. (either in the event of a takeover or otherwise). Only if the aggregate amounts of one of the two trigger events exceeds the investment of Kibbutz Ketura and Kibbutz Degania A in Security Matters Ltd.

This description is qualified by reference to the Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association as will be in effect upon consummation of the Transactions, a copy of which is attached to this proxy statement/prospectus and are incorporated in this proxy statement/prospectus by reference. \n\n**General**\n\nParent is a public limited company organized and existing under the laws of Ireland. Parent was formed on July 1, 2022 as a public limited company incorporated in Ireland under the name “Empatan Public Limited Company”. Parent’s affairs are governed by the Parent Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association, the ICA, and the laws of Ireland. \n\nThe following are summaries of material provisions of the Parent Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association to be in effect assuming approval of all of the charter proposals and upon consummation of the Transactions, and the ICA, insofar as they relate to the material terms of the Parent Shares. \n\n**Shares**\n\n**_General._** The authorized share capital of Parent is US$100,000,000 divided into 800,000,000,000 ordinary shares with a nominal value of US$0.0001 each, 200,000,000,000 preferred shares with a nominal value of US$0.0001 each and €25,000 divided into 25,000 deferred ordinary shares with a nominal value each of €1.00 each. \n\nImmediately prior to consummation of the Transactions, Parent had issued and paid up share capital of (i) €25,000 representing 25,000 deferred shares of €1.00 each and (ii) US$0.0001 representing one ordinary share of US$0.0001 each in the capital of Parent, in order to satisfy statutory capitalization requirements for all Irish public limited companies. \n\n**_Dividends._** The holders of Parent Shares are entitled to such dividends as may be declared by Parent’s board of directors. Dividends may be declared and paid out of the funds legally available therefor, or any other fund or account which can be authorized for this purpose in accordance with the ICA. \n\n**_Voting Rights_**. Each Parent Share shall be entitled to one vote on all matters subject to the vote at general meetings of Parent. Voting at any meeting of shareholders is by way of a poll, which shall be taken in such manner as the chairperson of the meeting directs. \n\nAn ordinary resolution to be passed at a meeting by the shareholders requires the affirmative vote of a simple majority of the votes attaching to the Parent Shares cast at a meeting, while a special resolution requires the affirmative vote of no less than 75% of the votes cast attaching to the outstanding Parent Shares at a meeting. Where the shareholders wish to act by way of written resolution in lieu of holding a meeting, unanimous consent of the holders of the Parent Shares shall be required. A special resolution will be required for important matters such as a change of name, reducing the share capital or making changes to the Parent Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association to be in effect, assuming approval of all of the charter proposals and upon consummation of the Transactions. \n\n**_Transfer of Parent Shares_**. Subject to the restrictions contained in the BCA with respect to the Parent Shares, and subject to any further restrictions contained in the Parent Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association, any Parent shareholder may transfer all or any of his or her Parent Shares by an instrument of transfer in the usual or common form or any other form approved by Parent’s board of directors. \n\n263 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\n**_Liquidation_**. On a return of capital on winding-up or otherwise (other than on conversion, redemption or purchase of Parent Shares), assets available for distribution among the holders of Parent Shares shall be distributed among the holders thereof on a pro rata basis. If Parent’s assets available for distribution are insufficient to repay all of the paid-up capital, the assets will be distributed so that the losses are borne by Parent’s shareholders proportionately. \n\n**_General Meetings of Shareholders_**. Shareholders’ meetings may be convened by the board of directors on the requisition of the shareholders or, if the board of directors fails to so convene a meeting, such extraordinary general meeting may be convened by the requisitioning shareholders where the requisitioning shareholders hold not less than 10% of the paid up share capital of Parent. Any action required or permitted to be taken at any annual or extraordinary general meetings may be taken only upon the vote of the shareholders at an annual or extraordinary general meeting duly noticed and convened in accordance with the Parent Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association and the ICA. Unanimous consent of the holders of the Parent Shares shall be required before the shareholders may act by way of written resolution without a meeting. \n\n**Warrants**\n\nEach whole Parent Warrant shall entitle the holder thereof to purchase one Parent Share at an exercise price of US$11.50 per share. \n\nSubject to the terms of the BCA, on the consummation of the Transactions, each Company Public Warrant shall remain outstanding but shall be automatically adjusted to become one Parent Warrant. Each such Parent Warrant will continue to have, and be subject to, the same terms and conditions set forth in the warrant agreement pursuant to which such Company Public Warrant was issued immediately prior to the consummation of the Transactions, except that each Parent Warrant will be exercisable (or will become exercisable in accordance with its terms) for that number of whole Parent Shares equal to the number of Company Private Shares that were issuable upon exercise of such Company Public Warrant that was outstanding immediately prior to the consummation of the Transactions. In addition, each Company Private Warrant shall remain outstanding but shall be automatically adjusted to become one Parent Warrant (each a “**Parent Founder Warrant** ”). Each such Parent Founder Warrant will continue to have, and be subject to the same terms and conditions set forth in the warrant agreement pursuant to which such Company Private Warrant was issued immediately prior to the consummation of the Transactions, except that each Parent Founder Warrant will be exercisable (or will become exercisable in accordance with its terms) for that number of whole Parent Shares equal to the number of Company Private Shares that were issuable upon exercise of such Company Private Warrant that was outstanding immediately prior to the consummation of the Transactions. \n\nThe Parent will not be obligated to deliver any Parent Shares pursuant to the exercise of a Parent Warrant and will have no obligation to settle such warrant exercise unless a registration statement under the Securities Act with respect to the Parent Shares underlying the Parent Warrants is then effective and a prospectus relating thereto is current, subject to the Parent satisfying its obligations described below with respect to registration. No Parent Warrant will be exercisable, and the Parent will not be obligated to issue Parent Shares upon exercise of a Parent Warrant unless the Parent Shares issuable upon such Parent Warrant exercise has been registered, qualified or deemed to be exempt under the securities laws of the state of residence of the registered holder of the Parent Warrants. In the event that the conditions in the two immediately preceding sentences are not satisfied with respect to a Parent Warrant, the holder of such warrant will not be entitled to exercise such warrant and such warrant may have no value and expire worthless. In no event will the Parent be required to net cash settle any Parent Warrant.\n\nThe Parent has agreed that as soon as practicable, but in no event later than 30 days after the closing of the Transactions, the Parent will use its best efforts to file with the SEC a registration statement for the registration under the Securities Act of the Parent Shares issuable upon exercise of the Parent Warrants and thereafter will use its best efforts to cause the same to become effective within 60 business days following the closing of the \n\n264 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\nTransactions and to maintain a current prospectus relating to the Parent Shares issuable upon exercise of the Parent Warrants, until the expiration of the Parent Warrants in accordance with the provisions of that certain warrant agreement between Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, as warrant agent, and the Company (the “Warrant Agreement”). If a registration statement covering the Parent Shares issuable upon exercise of the Parent Warrants is not effective by the 60th business day after the closing of the Transactions, holders of the Parent Warrants may, until such time as there is an effective registration statement and during any period when the Parent will have failed to maintain an effective registration statement, exercise Parent Warrants on a “cashless basis” in accordance with Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act or another exemption. If that exemption, or another exemption, is not available, holders of the Parent Warrants will not be able to exercise their Parent Warrants on a cashless basis. Once the Parent Warrants become exercisable, the Parent may call the Parent Warrants for redemption: \n\n• |  in whole and not in part;   \n---|---  \n• |  at a price of $0.01 per warrant;   \n---|---  \n• |  upon not less than 30 days’ prior written notice of redemption (the “30-day redemption period”) to each warrant holder; and   \n---|---  \n• |  if, and only if, the reported last reported sale price of the Parent Shares equals or exceeds $18.00 per share (as adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like) for any 20 trading days within a 30-trading day period ending three trading days before the Parent sends the notice of redemption to the warrant holders.   \n---|---  \n  \nIf and when the Parent Warrants become redeemable by the Parent, the Parent may not exercise its redemption right if the issuance of Parent Shares upon exercise of the Parent Warrants is not exempt from registration or qualification under applicable state blue sky laws or the Parent is unable to effect such registration or qualification. The Parent will use its best efforts to register or qualify such shares under the blue sky laws of the state of residence in those states in which the Parent Warrants were offered. \n\nThe Parent has established the last of the redemption criteria discussed above to prevent a redemption call unless there is at the time of the call a significant premium to the Parent Warrant exercise price. If the foregoing conditions are satisfied and the Parent issues a notice of redemption of the Parent Warrants, each holder of the Parent Warrants will be entitled to exercise its Parent Warrant prior to the scheduled redemption date. However, the price of the Parent Shares may fall below the $18.00 redemption trigger price (as adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like) as well as the $11.50 warrant exercise price after the redemption notice is issued. \n\nIf the Parent calls the Parent Warrants for redemption as described above, the Parent’s management will have the option to require any holder that wishes to exercise its Parent Warrant to do so on a “cashless basis.” In determining whether to require all holders to exercise their Parent Warrants on a “cashless basis,” the Parent’s management will consider, among other factors, the Parent’s cash position, the number of Parent Warrants that are outstanding and the dilutive effect on the Parent’s shareholders of issuing the maximum number of Parent Shares issuable upon the exercise of Parent Warrants. If the Parent’s management takes advantage of this option, all holders of Parent Warrants would pay the exercise price by surrendering their Parent Warrants for that number of Parent Shares equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (x) the product of the number of Parent Shares underlying the Parent Warrants, multiplied by the difference between the exercise price of the Parent Warrants and the “fair market value” (defined below) by (y) the fair market value. The “fair market value” means the average last reported sale price of the Parent Shares for the 10 trading days ending on the third trading day prior to the date on which the notice of redemption is sent to the holders of Parent Warrants. If the Parent’s management takes advantage of this option, the notice of redemption will contain the information necessary to calculate the number of Parent Shares to be received upon exercise of the Parent Warrants, including the “fair market value” in such case. Requiring a cashless exercise in this manner will reduce the number of shares to be issued and thereby lessen the dilutive effect of a warrant redemption. The Parent believes this feature is an \n\n265 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\nattractive option to the Parent if they do not need the cash from the exercise of the Parent Warrants after the closing of the Transactions. \n\nA holder of a Parent Warrant may notify the Parent in writing in the event it elects to be subject to a requirement that such holder will not have the right to exercise such warrant, to the extent that after giving effect to such exercise, such person (together with such person’s affiliates), to the warrant agent’s actual knowledge, would beneficially own in excess of 4.9% or 9.8% (or such other amount as a holder may specify) of the Parent Shares outstanding immediately after giving effect to such exercise. \n\nIf the number of outstanding Parent Shares is increased by a stock dividend payable in Parent Shares, or by a split-up of Parent Shares or other similar event, then, on the effective date of such stock dividend, split-up or similar event, the number of Parent Shares issuable on exercise of each Parent Warrant will be increased in proportion to such increase in the outstanding Parent Shares. A rights offering to holders of Parent Shares entitling holders to purchase Parent Shares at a price less than the fair market value will be deemed a stock dividend of a number of Parent Shares equal to the product of (i) the number of Parent Shares actually sold in such rights offering (or issuable under any other equity securities sold in such rights offering that are convertible into or exercisable for Parent Shares) and (ii) one (1) minus the quotient of (x) the price per share of Parent Shares paid in such rights offering divided by (y) the fair market value. For these purposes (i) if the rights offering is for securities convertible into or exercisable for Parent Shares, in determining the price payable for the Parent Shares, there will be taken into account any consideration received for such rights, as well as any additional amount payable upon exercise or conversion and (ii) fair market value means the volume weighted average price of the Parent Shares as reported during the ten (10) trading day period ending on the trading day prior to the first date on which the Parent Shares trade on the applicable exchange or in the applicable market, regular way, without the right to receive such rights. \n\nIn addition, if the Parent, at any time while the Parent Warrants are outstanding and unexpired, pays a dividend or makes a distribution in cash, securities or other assets to the holders of the Parent Shares on account of such Parent Shares (or other shares of the Parent’s capital stock into which the Parent Warrants are convertible), other than (a) as described above or (b) certain ordinary cash dividends, then the warrant exercise price will be decreased, effective immediately after the effective date of such event, by the amount of cash and/or the fair market value of any securities or other assets paid on each Parent Share in respect of such event. \n\nIf the number of outstanding Parent Shares is decreased by a consolidation, combination, reverse stock split or reclassification of Parent Shares or other similar event, then, on the effective date of such consolidation, combination, reverse stock split, reclassification or similar event, the number of Parent Shares issuable on exercise of each Parent Warrant will be decreased in proportion to such decrease in outstanding Parent Shares. \n\nWhenever the number of Parent Shares purchasable upon the exercise of the Parent Warrants is adjusted, as described above, the warrant exercise price will be adjusted by multiplying the warrant exercise price immediately prior to such adjustment by a fraction (x) the numerator of which will be the number of Parent Shares purchasable upon the exercise of the Parent Warrants immediately prior to such adjustment, and (y) the denominator of which will be the number of Parent Shares so purchasable immediately thereafter. \n\nIn case of any reclassification or reorganization of the outstanding Parent Shares (other than those described above or that solely affects the par value of such Parent Shares), or in the case of any merger or consolidation of the Parent with or into another corporation (other than a consolidation or merger in which the Parent is the continuing corporation and that does not result in any reclassification or reorganization of the outstanding Parent Shares), or in the case of any sale or conveyance to another corporation or entity of the assets or other property of the Parent as an entirety or substantially as an entirety in connection with which the Parent is dissolved, the holders of the Parent Warrants will thereafter have the right to purchase and receive, upon the basis and upon the terms and conditions specified in the Parent Warrants and in lieu of the Parent Shares immediately theretofore purchasable and receivable upon the exercise of the rights represented thereby, the kind and amount of shares of \n\n266 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\nstock or other securities or property (including cash) receivable upon such reclassification, reorganization, merger or consolidation, or upon a dissolution following any such sale or transfer, that the holder of the Parent Warrants would have received if such holder had exercised their Parent Warrants immediately prior to such event. If less than 70% of the consideration receivable by the holders of Parent Shares in such a transaction is payable in the form of Parent Shares in the successor entity that is listed for trading on a national securities exchange or is quoted in an established over-the-counter market, or is to be so listed for trading or quoted immediately following such event, and if the registered holder of the Parent Warrant properly exercises the Parent Warrant within thirty days following public disclosure of such transaction, the Parent Warrant exercise price will be reduced as specified in the Warrant Agreement based on the Black-Scholes value (as defined in the Warrant Agreement) of the Parent Warrant. The purpose of such exercise price reduction is to provide additional value to holders of the Parent Warrants when an extraordinary transaction occurs during the exercise period of the Parent Warrants pursuant to which the holders of the Parent Warrants otherwise do not receive the full potential value of the Parent Warrants in order to determine and realize the option value component of the Parent Warrant. This formula is to compensate the warrant holder for the loss of the option value portion of the Parent Warrant due to the requirement that the warrant holder exercise the warrant within 30 days of the event. The Black-Scholes model is an accepted pricing model for estimating fair market value where no quoted market price for an instrument is available. \n\nThe Warrant Agreement provides that the terms of the Parent Warrants may be amended without the consent of any holder to cure any ambiguity or correct any defective provision, but requires the approval by the holders of at least 65% of the then outstanding Parent Warrants to make any change that adversely affects the interests of the registered holders of the Parent Warrants. \n\nThe Parent Warrants may be exercised upon surrender of the warrant certificate on or prior to the expiration date at the offices of the warrant agent, with the exercise form on the reverse side of the warrant certificate completed and executed as indicated, accompanied by full payment of the exercise price (or on a cashless basis, if applicable), by certified or official bank check payable to the Parent, for the number of Parent Warrants being exercised. The warrant holders do not have the rights or privileges of holders of Parent Shares and any voting rights until they exercise their Parent Warrants and receive Parent Shares. After the issuance of Parent Shares upon exercise of the Parent Warrants, each holder will be entitled to one (1) vote for each share held of record on all matters to be voted on by Parent shareholders. \n\nNo fractional shares will be issued upon exercise of the warrants. If, upon exercise of the warrants, a holder would be entitled to receive a fractional interest in a share, the Parent will, upon exercise, round down to the nearest whole number the number of Parent Shares to be issued to the warrant holder. \n\nThe Parent has agreed that, subject to applicable law, any action, proceeding or claim against the Parent arising out of or relating in any way to the Warrant Agreement will be brought and enforced in the courts of the State of New York or the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, and the Parent irrevocably submits to such jurisdiction, which jurisdiction will be the exclusive forum for any such action, proceeding or claim. See “Risk Factors — The warrant agreement will designate the courts of the State of New York or the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by holders of our warrants, which could limit the ability of warrant holders to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with our company.” This provision applies to claims under the Securities Act but does not apply to claims under the Exchange Act or any claim for which the federal district courts of the United States of America are the sole and exclusive forum. \n\n**History of Security Issuances**\n\nUpon its formation, Parent issued one ordinary share at a price of US$0.0001 each to Doron Afik, and subsequently 25,000 deferred ordinary shares at a price of €1.00 per share, to Doron Afik. Immediately prior to consummation of the Transactions, Parent had paid up capital of €25,000 and US$0.0001. \n\n267 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\n**Transfer Agent**\n\nUpon the completion of the Transactions, the transfer agent for the Parent Shares will be Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company. \n\n**Listing**\n\nParent will apply for the listing of the Parent Shares and Parent Warrants on Nasdaq under the symbols “SMX” and “SMXW”, respectively. \n\n268 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\n**APPRAISAL RIGHTS**\n\nAppraisal rights are statutory rights that, if applicable under law, enable stockholders of a corporation to dissent from a merger and to demand that such corporation pay the fair value for their shares as determined by a court in a judicial proceeding instead of receiving the consideration offered to such stockholders in connection with the transaction. \n\nUnder Section 262 of the DGCL, holders of the Company’s Class B Common Stock who do not consent to the adoption of the Business Combination and who otherwise follow the procedures set forth in Section 262 of the DGCL will be entitled to have their shares of Class B Common Stock appraised by the Delaware Court of Chancery and to receive payment in cash of the “fair value” of the shares, exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger, together with interest, if any, to be paid on the amount determined to be “fair value.” Holders of Class B Common Stock seeking appraisal should be aware that the “fair value” of their shares as so determined could be more than, the same as or less than the consideration they would receive pursuant to the BCA if they did not seek appraisal of their shares. \n\nAny holder of Class B Common Stock wishing to exercise appraisal rights must, within 20 days after the date of mailing of the notice of their right to demand appraisal, make a written demand for the appraisal of the stockholder’s shares to the Company (as the surviving corporation in the merger), and that stockholder must not submit a written consent approving the adoption of the Business Combination. Failure to follow the procedures specified under Section 262 of the DGCL may result in the loss of appraisal rights. \n\n269 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\n**STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS**\n\nIf the Business Combination is consummated and Parent holds a 2023 annual general meeting, it will provide notice of or otherwise publicly disclose the date on which the 2023 annual meeting will be held. If the 2023 annual general meeting is held, shareholder proposals will be eligible for consideration by the directors for inclusion in the proxy statement for Parent’s 2023 annual general meeting in accordance with Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act. \n\n**OTHER STOCKHOLDER COMMUNICATIONS**\n\nStockholders and interested parties may communicate with Lionheart’s board of directors, any committee chairperson or the non-management directors as a group by writing to the board or committee chairperson in care of Lionheart III Corp, 4218 NE 2nd Avenue, Miami, FL 33137.

DESCRIPTION OF ORGANIZATION AND BUSINESS OPERATIONS**\n\nLionheart III Corp (the “Company”) was incorporated in Delaware on January 14, 2021. The Company is a blank check company formed for the purpose of entering into a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses or entities (the “Business Combination”). \n\nThe Company is an early stage and emerging growth company and, as such, the Company is subject to all of the risks associated with early stage and emerging growth companies. \n\nAs of September 30, 2022, the Company had not commenced any operations. All activity for the period from January 14, 2021 (inception) through September 30, 2022 relates to the Company’s formation, the initial public offering (“Initial Public Offering”), which is described below, and subsequent to the Initial Public Offering, identifying a target company for a Business Combination. The Company will not generate any operating revenues until after the completion of a Business Combination, at the earliest. The Company generates non-operating income in the form of interest income from the proceeds derived from the Initial Public Offering. \n\nThe registration statements for the Company’s Initial Public Offering were declared effective on November 3, 2021. On November 8, 2021, the Company consummated the Initial Public Offering of 12,500,000 units (the “Units” and, with respect to the shares of Class A common stock included in the Units sold, the “Public Shares”), which includes the full exercise by the underwriter of its over-allotment option in the amount of 1,000,000 Units, at $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of $125,000,000, which is described in Note 3. \n\nSimultaneously with the closing of the Initial Public Offering, the Company consummated the sale of 2,000,000 warrants (each, a “Private Placement Warrant” and, collectively, the “Private Placement Warrants”) at a price of $1.00 per Private Placement Warrant and the sale of 400,000 units (the “Private Placement Units” and, together with the Private Placement Warrants, the “Private Securities”) in a private placement to Lionheart Equities, LLC (the “Sponsor”) and Nomura Securities International, Inc. (“Nomura”), Northland Securities, Inc. and Drexel Hamilton, LLC, the underwriters of the Initial Public Offering (the “Underwriters”), generating gross proceeds of $6,000,000, which is described in Note 4. \n\nTransaction costs amounted to $7,388,270, consisting of $2,500,000 of underwriting fees, $4,375,000 of deferred underwriting fees and $513,270 of other offering costs. \n\nFollowing the closing of the Initial Public Offering on November 8, 2021, an amount of $126,250,000 ($10.10 per Unit) from the net proceeds of the sale of the Units in the Initial Public Offering and the sale of the Private Securities was placed in a trust account (the “Trust Account”), invested in U.S. government securities, within the meaning set forth in Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment Company Act”), with a maturity of 180 days or less, or in any open-ended investment company that holds itself out as a money market fund meeting the conditions of Rule 2a-7 of the Investment Company Act, as determined by the Company, until the earlier of: (i) the consummation of a Business Combination or (ii) the distribution of the funds in the Trust Account to the Company’s stockholders, as described below. \n\nThe Company’s management has broad discretion with respect to the specific application of the net proceeds of the Initial Public Offering and the sale of the Private Securities, although substantially all of the net proceeds are intended to be applied generally toward consummating a Business Combination. There is no assurance that the Company will be able to complete a Business Combination successfully. The Company must complete a Business Combination having an aggregate fair market value of at least 80% of the assets held in the Trust \n\nF-6 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\n**LIONHEART III CORP**\n\n**NOTES TO CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**\n\n**SEPTEMBER 30, 2022**\n\n**(Unaudited)**\n\nAccount (as defined below) (excluding taxes payable on income earned on the Trust Account) at the time of the agreement to enter into an initial Business Combination. The Company intends to only complete a Business Combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. \n\nThe Company will provide its holders of the outstanding Public Shares (the “public stockholders”) with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their Public Shares upon the completion of a Business Combination either (i) in connection with a stockholder meeting called to approve the Business Combination or (ii) by means of a tender offer. The decision as to whether the Company will seek stockholder approval of a Business Combination or conduct a tender offer will be made by the Company, solely in its discretion. The public stockholders will be entitled to redeem their Public Shares for a pro rata portion of the amount then in the Trust Account (initially anticipated to be $10.10 per Public Share, plus any pro rata interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to the Company to pay its tax obligations). There will be no redemption rights upon the completion of a Business Combination with respect to the Company’s warrants. \n\nThe Company will proceed with a Business Combination if the Company has net tangible assets of at least $5,000,001 immediately prior to or upon such consummation of a Business Combination and, if the Company seeks stockholder approval, a majority of the shares voted are voted in favor of the Business Combination. If a stockholder vote is not required by law and the Company does not decide to hold a stockholder vote for business or other legal reasons, the Company will, pursuant to its Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the “Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation”), conduct the redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) and file tender offer documents with the SEC containing substantially the same information as would be included in a proxy statement prior to completing a Business Combination. If, however, stockholder approval of the transaction is required by law, or the Company decides to obtain stockholder approval for business or legal reasons, the Company will offer to redeem shares in conjunction with a proxy solicitation pursuant to the proxy rules and not pursuant to the tender offer rules. If the Company seeks stockholder approval in connection with a Business Combination, the Sponsor and the Underwriters have agreed to vote their Founder Shares (as defined in Note 5), Placement Shares (as defined in Note 5) and any Public Shares purchased during or after the Initial Public Offering in favor of approving a Business Combination. Additionally, each public stockholder may elect to redeem their Public Shares irrespective of whether they vote for or against the proposed transaction or do not vote at all. \n\nNotwithstanding the above, if the Company seeks stockholder approval of a Business Combination and it does not conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules, the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation provides that a public stockholder, together with any affiliate of such stockholder or any other person with whom such stockholder is acting in concert or as a “group” (as defined under Section 13 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”)), will be restricted from redeeming its shares with respect to more than an aggregate of 20% or more of the Public Shares, without the prior consent of the Company. \n\nThe Sponsor and the Underwriters have agreed (a) to waive their redemption rights with respect to the Founder Shares, Placement Shares and Public Shares held by them in connection with the completion of a Business Combination and (b) not to propose an amendment to the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (i) to modify the substance or timing of the Company’s obligation to allow redemption in connection with the Company’s initial Business Combination and certain amendments to the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation or to redeem 100% of its Public Shares if the Company does not complete a Business Combination \n\nF-7 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\n**LIONHEART III CORP**\n\n**NOTES TO CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**\n\n**SEPTEMBER 30, 2022**\n\n**(Unaudited)**\n\nor (ii) with respect to any other provision relating to stockholders’ rights or pre-initial business combination activity, unless the Company provides the public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem their Public Shares in conjunction with any such amendment. \n\nThe Company will have until 12 months from the closing of the Initial Public Offering (or up to 18 months in total if the Company extends the period of time to consummate our initial business combination in accordance with the terms described in the registration statement related to the Initial Public Offering) to complete a Business Combination (the “Combination Period”), subject to the Sponsor depositing additional funds into the Trust Account as set forth below. If the Company is unable to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period and stockholders do not approve an amendment to the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation to extend this date, the Company will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the Public Shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account including interest (which interest shall be net of taxes payable), divided by the number of then outstanding Public Shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders’ rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of the Company’s remaining stockholders and the Company’s board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii) to the Company’s obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. There will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect to the Company’s warrants, which will expire worthless if the Company fails to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period. \n\nIn order for the time available for the Company to consummate an Initial Business Combination to be extended, for each one-month extension, the Sponsor or its affiliates or designees must deposit into the Trust Account $412,500 based on the underwriters’ over-allotment option being fully exercised ($0.033 per share), on or prior to the date of the applicable deadline up to an aggregate of $2,475,000. Any such payments would be made in the exchange for a non-interest bearing, unsecured promissory note which would be repaid, if at all, at the option of the Sponsor, from funds released to the Company upon completion of an Initial Business Combination or via conversion of a portion or all of the total loan amount into units at a price of $10.00 per unit, which units will be identical to the Private Placement Units. \n\nThe holders of the Founder Shares and Placement Shares will agree to waive liquidation rights with respect to such shares if the Company fails to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period. However, if the Sponsors acquire Public Shares in or after the Initial Public Offering, such Public Shares will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account if the Company fails to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period. The underwriters have agreed to waive their rights to their deferred underwriting commission (see Note 6) held in the Trust Account in the event the Company does not complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period and, in such event, such amounts will be included with the other funds held in the Trust Account that will be available to fund the redemption of the Public Shares. In the event of such distribution, it is possible that the per share value of the assets remaining available for distribution will be less than the Initial Public Offering price per Unit ($10.00). \n\nIn order to protect the amounts held in the Trust Account, the Sponsor will agree to be liable to the Company if and to the extent any claims by a vendor for services rendered or products sold to the Company, or a prospective target business with which the Company has discussed entering into a transaction agreement, reduce the amount of funds in the Trust Account to below (i) $10.10 per Public Share or (ii) such lesser amount per Public Share \n\nF-8 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\n**LIONHEART III CORP**\n\n**NOTES TO CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**\n\n**SEPTEMBER 30, 2022**\n\n**(Unaudited)**\n\nheld in the Trust Account as of the date of the liquidation of the Trust Account due to reductions in the value of trust assets, in each case net of the interest which may be withdrawn to pay the Company’s tax obligation and up to $100,000 for liquidation expenses, except as to any claims by a third party who executed a waiver of any and all rights to seek access to the Trust Account (even if such waiver is deemed to be unenforceable) and except as to any claims under the Company’s indemnity of the underwriters of Initial Public Offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”). Moreover, in the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, the Sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third-party claims. The Company will seek to reduce the possibility that the Sponsor will have to indemnify the Trust Account due to claims of creditors by endeavoring to have all vendors, service providers (except the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm), prospective target businesses or other entities with which the Company does business, execute agreements with the Company waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to monies held in the Trust Account.\n\n**_Proposed Business Combination_**\n\nOn July 26, 2022, the Company entered into a Business Combination Agreement (as it may be amended, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time, the “BCA”) and a scheme implementation deed (“SID”) by and among the Company, Security Matters Limited, a publicly traded company on the Australian Securities Exchange (“ASX”)(“SMX”), Empatan Public Limited Company, a public limited company incorporated in Ireland (“Parent”), and Aryeh Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (“Merger Sub”). \n\nSubject to the terms and conditions set forth in the BCA, including the approval of the Company’s stockholders, the parties thereto will enter into a business combination transaction (the “** _Business Combination_** ”), pursuant to which, among other things Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company with the Company continuing as a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent. \n\n**_Risks and Uncertainties_**\n\nManagement continues to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and has concluded that while it is reasonably possible that the virus could have a negative effect on the Company’s financial position, results of its operations, and/or search for a target company, the specific impact is not readily determinable as of the date of these financial statements. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. \n\nIn February 2022, the Russian Federation and Belarus commenced a military action with the country of Ukraine. As a result of this action, various nations, including the United States, have instituted economic sanctions against the Russian Federation and Belarus. Further, the impact of this action and related sanctions on the world economy are not determinable as of the date of these financial statements. The specific impact on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows is also not determinable as of the date of these financial statements. \n\nOn August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the “IR Act”) was signed into federal law. The IR Act provides for, among other things, a new U.S. federal 1% excise tax on certain repurchases of stock by publicly traded U.S. domestic corporations and certain U.S. domestic subsidiaries of publicly traded foreign corporations occurring on or after January 1, 2023. The excise tax is imposed on the repurchasing corporation itself, not its shareholders from which shares are repurchased. The amount of the excise tax is generally 1% of the fair market \n\nF-9 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\n**LIONHEART III CORP**\n\n**NOTES TO CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**\n\n**SEPTEMBER 30, 2022**\n\n**(Unaudited)**\n\nvalue of the shares repurchased at the time of the repurchase. However, for purposes of calculating the excise tax, repurchasing corporations are permitted to net the fair market value of certain new stock issuances against the fair market value of stock repurchases during the same taxable year. In addition, certain exceptions apply to the excise tax. The U.S. Department of the Treasury (the “Treasury”) has been given authority to provide regulations and other guidance to carry out and prevent the abuse or avoidance of the excise tax \n\nAny redemption or other repurchase that occurs after December 31, 2022, in connection with a Business Combination, extension vote or otherwise, may be subject to the excise tax. Whether and to what extent the Company would be subject to the excise tax in connection with a Business Combination, extension vote or otherwise would depend on a number of factors, including (i) the fair market value of the redemptions and repurchases in connection with the Business Combination, extension or otherwise, (ii) the structure of a Business Combination, (iii) the nature and amount of any “PIPE” or other equity issuances in connection with a Business Combination (or otherwise issued not in connection with a Business Combination but issued within the same taxable year of a Business Combination) and (iv) the content of regulations and other guidance from the Treasury. In addition, because the excise tax would be payable by the Company and not by the redeeming holder, the mechanics of any required payment of the excise tax have not been determined. The foregoing could cause a reduction in the cash available on hand to complete a Business Combination and in the Company’s ability to complete a Business Combination. \n\n**_Going Concern_**\n\nAs of September 30, 2022, the Company had cash of $490,218 not held in the Trust Account that is available for working capital purposes and had a working capital deficit of $2,238,655 when excluding Federal and Delaware tax liabilities that can be paid with the interest earned on the Trust Account.\n\nUntil the consummation of a Business Combination, the Company will be using the funds not held in the Trust Account for identifying and evaluating prospective acquisition candidates, performing due diligence on prospective target businesses, paying for travel expenditures, selecting the target business to acquire, and structuring, negotiating and consummating the Business Combination. \n\nThe Company may need to raise further additional capital through loans or additional investments from its Sponsor, stockholders, officers, directors, or third parties. In addition to the loan commitment described herein, the Company’s officers, directors and Sponsor may, but are not obligated to, loan the Company funds, from time to time or at any time, in whatever amount they deem reasonable in their sole discretion, to meet the Company’s working capital needs. Accordingly, the Company may not be able to obtain additional financing. If the Company is unable to raise additional capital, it may be required to take additional measures to conserve liquidity, which could include, but not necessarily be limited to, curtailing operations, suspending the pursuit of a potential transaction, and reducing overhead expenses. The Company cannot provide any assurance that new financing will be available to it on commercially acceptable terms, if at all. If a Business Combination is not consummated by November 8, 2022, the Company’s liquidation date, there will be a mandatory liquidation and subsequent dissolution of the Company. The Company has the ability to extend the mandatory liquidation date up to May 8, 2023, as needed, provided that the Company deposit $412,500 per month into the Trust Account. The Company intends to complete its initial business combination before the mandatory liquidation date; however, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to consummate any business combination Management has determined that the Company’s liquidity condition and the mandatory liquidation without an extension, should a Business Combination not occur, and potential subsequent dissolution raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. These consolidated financial statements do not include any \n\nF-10 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\n**LIONHEART III CORP**\n\n**NOTES TO CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**\n\n**SEPTEMBER 30, 2022**\n\n**(Unaudited)**\n\nadjustments relating to the recovery of the recorded assets or the classification of the liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. \n\n**NOTE 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES**\n\n**_Basis of Presentation_**\n\nThe accompanying unaudited condensed financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) for interim financial information and in accordance with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 8 of Regulation S-X of the SEC. Certain information or footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP have been condensed or omitted, pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC for interim financial reporting. Accordingly, they do not include all the information and footnotes necessary for a complete presentation of financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited condensed financial statements include all adjustments, consisting of a normal recurring nature, which are necessary for a fair presentation of the financial position, operating results and cash flows for the periods presented. \n\nThe accompanying unaudited condensed financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company’s Annual Report on Form10-K for the period ended December 31, 2021, as filed with the SEC on April 14, 2022. The interim results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the year ending December 31, 2022 or for any future periods. \n\n**_Emerging Growth Company_**\n\nThe Company is an “emerging growth company,” as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act, as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the “JOBS Act”), and it may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the independent registered public accounting firm attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in its periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. \n\nFurther, Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until private companies (that is, those that have not had a Securities Act registration statement declared effective or do not have a class of securities registered under the Exchange Act) are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting standards. The JOBS Act provides that a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies but any such election to opt out is irrevocable. The Company has elected not to opt out of such extended transition period which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private companies, the Company, as an emerging growth company, can adopt the new or revised standard at the time private companies adopt the new or revised standard. This may make comparison of the Company’s financial statements with another public company which is neither an emerging growth company nor an emerging growth company which has opted out of using the extended transition period difficult or impossible because of the potential differences in accounting standards used. \n\nF-11 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\n**LIONHEART III CORP**\n\n**NOTES TO CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**\n\n**SEPTEMBER 30, 2022**\n\n**(Unaudited)**\n\n**_Use of Estimates_**\n\nThe preparation of the condensed financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires the Company’s management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. \n\nMaking estimates requires management to exercise significant judgment. It is at least reasonably possible that the estimate of the effect of a condition, situation or set of circumstances that existed at the date of the financial statements, which management considered in formulating its estimate, could change in the near term due to one or more future confirming events. Accordingly, the actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. \n\n**_Cash and Cash Equivalents_**\n\nThe Company considers all short-term investments with an original maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. The Company did not have any cash equivalents as of September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021. \n\n**_Marketable Securities Held in Trust Account_**\n\nAt September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, substantially all of the assets held in the Trust Account were held in money market funds which are invested primarily in U.S. Treasury securities. All of the Company’s investments held in the Trust Account are classified as trading securities. Trading securities are presented on the balance sheets at fair value at the end of each reporting period. Gains and losses resulting from the change in fair value of investments held in the Trust Account are included in interest earned on marketable securities held in Trust Account in the accompanying condensed statements of operations. The estimated fair values of investments held in Trust Account are determined using available market information. \n\n**_Class A Common Stock Subject to Possible Redemption_**\n\nThe Company accounts for its Class A common stock subject to possible redemption in accordance with the guidance in Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 480 “Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity.” Common stock subject to mandatory redemption is classified as a liability instrument and is measured at fair value. Conditionally redeemable common stock (including common stock that features redemption rights that is either within the control of the holder or subject to redemption upon the occurrence of uncertain events not solely within the Company’s control) is classified as temporary equity. At all other times, common stock is classified as stockholders’ equity. The Company’s Class A common stock feature certain redemption rights that are considered to be outside of the Company’s control and subject to occurrence of uncertain future events. Accordingly, at September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, Class A common stock subject to possible redemption is presented at redemption value as temporary equity, outside of the stockholders’ deficit section of the Company’s condensed balance sheets. \n\nThe Company recognizes changes in redemption value immediately as they occur and adjusts the carrying value of redeemable common stock to equal the redemption value at the end of each reporting period. This method would view the end of the reporting period as if it were also the redemption date for the security. Immediately upon the closing of the Initial Public Offering, the Company recognized the accretion from initial book value to redemption amount value. The change in the carrying value of redeemable Class A common stock resulted in charges against additional paid-in capital and accumulated deficit. \n\nF-12 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\n**LIONHEART III CORP**\n\n**NOTES TO CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**\n\n**SEPTEMBER 30, 2022**\n\n**(Unaudited)**\n\nAt September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the Class A common stock reflected in the condensed balance sheets are reconciled in the following table: \n\nGross proceeds | $ | 125,000,000  \n---|---|---  \nLess:  \nProceeds allocated to Public Warrants | (3,875,000 | )   \nClass A common stock issuance costs | (7,136,454 | )   \nPlus:  \nAccretion of carrying value to redemption value | 12,261,454  \n**Class A common stock subject to possible redemption, December 31, 2021** | **126,250,000**  \nPlus:  \nAccretion of carrying value to redemption value | 433,750  \n**Class A common stock subject to possible redemption, September 30, 2022** | **$** | **126,683,750**  \n  \n**_Income Taxes_**\n\nThe Company accounts for income taxes under ASC 740, “Income Taxes.” ASC 740, Income Taxes, requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for both the expected impact of differences between the unaudited condensed financial statements and tax basis of assets and liabilities and for the expected future tax benefit to be derived from tax loss and tax credit carry forwards. ASC 740 additionally requires a valuation allowance to be established when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. As of September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the Company’s deferred tax asset had a full valuation allowance recorded against it. Our effective tax rate was 3.58% and 0% for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The effective tax rate differs from the statutory tax rate of 21% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, due to changes in fair value in warrant liability and the valuation allowance on the deferred tax assets.\n\nASC 740 also clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise’s financial statements and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement process for financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. For those benefits to be recognized, a tax position must be more-likely-than-not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities. ASC 740 also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim period, disclosure and transition. \n\nThe Company recognizes accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense. There were no unrecognized tax benefits and no amounts accrued for interest and penalties as of September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021. The Company is currently not aware of any issues under review that could result in significant payments, accruals or material deviation from its position. \n\nThe Company has identified the United States as its only “major” tax jurisdiction. The Company is subject to income taxation by major taxing authorities since inception. These examinations may include questioning the \n\nF-13 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\n**LIONHEART III CORP**\n\n**NOTES TO CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**\n\n**SEPTEMBER 30, 2022**\n\n**(Unaudited)**\n\ntiming and amount of deductions, the nexus of income among various tax jurisdictions and compliance with federal and state tax laws. The Company’s management does not expect that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits will materially change over the next twelve months. \n\n**_Net Loss per Common Share_**\n\nThe Company complies with accounting and disclosure requirements of FASB ASC Topic 260, “Earnings Per Share”. The Company has two classes of shares, which are referred to as Class A common stock and Class B common stock. Income and losses are shared pro rata between the two classes of shares. Net loss per common share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of common stock outstanding for the period. Accretion associated with the redeemable shares of Class A common stock is excluded from earnings per share as the redemption value approximates fair value. \n\nThe calculation of diluted income (loss) per share does not consider the effect of the warrants issued in connection with the (i) Initial Public Offering, and (ii) the private placement since the exercise of the warrants is contingent upon the occurrence of future events. The warrants are exercisable to purchase 8,850,000 Class A common stock in the aggregate. As of September 30, 2022 and 2021, the Company did not have any dilutive securities or other contracts that could, potentially, be exercised or converted into common stock and then share in the earnings of the Company. As a result, diluted net loss per common stock is the same as basic net loss per common stock for the periods presented. \n\nF-14 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\n**LIONHEART III CORP**\n\n**NOTES TO CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**\n\n**SEPTEMBER 30, 2022**\n\n**(Unaudited)**\n\nThe following table reflects the calculation of basic and diluted net loss per common stock (in dollars, except per share amounts): \n\n**Three Months EndedSeptember 30, 2022** | **Three Months EndedSeptember 30, 2021** | **Nine Months EndedSeptember 30, 2022** | **For thePeriod fromJanuary 14,2021(Inception)throughSeptember 30, 2021**  \n---|---|---|---  \n**Class A** | **Class B** | **Class A** | **Class B** | **Class A** | **Class B** | **Class A** | **Class B**  \n_Basic and diluted net loss per common stock_  \nNumerator:  \nAllocation of net loss | $ | (1,506,063 | )  | $ | (364,841 | )  | $ | —  | (2,830 | )  | $ | (2,594,978 | )  | $ | (628,629 | )  | $ | —  | $ | (3,859 | )   \nDenominator:  \nBasic and diluted weighted average shares outstanding | 12,900,000 | 3,125,000 | —  | 2,875,000 | 12,900,000 | 3,125,000 | —  | 2,875,000  \nBasic and diluted net loss per common stock | $ | (0.12 | )  | $ | (0.12 | )  | $ | —  | (0.00 | )  | $ | (0.20 | )  | $ | (0.20 | )  | $ | —  | $ | (0.00 | )   \n  \n**_Concentration of Credit Risk_**\n\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist of a cash account in a financial institution, which, at times, may exceed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation coverage limit of $250,000. The Company has not experienced losses on this account and management believes the Company is not exposed to significant risks on such account. \n\n**_Fair value of Financial Instruments_**\n\nThe fair value of the Company’s assets and liabilities, which qualify as financial instruments under ASC 820, “Fair Value Measurement,” approximates the carrying amounts represented in the accompanying condensed balance sheets, primarily due to their short-term nature. \n\n**_Fair Value of Financial Instruments_**\n\nFair value is defined as the price that would be received for sale of an asset or paid for transfer of a liability, in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.

The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active Markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements). These tiers include: \n\n• |  Level 1, defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical instruments in active markets;   \n---|---  \n• |  Level 2, defined as inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable such as quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets or quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active; and   \n---|---  \n• |  Level 3, defined as unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions, such as valuations derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs or significant value drivers are unobservable.   \n---|---  \n  \nIn some circumstances, the inputs used to measure fair value might be categorized within different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In those instances, the fair value measurement is categorized in its entirety in the fair value hierarchy based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement. \n\n**_Warrant Instruments_**\n\nThe Company accounts for the 8,450,000 warrants issued in connection with the Initial Public Offering and the private placement in accordance with the guidance contained in FASB ASC 815 “Derivatives and Hedging” where warrants that do not meet the criteria for equity treatment must be treated as liabilities. The Company evaluated and classifies its warrant instruments under equity treatment and will be reported at carrying value. As of September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, there are 8,450,000 warrants outstanding (consisting of 6,250,000 Public Warrants, 2,000,000 Private Placement Warrants, and 200,000 Private Placement Warrants embedded in Private Units purchased by the Sponsor and the Underwriters). \n\n**_Recent Accounting Standards_**\n\nManagement does not believe that there are any recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting standards, that if currently adopted, would have a material effect on the Company’s condensed financial statements. \n\n**NOTE 3. PUBLIC OFFERING**\n\nPursuant to the Initial Public Offering, the sold 12,500,000 Units, which includes a full exercise by the underwriters of their over-allotment option in the amount of 1,000,000 Units, at a price of $10.00 per Unit. Each Unit consists of one share of Class A common stock and one-half of one redeemable warrant (“Public Warrant”). Each Public Warrant entitles the holder to purchase one share of Class A common stock at a price of $11.50 per share, subject to adjustment (see Note 7). \n\n**NOTE 4. PRIVATE PLACEMENT**\n\nSimultaneously with the closing of the Initial Public Offering, the Sponsor purchased 2,000,000 Private Placement Warrants, at a purchase price of $1.00 per Private Placement Warrant, for an aggregate purchase price of $2,000,000, and 275,000 Private Placement Units, at a purchase price of $10.00 per Private Placement Unit, for an aggregate price of $2,750,000, and the Underwriters purchased 125,000 Private Placement at a price of $10.00 per Private Placement Unit, for an aggregate purchase price of $1,250,000, from the Company in a private \n\nF-16 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\n**LIONHEART III CORP**\n\n**NOTES TO CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**\n\n**SEPTEMBER 30, 2022**\n\n**(Unaudited)**\n\nplacement. Each Private Placement Warrant entitles the holder to purchase one share of common stock at a price of $11.50 per share, subject to adjustment (see Note 7). Each Private Placement Unit consists of one share of common stock (“Placement Share”) and one-half of one redeemable warrant (“Placement Warrant”). Each Placement Warrant entitles the holder to purchase one share of common stock at a price of $11.50 per share, subject to adjustment (see Note 7). \n\nThe proceeds from the sale of the Private Securities were added to the net proceeds from the Initial Public Offering held in the Trust Account. If the Company does not complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period, the proceeds from the sale of the Private Securities held in the Trust Account will be used to fund the redemption of the Public Shares (subject to the requirements of applicable law) and the Private Securities and all underlying securities will expire worthless. \n\n**NOTE 5. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS**\n\n**_Founder Shares_**\n\nOn January 27, 2021, the Sponsor purchased 2,875,000 shares (the “Founder Shares”) of the Company’s common stock for an aggregate price of $25,000. On November 3, 2021, the Company effected a stock dividend resulting in the Sponsor holding an aggregate of 3,125,000 Founder Shares. The Company filed the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation prior to the closing date of the Initial Public Offering such that the Company is authorized to issue shares of Class B common stock. Pursuant to the amendment, the Founder Shares were converted into shares of Class B common stock. \n\nThe Sponsor has agreed not to transfer, assign or sell any of its Founder Shares until the earlier to occur of: (A) six months after the completion of a Business Combination or (B) subsequent to a Business Combination, (x) if the last reported sale price of the Class A common stock equals or exceeds $12.00 per share (as adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like) for any 20 trading days within any30-tradingday period commencing at least 30 days after a Business Combination, or (y) the date on which the Company completes a liquidation, merger, capital stock exchange or other similar transaction that results in all of the stockholders having the right to exchange their shares of common stock for cash, securities or other property. \n\n**_Administrative Services Agreement_**\n\nThe Company entered into an agreement, commencing on November 2, 2021, to pay the Sponsor a total of $15,000 per month for office space, utilities and secretarial and administrative support. Upon completion of the Business Combination or the Company’s liquidation, the Company will cease paying these monthly fees. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, the Company incurred $45,000 and $135,000 in fees for these services, of which $19,000 is included in accrued expenses in the accompanying unaudited condensed balance sheet as of September 30, 2022. For the period from January 14, 2021 (inception) through September 30, 2021, the Company did not incur any fees for these services. \n\n**_Promissory Note — Related Party_**\n\nOn January 27, 2021, the Sponsor agreed to loan the Company an aggregate of up to $75,000 to cover expenses related to the Initial Public Offering pursuant to a promissory note (the “Promissory Note”). The Promissory Note was non-interest bearing and was payable on the consummation of the Initial Public Offering. The outstanding balance under the Promissory Note of $75,000 was repaid at the closing of the Initial Public Offering on November 8, 2021. This note is no longer available to be drawn upon. \n\nF-17 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\n**LIONHEART III CORP**\n\n**NOTES TO CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**\n\n**SEPTEMBER 30, 2022**\n\n**(Unaudited)**\n\n**_Related Party Loans_**\n\nIn order to finance transaction costs in connection with a Business Combination, the Sponsor or an affiliate of the Sponsor or certain of the Company’s directors and officers may, but are not obligated to, loan the Company funds as may be required (“Working Capital Loans”). If the Company completes a Business Combination, the Company would repay the Working Capital Loans out of the proceeds of the Trust Account released to the Company. Otherwise, the Working Capital Loans would be repaid only out of funds held outside the Trust Account. In the event that a Business Combination does not close, the Company may use a portion of proceeds held outside the Trust Account to repay the Working Capital Loans, but no proceeds held in the Trust Account would be used to repay the Working Capital Loans. Except for the foregoing, the terms of such Working Capital Loans, if any, have not been determined and no written agreements exist with respect to such loans. The Working Capital Loans would either be repaid upon consummation of a Business Combination, without interest, or, at the lender’s discretion, up to $1,500,000 of such Working Capital Loans may be convertible into units of the post-Business Combination entity at a price of $10.00 per unit. The units would be identical to the Private Placement Units. As of September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, there are no Working Capital Loans outstanding. \n\n**_Extension Deposits by Related Party_**\n\nIn order for the time available for the Company to consummate an Initial Business Combination to be extended, for each one-month extension the Sponsor or its affiliates or designees must deposit into the Trust Account $412,500 based on the underwriters’ over-allotment option being fully exercised ($0.033 per share), on or prior to the date of the applicable deadline, for each one month extension, up to an aggregate of $2,475,000. Any such payments would be made in the exchange for a non-interest bearing, unsecured promissory note which would be repaid, if at all, at the option of the Sponsor, from funds released to the Company upon completion of an Initial Business Combination or via conversion of a portion or all of the total loan amount into units at a price of $10.00 per unit, which units will be identical to the Private Placement Units. \n\n**_General Legal Counsel_**\n\nOn January 10, 2017, an affiliate of the Company’s Sponsor, Lionheart Capital, LLC (“Lionheart Capital”), engaged Jessica L. Wasserstrom, LLC (“Wasserstrom”), to represent Lionheart Capital and its affiliated companies, as corporate general counsel and otherwise in connection with any corporate and/or transactional matters as requested by Lionheart Capital. The engagement letter between Lionheart Capital and Wasserstrom is for an indefinite period only subject to termination rights of either party, of which no termination has occurred since the agreement was executed. Jessica Wasserstrom, the principal of Wasserstrom, currently holds the title of Chief Legal Officer of Lionheart Capital and its affiliated companies. \n\nIn connection therewith, Wasserstrom was specifically engaged by the Company to provide counsel for general corporate legal matters, including related to mergers and acquisitions activity and, as such, may be deemed to be a related party of the Company. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, the Company incurred an aggregate of $25,000 and $465,000 of legal fees from Wasserstrom, which were recorded within accrued expenses and remain unpaid and outstanding as of September 30, 2022. \n\n**NOTE 6.

The holders of the majority of these securities are entitled to make up to three demands, excluding short form demands, that the Company register such securities. In addition, the holders have certain “piggy-back” registration rights with respect to registration statements filed subsequent to the completion of a Business Combination and rights to require the Company to register for resale such securities pursuant to Rule 415 under the Securities Act. The registration rights agreement does not contain liquidating damages or other cash settlement provisions resulting from delays in registering the securities. The Company will bear the expenses incurred in connection with the filing of any such registration statements. \n\n**_Underwriting Agreement_**\n\nThe underwriters are entitled to a deferred fee of $0.35 per Unit, or $4,375,000 in the aggregate. The deferred fee will become payable to the underwriters from the amounts held in the Trust Account solely in the event that the Company completes a Business Combination, subject to the terms of the underwriting agreement. \n\n**_Business Combination Agreement_**\n\nOn July 26, 2022, the Company entered into a Business Combination Agreement (as it may be amended, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time, the “BCA”) and a scheme implementation deed (“SID”) by and among the Company, Security Matters Limited, a publicly traded company on the Australian Securities Exchange (“ASX”)(“SMX”), Empatan Public Limited Company, a public limited company incorporated in Ireland (“Parent”), and Aryeh Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (“Merger Sub”). \n\nSubject to the terms and conditions set forth in the BCA, including the approval of the Company’s stockholders, the parties thereto will enter into a business combination transaction (the “** _Business Combination_** ”), pursuant to which, among other things Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company with the Company continuing as a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent. \n\n**_Scheme of Implementation Deed_**\n\nUnder the SID, SMX has agreed to propose a scheme of arrangement under Part 5.1 of the Corporations Act (“** _Scheme_** ”) and capital reduction (“** _Capital Reduction_** ”) which, if implemented, will result in all shares in SMX being cancelled in return for the issue of ordinary shares of Parent (“** _Parent Shares_** ”), with Parent then being issued shares in SMX (“** _SMX Shares_** ”) (resulting in SMX becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent), subject to SMX shareholder approval, Australian court approval and the satisfaction of various conditions. \n\nIn addition, SMX has agreed to propose an option scheme of arrangement under Part 5.1 of the Corporations Act (“** _Option Scheme_** ”) which, if implemented, will result in the SMX options held by participants in the Option Scheme being subject to a cashless exercise based on a Black-Scholes valuation, in exchange for SMX Shares. Under the Scheme those shares will be cancelled and such participants receiving Parent Shares on the basis of the Scheme consideration, subject to SMX option holder approval, Australian court approval and the satisfaction of various conditions. \n\nF-19 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\n**LIONHEART III CORP**\n\n**NOTES TO CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**\n\n**SEPTEMBER 30, 2022**\n\n**(Unaudited)**\n\n**_Consideration_**\n\nSubject to the terms and conditions set forth in the BCA and the SID, SMX shareholders will receive consideration the Scheme of 1 Parent Share per 10.3624 SMX shares having an implied value of $10.00 per Parent Share and Parent will become the holder of all of the issued shares in SMX and Lionheart, with SMX being delisted from the ASX. \n\nUnder the BCA, Merger Sub will merge with and into Lionheart, with Lionheart surviving the merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent, with existing Lionheart stockholders and warrant holders receiving Parent Shares and warrants (“** _Parent Warrants_** ”), as further described in the BCA, in exchange for their existing Lionheart shares and warrants, subject to Lionheart stockholder approval and the satisfaction of various other conditions. \n\n**_Representations and Warranties_**\n\nThe BCA and SID, collectively, contain customary representations and warranties of the parties thereto with respect to the parties, the transactions contemplated by the BCA and the SID and their respective business operations and activities. The representations and warranties in the BCA and SID shall terminate and expire upon the occurrence of the closing of the transactions contemplated thereby Closing. \n\n**_Conditions to Closing_**\n\nConsummation of the Business Combination is subject to conditions that are customary for a transaction of this type in the United States, including, among others: (a) there being no order, temporary restraining order, preliminary or permanent injunction, decree or ruling issued by a court of competent jurisdiction or governmental authority, enjoining, restraining or otherwise imposing a legal restraint on the consummation of the closing; (b) approval by Lionheart’s stockholders of certain proposals to be set forth in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus; (c) approval by SMX shareholders of the Scheme, (d) approval by an Australian court of the Scheme; (e) the Parent Shares and Parent Warrants to be issued pursuant to the BCA and the SID being approved for listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market; and (f) the Form F-4 containing the Proxy Statement/Prospectus being declared effective in accordance with the provisions of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “** _Securities Act_** ”). \n\n**NOTE 7. STOCKHOLDERS’ DEFICIT**\n\n**_Preferred Stock—_** On November 3, 2021, the Company filed an Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation prior to the closing date of the Initial Public Offering such that the Company is authorized to issue 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock with a par value of $0.0001 per share with such designation, rights and preferences as may be determined from time to time by the Company’s Board of Directors. At September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, there were no issued or outstanding shares of preferred stock. \n\n**_Class_**** _A Common Stock_** _—_ The Company is authorized to issue up to 100,000,000 shares of Class A, $0.0001 par value common stock.

Holders of Class A common stock and Class B common stock will vote together as a single class on all matters submitted to a vote of stockholders, except as required by law. \n\nThe shares of Class B common stock will automatically convert into shares of Class A common stock at the time of a Business Combination on a one-for-one basis, subject to adjustment. In the case that additional shares of Class A common stock, or equity-linked securities, are issued or deemed issued in excess of the amounts offered in the Initial Public Offering and related to the closing of a Business Combination, the ratio at which shares of Class B common stock shall convert into shares of Class A common stock will be adjusted (unless the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Class B common stock agree to waive such adjustment with respect to any such issuance or deemed issuance) so that the number of shares of Class A common stock issuable upon conversion of all shares of Class B common stock will equal, in the aggregate, on an as-converted basis, 20% of the sum of the total number of all shares of common stock outstanding upon the completion of the Initial Public Offering plus all shares of Class A common stock and equity-linked securities issued or deemed issued in connection with a Business Combination (excluding any shares of Class A common stock or equity-linked securities issued, or to be issued, to any seller in a Business Combination, the Private Placement Units and any private placement-equivalent units or warrants issued to the Sponsor or its affiliates upon conversion of loans made to the Company). \n\n**_Warrants —_** As of September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, there are 6,250,000 Public Warrants issued and outstanding. The Public Warrants will become exercisable on the later of (a) the completion of a Business Combination or (b) 12 months from the closing of the Initial Public Offering. The Public Warrants will expire five years after the completion of a Business Combination or earlier upon redemption or liquidation. \n\nThe Company will not be obligated to deliver any shares of Class A common stock pursuant to the exercise of a warrant and will have no obligation to settle such warrant exercise unless a registration statement under the Securities Act with respect to the shares of Class A common stock underlying the warrants is then effective and a prospectus relating thereto is current, subject to the Company satisfying its obligations with respect to registration. No warrant will be exercisable and the Company will not be obligated to issue shares of Class A common stock upon exercise of a warrant unless Class A common stock issuable upon such warrant exercise has been registered, qualified or deemed to be exempt under the securities laws of the state of residence of the registered holder of the warrants. \n\nThe Company has agreed that as soon as practicable, but in no event later than 30 days after the closing of a Business Combination, the Company will use its best efforts to file with the SEC a registration statement for the registration under the Securities Act of the shares of Class A common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants and thereafter will use its best efforts to cause the same to become effective within 60 business days following a Business Combination and to maintain a current prospectus relating to the Class A common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants, until the expiration of the warrants in accordance with the provisions of the warrant agreement. If a registration statement covering the shares of Class A common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants is not effective by the 60th business day after the closing of a Business Combination, warrant holders may, until such time as there is an effective registration statement and during any period when \n\nF-21 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\n**LIONHEART III CORP**\n\n**NOTES TO CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**\n\n**SEPTEMBER 30, 2022**\n\n**(Unaudited)**\n\nthe Company will have failed to maintain an effective registration statement, exercise warrants on a “cashless basis” in accordance with Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act or another exemption. If that exemption, or another exemption, is not available, holders will not be able to exercise their warrants on a cashless basis. \n\nOnce the warrants become exercisable, the Company may redeem the Public Warrants: \n\n• |  in whole and not in part;   \n---|---  \n• |  at a price of $0.01 per warrant;   \n---|---  \n• |  upon not less than 30 days’ prior written notice of redemption to each warrant holder; and   \n---|---  \n• |  if, and only if, the reported last reported sale price of the Class A common stock equals or exceeds $18.00 per share (as adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like) for any 20 trading days within a30-tradingday period ending three trading days before the Company sends the notice of redemption to the warrant holders.   \n---|---  \n  \nIf and when the warrants become redeemable by the Company, the Company may not exercise its redemption right if the issuance of shares of common stock upon exercise of the warrants is not exempt from registration or qualification under applicable state blue sky laws or the Company is unable to effect such registration or qualification. \n\nIf the Company calls the Public Warrants for redemption, management will have the option to require all holders that wish to exercise the Public Warrants to do so on a “cashless basis,” as described in the warrant agreement. The exercise price and number of shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants may be adjusted in certain circumstances including in the event of a stock dividend, or recapitalization, reorganization, merger or consolidation. However, except as described below, the warrants will not be adjusted for issuance of common stock at a price below its exercise price. Additionally, in no event will the Company be required to net cash settle the warrants. If the Company is unable to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period and the Company liquidates the funds held in the Trust Account, holders of warrants will not receive any of such funds with respect to their warrants, nor will they receive any distribution from the Company’s assets held outside of the Trust Account with the respect to such warrants. Accordingly, the warrants may expire worthless. \n\nIn addition, if (x) the Company issues additional common stock or equity-linked securities for capital raising purposes in connection with the closing of a Business Combination at an issue price or effective issue price of less than $9.20 per share of Class A common stock (with such issue price or effective issue price to be determined in good faith by the Company’s board of directors and, in the case of any such issuance to the Sponsors or their affiliates, without taking into account any Founder Shares held by the Sponsor or such affiliates, as applicable, prior to such issuance) (the “Newly Issued Price”), (y) the aggregate gross proceeds from such issuances represent more than 60% of the total equity proceeds, and interest thereon, available for the funding of a Business Combination on the date of the consummation of a Business Combination (net of redemptions), and (z) the volume weighted average trading price of the common stock during the 10 trading day period starting on the trading day prior the day on which the Company consummates a Business Combination (such price, the “Market Value”) is below $9.20 per share, then the exercise price of the warrants will be adjusted (to the nearest cent) to be equal to 115% of the higher of the Market Value and the Newly Issued Price, and the $18.00 per share redemption trigger price will be adjusted (to the nearest cent) to be equal to 180% of the higher of the Market Value and the Newly Issued Price. \n\nF-22 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\n**LIONHEART III CORP**\n\n**NOTES TO CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**\n\n**SEPTEMBER 30, 2022**\n\n**(Unaudited)**\n\nAs of September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, there are 2,200,000 Public Placement Warrants issued and outstanding. The Private Placement Warrants and the Placement Warrants are identical to the Public Warrants underlying the Units sold in the Initial Public Offering, except that so long as they are held by our sponsor, the underwriters or their respective permitted transferees, the private shares and the private warrants (including the Class A common stock issuable upon the exercise of the private warrants) may not be transferred, assigned or sold until 30 days after the completion of our initial business combination. \n\n**NOTE 8. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS**\n\nThe Company follows the guidance in ASC Topic 820 for its financial assets and liabilities that are re-measured and reported at fair value at each reporting period, and non-financial assets and liabilities that arere-measured and reported at fair value at least annually. \n\nThe following table presents information about the Company’s assets that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis at September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, and indicates the fair value hierarchy of the valuation inputs the Company utilized to determine such fair value: \n\n**September 30, 2022** | **December 31, 2021**  \n---|---  \n**Level** | **Amount** | **Level** | **Amount**  \n**Assets:**  \nMarketable securities held in Trust Account | 1 | $ | 126,983,891 | 1 | $ | 126,251,590  \n  \n**NOTE 9.

Based on this evaluation, the Company did not identify any subsequent events that would have required adjustment or disclosure in the condensed financial statements. \n\nF-23 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\n**REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM**\n\nTo the Stockholders and Board of Directors of \n\nLionheart III Corp \n\n**Opinion on the Financial Statements**\n\nWe have audited the accompanying balance sheet of Lionheart III Corp (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2021, the related statements of operations, stockholders’ deficit and cash flows for the period from January 14, 2021 (inception) through December 31, 2021, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the period from January 14, 2021 (inception) through December 31, 2021, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. \n\n**Explanatory Paragraph – Going Concern**\n\nThe accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As more fully described in Note 1 to the financial statements, the Company’s business plan is dependent on the completion of a business combination and the Company has determined that the mandatory liquidation and subsequent dissolution, should the Company be unable to complete a business combination, raises substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. \n\n**Basis for Opinion**\n\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. \n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audit we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. \n\nOur audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audit provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. \n\n/s/ Marcum LLP \n\nMarcum LLP \n\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor from January 19, 2021 to May 11, 2022. \n\nHouston, TX \n\nApril 13, 2022 \n\nF-24 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\n**LIONHEART III CORP**\n\n**BALANCE SHEET**\n\n**DECEMBER 31, 2021**\n\n**ASSETS**  \n---  \nCurrent Assets  \nCash | $ | 1,416,688  \nPrepaid expenses — Short-term | 269,097  \nTotal Current Assets | 1,685,785  \nPrepaid expenses — Long-term | 82,833  \nMarketable securities held in Trust Account | 126,251,590  \n**TOTAL ASSETS** | **$** | **128,020,208**  \n**LIABILITIES AND STOCKHOLDERS’ DEFICIT**  \nCurrent Liabilities  \nAccrued expenses | $ | 290,375  \nAccrued offering costs | 61,131  \nTotal Current Liabilities | 351,506  \nDeferred underwriting payable | 4,375,000  \n**Total Liabilities** | **4,726,506**  \n**Commitments (Note 6)**  \nClass A common stock subject to possible redemption 12,500,000 shares at redemption value | 126,250,000  \n**Stockholders’ Deficit**  \nPreferred stock, $0.0001 par value;

DESCRIPTION OF ORGANIZATION, BUSINESS OPERATIONS, AND GOING CONCERN**\n\nLionheart III Corp (the “Company”) was incorporated in Delaware on January 14, 2021. The Company is a blank check company formed for the purpose of entering into a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses or entities (the “Business Combination”). \n\nThe Company is an early stage and emerging growth company and, as such, the Company is subject to all of the risks associated with early stage and emerging growth companies. \n\nAs of December 31, 2021, the Company had not commenced any operations. All activity for the period from January 14, 2021 (inception) through December 31, 2021 relates to the Company’s formation, the initial public offering (“Initial Public Offering”), which is described below, and subsequent to the Initial Public Offering, identifying a target company for a Business Combination. The Company will not generate any operating revenues until after the completion of a Business Combination, at the earliest. The Company will generate non-operating income in the form of interest income from the proceeds derived from the Initial Public Offering. \n\nThe registration statements for the Company’s Initial Public Offering were declared effective on November 3, 2021. On November 8, 2021, the Company consummated the Initial Public Offering of 12,500,000 units (the “Units” and, with respect to the shares of Class A common stock included in the Units sold, the “Public Shares”), which includes the full exercise by the underwriter of its over-allotment option in the amount of 1,000,000 Units, at $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of $125,000,000, which is described in Note 3. \n\nSimultaneously with the closing of the Initial Public Offering, the Company consummated the sale of 2,000,000 warrants (each, a “Private Placement Warrant” and, collectively, the “Private Placement Warrants”) at a price of $1.00 per Private Placement Warrant and the sale of 400,000 units (the “Private Placement Units” and, together with the Private Placement Warrants, the “Private Securities”) in a private placement to Lionheart Equities, LLC (the “Sponsor”) and Nomura Securities International, Inc. (“Nomura”), Northland Securities, Inc. and Drexel Hamilton, LLC, the underwriters of the Initial Public Offering (the “Underwriters”), generating gross proceeds of $6,000,000, which is described in Note 4. \n\nTransaction costs amounted to $7,388,270, consisting of $2,500,000 of underwriting fees, $4,375,000 of deferred underwriting fees and $513,270 of other offering costs. \n\nFollowing the closing of the Initial Public Offering on November 8, 2021, an amount of $126,250,000 ($10.10 per Unit) from the net proceeds of the sale of the Units in the Initial Public Offering and the sale of the Private Securities was placed in a trust account (the “Trust Account”), invested in U.S. government securities, within the meaning set forth in Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act, with a maturity of 180 days or less, or in any open-ended investment company that holds itself out as a money market fund meeting the conditions of Rule 2a-7 of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment Company Act”), as determined by the Company, until the earlier of: (i) the consummation of a Business Combination or (ii) the distribution of the funds in the Trust Account to the Company’s stockholders, as described below. \n\nThe Company’s management has broad discretion with respect to the specific application of the net proceeds of the Initial Public Offering and the sale of the Private Securities, although substantially all of the net proceeds are intended to be applied generally toward consummating a Business Combination. There is no assurance that the Company will be able to complete a Business Combination successfully. The Company must complete a Business Combination having an aggregate fair market value of at least 80% of the assets held in the Trust Account (as defined below) (excluding taxes payable on income earned on the Trust Account) at the time of the agreement to enter into an initial Business Combination. The Company intends to only complete a Business Combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. \n\nF-29 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\nThe Company will provide its holders of the outstanding Public Shares (the “public stockholders”) with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their Public Shares upon the completion of a Business Combination either (i) in connection with a stockholder meeting called to approve the Business Combination or (ii) by means of a tender offer. The decision as to whether the Company will seek stockholder approval of a Business Combination or conduct a tender offer will be made by the Company, solely in its discretion. The public stockholders will be entitled to redeem their Public Shares for a pro rata portion of the amount then in the Trust Account (initially anticipated to be $10.10 per Public Share, plus any pro rata interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to the Company to pay its tax obligations). There will be no redemption rights upon the completion of a Business Combination with respect to the Company’s warrants. \n\nThe Company will proceed with a Business Combination if the Company has net tangible assets of at least $5,000,001 immediately prior to or upon such consummation of a Business Combination and, if the Company seeks stockholder approval, a majority of the shares voted are voted in favor of the Business Combination. If a stockholder vote is not required by law and the Company does not decide to hold a stockholder vote for business or other legal reasons, the Company will, pursuant to its Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the “Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation”), conduct the redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) and file tender offer documents with the SEC containing substantially the same information as would be included in a proxy statement prior to completing a Business Combination. If, however, stockholder approval of the transaction is required by law, or the Company decides to obtain stockholder approval for business or legal reasons, the Company will offer to redeem shares in conjunction with a proxy solicitation pursuant to the proxy rules and not pursuant to the tender offer rules. If the Company seeks stockholder approval in connection with a Business Combination, the Sponsor and the Underwriters have agreed to vote their Founder Shares (as defined in Note 5), Placement Shares (as defined in Note 5) and any Public Shares purchased during or after the Initial Public Offering in favor of approving a Business Combination. Additionally, each public stockholder may elect to redeem their Public Shares irrespective of whether they vote for or against the proposed transaction or do not vote at all. \n\nNotwithstanding the above, if the Company seeks stockholder approval of a Business Combination and it does not conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules, the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation provides that a public stockholder, together with any affiliate of such stockholder or any other person with whom such stockholder is acting in concert or as a “group” (as defined under Section 13 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”)), will be restricted from redeeming its shares with respect to more than an aggregate of 20% or more of the Public Shares, without the prior consent of the Company. \n\nThe Sponsor and the Underwriters have agreed (a) to waive their redemption rights with respect to the Founder Shares, Placement Shares and Public Shares held by them in connection with the completion of a Business Combination and (b) not to propose an amendment to the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (i) to modify the substance or timing of the Company’s obligation to allow redemption in connection with the Company’s initial Business Combination and certain amendments to the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation or to redeem 100% of its Public Shares if the Company does not complete a Business Combination or (ii) with respect to any other provision relating to stockholders’ rights or pre-initial business combination activity, unless the Company provides the public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem their Public Shares in conjunction with any such amendment. \n\nThe Company will have until 12 months from the closing of the Initial Public Offering (or up to 18 months in total if the Company extends the period of time to consummate our initial business combination in accordance with the terms described in the registration statement related to the Initial Public Offering) to complete a Business Combination (the “Combination Period”), subject to the Sponsor depositing additional funds into the Trust Account as set forth below. If the Company is unable to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period and stockholders do not approve an amendment to the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation to extend this date, the Company will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, \n\nF-30 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\n(ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the Public Shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account including interest (which interest shall be net of taxes payable), divided by the number of then outstanding Public Shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders’ rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of the Company’s remaining stockholders and the Company’s board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii) to the Company’s obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. There will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect to the Company’s warrants, which will expire worthless if the Company fails to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period. \n\nIn order for the time available for the Company to consummate an Initial Business Combination to be extended, for each one-month extension the Sponsor or its affiliates or designees must deposit into the Trust Account $412,500 based on the underwriters’ over-allotment option being fully exercised ($0.033 per share), on or prior to the date of the applicable deadline, for each one month extension, up to an aggregate of $2,475,000. Any such payments would be made in the exchange for a non-interest bearing, unsecured promissory note which would be repaid, if at all, at the option of the Sponsor, from funds released to the Company upon completion of an Initial Business Combination or via conversion of a portion or all of the total loan amount into units at a price of $10.00 per unit, which units will be identical to the Private Placement Units. \n\nThe holders of the Founder Shares and Placement Shares will agree to waive liquidation rights with respect to such shares if the Company fails to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period. However, if the Sponsors acquire Public Shares in or after the Initial Public Offering, such Public Shares will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account if the Company fails to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period. The underwriters have agreed to waive their rights to their deferred underwriting commission (see Note 6) held in the Trust Account in the event the Company does not complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period and, in such event, such amounts will be included with the other funds held in the Trust Account that will be available to fund the redemption of the Public Shares. In the event of such distribution, it is possible that the per share value of the assets remaining available for distribution will be less than the Initial Public Offering price per Unit ($10.00). \n\nIn order to protect the amounts held in the Trust Account, the Sponsor will agree to be liable to the Company if and to the extent any claims by a vendor for services rendered or products sold to the Company, or a prospective target business with which the Company has discussed entering into a transaction agreement, reduce the amount of funds in the Trust Account to below (i) $10.10 per Public Share or (ii) such lesser amount per Public Share held in the Trust Account as of the date of the liquidation of the Trust Account due to reductions in the value of trust assets, in each case net of the interest which may be withdrawn to pay the Company’s tax obligation and up to $100,000 for liquidation excepts, except as to any claims by a third party who executed a waiver of any and all rights to seek access to the Trust Account (even if such waiver is deemed to be unenforceable) and except as to any claims under the Company’s indemnity of the underwriters of Initial Public Offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”). Moreover, in the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, the Sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third-party claims. The Company will seek to reduce the possibility that the Sponsor will have to indemnify the Trust Account due to claims of creditors by endeavoring to have all vendors, service providers, prospective target businesses or other entities with which the Company does business, execute agreements with the Company waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to monies held in the Trust Account. \n\n**_Risks and Uncertainties_**\n\nManagement continues to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and has concluded that while it is reasonably possible that the virus could have a negative effect on the Company’s financial position, results of its \n\nF-31 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\noperations, and/or search for a target company, the specific impact is not readily determinable as of the date of these financial statements. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. \n\n**_Going Concern_**\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, the Company had cash of $1,416,688 not held in the Trust Account and available for working capital purposes. \n\nUntil the consummation of a Business Combination, the Company will be using the funds not held in the Trust Account for identifying and evaluating prospective acquisition candidates, performing due diligence on prospective target businesses, paying for travel expenditures, selecting the target business to acquire, and structuring, negotiating and consummating the Business Combination. \n\nThe Company may need to raise further additional capital through loans or additional investments from its Sponsor, stockholders, officers, directors, or third parties. In addition to the loan commitment described herein, the Company’s officers, directors and Sponsor may, but are not obligated to, loan the Company funds, from time to time or at any time, in whatever amount they deem reasonable in their sole discretion, to meet the Company’s working capital needs. Accordingly, the Company may not be able to obtain additional financing. If the Company is unable to raise additional capital, it may be required to take additional measures to conserve liquidity, which could include, but not necessarily be limited to, curtailing operations, suspending the pursuit of a potential transaction, and reducing overhead expenses. The Company cannot provide any assurance that new financing will be available to it on commercially acceptable terms, if at all. If a Business Combination is not consummated by November 8, 2022, the Company’s liquidation date, there will be a mandatory liquidation and subsequent dissolution of the Company. Management has determined that the mandatory liquidation, should a Business Combination not occur, and potential subsequent dissolution raises substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. These consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recovery of the recorded assets or the classification of the liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. \n\n**NOTE 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES**\n\n**_Basis of Presentation_**\n\nThe accompanying financial statements are presented in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC. \n\n**_Emerging Growth Company_**\n\nThe Company is an “emerging growth company,” as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act, as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the “JOBS Act”), and it may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the independent registered public accounting firm attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in its periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. \n\nFurther, Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until private companies (that is, those that have not had a Securities Act registration statement declared effective or do not have a class of securities registered under the Exchange Act) are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting standards. The JOBS Act \n\nF-32 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\nprovides that a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies but any such election to opt out is irrevocable. The Company has elected not to opt out of such extended transition period which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private companies, the Company, as an emerging growth company, can adopt the new or revised standard at the time private companies adopt the new or revised standard. This may make comparison of the Company’s financial statements with another public company which is neither an emerging growth company nor an emerging growth company which has opted out of using the extended transition period difficult or impossible because of the potential differences in accounting standards used. \n\n**_Use of Estimates_**\n\nThe preparation of the financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires the Company’s management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements. \n\nMaking estimates requires management to exercise significant judgment. It is at least reasonably possible that the estimate of the effect of a condition, situation or set of circumstances that existed at the date of the financial statements, which management considered in formulating its estimate, could change in the near term due to one or more future confirming events. Accordingly, the actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. \n\n**_Cash and Cash Equivalents_**\n\nThe Company considers all short-term investments with an original maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. The Company did not have any cash equivalents as of December 31, 2021. \n\n**_Marketable Securities Held in Trust Account_**\n\nAt December 31, 2021, substantially all of the assets held in the Trust Account were held in money market funds which are invested primarily in U.S. Treasury securities. All of the Company’s investments held in the Trust Account are classified as trading securities. Trading securities are presented on the balance sheet at fair value at the end of each reporting period. Gains and losses resulting from the change in fair value of investments held in the Trust Account are included in interest earned on marketable securities held in Trust Account in the accompanying statement of operations. The estimated fair values of investments held in Trust Account are determined using available market information. \n\n**_Class A Common Stock Subject to Possible Redemption_**\n\nThe Company accounts for its Class A common stock subject to possible redemption in accordance with the guidance in Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 480 “Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity.” Common stock subject to mandatory redemption is classified as a liability instrument and is measured at fair value. Conditionally redeemable common stock (including common stock that features redemption rights that is either within the control of the holder or subject to redemption upon the occurrence of uncertain events not solely within the Company’s control) is classified as temporary equity. At all other times, common stock is classified as stockholders’ equity. The Company’s Class A common stock feature certain redemption rights that are considered to be outside of the Company’s control and subject to occurrence of uncertain future events. Accordingly, at December 31, 2021, Class A common stock subject to possible redemption is presented at redemption value as temporary equity, outside of the stockholders’ deficit section of the Company’s balance sheet. \n\nThe Company recognizes changes in redemption value immediately as they occur and adjusts the carrying value of redeemable common stock to equal the redemption value at the end of each reporting period. Immediately upon the closing of the Initial Public Offering, the Company recognized the accretion from initial book value to redemption amount value. The change in the carrying value of redeemable Class A common stock resulted in charges against additional paid-in capital and accumulated deficit. \n\nF-33 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\nAt December 31, 2021, the Class A common stock reflected in the consolidated balance sheets are reconciled in the following table: \n\nGross proceeds | $ | 125,000,000  \n---|---|---  \nLess:  \nProceeds allocated to Public Warrants | $ | (3,875,000 | )   \nClass A common stock issuance costs | $ | (7,136,454 | )   \nPlus:  \nAccretion of carrying value to redemption value | $ | 12,261,454  \nClass A common stock subject to possible redemption | $ | 126,250,000  \n  \n**_Income Taxes_**\n\nThe Company follows the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes under ASC 740, “Income Taxes.” Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statements carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that included the enactment date. Valuation allowances are established, when necessary, to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized. \n\nASC 740 prescribes a recognition threshold and a measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. For those benefits to be recognized, a tax position must be more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities. The Company recognizes accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense. There were no unrecognized tax benefits and no amounts accrued for interest and penalties as of December 31, 2021. The Company is currently not aware of any issues under review that could result in significant payments, accruals or material deviation from its position. The Company is subject to income tax examinations by major taxing authorities since inception. \n\n**_Net Income (Loss) per Common Share_**\n\nThe Company complies with accounting and disclosure requirements of FASB ASC Topic 260, “Earnings Per Share”. Net income (loss) per common stock is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of common stock outstanding for the period. The Company applies the two-class method in calculating earnings per share. Accretion associated with the redeemable shares of Class A common stock is excluded from earnings per share as the redemption value approximates fair value. \n\nThe calculation of diluted income (loss) per share does not consider the effect of the warrants issued in connection with the (i) Initial Public Offering, and (ii) the private placement since the exercise of the warrants is contingent upon the occurrence of future events. The warrants are exercisable to purchase 8,850,000 Class A common stock in the aggregate. As of December 31, 2021, the Company did not have any dilutive securities or other contracts that could, potentially, be exercised or converted into common stock and then share in the earnings of the Company. As a result, diluted net loss per common stock is the same as basic net loss per common stock for the periods presented. \n\nF-34 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\nThe following table reflects the calculation of basic and diluted net loss per common stock (in dollars, except per share amounts): \n\n**For the Period fromJanuary 14, 2021(inception) throughDecember 31, 2021**  \n---  \n**Class A** | **Class B**  \nBasic and diluted net loss per common stock  \nNumerator:  \nAllocation of net loss, as adjusted | $ | (137,467 | )  | $ | (205,561 | )   \nDenominator:  \nBasic and diluted weighted average shares outstanding | 1,947,863 | 2,912,749  \nBasic and diluted net loss per common stock | $ | (0.07 | )  | $ | (0.07 | )   \n  \n**_Concentration of Credit Risk_**\n\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist of a cash account in a financial institution, which, at times, may exceed the Federal Depository Insurance Corporation limit of $250,000. The Company has not experienced losses on this account and management believes the Company is not exposed to significant risks on such account. \n\n**_Fair value of Financial Instruments_**\n\nThe fair value of the Company’s assets and liabilities, which qualify as financial instruments under ASC 820, “Fair Value Measurement,” approximates the carrying amounts represented in the accompanying balance sheet, primarily due to their short-term nature. \n\n**_Fair Value of Financial Instruments_**\n\nFair value is defined as the price that would be received for sale of an asset or paid for transfer of a liability, in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. GAAP establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active Markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements). These tiers include: \n\n• |  Level 1, defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical instruments in active markets;   \n---|---  \n• |  Level 2, defined as inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable such as quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets or quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active; and   \n---|---  \n• |  Level 3, defined as unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions, such as valuations derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs or significant value drivers are unobservable.   \n---|---  \n  \nIn some circumstances, the inputs used to measure fair value might be categorized within different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In those instances, the fair value measurement is categorized in its entirety in the fair value hierarchy based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement. \n\nF-35 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\n**_Warrant Instruments_**\n\nThe Company accounts for the 8,450,000 warrants issued in connection with the Initial Public Offering and the private placement in accordance with the guidance contained in FASB ASC 815 “Derivatives and Hedging” where warrants that do not meet the criteria for equity treatment must be treated as liabilities. The Company evaluated and classifies its warrant instruments under equity treatment and will be reported at carrying value. As of December 31, 2021, there are 8,450,000 warrants outstanding (consisting of 6,250,000 Public Warrants, 2,000,000 Private Placement Warrants, and 200,000 Private Placement Warrants embedded in Private Units purchased by the Sponsor and the Underwriters). \n\n**_Recent Accounting Standards_**\n\nIn August 2020, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2020-06, Debt – Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging – Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40) (“ASU 2020-06”) to simplify certain financial instruments. ASU 2020-06 eliminates the current models that require separation of beneficial conversion and cash conversion features from convertible instruments and simplifies the derivative scope exception guidance pertaining to equity classification of contracts in an entity’s own equity. The new standard also introduces additional disclosures for convertible debt and freestanding instruments that are indexed to and settled in an entity’s own equity. ASU 2020-06 amends the diluted earnings per share guidance, including the requirement to use the if-converted method for all convertible instruments. ASU 2020-06 is for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021 and should be applied on a full or modified retrospective basis. Early adoption is permitted, but no earlier than fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company adopted ASU 2020-06 effective February 24, 2021. The adoption of ASU 2020-06 did not have a material impact on the Company’s financial statements. \n\nManagement does not believe that any other recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting standards, if currently adopted, would have a material effect on the Company’s financial statements. \n\n**NOTE 3. INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING**\n\nPursuant to the Initial Public Offering, the sold 12,500,000 Units, which includes a full exercise by the underwriters of their over-allotment option in the amount of 1,000,000 Units, at a price of $10.00 per Unit. Each Unit consists of one share of Class A common stock and one-half of one redeemable warrant (“Public Warrant”). Each Public Warrant entitles the holder to purchase one share of Class A common stock at a price of $11.50 per share, subject to adjustment (see Note 7). \n\n**NOTE 4. PRIVATE PLACEMENT**\n\nSimultaneously with the closing of the Initial Public Offering, the Sponsor purchased 2,000,000 Private Placement Warrants, at a purchase price of $1.00 per Private Placement Warrant, for an aggregate purchase price of $2,000,000, and 275,000 Private Placement Units, at a purchase price of $10.00 per Private Placement Unit, for an aggregate price of $2,750,000, and the Underwriters purchased 125,000 Private Placement at a price of $10.00 per Private Placement Unit, for an aggregate purchase price of $1,250,000, from the Company in a private placement. Each Private Placement Warrant entitles the holder to purchase one share of common stock at a price of $11.50 per share, subject to adjustment (see Note 7). Each Private Placement Unit consists of one share of common stock (“Placement Share”) and one-half of one redeemable warrant (“Placement Warrant”). Each Placement Warrant entitles the holder to purchase one share of common stock at a price of $11.50 per share, subject to adjustment (see Note 7). \n\nThe proceeds from the sale of the Private Securities were added to the net proceeds from the Initial Public Offering held in the Trust Account. If the Company does not complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period, the proceeds from the sale of the Private Securities held in the Trust Account will be used to fund the redemption of the Public Shares (subject to the requirements of applicable law) and the Private Securities and all underlying securities will expire worthless. \n\nF-36 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\n**NOTE 5. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS**\n\n**_Founder Shares_**\n\nOn January 27, 2021, the Sponsor purchased 2,875,000 shares (the “Founder Shares”) of the Company’s common stock for an aggregate price of $25,000. On November 3, 2021, the Company effected a stock dividend resulting in the Sponsor holding an aggregate of 3,125,000 Founder Shares. The Company filed the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation prior to the closing date of the Initial Public Offering such that the Company is authorized to issue shares of Class B common stock. Pursuant to the amendment, the Founder Shares were converted into shares of Class B common stock. \n\nThe Sponsor has agreed not to transfer, assign or sell any of its Founder Shares until the earlier to occur of: (A) six months after the completion of a Business Combination or (B) subsequent to a Business Combination, (x) if the last reported sale price of the Class A common stock equals or exceeds $12.00 per share (as adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like) for any 20 trading days within any 30-trading day period commencing at least 30 days after a Business Combination, or (y) the date on which the Company completes a liquidation, merger, capital stock exchange or other similar transaction that results in all of the stockholders having the right to exchange their shares of common stock for cash, securities or other property. \n\n**_Administrative Support Agreement_**\n\nThe Company entered into an agreement, commencing on November 2, 2021, to pay the Sponsor a total of $15,000 per month for office space, utilities and secretarial and administrative support. Upon completion of the Business Combination or the Company’s liquidation, the Company will cease paying these monthly fees. For the period from January 14, 2021 (inception) through December 31, 2021, the Company incurred $30,000 in fees for these services, of which $19,000 is included in accrued expenses in the accompanying balance sheet. \n\n**_Promissory Note — Related Party_**\n\nOn January 27, 2021, the Sponsor agreed to loan the Company an aggregate of up to $75,000 to cover expenses related to the Initial Public Offering pursuant to a promissory note (the “Promissory Note”). The Promissory Note is non-interest bearing and is payable on the consummation of the Initial Public Offering. The outstanding balance under the Promissory Note of $75,000 was repaid at the closing of the Initial Public Offering on November 8, 2021. \n\n**_Related Party Loans_**\n\nIn order to finance transaction costs in connection with a Business Combination, the Sponsor or an affiliate of the Sponsor or certain of the Company’s directors and officers may, but are not obligated to, loan the Company funds as may be required (“Working Capital Loans”). If the Company completes a Business Combination, the Company would repay the Working Capital Loans out of the proceeds of the Trust Account released to the Company. Otherwise, the Working Capital Loans would be repaid only out of funds held outside the Trust Account. In the event that a Business Combination does not close, the Company may use a portion of proceeds held outside the Trust Account to repay the Working Capital Loans, but no proceeds held in the Trust Account would be used to repay the Working Capital Loans. Except for the foregoing, the terms of such Working Capital Loans, if any, have not been determined and no written agreements exist with respect to such loans. The Working Capital Loans would either be repaid upon consummation of a Business Combination, without interest, or, at the lender’s discretion, up to $1,500,000 of such Working Capital Loans may be convertible into units of the post-Business Combination entity at a price of $10.00 per unit. The units would be identical to the Private Placement Units. \n\nIn order for the time available for the Company to consummate an Initial Business Combination to be extended, for each one-month extension the Sponsor or its affiliates or designees must deposit into the Trust Account \n\nF-37 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\n$412,500 based on the underwriters’ over-allotment option being fully exercised ($0.033 per share), on or prior to the date of the applicable deadline, for each one month extension, up to an aggregate of $2,475,000. Any such payments would be made in the exchange for a non-interest bearing, unsecured promissory note which would be repaid, if at all, at the option of the Sponsor, from funds released to the Company upon completion of an Initial Business Combination or via conversion of a portion or all of the total loan amount into units at a price of $10.00 per unit, which units will be identical to the Private Placement Units. As of December 31 , 2021, there are no Working Capital Loans outstanding. \n\n**_General Legal Counsel_**\n\nOn January 10, 2017, an affiliate of the Company’s Sponsor, Lionheart Capital, LLC (“Lionheart Capital”), engaged Jessica L. Wasserstrom, LLC (“Wasserstrom”), to represent Lionheart Capital and its affiliated companies, as corporate general counsel and otherwise in connection with any corporate and/or transactional matters as requested by Lionheart Capital. The engagement letter between Lionheart Capital and Wasserstrom is for an indefinite period only subject to termination rights of either party, of which no termination has occurred since the agreement was executed. Jessica Wasserstrom, the principal of Wasserstrom, currently holds the title of Chief Legal Officer of Lionheart Capital and its affiliated companies. \n\nIn connection therewith, Wasserstrom was specifically engaged by the Company to provide counsel for general corporate legal matters, including related to mergers and acquisitions activity and, as such, may be deemed to be a related party of the Company. For the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company incurred $150,000 of legal fees from Wasserstrom, which were recorded within accrued expenses and remain unpaid and outstanding as of December 31, 2021. \n\n**NOTE 6. COMMITMENTS**\n\n**_Registration Rights_**\n\nPursuant to a registration rights agreement entered into on November 3, 2021, the holders of the Founder Shares, Private Placement Units (including up to 3,000,000 units that the Sponsor may, at its option but subject to our consent, purchase on a private placement basis prior to and in connection with a Business Combination), the Private Warrants, and securities issuable pursuant to the warrants that may be issued upon conversion of Working Capital Loans (and any shares of Class A common stock issuable upon the exercise of the warrants that may be issued upon conversion of Working Capital Loans and upon conversion of the Founder Shares) are entitled to registration rights, requiring the Company to register such securities for resale (in the case of the Founder Shares, only after conversion to the Class A common stock). The holders of the majority of these securities are entitled to make up to three demands, excluding short form demands, that the Company register such securities. In addition, the holders have certain “piggy-back” registration rights with respect to registration statements filed subsequent to the completion of a Business Combination and rights to require the Company to register for resale such securities pursuant to Rule 415 under the Securities Act. The registration rights agreement does not contain liquidating damages or other cash settlement provisions resulting from delays in registering the securities. The Company will bear the expenses incurred in connection with the filing of any such registration statements. \n\n**_Underwriting Agreement_**\n\nThe underwriters are entitled to a deferred fee of $0.35 per Unit, or $4,375,000 in the aggregate. The deferred fee will become payable to the underwriters from the amounts held in the Trust Account solely in the event that the Company completes a Business Combination, subject to the terms of the underwriting agreement. \n\n**NOTE 7. STOCKHOLDERS’ DEFICIT**\n\n**_Preferred Stock —_** On November 3, 2021, the Company filed an Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation prior to the closing date of the Initial Public Offering such that the Company is authorized to issue \n\nF-38 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\n1,000,000 shares of preferred stock with a par value of $0.0001 per share with such designation, rights and preferences as may be determined from time to time by the Company’s Board of Directors. At December 31, 2021, there were no issued or outstanding shares of preferred stock . \n\n**_Class_**** _A Common Stock_** **_—_** The Company is authorized to issue up to 100,000,000 shares of Class A, $0.0001 par value common stock. Holders of the Company’s common stock are entitled to one vote for each share. At December 31, 2021, there were 400,000 shares of Class A common stock issued and outstanding, excluding 12,500,000 shares subject to possible redemption. \n\n**_Class_**** _B Common Stock —_** On January 28, 2021, the Company amended its Certificate of Incorporation such that the Company is authorized to issue 50,000,000 shares of common stock with a par value of $0.0001 per share. At December 31, 2021, there were 3,125,000 shares of common stock issued and outstanding. \n\nOn November 3, 2021, the Company filed an Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation prior to the closing date of the Initial Public Offering such that the Company is authorized to issue 100,000,000 shares of Class A common stock with a par value of $0.0001 per share and 50,000,000 shares of Class B common stock, par value $0.0001 per share. \n\nHolders of Class A common stock and Class B common stock are entitled to one vote for each share. Holders of Class A common stock and Class B common stock will vote together as a single class on all matters submitted to a vote of stockholders, except as required by law. \n\nThe shares of Class B common stock will automatically convert into shares of Class A common stock at the time of a Business Combination on a one-for-one basis, subject to adjustment. In the case that additional shares of Class A common stock, or equity-linked securities, are issued or deemed issued in excess of the amounts offered in the Initial Public Offering and related to the closing of a Business Combination, the ratio at which shares of Class B common stock shall convert into shares of Class A common stock will be adjusted (unless the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Class B common stock agree to waive such adjustment with respect to any such issuance or deemed issuance) so that the number of shares of Class A common stock issuable upon conversion of all shares of Class B common stock will equal, in the aggregate, on an as-converted basis, 20% of the sum of the total number of all shares of common stock outstanding upon the completion of the Initial Public Offering plus all shares of Class A common stock and equity-linked securities issued or deemed issued in connection with a Business Combination (excluding any shares of Class A common stock or equity-linked securities issued, or to be issued, to any seller in a Business Combination, the Private Placement Units and any private placement-equivalent units or warrants issued to the Sponsor or its affiliates upon conversion of loans made to the Company). \n\n**_Warrant —_** As of December 31, 2021, there are 6,250,000 Public Warrants issued and outstanding. The Public Warrants will become exercisable on the later of (a) the completion of a Business Combination or (b) 12 months from the closing of the Initial Public Offering. The Public Warrants will expire five years after the completion of a Business Combination or earlier upon redemption or liquidation. \n\nThe Company will not be obligated to deliver any shares of Class A common stock pursuant to the exercise of a warrant and will have no obligation to settle such warrant exercise unless a registration statement under the Securities Act with respect to the shares of Class A common stock underlying the warrants is then effective and a prospectus relating thereto is current, subject to the Company satisfying its obligations with respect to registration. No warrant will be exercisable and the Company will not be obligated to issue shares of Class A common stock upon exercise of a warrant unless Class A common stock issuable upon such warrant exercise has been registered, qualified or deemed to be exempt under the securities laws of the state of residence of the registered holder of the warrants. \n\nThe Company has agreed that as soon as practicable, but in no event later than 30 days after the closing of a Business Combination, the Company will use its best efforts to file with the SEC a registration statement for the \n\nF-39 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\nregistration under the Securities Act of the shares of Class A common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants and thereafter will use its best efforts to cause the same to become effective within 60 business days following a Business Combination and to maintain a current prospectus relating to the Class A common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants, until the expiration of the warrants in accordance with the provisions of the warrant agreement. If a registration statement covering the shares of Class A common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants is not effective by the 60th business day after the closing of a Business Combination, warrant holders may, until such time as there is an effective registration statement and during any period when the Company will have failed to maintain an effective registration statement, exercise warrants on a “cashless basis” in accordance with Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act or another exemption. If that exemption, or another exemption, is not available, holders will not be able to exercise their warrants on a cashless basis. \n\nOnce the warrants become exercisable, the Company may redeem the Public Warrants: \n\n• |  in whole and not in part;   \n---|---  \n• |  at a price of $0.01 per warrant;   \n---|---  \n• |  upon not less than 30 days’ prior written notice of redemption to each warrant holder; and   \n---|---  \n• |  if, and only if, the reported last reported sale price of the Class A common stock equals or exceeds $18.00 per share (as adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like) for any 20 trading days within a 30-trading day period ending three trading days before the Company sends the notice of redemption to the warrant holders.   \n---|---  \n  \nIf and when the warrants become redeemable by the Company, the Company may not exercise its redemption right if the issuance of shares of common stock upon exercise of the warrants is not exempt from registration or qualification under applicable state blue sky laws or the Company is unable to effect such registration or qualification. \n\nIf the Company calls the Public Warrants for redemption, management will have the option to require all holders that wish to exercise the Public Warrants to do so on a “cashless basis,” as described in the warrant agreement. The exercise price and number of shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants may be adjusted in certain circumstances including in the event of a stock dividend, or recapitalization, reorganization, merger or consolidation. However, except as described below, the warrants will not be adjusted for issuance of common stock at a price below its exercise price. Additionally, in no event will the Company be required to net cash settle the warrants. If the Company is unable to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period and the Company liquidates the funds held in the Trust Account, holders of warrants will not receive any of such funds with respect to their warrants, nor will they receive any distribution from the Company’s assets held outside of the Trust Account with the respect to such warrants. Accordingly, the warrants may expire worthless. \n\nIn addition, if (x) the Company issues additional common stock or equity-linked securities for capital raising purposes in connection with the closing of a Business Combination at an issue price or effective issue price of less than $9.20 per share of Class A common stock (with such issue price or effective issue price to be determined in good faith by the Company’s board of directors and, in the case of any such issuance to the Sponsors or their affiliates, without taking into account any Founder Shares held by the Sponsor or such affiliates, as applicable, prior to such issuance) (the “Newly Issued Price”), (y) the aggregate gross proceeds from such issuances represent more than 60% of the total equity proceeds, and interest thereon, available for the funding of a Business Combination on the date of the consummation of a Business Combination (net of redemptions), and (z) the volume weighted average trading price of the common stock during the 10 trading day period starting on the trading day prior the day on which the Company consummates a Business Combination (such price, the “Market Value”) is below $9.20 per share, then the exercise price of the warrants will be adjusted (to the nearest cent) to be equal to 115% of the higher of the Market Value and the Newly Issued Price, and the $18.00 per share redemption trigger price will be adjusted (to the nearest cent) to be equal to 180% of the higher of the Market Value and the Newly Issued Price. \n\nF-40 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, there are 2,200,000 Public Placement Warrants issued and outstanding. The Private Placement Warrants and the Placement Warrants are identical to the Public Warrants underlying the Units sold in the Initial Public Offering, except that so long as they are held by our sponsor, the underwriters or their respective permitted transferees, the private shares and the private warrants (including the Class A common stock issuable upon the exercise of the private warrants) may not be transferred, assigned or sold until 30 days after the completion of our initial business combination. \n\n**NOTE 8. INCOME TAX**\n\nThe Company’s net deferred tax assets (liability) at December 31, 2021 is as follows: \n\n**December 31,**  \n---  \n**2021**  \nDeferred tax assets (liability)  \nNet operating loss carryforward | $ | 6,983  \nStartup/organization expenses | 65,053  \nTotal deferred tax assets (liability) | 72,036  \nValuation Allowance | (72,036 | )   \nDeferred tax assets (liability) | $ | —   \n  \nThe income tax provision for the period from January 14, 2021 (inception) through December 31, 2021 consists of the following: \n\n**December 31,**  \n---  \n**2021**  \nFederal  \nCurrent | $ | —   \nDeferred | (72,036 | )   \nState and Local  \nCurrent | —   \nDeferred | —   \nChange in valuation allowance | 72,036  \nIncome tax provision | $ | —   \n  \nAs of December 31, 2021, the Company had $6,983 of U.S. federal and state net operating loss carryovers available to offset future taxable income. \n\nIn assessing the realization of the deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion of all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which temporary differences representing net future deductible amounts become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. After consideration of all of the information available, management believes that significant uncertainty exists with respect to future realization of the deferred tax assets and has therefore established a full valuation allowance. For the period from January 14, 2021 (inception) through December 31, 2021, the change in the valuation allowance was $72,036. \n\nF-41 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\nA reconciliation of the federal income tax rate to the Company’s effective tax rate at December 31, 2021 is as follows: \n\n**December 31,2021**  \n---  \nStatutory federal income tax rate | 21.0 | %   \nValuation allowance | (21.0 | )%   \nIncome tax provision | —  | %   \n  \nThe Company files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and is subject to examination by the various taxing authorities. The Company’s tax returns for the year ended December 31, 2021 remain open and subject to examination. \n\n**NOTE 9. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS**\n\nThe Company follows the guidance in ASC Topic 820 for its financial assets and liabilities that are re-measured and reported at fair value at each reporting period, and non-financial assets and liabilities that are re-measured and reported at fair value at least annually. \n\nThe fair value of the Company’s financial assets and liabilities reflects management’s estimate of amounts that the Company would have received in connection with the sale of the assets or paid in connection with the transfer of the liabilities in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. In connection with measuring the fair value of its assets and liabilities, the Company seeks to maximize the use of observable inputs (market data obtained from independent sources) and to minimize the use of unobservable inputs (internal assumptions about how market participants would price assets and liabilities). The following fair value hierarchy is used to classify assets and liabilities based on the observable inputs and unobservable inputs used in order to value the assets and liabilities: \n\nLevel 1: |  Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. An active market for an asset or liability is a market in which transactions for the asset or liability occur with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis.   \n---|---  \nLevel 2: |  Observable inputs other than Level 1 inputs. Examples of Level 2 inputs include quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities and quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets that are not active.   \n---|---  \nLevel 3: |  Unobservable inputs based on our assessment of the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.   \n---|---  \n  \nThe following table presents information about the Company’s assets that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis at December 31, 2021, and indicates the fair value hierarchy of the valuation inputs the Company utilized to determine such fair value: \n\n**Description** | **Level** | **December 31,2021**  \n---|---|---  \nAssets:  \nMarketable securities held in Trust Account | 1 | $ | 126,251,590  \n  \n**NOTE 10. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS**\n\nThe Company evaluated subsequent events and transactions that occurred after the balance sheet date up to the date that the financial statements were issued. Based upon this review, the Company did not identify any subsequent events that would have required adjustment or disclosure in the financial statements. \n\nF-42 \n\n##### [Table of

\n**NOTE 1 - GENERAL:**\n\nA. |  Security Matters Limited (“Security Matters” and together with its subsidiaries, the “Company” or the “Group”) was incorporated in May 2018 under Australian law. Security Matters’ registered address is K&L Gates Level 25, 525 Collins Street Melbourne, Victoria 3000, Australia. In October 2018, the Company was listed to the Australian Stock Exchange (“ASX”) under the symbol SMX.   \n---|---  \n  \nThe Company engages in research and development to permanently and irrevocably “mark” any object either solid, liquid or gas, allowing identification, circularity, proof of authenticity, tracking supply chain movements and quality assurance. \n\nSecurity Matters’ technology comprises a chemical-based hidden “barcode” system, alongside a unique “reader” to identify these codes, and a blockchain record to store and protect ownership data. Security Matters offers a business-to-business (B2B), “white-label” solution that serves market leaders’ needs for authentication, supply chain integrity and quality assurance. \n\nB. |  The novel coronavirus (“COVID-19”) has adversely impacted global commercial activity and contributed to significant volatility in financial markets. The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted global supply chains and adversely impacted many different industries for most of 2020-2021. COVID-19 could have a continued material adverse impact on economic and market conditions and trigger a period of continued global economic slowdown. The rapid development and fluidity of this situation precludes any prediction as to the extent and the duration of the economic impact of COVID-19. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Group have experienced some changes in its operations among them, shift to remote work as a result of lockdown and health precaution measures but do not expect to have material effect on the company’s operation.   \n---|---  \nC. |  During the six months ended June 30, 2022, the Company incurred operating losses and negative cash flows from operating activities. The Company did not yet generate significant revenues.   \n---|---  \n  \nAs discussed in Note 9 (3), on August 24, 2022, and on September 05, 2022, the Company entered into binding loan agreements including with existing shareholders. As discussed in Note 9 (4), the Company executed equity line agreement. The Company has also the ability to decrease its expenses in order to meet its existing cash flow streams. \n\nManagement believes that the proceeds from the recent funding agreements, combined with its cash on hand and the Company plans, are sufficient to meet the Company’s obligations as they come due in the foreseeable future. There are no assurances, however, that the Company will be able to obtain an adequate level of financial resources that are required for its long-term business plan. \n\n**NOTE 2 - SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES:**\n\n**Basis of preparation**\n\nThese interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting. They do not include all disclosures that would otherwise be required in a complete set of financial statements and should be read in conjunction with the 2021 annual financial statements. \n\n**Significant accounting policies**\n\nThe Group has applied the same accounting policies and methods of computation in its interim consolidated financial statements as in its 2021 annual financial statements.

The other party to the agreement will reimburse the Company for expenditures on research and development. These reimbursements are offset in the profit or loss accounts against the related expenses (research and development expenses). Any IP generated from this activity remains in the ownership of the Company. \n\nThe reimbursement from paid pilots and proof of concept projects for the six months period ended June 30, 2022, amounted to $1,020 ($555 for the six months period ended June 30, 2021). \n\n**NOTE 3 - OTHER RECEIVABLES:**\n\n**June 30,2022** | **December 31,2021**  \n---|---  \nPrepaid expenses | 1,155 | 454  \nTax authorities | 224 | 280  \nOther | 37 | 70  \n**Total** | **1,416** | **804**  \n* |  The prepaid expenses include US$ 1,027 for June 30, 2022, and US$ 349 for December 31 ,2021 that is related to the anticipated SPAC transaction (refer to Note 9 – Subsequent Events).   \n---|---  \n  \n**NOTE 4 - INTANGIBLE ASSETS:**\n\nIntangible assets as of June 30, 2022, consist of capitalized technology development costs ($4,192), of the Company core technology as well as the cost of the exclusive license intellectual property ($664) that was acquired in 2022, and which includes the addition amount as a result of the acquisition of additional 50% interest in SMX Beverages Pty Ltd (Note 7) and the cost of the existing 50% investment ($4). The fair value of the additional intellectual property acquired has been determined based on the fair value of the issued options consideration at the grant date. The acquired rights have not yet commenced amortization as the license has not yet been used. \n\n**NOTE 5 - CONVERTIBLE NOTES**\n\nIn May 2022, the Company issued 828,240 convertible notes, with a face value of $0.7 per convertible note, for an aggregate amount of 581. These convertible notes have a maturity date: December 31, 2022.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2021, and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period ended December 31, 2021, in conformity with International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board. \n\n**_Basis for Opinion_**\n\nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. \n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. \n\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. \n\nTel-Aviv, Israel |  /s/ Ziv Haft  \n---|---  \nSeptember 6, 2022 | Certified Public Accountants (Isr.)  \nWe have served as

Matters” and together with its subsidiaries, the “Company” or the “Group”) was incorporated in May 2018 under Australian law. Security Matters’ registered address is K&L Gates Level 25, 525 Collins Street Melbourne, Victoria 3000, Australia. In October 2018, the Company was listed to the Australian Securities Exchange (“ASX”) under the symbol SMX.   \n---|---  \n  \nThe Company engages in research and development to permanently and irrevocably “mark” any object either solid, liquid or gas, allowing identification, circularity, proof of authenticity, tracking supply chain movements and quality assurance for countless products in virtually every industry. \n\nSecurity Matters’ technology comprises a chemical-based hidden “barcode” system, alongside a unique “reader” to identify these codes, and a blockchain record to store and protect ownership data. Security Matters offers a business-to-business (B2B), “white-label” solution that serves market leaders’ needs for authentication, supply chain integrity and quality assurance. \n\nB. |  The novel coronavirus (“COVID-19”) has adversely impacted global commercial activity and contributed to significant volatility in financial markets. The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted global supply chains and adversely impacted many different industries for most of 2020-2021. COVID-19 could have a continued material adverse impact on economic and market conditions and trigger a period of continued global economic slowdown. The rapid development and fluidity of this situation precludes any prediction as to the extent and the duration of the economic impact of COVID-19. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic spread during 2021, the Group have experienced some changes in its operations among them, shift to remote work as a result of lockdown and health precaution measures but do not expect to have material effect on the company’s operation.   \n---|---  \n  \n**NOTE 2 - SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES:**\n\nThe significant accounting policies followed in the preparation of the financial statements, on a consistent basis, are: \n\n**New accounting standards**\n\nNew standards, interpretations and amendments not yet effective. \n\nThere are a number of standards, amendments to standards, and interpretations which have been issued by the IASB that are effective in future accounting periods that the company has decided not to adopt early. \n\nThe following amendments are effective for the period beginning 1 January 2022: \n\n• |  Annual Improvements to IFRS Standards 2018-2020 (Amendments to IFRS 1, IFRS 9, IFRS 16 and IAS 41);   \n---|---  \n• |  References to Conceptual Framework (Amendments to IFRS 3).   \n---|---  \n  \nThe following amendments are effective for the period beginning 1 January 2023: \n\n• |  Disclosure of Accounting Policies (Amendments to IAS 1 and IFRS 2 Practice Statement);   \n---|---  \n• |  Definition of Accounting Estimates (Amendments to IAS 8); and   \n---|---  \n• |  Deferred Tax Related to Assets and Liabilities arising from a Single Transaction (Amendments to IAS 12).   \n---|---  \n  \nF-62 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\n**SECURITY MATTERS LIMITED** **NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS** **(US$ in thousands)** |  ![LOGO](g381455g02a27.jpg)  \n---|---  \n  \n**NOTE 2 - SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONT.):**\n\n**New accounting standards (cont.)**\n\nIn January 2020, the IASB issued amendments to IAS 1, which clarify the criteria used to determine whether liabilities are classified as current or non-current. These amendments clarify that current or non-current classification is based on whether an entity has a right at the end of the reporting period to defer settlement of the liability for at least twelve months after the reporting period. \n\nThe amendments also clarify that ‘settlement’ includes the transfer of cash, goods, services, or equity instruments unless the obligation to transfer equity instruments arises from a conversion feature classified as an equity instrument separately from the liability component of a compound financial instrument. \n\nThe amendments were originally effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2022. However, in May 2020, the effective date was deferred to annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2023. \n\nIn response to feedback and enquiries from stakeholders, in December 2020, the IFRS Interpretations Committee (IFRIC) issued a Tentative Agenda Decision, analyzing the applicability of the amendments to three scenarios. \n\nHowever, given the comments received and concerns raised on some aspects of the amendments, in April 2021, IFRIC decided not to finalise the agenda decision and referred the matter to the IASB. In its June 2021 meeting, the IASB tentatively decided to amend the requirements of IAS 1 with respect to the classification of liabilities subject to conditions and disclosure of information about such conditions and to defer the effective date of the 2020 amendment by at least one year. \n\nThe Group is currently assessing the impact of these new accounting standards and amendments. The Group will assess the impact of the final amendments to IAS 1 on classification of its liabilities once the those are issued by the IASB. The Group does not believe that the amendments to IAS 1, in their present form, will have a significant impact on the classification of its liabilities, as the conversion feature in its convertible debt instruments is classified as an equity instrument and therefore, does not affect the classification of its convertible debt as a non-current liability. \n\n**Basis of preparation**\n\nThese financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (“IASB”). The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention except for certain financial liabilities which are measured at fair value until conversion. The Company has elected to present the statement of comprehensive income using the function of expense method. \n\n**Principles of consolidation**\n\nThe consolidated financial statements incorporate the assets and liabilities of all subsidiaries of Security Matters Limited as of 31 December 2021 and the results of all subsidiaries for the year then ended. Security Matters Limited and its subsidiaries together are referred to in these financial statements as the ‘consolidated entity’. \n\nSubsidiaries are all those entities over which the Company has control. The Company controls an entity when it is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect \n\nF-63 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\n**SECURITY MATTERS LIMITED** **NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS** **(US$ in thousands)** |  ![LOGO](g381455g02a27.jpg)  \n---|---  \n  \n**NOTE 2 - SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONT.):**\n\n**Principles of consolidation (cont.)**\n\nthose returns through its power to direct the activities of the entity. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is obtained by the Company and until the date that control is lost. \n\nIntercompany transactions between entities in the consolidated entity are eliminated. Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of the impairment of the asset transferred. \n\n**Critical Accounting Estimates and Assumptions**\n\nThe preparation of the financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that have an effect on the application of the accounting policies and on the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and expenses. These estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed regularly. Changes in accounting estimates are reported in the period of the change in estimate. The areas involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the financial statements, are disclosed in note 3. \n\n**Cash and cash equivalents**\n\nCash equivalents are considered by the Company to be highly liquid investments, including, inter alia, short-term deposits with banks and the maturity of which do not exceed three months at the time of deposit, and which are not restricted. \n\n**Foreign currency**\n\nThe financial statements are prepared in US Dollars which is the presentation currency of the Group. Security Matters Limited’s functional currency is Australian Dollars. The functional currency of Security Matters Ltd (Israel) is ILS Israeli Shekels. \n\nTransactions and balances in foreign currencies are converted into US Dollars in accordance with the principles set forth by International Accounting Standard (IAS) 21 (“The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates”). Accordingly, transactions and balances have been converted as follows: \n\n• |  Assets and liabilities – at the rate of exchange applicable at the reporting date;   \n---|---  \n• |  Expense items – at annual average rate at the statements of financial position date.   \n---|---  \n• |  Share capital, capital reserve and other capital movement items were at rate of exchange as of the date of recognition of those items.   \n---|---  \n• |  Accumulated deficit was based on the opening balance for the beginning of the reporting period in addition to the movements mentioned above.   \n---|---  \n• |  Exchange gains and losses from the aforementioned conversion are recognized in the statement of other comprehensive lose in Foreign Currency Translation Reserve.   \n---|---  \n  \nF-64 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\n**SECURITY MATTERS LIMITED** **NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS** **(US$ in thousands)** |  ![LOGO](g381455g02a27.jpg)  \n---|---  \n  \n**NOTE 2 - SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONT.):**\n\n**Investments in associated company**\n\nInvestments in associated company is accounted under the equity method and are initially recognized at cost. The investment’s cost includes transaction costs. The consolidated financial statements include the Group’s share in net income or loss, in other comprehensive income or loss, and in the net assets of associated companies accounted by the equity method from the date when significant influence or joint control materialized, until the date on which the conditions for significant influence or joint control are no longer met. \n\nLosses of an associate in amounts which exceed its equity are recognized by the Company to the extent of its investment in the associate plus any losses that the Company may incur as a result of a guarantee or other financial support provided in respect of the associate. \n\n**Loss per share**\n\n_Basic loss per share_\n\nBasic loss per share is calculated by dividing the net loss attributable to the owners of Security Matters Limited, by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the financial year, adjusted for bonus elements in ordinary shares issued during the financial year _._\n\n_Diluted earnings per share_\n\nPotential Ordinary shares are included in the computation of diluted earnings per share when their conversion decreases earnings per share. Potential Ordinary shares that are converted during the period are included in diluted earnings per share only until the conversion date and from that date in basic earnings per share. \n\n**Governmental grants**\n\nGovernment grants received for the use of research and development activities, for which the Company undertook to pay royalties to the state, contingent on future sales arising from this financing, were treated as forgivable loans. The grant was recognized as a liability in the financial statements, except when there is reasonable assurance that the Company will comply with the conditions for the forgiveness of the loan, then it would be recognized as a government grant. When the loan bears a below-market rate of interest, the liability is recognized at its fair value in accordance with the market interest rate prevailing at the time of receiving the grant. The difference between the consideration received and the liability recognized at inception was treated as a government grant and recognized as a reimbursement of research expenses. The repayment of the liability to the state is reviewed every reporting period, with changes in the liability resulting from a change in the expected royalties recognized in profit or loss. \n\n**Fair value measurement**\n\nFair value is the price that would be received when selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. \n\nF-65 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\n**SECURITY MATTERS LIMITED** **NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS** **(US$ in thousands)** |  ![LOGO](g381455g02a27.jpg)  \n---|---  \n  \n**NOTE 2 - SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONT.):**\n\n**Fair value measurement (cont.)**\n\nThe fair value measurement is based on the presumption that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability takes place either: \n\nA. |  In the principal market for the asset or liability; or   \n---|---  \nB. |  In the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market for the asset or liability.   \n---|---  \n  \nThe principal or the most advantageous market must be accessible to the Company. \n\nThe fair value of an asset or a liability is measured using the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability, assuming that market participants act in their economic best interest. \n\nA fair value measurement of a non-financial asset takes into account a market participant’s ability to generate economic benefits by using the asset in its highest and best use or by selling it to another market participant that would use the asset in its highest and best use. \n\nThe Company uses valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances and for which sufficient data are available to measure fair value, maximizing the use of relevant observable inputs and minimizing the use of unobservable inputs. \n\n**Classification of financial instruments by fair value hierarchy**\n\nThe financial instruments presented in the statements of financial position at fair value are grouped into classes with similar characteristics using the following fair value hierarchy which is determined based on the source of input used in measuring fair value: \n\nLevel 1 — | Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.  \n---|---  \nLevel 2 — | Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable either directly or indirectly.  \nLevel 3 — | Inputs that are not based on observable market data (valuation techniques which use inputs that are not based on observable market data).  \n  \n**Financial assets**\n\nThe Company classifies its financial assets into one of the following categories, depending on the purpose for which the asset was acquired. The Company’s accounting policy for each category is as follows: \n\nOther trade receivables: These assets are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. They arise principally through the provision of goods and services, but also incorporate other types of contractual monetary asset. These assets are carried at amortized cost less any provision for impairment. \n\nThe Company has no financial assets classified at Fair value through profit or loss. \n\nF-66 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\n**SECURITY MATTERS LIMITED** **NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS** **(US$ in thousands)** |  ![LOGO](g381455g02a27.jpg)  \n---|---  \n  \n**NOTE 2 - SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONT.):**\n\n**Financial liabilities**\n\na. financial liabilities measured at amortized cost: \n\nFinancial liabilities are initially recognized at fair value less transaction costs that are directly attributable to the issue of the financial liability. \n\nAfter initial recognition, the Company measures all financial liabilities at amortized cost using the effective interest rate method, which ensures that any interest expense over the period is at a constant interest rate on the balance of the liability carried in the statement of financial position, except for financial liabilities in b) below. \n\nb. financial liabilities measured at fair value through profit or loss: \n\nThese financial liabilities comprise of derivatives that are options which are to be settled in equity instruments but nevertheless do not meet the definitions of equity instrument. At initial recognition, the Company measures those financial liabilities at fair value. Transaction costs are recognized in profit or loss. After initial recognition, changes in fair value are recognized in profit or loss. \n\n**Impairment of financial assets**\n\nThe Company recognizes a loss allowance for expected credit losses on financial assets which are either measured at amortized cost or fair value through other comprehensive income. The measurement of the loss allowance depends upon the Company’s assessment at the end of each reporting period as to whether the financial instrument’s credit risk has increased significantly since initial recognition, based on reasonable and supportable information that is available, without undue cost or effort to obtain. \n\nWhere there has not been a significant increase in exposure to credit risk since initial recognition, a 12-month expected credit loss allowance is estimated. This represents a portion of the asset’s lifetime expected credit losses that is attributable to a default event that is possible within the next 12 months. Where a financial asset has become credit impaired or where it is determined that credit risk has increased significantly, the loss allowance is based on the asset’s lifetime expected credit losses. The amount of expected credit loss recognised is measured on the basis of the probability weighted present value of anticipated cash shortfalls over the life of the instrument discounted at the original effective interest rate. The loss allowance is recognised in profit or loss. \n\n**Impairment of non-financial assets **\n\nIntangible assets that have an indefinite useful life are not subject to amortization and are tested annually for impairment, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that they might be impaired. Other non-financial assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognized for the amount by which the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. Recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs of disposal and value-in-use. The value-in-use is the present value of the estimated future cash flows relating to the asset using a pre-tax discount rate specific to the asset or cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs. Assets that do not have independent cash flows are grouped together to form a cash-generating unit. \n\nF-67 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\n**SECURITY MATTERS LIMITED** **NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS** **(US$ in thousands)** |  ![LOGO](g381455g02a27.jpg)  \n---|---  \n  \n**NOTE 2 - SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONT.):**\n\n**Property, plant and equipment**\n\nItems of property, plant and equipment are initially recognized at cost. Cost includes directly attributable costs and the estimated present value of any future costs of dismantling and removing items. Depreciation is computed by the straight-line method, based on the estimated useful lives of the assets, as follows: \n\n%  \n---  \nComputers | 33  \nMachines and equipment | 20  \nFurniture and office equipment | 10  \nLeasehold improvements | 5  \n  \nLeasehold improvements are depreciated over the term of the expected lease including optional extension, or the estimated useful lives of the improvements, whichever is shorter. \n\n**Right-of-use assets **\n\nAll leases are accounted for by recognizing a right-of-use asset and a lease liability. \n\nA right-of-use asset is recognized at the commencement date of a lease. The right-of-use asset is measured at cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease liability, adjusted for, as applicable, any lease payments made at or before the commencement date net of any lease incentives received. \n\nRight-of-use assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the unexpired period of the lease or the estimated useful life of the asset, whichever is the shorter. Where the Company expects to obtain ownership of the leased asset at the end of the lease term, the depreciation is over its estimated useful life. Right-of use assets are subject to impairment or adjusted for any remeasurement of lease liabilities. \n\n**Reimbursement of research and development expenses**\n\nReimbursements in proof of concept (POC) agreements of expenditures on research and development in order to achieve commercial agreement once this activity will be result successful, are offset in profit or loss against the related expenses (research and development expenses). Any IP generated from this activity remains at the ownership of the company. \n\n**Lease liabilities**\n\nAll leases are accounted for by recognizing a right-of-use asset and a lease liability. Lease liabilities are measured at the present value of the contractual payments due to the lessor over the lease term, with the discount rate determined by reference to the rate implicit in the lease unless (as is typically the case) this is not readily determinable, in which case the Group’s incremental borrowing rate on commencement of the lease is used. Variable lease payments are only included in the measurement of the lease liability if they depend on an index or rate. In such cases, the initial measurement of the lease liability assumes the variable element will remain unchanged throughout the lease term. Other variable lease payments are expensed in the period to which they relate. \n\nOn initial recognition, the carrying value of the lease liability also includes: \n\n• |  amounts expected to be payable under any residual value guarantee.   \n---|---  \n  \nF-68 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\n**SECURITY MATTERS LIMITED** **NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS** **(US$ in thousands)** |  ![LOGO](g381455g02a27.jpg)  \n---|---  \n  \n**NOTE 2 - SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONT.):**\n\n**Lease liabilities (cont.)**\n\n• |  the exercise price of any purchase option granted in favor of the Group if it is reasonably certain to exercise that option.   \n---|---  \n• |  any penalties payable for terminating the lease, if the term of the lease has been estimated on the basis of termination option being exercised.   \n---|---  \n  \nSubsequent to initial measurement lease liabilities increase as a result of interest charged at a constant rate on the balance outstanding and are reduced for lease payments made. Lease liabilities are remeasured when there is a change in future lease payments arising from a change in an index or rate or when there is a change in the assessment of the term of any lease the remeasurement being recognized in front of the right of use assets. \n\n**Employee benefits**\n\nThe Company has several employee benefit plans as to Israeli employees: \n\n1. |  Short-term employee benefits: Short-term employee benefits include salaries, paid annual leave, paid sick leave, recreation and social security contributions and are recognized as expenses as the services are rendered. A liability in respect of a cash bonus or a profit-sharing plan is recognized when the Company has a legal or constructive obligation to make such payment as a result of past service rendered by an employee and a reliable estimate of the amount can be made.   \n---|---  \n2. |  Post-employment benefits: The plans are normally financed by contributions to insurance companies and classified as defined contribution plans or as defined benefit plans. The Company has defined for most of its employees contribution plans pursuant to Section 14 to the Israel Severance Pay Law since 2004 under which the Company pays fixed contributions and will have no legal or constructive obligation to pay further contributions if the fund does not hold sufficient amounts to pay all employee benefits relating to employee service in the current and prior periods.   \n---|---  \n  \nContributions to the defined contribution plan in respect of severance or retirement pay are recognized as an expense simultaneously with receiving the employee’s services and no additional provision is required in the financial statements except for the unpaid contribution. \n\n**Intangible assets**\n\nIntangible assets include capitalized technology development costs. Expenditures on research activities are recognized in profit or loss as incurred. Expenditures on internally developed products are mainly employee salaries and legal fees for filing of patents and are capitalized when the Company demonstrates all the following criteria: \n\na. |  The technical feasibility of completing the intangible asset so that it will be available for use or sale.   \n---|---  \nb. |  The intention to complete the intangible asset and use or sell it.   \n---|---  \nc. |  The ability to use or sell the intangible asset.   \n---|---  \nd. |  The probability of the intangible asset to generate future economic benefits. Among other things, the Company considers the existence of a market for the output of the intangible asset or the intangible asset itself or, if it is to be used internally, the usefulness of the intangible asset.   \n---|---  \n  \nF-69 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\n**SECURITY MATTERS LIMITED** **NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS** **(US$ in thousands)** |  ![LOGO](g381455g02a27.jpg)  \n---|---  \n  \n**NOTE 2 - SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONT.):**\n\n**Intangible assets (cont.)**\n\ne. |  The availability of adequate technical, financial and other resources to complete the development and to use or sell the intangible asset.   \n---|---  \nf. |  The ability to measure reliably the expenditures attributable to the intangible asset during its development.   \n---|---  \n  \nThe recognition criteria above are considered by the Company at each stage of development to determine when the criteria have been initially met in full. \n\nThe technical feasibility criteria is determine to be met when a the milestone of initial marking and reading capabilities is satisfied. The milestone’s identification occurs only following a detailed broad mapping of the raw material characteristics and establishing the formula for the chemical marker architecture to be embedded into the raw material based on industry standards and regulations. The result is the initial evidence that the x-ray algorithm of the designated reader is in a stage that can identify the marker and convey information. At this stage, the Company believes that the technical feasibility of completing the development for use is probable. \n\nThe Company notes that technical feasibility has been established and the achieved technology is ready for the next stage which consists of performing a proof-of-concept pilot with an industry partner, in order to adapt the technology for the relevant industry and adjust the development to meet the industry’s needs. \n\nCurrently, the Company’s capitalized development activities focus on: \n\n1. |  Development of marker architecture to be embedded topically or in-situ (application) for each material/product within the optimal industrial manufacturing phase, based on industry standards and regulations.   \n---|---  \n2. |  Semi Industrial scale – technology implementation in semi industrial production.   \n---|---  \n3. |  Development of a digital platform to support the end-to-end traceability from raw material to final product to recycling.   \n---|---  \n  \nThe Company’s management has the full intention to complete the development of the technology and ultimately to sell it. This intention is demonstrated by initiating partnerships with industry market leaders and continuing the development into the next phase. The Company’s intention is also reflected in the Company’s approved budget. \n\nThe Company’s management intends to concentrate its future sales and marketing efforts in the U.S. market, including recruitment of sales and marketing personnel. It plans to advance successful proof-of-concept pilots performed with industry leading partners, and further advance its innovative technology and commercialization efforts and collaborations in the segments relevant to its technology. \n\nThe Company’s business model targets leading brands and manufacturers in order to create a new market standard for circular economy solutions, brand authentication and supply chain integrity. The Company’s technology is applicable for multiple industries such as gold, fashion, electronics and circular economy – plastic and rubber. The Company is able to provide an adaptive solution for multiple market segments, based on a unified technology solution, through collaborative relationships with leading market companies which provide it with access to various potential entities to sell its solution. This is part of the Company’s strategy to create strategic partnerships with market leaders across its main segments of activity. The Company believes that this close collaboration with market leaders, and developing a product that meets their requests, suggest that there is a strong potential market for its development. \n\nF-70 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\n**SECURITY MATTERS LIMITED** **NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS** **(US$ in thousands)** |  ![LOGO](g381455g02a27.jpg)  \n---|---  \n  \n**NOTE 2 - SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONT.):**\n\n**Intangible assets (cont.)**\n\nAdequate technical and financial resources are available to complete the development; the development will be completed by the Company’s technology team which consists of professional experienced scientists and engineers, with a track record in the industrial sector and with financial resources successfully raised through the issuance of ordinary shares and loans. The Company has already accomplished its core technology development and is currently focused on development of specific adjustments for different market segments. This stage is focused and short-termed, therefore, management believes that limited financial resources are required for completing the development and that there is high probability for commencing commercial agreements following the successful proof-of-concept pilots. \n\nThe Company has financial systems in place that allow it to maintain records in sufficient detail that enable it to measure reliably the expenditures attributable to the intangible asset during its development. \n\nDevelopment expenditures not satisfying all the above criteria are recognized in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income as incurred. \n\n**Subsequent measurement**\n\nIn subsequent periods, capitalized development expenditures are measured at cost less accumulated amortization and accumulated impairment losses. \n\nAn asset is ready for its intended use, when the developed technology becomes operational and the Company completes an initial customization for a client’s specific needs, which means that the technology is fully implemented in the customer’s manufacturing processes and ready for its intended use. The management estimates that in approximately two years such customization will be completed and amortization will commence. \n\nIntangible assets with a finite useful life are amortized over their estimated useful lives and reviewed for impairment whenever there is an indication that the asset may be impaired. The amortization period and the amortization method for an intangible asset are reviewed at least at each year end. \n\nThe carrying amount of these assets is reviewed whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. If the asset is considered to be impaired, the amount of any impairment is measured as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the impaired asset. An expenditure incurred in development activities, including the Company’s software development is capitalized only where it clearly increases the economic benefits to be derived from the asset to which it relates, the expenditure will lead to new or substantially improved products, the products are technically and commercially feasible and the Company has sufficient resources to complete the development and reach the stage for which the product is ready for use. \n\nAll other expenditure, including those incurred in order to maintain an intangible assets current level of performance, is expensed as incurred. \n\nF-71 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\n**SECURITY MATTERS LIMITED** **NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS** **(US$ in thousands)** |  ![LOGO](g381455g02a27.jpg)  \n---|---  \n  \n**NOTE 2 - SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONT.):**\n\n**Share-based payments**\n\nThe Company measures the share-based expense and the cost of equity-settled transactions with employees and service providers by reference to the fair value of the equity instruments at the date at which they are granted. The Company selected the Black-Scholes model as the Company’s option pricing model to estimate the fair value of the company’s options awards. The model is based on share price, grant date and on assumptions regarding expected volatility, expected life of the options, expected dividend, and a no risk interest rate. As for granted options which are settled in equity instruments, the fair value of the options at the grant date is charged to the statement of comprehensive loss over the vesting period. Non-market vesting conditions are taken into account by adjusting the number of equity instruments expected to vest at each reporting date so that, ultimately, the cumulative amount recognized over the vesting period is based on the number of options that eventually vest. \n\n**NOTE 3 - CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS:**\n\nIn the process of applying the significant accounting policies, the Group has made the following judgments which have the most significant effect on the amounts recognized in the financial statements. \n\nThe preparation of the financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that have an effect on the application of the accounting policies and on the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Changes in accounting estimates are reported in the period of the change in estimate. The key assumptions made in the financial statements are discussed below. \n\n**Share based payments**\n\nThe Company has a share-based remuneration scheme for employees. The fair value of share options is estimated by using the Black-Scholes model, which was derived to model the value of the firm’s equity over time. The simulation model was designed to take into account the unique terms and conditions of the performance shares and share options, as well as the capital structure of the firm and the volatility of its assets, on the date of grant based on certain assumptions. Those conditions are described in the share-based compensation note and include, among others, the dividend growth rate, expected share price volatility and expected life of the options. The fair value of the equity settled options granted is charged to statement of profit or loss over the vesting period of each tranche and the credit is taken to equity, based on the consolidated entity’s estimate of shares that will eventually vest. \n\n**Intangible Assets**\n\nThe Company capitalizes costs for its developed projects when specific criteria are met. Initial capitalization of costs is based on management’s judgement that technological and economic feasibility is achievable, usually when a product development project has reached a defined milestone according to an established project management model. The management makes assumptions regarding the expected future economic benefit to be derived from the intangible asset and therefore whether the capitalized costs are expected to be recovered. \n\nThis amount of capitalized costs includes significant investment in the development of marking and reading capabilities in the subject material. Prior to being marketed, the Company will obtain a proof-of-concept pilot with an industry leading partner. The innovative nature of the product gives rise to some judgement as to whether the proof-of-concept will be successful such that it will lead to obtaining commercial contracts with customers.

In any way, the Bonus Payment is capped at ILS 3 million (approximately $965) per each of the two lenders (together, the Bonus Payments). \n\nThe Bonus Payments are intended to operate in one of the two trigger events: \n\n(i) |  dividend distributions paid by the Company; or   \n---|---  \n(ii) |  the sale of shares by a Lender in Security Matters Ltd (either in the event of a takeover or otherwise)   \n---|---  \n  \nOnly if the aggregate amounts of one of the two trigger events exceeds the investment of the lenders in the Company (in a way of loan or shares), then the lender would be entitled the Bonus Payment based on a formula set forth in the agreement. \n\nThe amount of the Bonus Payment is the amount that exceeds the aggregate sum invested in the Company (in a way of loan or shares) by the lender divided by several factors according to the formula as set forth in the agreement. \n\nThere is no time limit to pay the Bonus Payments. Once the Company has paid each Bonus Payment in its entirety (i.e., the cap of ILS 3 million has been paid to each Lender), then the Company has fulfilled its obligations. When the bonus payment is not expected to be made, the resulting cash flows would not affect profit and loss until the point in which the Company estimates that the liquidity events will take place. As of 31 December 2021, the Company estimates that is more likely than not that the shareholders will sell their shares in 2022 which will entitle them to the Bonus Payments. The amount of the Bonus Payment is subject to assumptions that were made with the assistance of external appraisal. As a result, the increase in the carrying amount of the liability was charged as expense of $87 to profit and loss in 2021. In August 2022 the loan from related party have been fully repaid – refer to Note 22. \n\nF-78 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\n**SECURITY MATTERS LIMITED** **NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS** **(US$ in thousands)** |  ![LOGO](g381455g02a27.jpg)  \n---|---  \n  \n**NOTE 11 - SHAREHOLDERS’ EQUITY**\n\n**A.** The ordinary shares in the Company confer upon their holders the right to receive notice to participate and vote in general meetings of the Company, and the right to receive dividends, if and when declared. \n\nNumber of shares  \n---  \nDecember 31, 2021 | December 31, 2020  \nAuthorized | Issued andoutstanding | Authorized | Issued andoutstanding  \nOrdinary shares | 165,532,264 | 165,532,264 | 139,291,043 | 139,291,043  \n  \n_Ordinary shares_\n\nOrdinary shares entitle the holder to participate in dividends and the proceeds on the winding up of the company in proportion to the number of and amounts paid on the shares held.

The Company uses different methods to measure different types of risk to which it is exposed. These methods include sensitivity analysis in the case of interest rate, foreign exchange and other price risks, ageing analysis for credit risk and beta analysis in respect of investment portfolios to determine market risk. \n\nF-84 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\n**SECURITY MATTERS LIMITED** **NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS** **(US$ in thousands)** |  ![LOGO](g381455g02a27.jpg)  \n---|---  \n  \n**NOTE 20 - FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND RISK MANAGEMENT (CONT.):**\n\n**Foreign currency risk**\n\nCurrency risk is the risk that the value of financial instruments will fluctuate due to changes in foreign exchange rates.

The Directors may authorise certificates to be issued with the seal and authorised signature(s) affixed by some method or system of mechanical process. In respect of a share or shares in the capital of the Company held jointly by several persons, the Company shall not be bound to issue a certificate or   \n---|---  \n  \nC-12 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\ncertificates to each such person, and the issue and delivery of a certificate or certificates to one of several joint holders shall be sufficient delivery to all such holders. If a share certificate is defaced, worn out, lost or destroyed, it may be renewed on such terms (if any) as to evidence and indemnity and on the payment of such expenses reasonably incurred by the Company in investigating such evidence, as the Directors may prescribe, and, in the case of defacement or wearing out, upon delivery of the old certificate.   \n---  \n15. |  The Company:   \n---|---  \n15.1 |  may give financial assistance for the purpose of an acquisition of its shares or, where the Company is a subsidiary, its holding company where permitted by sections 82 and 1043 of the Act, and   \n---|---  \n15.2 |  is authorised, for the purposes of section 105(4)(a) of the Act, but subject to section 1073 of the Act, to acquire its own shares.   \n---|---  \n16. |  The Directors (and any committee established under Article 186 and so authorised by the Directors and any person so authorised by the Directors or such committee) may without prejudice to Article 168:   \n---|---  \n16.1 |  allot, issue, grant options over and otherwise dispose of shares in the Company; and   \n---|---  \n16.2 |  exercise the Company’s powers under Article 14,   \n---|---  \n  \non such terms and subject to such conditions as they think fit, subject only to the provisions of the Act and these Articles. \n\n17. |  Unless the Board determines otherwise, any share in the capital of the Company shall be deemed to be a Redeemable Share on, and from the time of, the existence or creation of an agreement, transaction or trade between the Company and any person (who may or may not be a member) pursuant to which the Company acquires or will acquire a share in the capital of the Company, or an interest in shares in the capital of the Company, from the relevant person, save for an acquisition for nil consideration pursuant to section 102(1)(a) of the Act. In these circumstances, the acquisition of such shares by the Company, save where acquired for nil consideration in accordance with the Act, shall constitute the redemption of a Redeemable Share in accordance with Chapter 6 of Part 3 of the Act. No resolution, whether special or otherwise, shall be required to be passed to deem any share in the capital of the Company a Redeemable Share.   \n---|---  \n  \n**VARIATION OF CLASS RIGHTS**\n\n18. |  Without prejudice to the authority conferred on the Directors pursuant to Article 9 to issue Preferred Shares in the capital of the Company, where the shares in the Company are divided into different classes, the rights attaching to a class of shares may only be varied or abrogated if (a) the holders of 75% in nominal value of the issued shares of that class consent in writing to the variation, or (b) a special resolution, passed at a separate general meeting of the holders of that class, sanctions the variation. The quorum at any such separate general meeting, other than an Adjourned Meeting, shall be two persons holding or representing by proxy at least one-third in nominal value of the issued shares of the class in question and the quorum at an Adjourned Meeting shall be one person holding or representing by proxy shares of the class in question or that person’s proxy. The rights conferred upon the holders of any class of shares issued with preferred or other rights shall not, unless otherwise expressly provided by the terms of issue of the shares of that class, be deemed to be varied by a purchase or redemption by the Company of its own shares or by the creation or issue of further shares ranking pari passu therewith or subordinate thereto.   \n---|---  \n19. |  The redemption or purchase of Preferred Shares or any class or series of Preferred Shares shall not constitute a variation of rights of the holders of Preferred Shares.   \n---|---  \n20. |  The issue, redemption or purchase of any of the Preferred Shares shall not constitute a variation of the rights of the holders of Ordinary Shares.   \n---|---  \n  \nC-13 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\n21. |  The issue of Preferred Shares or any class or series of Preferred Shares which rank pari passu with, or junior to, any existing Preferred Shares or class of Preferred Shares shall not constitute a variation of the existing Preferred Shares or class of Preferred Shares.   \n---|---  \n22. |  The rights conferred upon the holders of the shares of any class issued with preferred or other rights shall not, unless otherwise expressly provided by the terms of issue of the shares of that class, be deemed to be varied by the creation or issue of further shares ranking pari passu therewith.   \n---|---  \n  \n**TRUSTS NOT RECOGNISED**\n\n23. |  Except as required by law, no person shall be recognised by the Company as holding any share upon any trust, and the Company shall not be bound by or be compelled in any way to recognise (even when having notice thereof) any equitable, contingent, future or partial interest in any share or any interest in any fractional part of a share or (except only as by these Articles or by law otherwise provided) any other rights in respect of any share except an absolute right to the entirety thereof in the member. This shall not preclude (i) the Company from requiring the members or a transferee of shares to furnish the Company with information as to the beneficial ownership of any share when such information is reasonably required by the Company, or (ii) the Directors, where they consider it appropriate, providing the information given to the members of shares to the holders of depositary instruments in such shares.   \n---|---  \n  \n**CALLS ON SHARES**\n\n24. |  The Directors may from time to time make calls upon the members in respect of any consideration unpaid on their shares in the Company (whether on account of the nominal value of the shares or by way of premium), provided that in the case where the conditions of allotment or issuance of shares provide for the payment of consideration in respect of such shares at fixed times, the Directors shall only make calls in accordance with such conditions.   \n---|---  \n25. |  Each member shall (subject to receiving at least thirty days’ notice specifying the time or times and place of payment, or such lesser or greater period of notice provided in the conditions of allotment or issuance of the shares) pay to the Company, at the time or times and place so specified, the amount called on the shares.   \n---|---  \n26. |  A call may be revoked or postponed, as the Directors may determine.   \n---|---  \n27. |  Subject to the conditions of allotment or issuance of the shares, a call shall be deemed to have been made at the time when the resolution of the Directors authorising the call was passed and may be required to be paid by instalments if specified in the call.   \n---|---  \n28. |  The joint holders of a share shall be jointly and severally liable to pay all calls in respect of it.   \n---|---  \n29. |  If the consideration called in respect of a share or in respect of a particular instalment is not paid in full before or on the day appointed for payment of it, the person from whom the sum is due shall pay interest in cash on the unpaid value from the day appointed for payment of it to the time of actual payment of such rate, not exceeding five per cent per annum or such other rate as may be specified by an order under section 2(7) of the Act, as the Directors may determine, but the Directors may waive payment of such interest wholly or in part.   \n---|---  \n30. |  Any consideration which, by the terms of issue of a share, becomes payable on allotment or issuance or at any fixed date (whether on account of the nominal value of the share or by way of premium) shall, for the purposes of these Articles, be deemed to be a call duly made and payable on the date on which, by the terms of issue, that consideration becomes payable, and in the case of non-payment of such a consideration, all the relevant provisions of these Articles as to payment of interest and expenses, forfeiture or otherwise, shall apply as if such consideration had become payable by virtue of a call duly made and notified.   \n---|---  \n  \nC-14 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\n31. |  The Directors may, on the issue of shares, differentiate between the holders of different classes as to the amount of calls to be paid and the times of payment.   \n---|---  \n32. |  The Directors may, if they think fit:   \n---|---  \n(a) |  receive from any member willing to advance such consideration, all or any part of the consideration uncalled and unpaid upon any shares held by him or her; and/or   \n---|---  \n(b) |  pay, upon all or any of the consideration so advanced (until the amount concerned would, but for such advance, become payable) interest at such rate (not exceeding, unless the Company in a general meeting otherwise directs, five per cent per annum or such other rate as may be specified by an order under section 2(7) of the Act) as may be agreed upon between the Directors and the member paying such consideration in advance.   \n---|---  \n33. |  The Company may:   \n---|---  \n(a) |  acting by its Directors, make arrangements on the issue of shares for a difference between the members in the amounts and times of payment of calls on their shares;   \n---|---  \n(b) |  acting by its Directors, accept from any member the whole or a part of the amount remaining unpaid on any shares held by him or her, although no part of that amount has been called up;   \n---|---  \n(c) |  acting by its Directors and subject to the Act, pay a dividend in proportion to the amount paid up on each share where a larger amount is paid up on some shares than on others; and   \n---|---  \n(d) |  by special resolution determine that any portion of its share capital which has not been already called up shall not be capable of being called up except in the event and for the purposes of the Company being wound up; upon the Company doing so, that portion of its share capital shall not be capable of being called up except in that event and for those purposes.   \n---|---  \n  \n**LIEN**\n\n34. |  The Company shall have a first and paramount lien on every share (not being a fully paid share) for all consideration (whether immediately payable or not) called, or payable at a fixed time, in respect of that share.   \n---|---  \n35. |  The Directors may at any time declare any share in the Company to be wholly or in part exempt from Article 34.   \n---|---  \n36. |  The Company’s lien on a share shall extend to all dividends payable on it.   \n---|---  \n37. |  The Company may sell, in such manner as the Directors think fit, any shares on which the Company has a lien, but no sale shall be made unless (i) a sum in respect of which the lien exists is immediately payable; and (ii) the following conditions are satisfied:   \n---|---  \n37.1 |  a notice in writing, stating and demanding payment of such part of the amount in respect of which the lien exists as is immediately payable, has been given to the registered holder of the share for the time being, or the person entitled thereto by reason of his or her death or bankruptcy; and   \n---|---  \n37.2 |  a period of 14 days after the date of giving of that notice has expired.   \n---|---  \n38. |  The following provisions apply in relation to a sale referred to in Article 37:   \n---|---  \n38.1 |  to give effect to any such sale, the Directors may authorise some person to transfer the shares sold to the purchaser of them;   \n---|---  \n38.2 |  the purchaser shall be registered as the holder of the shares comprised in any such transfer;   \n---|---  \n38.3 |  the purchaser shall not be bound to see to the application of the purchase consideration, nor shall his or her title to the shares be affected by any irregularity or invalidity in the proceedings in reference to the sale; and   \n---|---  \n  \nC-15 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\n38.4 |  the proceeds of the sale shall be received by the Company and applied in payment of such part of the amount in respect of which the lien exists as is immediately payable, and the residue, if any, shall (subject to a like lien for sums not immediately payable as existed upon the shares before the sale) be paid to the person entitled to the shares at the date of the sale.   \n---|---  \n  \n**FORFEITURE**\n\n39. |  If a member of the Company fails to pay any call or instalment of a call on the day appointed for payment of it, the Directors may, at any time thereafter during such time as any part of the call or instalment remains unpaid, serve a notice on the member requiring payment of so much of the call or instalment as is unpaid, together with any interest which may have accrued.   \n---|---  \n40. |  The notice referred to in Article 39 shall:   \n---|---  \n40.1 |  specify a further day (not earlier than the expiration of 14 days after the date of service of the notice) on or before which the payment required by the notice is to be made; and   \n---|---  \n40.2 |  state that, if the amount concerned is not paid by the day so specified, the shares in respect of which the call was made will be liable to be forfeited.   \n---|---  \n41. |  If the requirements of the notice referred to in Article 40 are not complied with, any share in respect of which the notice has been served may at any time after the day so specified (but before, should it occur, the payment required by the notice has been made) be forfeited by a resolution of the Directors to that effect.   \n---|---  \n42. |  On the trial or hearing of any action for the recovery of any money due for any call, it shall be sufficient to prove that the name of the member sued is entered in the Register as the holder, or one of the holders, of the shares in the capital of the Company in respect of which such debt accrued, that the resolution making the call is duly recorded in the minute book and that notice of such call was duly given to the member sued, in pursuance of these Articles, and it shall not be necessary to prove the appointment of the Directors who made such call nor any other matters whatsoever, but the proof of the matters aforesaid shall be conclusive evidence of the debt.   \n---|---  \n43. |  A forfeited share may be sold or otherwise disposed of on such terms and in such manner as the Directors think fit, and at any time before a sale or disposition the forfeiture may be cancelled on such terms as the Directors think fit.   \n---|---  \n44. |  A person whose shares have been forfeited shall cease to be a member of the Company in respect of the forfeited shares, but shall, notwithstanding, remain liable to pay to the Company all consideration which, at the date of forfeiture, were payable by him or her to the Company in respect of the shares, but his or her liability shall cease if and when the Company shall have received payment in full of all such consideration in respect of the shares.   \n---|---  \n45. |  A statement in writing that the maker of the statement is a Director or the Company Secretary, and that a share in the Company has been duly forfeited on a date stated in the statement, shall be conclusive evidence of the facts stated in it as against all persons claiming to be entitled to the share.   \n---|---  \n46. |  The following provisions apply in relation to a sale or other disposition of a share referred to in Article 43:   \n---|---  \n46.1 |  the Company may receive the consideration, if any, given for the share on the sale or other disposition of it and may execute a transfer of the share in favour of the person to whom the share is sold or otherwise disposed of (the “**disponee** ”);   \n---|---  \n46.2 |  upon such execution, the disponee shall be registered as the holder of the share; and   \n---|---  \n46.3 |  the disponee shall not be bound to see to the application of the purchase consideration, if any, nor shall his or her title to the share be affected by any irregularity or invalidity in the proceedings in reference to the forfeiture, sale or disposal of the share.   \n---|---  \n  \nC-16 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\n47. |  The provisions of these Articles as to forfeiture shall apply in the case of non-payment of any sum which, by the terms of issue of a share in the capital of the Company, becomes payable at a fixed time, whether on account of the nominal value of the share in the capital of the Company or by way of premium, as if the same had been payable by virtue of a call duly made and notified.   \n---|---  \n48. |  The Directors may accept the surrender of any share in the capital of the Company which the Directors have resolved to have been forfeited upon such terms and conditions as may be agreed and, subject to any such terms and conditions, a surrendered share in the capital of the Company shall be treated as if it has been forfeited.   \n---|---  \n  \n**VARIATION OF COMPANY CAPITAL; AMENDMENT OF MEMORANDUM OF ASSOCIATION**\n\n49. |  Subject to the provisions of these Articles, the Company may, by ordinary resolution and in accordance with section 83 of the Act, do any one or more of the following, from time to time:   \n---|---  \n49.1 |  consolidate and divide all or any of its classes of shares into shares of a larger nominal value than its existing shares;   \n---|---  \n49.2 |  subdivide its classes of shares, or any of them, into shares of a smaller nominal value, so however, that in the subdivision the proportion between the amount paid and the amount, if any, unpaid on each reduced share shall be the same as it was in the case of the share from which the reduced share is derived;   \n---|---  \n49.3 |  increase the nominal value of any of its shares by the addition to them of any undenominated capital;   \n---|---  \n49.4 |  reduce the nominal value of any of its shares by the deduction from them of any part of that value, subject to the crediting of the amount of the deduction to undenominated capital, other than the share premium account;   \n---|---  \n49.5 |  without prejudice or limitation to Articles 89 to 94 and the powers conferred on the Directors thereby, convert any undenominated capital into shares for allotment as bonus shares to holders of existing shares;   \n---|---  \n49.6 |  increase its share capital by new shares of such amount as it thinks expedient; or   \n---|---  \n49.7 |  cancel shares of its share capital which, at the date of the passing of the resolution, have not been taken or agreed to be taken by any person, and diminish the amount of its share capital by the amount of the shares so cancelled.   \n---|---  \n50. |  Subject to the provisions of these Articles, the Company may:   \n---|---  \n50.1 |  without prejudice to Article 17, by special resolution, and subject to the provisions of the Act governing the variation of rights attached to classes of shares and the amendment of these Articles, convert any of its shares into Redeemable Shares; or   \n---|---  \n50.2 |  by special resolution, and subject to the provisions of the Act (or as otherwise required or permitted by applicable law) alter or add to the Memorandum with respect to any objects, powers or other matters specified therein or alter or add to these Articles.   \n---|---  \n  \n**REDUCTION OF COMPANY CAPITAL**\n\n51. |  The Company may, in accordance with the provisions of sections 84 to 87 of the Act, reduce its company capital in any way it thinks expedient and, without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing, may thereby:   \n---|---  \n51.1 |  extinguish or reduce the liability on any of its shares in respect of share capital not paid up;   \n---|---  \n  \nC-17 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\n51.2 |  either with or without extinguishing or reducing liability on any of its shares, cancel any paid up company capital which is lost or unrepresented by available assets; or   \n---|---  \n51.3 |  either with or without extinguishing or reducing liability on any of its shares, pay off any paid up company capital which is in excess of the wants of the Company.   \n---|---  \n  \nUnless the special resolution provides otherwise, a reserve arising from the reduction of company capital is to be treated for all purposes as a realised profit in accordance with section 117(9) of the Act. Nothing in this Article 51 shall, however, prejudice or limit the Company’s ability to perform or engage in any of the actions described in section 83(1) of the Act by way of ordinary resolution only. \n\n**TRANSFER OF SHARES**\n\n52. |  Subject to the Act and to the provisions of these Articles as may be applicable, any member may transfer all or any of his shares (of any class) by an instrument of transfer in the usual common form or in any other form which the Board may from time to time approve. The instrument of transfer may be endorsed on the certificate.   \n---|---  \n53. |  The instrument of transfer of a share shall be signed by or on behalf of the transferor and, if the share is not fully paid, by or on behalf of the transferee. The transferor shall be deemed to remain the holder of the share until the name of the transferee is entered in the Register in respect of it. All instruments of transfer may be retained by the Company.   \n---|---  \n54. |  The instrument of transfer of any share may be executed for and on behalf of the transferor by the Company Secretary or any other party designated by the Board for such purpose, and the Company Secretary or any other party designated by the Board for such purpose shall be deemed to have been irrevocably appointed agent for the transferor of such share or shares with full power to execute, complete and deliver in the name of and on behalf of the transferor of such share or shares all such transfers of shares held by the members in the share capital of the Company. Any document which records the name of the transferor, the name of the transferee, the class and number of shares agreed to be transferred, the date of the agreement to transfer shares and the price per share, shall, once executed by the transferor or the Company Secretary or any other party designated by the Board for such purpose as agent for the transferor, be deemed to be a proper instrument of transfer for the purposes of the Act. The transferor shall be deemed to remain the member holding the share until the name of the transferee is entered on the Register in respect thereof, and neither the title of the transferee nor the title of the transferor shall be affected by any irregularity or invalidity in the proceedings in reference to the sale should the Directors so determine.   \n---|---  \n55. |  Subject to the Act, the Company, at its absolute discretion, may, or may procure that a subsidiary of the Company shall, pay Irish stamp duty arising on a transfer of shares on behalf of the transferee of such shares of the Company. If stamp duty resulting from the transfer of shares in the Company which would otherwise be payable by the transferee is paid by the Company or any subsidiary of the Company on behalf of the transferee, then in those circumstances, the Company shall, on its behalf or on behalf of its subsidiary (as the case may be), be entitled to (i) reimbursement of the stamp duty from the transferee, (ii) set-off the stamp duty against any dividends payable to the transferee of those shares and (iii) to the extent permitted by section 1042 of the Act, claim a first and paramount lien on the shares on which stamp duty has been paid by the Company or its subsidiary for the amount of stamp duty paid. The Company’s lien shall extend to all dividends paid on those shares.   \n---|---  \n56. |  The Directors shall have power to permit any class of shares to be held in uncertificated form and to implement any arrangements they think fit for such evidencing and transfer which accord with such regulations and in particular shall, where appropriate, be entitled to disapply or modify all or part of the provisions in these Articles with respect to the requirement for written instruments of transfer and share certificates (if any), in order to give effect to such regulations.   \n---|---  \n  \nC-18 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\n57. |  The Board may, in its absolute discretion and without assigning any reason for its decision, decline to register any transfer of any share which is not a fully-paid share. The Board may also decline to register any transfer if:   \n---|---  \n57.1 |  the instrument of transfer is not duly stamped, if required, and lodged at the Office or any other place as the Board may from time to time specify for the purpose, accompanied by the certificate (if any) for the shares to which it relates and such other evidence as the Board may reasonably require to show the right of the transferor to make the transfer;   \n---|---  \n57.2 |  the instrument of transfer is in respect of more than one class of share;   \n---|---  \n57.3 |  the instrument of transfer is in favour of more than four persons jointly;   \n---|---  \n57.4 |  it is not satisfied that all applicable consents, authorisations, permissions or approvals of any governmental body or agency in Ireland or any other applicable jurisdiction required to be obtained under relevant law prior to such transfer have been obtained; or   \n---|---  \n57.5 |  it is not satisfied that the transfer would not violate the terms of any agreement to which the Company (or any of its subsidiaries) and the transferor are party or subject.   \n---|---  \n58. |  Subject to any directions of the Board from time to time in force, the Company Secretary or any other party designated by the Board for such purpose may exercise the powers and discretions of the Board under Article 57, Article 81, Article 88 and Article 90.   \n---|---  \n59. |  If the Board declines to register a transfer it shall, within one month after the date on which the instrument of transfer was lodged, send to the transferee notice of such refusal.   \n---|---  \n60. |  No fee shall be charged by the Company for registering any transfer or for making any entry in the Register concerning any other document relating to or affecting the title to any share (except that the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed on it in connection with such transfer or entry).   \n---|---  \n  \n**TRANSMISSION OF SHARES**\n\n61. |  In the case of the death of a member, the survivor or survivors, where the deceased was a joint holder, and the personal representatives of the deceased where he or she was a sole holder, shall be the only persons recognised by the Company as having any title to his or her interest in the shares.   \n---|---  \n62. |  Nothing in Article 61 shall release the estate of a deceased joint holder from any liability in respect of any share which had been jointly held by him or her with other persons.   \n---|---  \n63. |  Any person becoming entitled to a share in consequence of the death or bankruptcy of a member may, upon such evidence being produced as may from time to time properly be required by the Directors and subject to Article 64, elect either: (a) to be registered himself or herself as holder of the share; or (b) to have some person nominated by him or her (being a person who consents to being so registered) registered as the transferee thereof.   \n---|---  \n64. |  The Directors shall, in either of those cases, have the same right to decline or suspend registration as they would have had in the case of a transfer of the share by that member before his or her death or bankruptcy, as the case may be.   \n---|---  \n65. |  If the person becoming entitled as mentioned in Article 63: (a) elects to be registered himself or herself, the person shall furnish to the Company a notice in writing signed by him or her stating that he or she so elects; or (b) elects to have another person registered, the person shall testify his or her election by executing to that other person a transfer of the share.   \n---|---  \n66. |  All the limitations, restrictions and provisions of Articles 61 to 65 shall be applicable to a notice or transfer referred to in Article 65 as if the death or bankruptcy of the member concerned had not occurred and the notice or transfer were a transfer signed by that member.   \n---|---  \n  \nC-19 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\n67. |  Subject to Article 68 and Article 69, a person becoming entitled to a share by reason of the death or bankruptcy of the holder shall be entitled to the same dividends and other advantages to which he or she would be entitled if he or she were the registered holder of the share.   \n---|---  \n68. |  A person referred to in Article 67 shall not, before being registered as a member in respect of the share, be entitled in respect of it to exercise any right conferred by membership in relation to meetings of the Company.   \n---|---  \n69. |  The Directors may at any time serve a notice on any such person requiring the person to make the election provided for by Article 63 and, if the person does not make that election (and proceed to do, consequent on that election, whichever of the things mentioned in Article 65 is appropriate) within ninety days after the date of service of the notice, the Directors may thereupon withhold payment of all dividends, bonuses or other moneys payable in respect of the share until the requirements of the notice have been complied with.   \n---|---  \n70. |  The Company may charge a fee not exceeding €10 on the registration of every probate, letters of administration, certificate of death, power of attorney, notice as to stock or other instrument or order.   \n---|---  \n71. |  The Directors may determine such procedures as they shall think fit regarding the transmission of shares in the Company held by a body corporate that are transmitted by operation of law in consequence of a merger or division.   \n---|---  \n  \n**CLOSING REGISTER OR FIXING RECORD DATE**\n\n72. |  For the purpose of determining members entitled to notice of or to vote at any meeting of members or any adjournment thereof, or members entitled to receive payment of any dividend, or in order to make a determination of members for any other proper purpose, the Board may provide, subject to the requirements of section 174 of the Act, that the Register shall be closed for transfers at such times and for such periods, not exceeding in the whole thirty days in each year. If the Register shall be so closed for the purpose of determining members entitled to notice of, or to vote at, a meeting of members, such Register shall, subject to applicable law and Exchange rules, be so closed for at least five days immediately preceding such meeting and the record date for such determination shall be the date of the closure of the Register.   \n---|---  \n73. |  In lieu of, or apart from, closing the Register, the Board may fix in advance a date as the record date (a) for any such determination of members entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of the members, which record date shall not, subject to applicable law and Exchange rules, be more than sixty days before the date of such meeting, and (b) for the purpose of determining the members entitled to receive payment of any dividend or other distribution, or in order to make a determination of members for any other proper purpose, which record date shall not, subject to applicable law and Exchange rules, be more than sixty days prior to the date of payment of such dividend or other distribution or the taking of any action to which such determination of members is relevant.   \n---|---  \n74. |  If the Register is not so closed and no record date is fixed for the determination of members entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of members, the date immediately preceding the date on which notice of the meeting is deemed given under these Articles shall be the record date for such determination of members. Where a determination of members entitled to vote at any meeting of members has been made as provided in these Articles, such determination shall apply to any adjournment thereof; provided, however, that the Directors may fix a new record date of the Adjourned Meeting, if they think fit.   \n---|---  \n  \n**DIVIDENDS**\n\n75. |  The Company in a general meeting may declare dividends, but no dividends shall exceed the amount recommended by the Directors. Any general meeting declaring a dividend and any resolution of the   \n---|---  \n  \nC-20 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\nDirectors declaring an interim dividend may direct payment of such dividend or interim dividend wholly or partly by the distribution of specific assets including paid up shares, debentures or debenture stocks of any other company or in any one or more of such ways, and the Directors shall give effect to such resolution.   \n---  \n76. |  The Directors may from time to time:   \n---|---  \n76.1 |  pay to the members such dividends (whether as either interim dividends or final dividends) as appear to the Directors to be justified by the profits of the Company, subject to section 117 and Chapter 6 of Part 17 of the Act;   \n---|---  \n76.2 |  before declaring any dividend, set aside out of the profits of the Company such sums as they think proper as a reserve or reserves which shall, at the discretion of the Directors, be applicable for any purpose to which the profits of the Company may be properly applied, and pending such application may, at the like discretion either be employed in the business of the Company or be held as cash or cash equivalents or invested in such investments as the Directors may lawfully determine; and   \n---|---  \n76.3 |  without placing the profits of the Company to reserve, carry forward any profits which they may think prudent not to distribute.   \n---|---  \n77. |  Unless otherwise specified by the Directors at the time of declaring a dividend, the dividend shall be a final dividend.   \n---|---  \n78. |  Where the Directors specify that a dividend is an interim dividend at the time it is declared, such interim dividend shall not constitute a debt recoverable against the Company and the declaration may be revoked by the Directors at any time prior to its payment provided that the holders of the same class of share are treated equally on any revocation.   \n---|---  \n79. |  Subject to the rights of persons, if any, entitled to shares with special rights as to dividend (and to the rights of the Company under Articles 34 to 38 and Article 81) all dividends shall be declared and paid such that shares of the same class shall rank equally irrespective of the premium credited as paid up on such shares.   \n---|---  \n80. |  If any share is issued on terms providing that it shall rank for a dividend as from a particular date, such share shall rank for dividend accordingly.   \n---|---  \n81. |  The Directors may deduct from any dividend payable to any member, all sums of money (if any) immediately payable by him or her to the Company on account of calls or otherwise in relation to the shares of the Company.   \n---|---  \n82. |  The Directors when declaring a dividend or bonus may direct payment of such dividend or bonus wholly or partly by the distribution of specific assets and, in particular, paid up shares, debentures or debenture stock of any other company or in any one or more of such ways.   \n---|---  \n83. |  Where any difficulty arises in regard to a distribution, the Directors may settle the matter as they think expedient and, in particular, may:   \n---|---  \n83.1 |  issue fractional certificates (subject always to the restriction on the issue of fractional shares) and fix the value for distribution of such specific assets or any part of them;   \n---|---  \n83.2 |  determine that cash payments shall be made to any members upon the footing of the value so fixed, in order to adjust the rights of all the parties; and   \n---|---  \n83.3 |  vest any such specific assets in trustees as may seem expedient to the Directors.   \n---|---  \n84. |  Any dividend, interest or other moneys payable in cash in respect of any shares may be paid:   \n---|---  \n84.1 |  by cheque or negotiable instrument sent by post directed to or otherwise delivered to the registered address of the holder, or where there are joint holders, to the registered address of that one of the joint holders who is first named on the register or to such person and to such address as the holder or the joint holders may in writing direct; or   \n---|---  \n84.2 |  by transfer to a bank account nominated by the payee or where such an account has not been so nominated, to the account of a trustee nominated by the Company to hold such moneys,   \n---|---  \n  \nC-21 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\nprovided that the debiting of the Company’s account in respect of the relevant amount shall be evidence of good discharge of the Company’s obligations in respect of any payment made by any such methods. \n\n85. |  Any such cheque or negotiable instrument referred to in Article 84 shall be made payable to the order of the person to whom it is sent.   \n---|---  \n86. |  Any one of two or more joint holders may give valid receipts for any dividends, bonuses or other moneys payable in respect of the shares held by them as joint holders, whether paid by cheque or negotiable instrument or direct transfer.   \n---|---  \n87. |  No dividend shall bear interest against the Company.   \n---|---  \n88. |  If the Directors so resolve, any dividend or distribution which has remained unclaimed for twelve years from the date of its declaration shall be forfeited and cease to remain owing by the Company. The payment by the Directors of any unclaimed dividend, distribution or other moneys payable in respect of a share into a separate account shall not constitute the Company a trustee in respect thereof.   \n---|---  \n  \n**BONUS ISSUE OF SHARES**\n\n89. |  Any capitalisation provided for in Articles 90 to 94 inclusive will not require approval or ratification by the members.   \n---|---  \n90. |  The Directors may resolve to capitalise any part of a relevant sum (within the meaning of Article 91) by applying such sum in paying up in full unissued shares of a nominal value or nominal value and premium, equal to the sum capitalised, to be allotted and issued as fully paid bonus shares, to those members of the Company who would have been entitled to that sum if it were distributed by way of dividend (and in the same proportions).   \n---|---  \n91. |  For the purposes of Article 90, “relevant sum” means: (a) any sum for the time being standing to the credit of the Company’s undenominated capital; (b) any of the Company’s profits available for distribution; (c) any sum representing unrealised revaluation reserves; or (d) a merger reserve or any other capital reserve of the Company.   \n---|---  \n92. |  The Directors may in giving effect to any resolution under Article 90 make: (a) all appropriations and applications of the undivided profits resolved to be capitalised by the resolution; and (b) all allotments and issues of fully paid shares, if any, and generally shall do all acts and things required to give effect to the resolution.   \n---|---  \n93. |  Without limiting Article 92, the Directors may:   \n---|---  \n93.1 |  make such provision as they think fit for the case of shares becoming distributable in fractions (and, again, without limiting the foregoing, may sell the shares represented by such fractions and distribute the net proceeds of such sale amongst the members otherwise entitled to such fractions in due proportions);   \n---|---  \n93.2 |  authorise any person to enter, on behalf of all the members concerned, into an agreement with the Company providing for the allotment to them, respectively credited as fully paid up, of any further shares to which they may become entitled on the capitalisation concerned or, as the case may require, for the payment by the application thereto of their respective proportions of the profits resolved to be capitalised of the amounts remaining unpaid on their existing shares,   \n---|---  \n  \nand any agreement made under such authority shall be effective and binding on all the members concerned. \n\n94. |  Where the Directors have resolved to approve a bona fide revaluation of all the fixed assets of the Company, the net capital surplus in excess of the previous book value of the assets arising from such revaluation may be: (a) credited by the Directors to undenominated capital, other than the share premium account; or (b) used in paying up unissued shares of the Company to be issued to members as fully paid bonus shares.   \n---|---  \n  \nC-22 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\n**GENERAL MEETINGS – GENERAL**\n\n95. |  Subject to Article 96, the Company shall in each year hold a general meeting as its annual general meeting in addition to any other meeting in that year, and shall specify the meeting as such in the notices calling it; and not more than 15 months shall elapse between the date of one annual general meeting of the Company and that of the next.   \n---|---  \n96. |  The Company will hold its first annual general meeting within eighteen months of its incorporation.   \n---|---  \n97. |  The annual general meeting shall be held in such place and at such time as the Directors shall determine.   \n---|---  \n98. |  All general meetings of the Company other than annual general meetings shall be called extraordinary general meetings.   \n---|---  \n99. |  The Directors may, whenever they think fit, convene an extraordinary general meeting. An extraordinary general meeting shall also be convened by the Directors on the requisition of members, or if the Directors fail to so convene an extraordinary general meeting, such extraordinary general meeting may be convened by the requisitioning members, in each case in accordance with section 178(3) to (7) of the Act.   \n---|---  \n100. |  If at any time the number of Directors is less than two, any Director or any member that satisfies the criteria thereunder, may convene an extraordinary general meeting in the same manner as nearly as possible as that in which meetings may be convened by the Directors.   \n---|---  \n101. |  An annual general meeting or extraordinary general meeting of the Company may be held outside of Ireland. The Company shall make, at its expense, all necessary arrangements to ensure that members can by technological means participate in any such meeting without leaving Ireland.   \n---|---  \n102. |  A general meeting of the Company may be held in two or more venues (whether inside or outside of Ireland) at the same time using any technology that provides members, as a whole, with a reasonable opportunity to participate, and such participation shall be deemed to constitute presence in person at the meeting.   \n---|---  \n  \n**NOTICE OF GENERAL MEETINGS**\n\n103. |  The only persons entitled to notice of general meetings of the Company are:   \n---|---  \n103.1 |  the members;   \n---|---  \n103.2 |  the personal representatives of a deceased member, which member would but for his death be entitled to vote;   \n---|---  \n103.3 |  the assignee in bankruptcy of a bankrupt member of the Company (being a bankrupt member who is entitled to vote at the meeting);   \n---|---  \n103.4 |  the Directors and Company Secretary; and   \n---|---  \n103.5 |  unless the Company is entitled to and has availed itself of the audit exemption under the Act, the Auditors (who shall also be entitled to receive other communications relating to any general meeting which a member is entitled to receive).   \n---|---  \n104. |  Subject to the provisions of the Act allowing a general meeting to be called by shorter notice, an annual general meeting and an extraordinary general meeting called for the passing of a special resolution shall be called by at least twenty-one days’ notice. Any other extraordinary general meeting shall also be called by at least twenty-one days’ notice, except that it may be called by fourteen days’ notice where:   \n---|---  \n104.1 |  all members, who hold shares that carry rights to vote at the meeting, are permitted to vote by electronic means at the meeting; and   \n---|---  \n104.2 |  a special resolution reducing the period of notice to fourteen days has been passed at the immediately preceding annual general meeting, or at a general meeting held since that meeting.   \n---|---  \n  \nC-23 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\n105. |  Any notice convening a general meeting shall specify the time and place of the meeting and, in the case of special business, the general nature of that business and, in reasonable prominence, that a member entitled to attend, speak, ask questions and vote is entitled to appoint a proxy to attend, speak, ask questions and vote in his place and that a proxy need not be a member of the Company. Every notice shall specify such other details as are required by applicable law or the relevant code, rules and regulations applicable to the listing of the shares on any Exchange. Subject to any restrictions imposed on any shares, the notice shall be given to all the members and to the Directors and Auditors.   \n---|---  \n106. |  The accidental omission to give notice of a meeting to, or the non-receipt of notice of a meeting by, any person entitled to receive notice shall not invalidate the proceedings at the meeting.   \n---|---  \n107. |  In cases where instruments of proxy are sent out with notices, the accidental omission to send such instrument of proxy to, or the non-receipt of such instrument of proxy by, any person entitled to receive such notice shall not invalidate any resolution passed or any proceeding at any such meeting. A member present, either in person or by proxy, at any general meeting of the Company or of the holders of any class of shares in the Company will be deemed, subject to Article 110, to have received notice of that meeting and, where required, of the purpose for which it was called.   \n---|---  \n108. |  Where, by any provision contained in the Act, extended notice is required of a resolution, the resolution shall not be effective (except where the Directors have resolved to submit it) unless notice of the intention to move it has been given to the Company not less than twenty-eight days (or such shorter period as the Act permits) before the meeting at which it is moved, and the Company shall give to the members notice of any such resolution as required by and in accordance with the provisions of the Act.   \n---|---  \n109. |  In determining the correct period of notice for a general meeting, only Clear Days shall be counted.   \n---|---  \n110. |  Whenever any notice is required to be given by law or by these Articles to any person or persons, a waiver thereof in writing, signed by the person or persons entitled to the notice whether before or after the time stated therein, shall be deemed equivalent thereto. Attendance of a person at a meeting shall constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting, except when the person attends a meeting for the express purpose of objecting at the beginning of the meeting to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened.   \n---|---  \n  \n**WRITTEN RESOLUTIONS OF THE MEMBERS**\n\n111. |  For so long as the Company has more than one shareholder, unanimous consent of the holders of the Ordinary Shares shall be required before the shareholders may act by way of written resolution in lieu of holding a meeting.   \n---|---  \n112. |  Except in the case of the removal of statutory auditors or Directors and subject to the Act and the provisions of Article 111, anything which may be done by resolution in general meeting of all or any class may be done by resolution in writing, signed by all of the holders or any class thereof or their proxies (or in the case of a holder that is a corporation (whether or not a company within the meaning of the Acts) on behalf of such holder) being all of the holders of the Company or any class thereof, who at the date of the resolution in writing would be entitled to attend a meeting and vote on the resolution shall be valid and effective for all purposes as if the resolution had been passed at a general meeting of the Company or any class thereof duly convened and held, and if described as a Special Resolution shall be deemed to be a Special Resolution within the meaning of the Acts. Any such resolution in writing may be signed in as many counterparts as may be necessary.   \n---|---  \n112.1 |  For the purposes of any written resolution under Article 112, the date of the resolution in writing is the date when the resolution is signed by, or on behalf of, the last holder to sign and any reference in any enactment to the date of passing of a resolution is, in relation to a resolution in writing made in accordance with this section, a reference to such date.   \n---|---  \n  \nC-24 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\n112.2 |  A resolution in writing made in accordance with Article 112 is valid as if it had been passed by the Company in general meeting or, if applicable, by a meeting of the relevant class of holders of the Company, as the case may be. A resolution in writing made in accordance with this section shall constitute minutes for the purposes of the Act and these Articles.   \n---|---  \n113. |  At any time that the Company is a single-member company, its sole member may pass any resolution as a written decision in accordance with section 196 of the Act.   \n---|---  \n  \n**QUORUM FOR GENERAL MEETINGS**\n\n114. |  Two members present in person or by proxy and having the right to attend and vote at the meeting and together holding shares representing more than 50% of the votes that may be cast by all members at the relevant time shall be a quorum at a general meeting; provided, however, that at any time when the Company is a single-member company, one member of the Company present in person or by proxy at a general meeting of it shall be a quorum.   \n---|---  \n115. |  If within 15 minutes (or such greater time determined by the chairperson) after the time appointed for a general meeting a quorum is not present, then:   \n---|---  \n115.1 |  the meeting shall stand adjourned to the same day in the next week, at the same time and place or to such other day and at such other time and place as the Directors may determine (the “**Adjourned Meeting** ”); and   \n---|---  \n115.2 |  if at the Adjourned Meeting a quorum is not present within half an hour (or such greater time determined by the chairperson) after the time appointed for the meeting, the members present shall be a quorum.   \n---|---  \n  \n**PROXIES**\n\n116. |  Every member entitled to attend, speak, ask questions and vote at a general meeting may appoint a proxy or proxies to attend, speak, ask questions relating to items on the agenda and vote on his behalf and may appoint more than one proxy to attend, speak, ask questions and vote at the same general meeting provided that, where a member appoints more than one proxy in relation to a general meeting, each proxy must be appointed to exercise the rights attached to different shares held by that member.   \n---|---  \n117. |  The appointment of a proxy shall be in writing in any usual form or in any other form which the Directors may approve and shall be signed by or on behalf of the appointor. The signature on such appointment need not be witnessed. A body corporate may sign a form of proxy under its common seal or under the hand of a duly authorised officer thereof or in such other manner as the Directors may approve. A proxy need not be a member of the Company. A member shall be entitled to appoint a proxy by electronic means, to an address specified by the Company. The proxy form must make provision for three-way voting (i.e., to allow votes to be cast for or against a resolution or to be withheld) on all resolutions intended to be proposed, other than resolutions which are merely procedural. An instrument or other form of communication appointing or evidencing the appointment of a proxy or a corporate representative (other than a standing proxy or representative) together with such evidence as to its due execution as the Board may from time to time require, may be returned to the address or addresses stated in the notice of meeting or Adjourned Meeting or any other information or communication by such time or times as may be specified in the notice of meeting or Adjourned Meeting or in any other such information or communication (which times may differ when more than one place is so specified) or, if no such time is specified, at any time prior to the holding of the relevant meeting or Adjourned Meeting at which the appointee proposes to vote, and, subject to the Act, if not so delivered the appointment shall not be treated as valid.   \n---|---  \n  \nC-25 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\n**BODIES CORPORATE ACTING BY REPRESENTATIVES AT MEETINGS**\n\n118. |  Any body corporate which is a member, or a proxy for a member, of the Company may by resolution of its directors or other governing body authorise such person or persons as it thinks fit to act as its representative or representatives at any meeting of the Company or of any class of members of the Company and, subject to evidence being furnished to the Company of such authority as the Directors may reasonably require, any person(s) so authorised shall be entitled to exercise the same powers on behalf of the body corporate which he represents as that body corporate could exercise if it were an individual member of the Company or, where more than one such representative is so authorized, all or any of the rights attached to the shares in respect of which he is so authorised. Where a body corporate appoints more than one representative in relation to a general meeting, each representative must be appointed to exercise the rights attached to different shares held by that body corporate.   \n---|---  \n  \n**RECEIPT OF PROXY APPOINTMENTS**\n\n119. |  Where the appointment of a proxy and any authority under which it is signed or a copy certified notarially or in some other way approved by the Directors is to be received by the Company:   \n---|---  \n119.1 |  in physical form, it shall be deposited at the Office or (at the option of the member) at such other place or places (if any) as may be specified for that purpose in or by way of note to the notice convening the meeting;   \n---|---  \n119.2 |  in electronic form, it may be so received where an address has been specified by the Company for the purpose of receiving electronic communications:   \n---|---  \n(a) |  in the notice convening the meeting; or   \n---|---  \n(b) |  in any appointment of proxy sent out by the Company in relation to the meeting; or   \n---|---  \n(c) |  in any invitation contained in an electronic communication to appoint a proxy issued by the Company in relation to the meeting;   \n---|---  \n  \nprovided that it is so received by the Company no later than 3 hours, or such other time as may be communicated to the members, before the time for holding the meeting or Adjourned Meeting or (in the case of a poll taken otherwise than at or on the same day as the meeting or Adjourned Meeting) for the taking of the poll at which it is to be used, at which the person named in the proxy proposes to vote and in default shall not be treated as valid or, in the case of a meeting which is adjourned to, or a poll which is to be taken on, a date not later than the record date applicable to the meeting which was adjourned or the poll, it shall be sufficient if the appointment of a proxy and any such authority and certification thereof as aforesaid is so received by the Company at the commencement of the Adjourned Meeting or the taking of the poll. An appointment of a proxy relating to more than one meeting (including any adjournment thereof) having once been so received for the purposes of any meeting shall not be required to be delivered, deposited or received again for the purposes of any subsequent meeting to which it relates. \n\n**EFFECT OF PROXY APPOINTMENTS**\n\n120.  \n---  \n120.1 |  Receipt by the Company of an appointment of a proxy in respect of a meeting shall not preclude a member from attending and voting at the meeting or at any adjournment thereof. However, if that member votes at the meeting or at any adjournment thereof, then as regards to the resolution(s) any proxy notice delivered to the Company by or on behalf of that same member shall on a poll, be invalid to the extent that such member votes in respect of the shares to which the proxy notice relates.   \n---|---  \n  \nC-26 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\n120.2 |  An appointment of a proxy shall be valid, unless the contrary is stated therein, as well for any adjournment of the meeting as for the meeting to which it relates and shall be deemed to confer authority to speak at a general meeting and to demand or join in demanding a poll.   \n---|---  \n121. |  A proxy shall have the right to exercise all or any of the rights of his appointor, or (where more than one proxy is appointed) all or any of the rights attached to the shares in respect of which he is appointed as the proxy to attend, and to speak and vote, at a general meeting of the Company. Unless his appointment provides otherwise, a proxy may vote or abstain at his discretion on any resolution put to the vote.   \n---|---  \n  \n**EFFECT OF REVOCATION OF PROXY OR OF AUTHORISATION**\n\n122. |  A vote given or poll demanded in accordance with the terms of an appointment of a proxy or a resolution authorising a representative to act on behalf of a body corporate shall be valid notwithstanding the previous death, insanity or winding up of the principal, or the revocation of the appointment of a proxy or of the authority under which the proxy was appointed or of the resolution authorising the representative to act or the transfer of the share in respect of which the proxy was appointed or the authorisation of the representative to act was given, provided that no notice in writing (whether in electronic form or otherwise) of such death, insanity, winding up, revocation or transfer is received by the Company at the Office before the commencement of the meeting.   \n---|---  \n123. |  The Directors may send to the members, at the expense of the Company, by post, electronic mail or otherwise, forms for the appointment of a proxy (with or without reply paid envelopes for their return) for use at any general meeting or at any class meeting, either in blank or nominating any one or more of the Directors or any other persons in the alternative. If, for the purpose of any meeting, invitations to appoint as proxy a person or one of a number of persons specified in the invitations are issued at the expense of the Company, such invitations shall be issued to all (and not to some only) of the members entitled to be sent a notice of the meeting and to vote thereat by proxy, but the accidental omission to issue such invitations to, or the non-receipt of such invitations by, any member shall not invalidate the proceedings at any such meeting.   \n---|---  \n  \n**THE BUSINESS OF GENERAL MEETINGS**\n\n124. |  All business shall be deemed to be special business that is transacted at an extraordinary general meeting or that is transacted at an annual general meeting other than, in the case of an annual general meeting, the business specified in Article 128 which shall be ordinary business.   \n---|---  \n125. |  At any meeting of the members, only such business shall be conducted as shall have been properly brought before such meeting. To be properly brought before an annual general meeting, business must be:   \n---|---  \n125.1 |  specified in the notice of meeting (or any supplement thereto) given by or at the direction of the Board;   \n---|---  \n125.2 |  otherwise properly brought before the meeting by or at the direction of the Board; or   \n---|---  \n125.3 |  otherwise properly brought before the meeting by a member.   \n---|---  \n126. |  Without prejudice to any procedure which may be permitted under the Act, for business to be properly brought before an annual general meeting by a member, the member must have given timely notice thereof in writing to the Company Secretary. To be timely, a member’s notice must be received not less than 60 days nor more than 90 days prior to the first anniversary of the preceding year’s annual general meeting; provided, however, that in the event that the date of the annual general meeting is advanced by more than 30 days or delayed by more than 60 days from such anniversary, notice by the member to be timely must be so received not earlier than the 90th day prior to such annual general meeting and not later than the close of   \n---|---  \n  \nC-27 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\nbusiness on the later of (i) the 60th day prior to such annual general meeting or (ii) the tenth day following the date on which notice of the date of the annual general meeting was mailed or public disclosure thereof was made by the Company, whichever event in this clause (ii) first occurs. For the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall the adjournment or postponement of any general meeting, or the public announcement of such an adjournment or postponement, commence a new time period (or extend any time period) for the giving of a member’s notice to the Company Secretary pursuant to this Article 126.

Any Director elected to fill a vacancy not resulting from an increase in the number of Directors shall have the same remaining term as that of his predecessor or if there is no such remaining term, the Director shall retire, and be eligible to stand for re-election, at the annual general meeting immediately following their appointment at which time, if reelected, the Director shall hold office for a term that shall coincide with the remaining term of that class.

The nomination and governance committee of the Board shall then consider the resignation offer and recommend to the Board whether to accept or reject the resignation, or whether other action should be taken; provided that any Director whose resignation is under consideration shall not participate in the nomination and governance committee’s recommendation regarding whether to accept, reject or take other action with respect to his/her resignation. The Board shall take action on the nomination and governance committee’s recommendation within 90 days following certification of the vote, and promptly thereafter publicly disclose its decision and the reasons therefor.   \n---|---  \n160. |  The Directors are not entitled to appoint alternate directors.   \n---|---  \n161. |  The Company may from time to time, by ordinary resolution, increase or reduce the number of Directors provided that any resolution to appoint a director approved by the members that would result in the maximum number of Directors being exceeded shall be deemed to constitute an ordinary resolution increasing the maximum number of Directors to the number that would be in office following such a resolution of appointment.   \n---|---  \n162. |  The Company may by ordinary resolution, appoint another person in place of a Director removed from office under section 146 of the Act and, without prejudice to the powers of the Directors under Article 158.7, the Company in a general meeting may appoint any person to be a Director either to fill a casual vacancy or as an additional Director.   \n---|---  \n  \n**DIRECTORS - MEMBER NOMINATIONS**\n\n163. |  The following are the requirements mentioned in Article 157 for the eligibility of a person (the “**person concerned** ”) for election as a Director at a general meeting, namely, any member entitled to vote in the election of Directors generally may nominate one or more persons for election as Directors at an annual general meeting only pursuant to the Company’s notice of such meeting or if written notice of such member’s intent to make such nomination or nominations has been received by the Company Secretary at the Company’s Office not less than 60 nor more than 90 days prior to the first anniversary of the preceding year’s annual general meeting; provided, however, that in the event that the date of the annual general meeting is more than 30 days before or more than 60 days after such anniversary, notice by the member to be timely must be so received not earlier than the 90th day prior to such annual general meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of (i) the 60th day prior to such annual general meeting and (ii) the 10th day following the day on which notice of the date of the annual general meeting was mailed or public disclosure thereof was made by the Company, whichever event in this clause (ii) first occurs.

For purposes of clarity, any Registration effected pursuant to _Section_ _2.2_ hereof shall not be counted as a Registration pursuant to a Demand Registration effected under _Section_ _2.1_ hereof. \n\n2.3 _Registrations on Form F-3_. Any Holder of Registrable Securities may at any time, and from time to time, request in writing that the Parent, pursuant to Rule 415 under the Securities Act (or any successor rule promulgated thereafter by the Commission), register the resale of any or all of their Registrable Securities on Form F-3 or any similar short form registration statement that may be available at such time (“** _Form F-3_**”); _provided_ , _however_ , that the Parent shall not be obligated to effect such request through an Underwritten Offering; _provided further, however_ , that following the filing of a resale registration statement on Form F-3, the Parent, at its option may effect a Demand Registration under _Section_ _2.1_ as a “take down” under such registration statement.

The Parent further covenant that they shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to take such further action as any Holder may reasonably request, all to the extent required from time to time to enable such Holder to sell the Parent Ordinary Shares held by such Holder without registration under the Securities Act within the limitation of the exemptions provided by Rule 144 promulgated under the Securities Act (or any successor rule promulgated thereafter by the Commission), including providing any legal opinions. Upon the request of any Holder, the Parent shall deliver to such Holder a written certification of a duly authorized officer as to whether it has complied with such requirements. \n\n3.6 _Limitation on Registration Rights_. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, (i) the IPO Underwriters may not exercise their rights under _Section_ _2.1_ or _2.2_ hereunder after five (5) and seven (7) years, \n\nE-12 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\nrespectively, after the effective date of the registration statement relating to the Parent’s initial public offering and (ii) no IPO Underwriter may exercise its rights under _Section_ _2.1_ more than once. \n\n**ARTICLE 4**\n\n**INDEMNIFICATION AND CONTRIBUTION**\n\n4.1 _Indemnification._\n\n4.1.1 The Parent agrees to indemnify, to the extent permitted by law, each Holder of Registrable Securities, its officers and directors and each person who controls such Holder (within the meaning of the Securities Act) against all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses (including attorneys’ fees) caused by any untrue or alleged untrue statement of material fact contained in any Registration Statement, Prospectus or preliminary Prospectus or any amendment thereof or supplement thereto or any omission or alleged omission of a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, except insofar as the same are caused by or contained in any information furnished in writing to the Parent by such Holder expressly for use therein. The Parent shall indemnify the Underwriters, their officers and directors and each person who controls such Underwriters (within the meaning of the Securities Act) to the same extent as provided in the foregoing with respect to the indemnification of the Holder. \n\n4.1.2 In connection with any Registration Statement in which a Holder of Registrable Securities is participating, such Holder shall furnish to the Parent in writing such information and affidavits as the Parent reasonably requests for use in connection with any such Registration Statement or Prospectus and, to the extent permitted by law, shall indemnify the Parent, its directors and officers and agents and each person who controls the Parent (within the meaning of the Securities Act) against any losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses (including without limitation reasonable attorneys’ fees) resulting from any untrue statement of material fact contained in the Registration Statement, Prospectus or preliminary Prospectus or any amendment thereof or supplement thereto or any omission of a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, but only to the extent that such untrue statement or omission is contained in any information or affidavit so furnished in writing by such Holder expressly for use therein. The Holders of Registrable Securities shall indemnify the Underwriters, their officers, directors and each person who controls such Underwriters (within the meaning of the Securities Act) to the same extent as provided in the foregoing with respect to indemnification of the Parent. For the avoidance of doubt, the obligation to indemnify under this Section 4.1.2 shall be several, not joint and several, among the Holders of Registrable Securities, and the total indemnification liability of a Holder under this Section 4.1.2 shall be in proportion to and limited to the net proceeds received by such Holder from the sale of Registrable Securities pursuant to such Registration Statement. \n\n4.1.3 Any person entitled to indemnification herein shall (i) give prompt written notice to the indemnifying party of any claim with respect to which it seeks indemnification (provided that the failure to give prompt notice shall not impair any person’s right to indemnification hereunder to the extent such failure has not materially prejudiced the indemnifying party) and (ii) unless in such indemnified party’s reasonable judgment a conflict of interest between such indemnified and indemnifying parties may exist with respect to such claim, permit such indemnifying party to assume the defense of such claim with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party. If such defense is assumed, the indemnifying party shall not be subject to any liability for any settlement made by the indemnified party without its consent (but such consent shall not be unreasonably withheld). An indemnifying party who is not entitled to, or elects not to, assume the defense of a claim shall not be obligated to pay the fees and expenses of more than one counsel (plus local counsel) for all parties indemnified by such indemnifying party with respect to such claim, unless in the reasonable judgment of any indemnified party a conflict of interest may exist between such indemnified party and any other of such indemnified parties with respect to such claim. No indemnifying party shall, without the consent of the indemnified party, consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement which cannot be settled in all respects by the payment of money (and such money is so paid by the indemnifying party pursuant to the terms of \n\nE-13 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\nsuch settlement) or which settlement does not include as an unconditional term thereof the giving by the claimant or plaintiff to such indemnified party of a release from all liability in respect to such claim or litigation. \n\n4.1.4 The indemnification provided for under this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of the indemnified party or any officer, director or controlling person of such indemnified party and shall survive the transfer of securities. \n\n4.1.5 If the indemnification provided under _Section_ _4.1_ hereof from the indemnifying party is unavailable or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party in respect of any losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses referred to herein, then the indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying the indemnified party, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by the indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the indemnifying party and the indemnified party, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative fault of the indemnifying party and indemnified party shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any action in question, including any untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact, was made by, or relates to information supplied by, such indemnifying party or indemnified party, and the indemnifying party’s and indemnified party’s relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such action; _provided_ , _however_ , that the liability of any Holder under this _subsection 4.1.5_ shall be limited to the amount of the net proceeds received by such Holder in such offering giving rise to such liability. The amount paid or payable by a party as a result of the losses or other liabilities referred to above shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth in _subsections 4.1.1_ , _4.1.2_ and _4.1.3_ above, any legal or other fees, charges or expenses reasonably incurred by such party in connection with any investigation or proceeding. The parties hereto agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this _subsection 4.1.5_ were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation, which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in this _subsection 4.1.5_. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of _Section_ _11(f)_ of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution pursuant to this _subsection 4.1.5_ from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. \n\n**ARTICLE 5**\n\n**MISCELLANEOUS**\n\n5.1 _Notices_.

Any transfer or assignment made other than as provided in this _Section_ _5.2_ shall be null and void. \n\n5.3 _Counterparts; Electronic Signatures_. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each of which when so executed shall be deemed to be an original and all of which when taken together shall constitute one and the same instrument. The words “execution,” signed,” “signature,” and words of like import in this Agreement or in any other certificate, agreement or document related to this Agreement shall include images of manually executed signatures transmitted by facsimile or other electronic format (including, without limitation, “pdf”, “tif” or “jpg”) and other electronic signatures (including, without limitation, DocuSign and AdobeSign). The use of electronic signatures and electronic records (including, without limitation, any contract or other record created, generated, sent, communicated, received, or stored by electronic means) shall be of the same legal effect, validity and enforceability as a manually executed signature or use of a paper-based record-keeping system to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, including the Federal Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act, the New York State Electronic Signatures and Records Act and any other applicable law, including, without limitation, any state law based on the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act or the Uniform Commercial Code. \n\n5.4 _Governing Law; Venue_.

Upon the written consent of the Parent and the Holders of at least a majority in interest of the Registrable Securities at the time in question, compliance with any of the provisions, covenants and conditions set forth in this Agreement may be waived, or any of such provisions, covenants or conditions may be amended or modified; _provided_ , _however_ , that notwithstanding the foregoing, any amendment hereto or waiver hereof that adversely affects one Holder, solely in its capacity as a holder of share capital of the Parent, in a manner that is materially different from the other Holders (in such capacity) shall require the consent of the Holder so affected, and any amendment or waiver hereof that adversely affects the Original Holders shall require the written consent of Original Holders of at least a majority in interest of the Registrable Securities of such Original Holders at the time in question, and any amendment or waiver hereof that adversely affects the Additional Holders shall require the written consent of Original Holders of at least a majority in interest of the Registrable Securities of such Additional Holders at the time in question.

EACH PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHTS TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION BROUGHT TO RESOLVE ANY DISPUTE BETWEEN OR AMONG ANY OF THE PARTIES (WHETHER ARISING IN CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF, CONNECTED WITH, RELATED OR INCIDENTAL TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT AND/OR THE RELATIONSHIPS ESTABLISHED AMONG THE PARTIES UNDER THIS AGREEMENT. THE PARTIES FURTHER WARRANT AND REPRESENT THAT EACH HAS REVIEWED THIS WAIVER WITH SUCH PARTY’S LEGAL COUNSEL, AND THAT EACH KNOWINGLY AND VOLUNTARILY WAIVES SUCH PARTY’S JURY TRIAL RIGHTS FOLLOWING CONSULTATION WITH LEGAL COUNSEL. Each of the Parties submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of first, the Chancery Court of the State of Delaware or if such court declines jurisdiction, then to the Federal District Court for the District of Delaware, in any Action arising out of or relating to this Agreement, agrees that all claims in respect of the Action shall be heard and determined in any such court and agrees not to bring any Action arising out of or relating to this Agreement in any other courts. Each Party irrevocably consents to the service of process in any such Action by the mailing of copies thereof by registered or certified mail, postage prepaid, to such Party, at its address for notices as provided in _Section_ _2.4_ of this Agreement, such service to become effective ten (10) days after such mailing. Each Party hereby irrevocably waives any objection to such service of process and further irrevocably waives and agrees not to plead or claim in any Action commenced hereunder or under any other documents contemplated hereby that service of process was in any way invalid or ineffective. Nothing in this _Section_ _2.5_ , however, shall affect the right of any Party to serve \n\nF-6 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\nlegal process in any other manner permitted by Law or at equity; provided, that each of the Parties hereby waives any right it may have under the Laws of any jurisdiction to commence by publication any Action with respect to this Agreement. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, each of the Parties hereby irrevocably waives any objection it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any Action arising out of or relating to this Agreement in any of the courts referred to in this _Section_ _2.5_ and hereby further irrevocably waives and agrees not to plead or claim that any such court is not a convenient forum for any such Action. Each Party agrees that a final judgment in any Action so brought shall be conclusive and may be enforced by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by Law or at equity, in any jurisdiction. \n\nSection 2.6 _Specific Performance_. Each Party hereby agrees and acknowledges that it will be impossible to measure in money the damages that would be suffered if the Parties fail to comply with any of the obligations imposed on them by this Agreement and that, in the event of any such failure, an aggrieved Party will be irreparably damaged and will not have an adequate remedy at Law. Any such Party shall, therefore, be entitled (in addition to any other remedy to which such Party may be entitled at Law or in equity) to seek injunctive relief, including specific performance, to enforce such obligations, without the posting of any bond, and if any Action should be brought in equity to enforce any of the provisions of this Agreement, none of the Parties shall raise the defense that there is an adequate remedy at Law. \n\nSection 2.7 _Subsequent Acquisition of Shares_. Any Shares acquired subsequent to the Effective Date by a Party shall be subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement. In the event of any stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization, reorganization or the like, any securities issued with respect to the Shares held by the Holders shall become “Shares” for purposes of voting or providing a written consent or proxy, if applicable, pursuant to _Section_ _1.1_. \n\nSection 2.8 _Not a Group; Independent Nature of the Holders’ Obligations and Rights_. The Shareholders and each assignee thereof who becomes a Party to this Agreement (each, a “** _Holder_** ”) agree that the arrangements contemplated by this Agreement are not intended to constitute the formation of a “group” (as defined in Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act). Each Holder agrees that, for purposes of determining beneficial ownership of such Holder, it shall disclaim any beneficial ownership by virtue of this Agreement of the Company’s Shares owned by the other Holders. The obligations of each Holder under this Agreement are several and not joint with the obligations of any other Holder, and no Holder shall be responsible in any way for the performance of the obligations of any other Holder under this Agreement. Nothing contained herein, and no action taken by any Holder pursuant hereto, shall be deemed to constitute the Holders as a partnership, an association, a joint venture or any other kind of group or entity, or create a presumption that the Holders are in any way acting in concert or as a group or entity with respect to such obligations or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The decision of each Holder to enter into this Agreement has been made by such Holder independently of any other Holder. Each Holder acknowledges that no other Holder has acted as agent for such Holder in connection with such Holder making its investment in the Company and that no other Holder will be acting as agent of such Holder in connection with monitoring such Holder’s investment in the Shares or enforcing its rights under this Agreement. Each Holder confirms that each Holder has had the opportunity to independently participate with the Company and its subsidiaries in the negotiation of the transaction contemplated hereby with the advice of its own counsel and advisors. Each Holder shall be entitled to independently protect and enforce its rights, including, without limitation, the rights arising out of this Agreement, and it shall not be necessary for any other Holder to be joined as an additional party in any proceeding for such purpose. \n\nSection 2.9 _Assignment; Successors and Assigns; No Third Party Beneficiaries_. \n\n(a) Except as otherwise permitted pursuant to this Agreement, no Party may assign such Party’s rights and obligations under this Agreement, in whole or in part, without the prior written consent of the SMX Holders and the Lionheart Holders; provided, however, that each Party hereto may assign its rights and obligations under this Agreement in connection with the permitted transfer of its Shares by having the transferee of such Shares \n\nF-7 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\nexecute a joinder to this Agreement agreeing to be bound by the terms hereof.

The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon the successors in interest of any Holder with respect to any of such Holder’s Shares or any voting rights therein, unless the Shares are sold pursuant to a Permitted Sale. \n\n(d) This Agreement shall terminate automatically (without any action by any Party) as to each Holder when such Party, following the Closing Date, ceases to beneficially own any Shares, provided that such shares have been transferred in a manner permitted by this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in the event the BCA terminates in accordance with its terms prior to the Closing, this Agreement shall automatically terminate and be of no further force or effect, without any further action required by the Parties. \n\n(e) Nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to confer upon any Person, other than the Parties and their respective permitted successors, assigns, heirs and representatives, any rights or remedies under this Agreement or otherwise create any third-party beneficiary hereto. \n\nSection 2.10 _Power of Attorney_. During the Term, in the event a Holder does not (i) attend in person a meeting of the shareholders of the Company at which directors shall be elected to the Board or timely submit a proxy card for such meeting and (ii) in each case vote such Holder’s Shares in favor of the election of all of directors as required by this Agreement, the Holder hereby appoints the chairperson of the Board as its true and lawful attorney and proxy with full power of substitution for and its name to act on behalf of the Holder, for the limited purpose of voting in favor of the election of the directors as required by this Agreement. The Holder understands and agrees that this limited proxy is irrevocable and coupled with an interest and, except as otherwise provided herein, shall terminate upon the termination of this Agreement. \n\n_[Signature Pages Follow]_\n\nF-8 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF, each of the Parties has duly executed this Agreement as of the Effective Date. \n\n**EMPATAN PUBLIC LIMITED COMPANY**  \n---  \nBy:  \nName:  \nTitle:  \n**SHAREHOLDERS:**  \n[ ]  \nBy:  \nName:  \nTitle:  \nAddress for Notice:   \n  \nF-9 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\n**ANNEX G - FORM OF LOCK-UP AGREEMENT **\n\nTHIS LOCK-UP AGREEMENT (this “ _Agreement_ ”) is dated as of [ ], 2022, by and between the undersigned (the “ _Holder_ ”) and Empatan Public Limited Company, a public limited company incorporated in Ireland with registered number 722009 (the “ _Company_ ”). \n\nCapitalized terms used, but not otherwise defined herein, shall have the meanings ascribed to such terms in the Business Combination Agreement, dated as of [ ], 2022 (the “ _BCA_ ”) by and among Security Matters Limited, an Australian public company with Australian Company Number (CAN) 626 192 998 listed on the Australian Stock Exchange (“ _SMX_ ”), Lionheart III Corp, a Delaware corporation, the Company, and Aryeh Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. \n\n**_BACKGROUND_**\n\nA.

You have also requested our opinion as to whether the fair market value of the equity of SMX equals or exceeds 80% of the amount held by the Company in trust for benefit of its public stockholders (excluding any deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on the income earned on the trust account). \n\nIn arriving at our opinion, we have, among other things: (i) reviewed certain internal information relating to the business, earnings, cash flow, assets, liabilities and prospects of SMX furnished to us by the Company, including financial and other forecasts provided to, or discussed with us by the management of the Company and the management of SMX; (ii) reviewed certain internal information relating to expenses expected to result from the Transaction furnished to us by the Company; (iii) conducted discussions with members of the management and representatives of the Company and of SMX concerning the information described in clauses (i) and (ii); (iv) reviewed the Company’s and SMX’ capital structure furnished to us by the management of the Company both on a standalone basis pre-Transaction and on a pro forma basis giving effect to the Transaction; (v) reviewed publicly available financial and stock market data of certain other companies in lines of business that we deemed relevant; (vi) reviewed a draft, dated July 24, 2022 of the Agreement; and (vii) conducted such other financial studies and analyses and took into account such other information as we deemed appropriate. \n\nIn connection with our review, we have, with your consent, relied on the information supplied to, discussed with or reviewed by us for purposes of this opinion being complete and accurate in all material respects. We have not assumed any responsibility for independent verification of, and have not independently verified, any of such information. With your consent, we have relied upon, without independent verification, the assessment of the Company and its legal, tax, regulatory and accounting advisors with respect to legal, tax, regulatory and accounting matters. In addition, we have relied, with your consent, on the assessments of the management of the \n\nH-1 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\nCompany as to the existing technology, products and services of SMX and the validity of, and risks associated with, the future technology, products and services of SMX.

In addition, we have relied, with your consent, on the assessments of the management of the Company as to the Company’s ability to retain key employees of SMX. We express no views as to the reasonableness of any financial or other forecasts or the assumptions on which they are based. In addition, with your consent, we have not made any independent evaluation or appraisal of any of the assets or liabilities (contingent, derivative, off-balance-sheet, or otherwise) of SMX or the Company, nor have we been furnished with any such evaluation or appraisal. \n\nOur opinion does not address the Company’s underlying business decision to effect the Transaction or the relative merits of the Transaction as compared to any alternative business strategies or transactions that might be available to the Company and does not address any legal, regulatory, tax, or accounting matters. At your direction, we have not been asked to, nor do we, offer any opinion as to any terms of the Agreement or any aspect or implication of the Transaction, except for the fairness of the Consideration in the Transaction from a financial point of view to the Company. With your consent, we express no opinion as to what the value of the shares of Empatan will be when issued pursuant to the Transaction. We are not expressing any opinion as to fair value or the solvency of SMX, Empatan or the Company following the closing of the Transaction. In rendering this opinion, we have assumed, with your consent, that the final executed form of the Agreement will not differ in any material respect from the draft that we have reviewed, that the Transaction, including a possible PIPE Financing, will be consummated in accordance with its terms without any waiver or modification that could be material to our analysis, and that the parties to the Agreement will comply with all the material terms of the Agreement. We have assumed, with your consent, that all governmental, regulatory, or other consents and approvals necessary for the completion of the Transaction will be obtained except to the extent that could not be material to our analysis. In addition, representatives of the Company have advised us, and we have assumed, with your consent, that the Transaction will qualify as a tax free reorganization for income tax purposes in the United States, Australia, and Ireland. We also have not been requested to, and have not, participated in the structuring or negotiation of the Transaction. \n\nOur opinion is necessarily based on economic, monetary, market and other conditions as in effect on, and the information made available to us as of, the date hereof, and we assume no responsibility to update this opinion for developments after the date hereof. \n\nWe have been engaged by the Company to render this opinion and will earn a fee upon delivery of this opinion, which fee is not contingent upon either the conclusion expressed in this opinion or the consummation of the Transaction. Our affiliates, employees, officers, and partners may at any time own securities (long or short) of the Company and SMX. In the future we may provide investment banking or other services to Empatan, the Company, SMX or their respective affiliates and may receive compensation for such services. \n\nThis opinion is for the use and benefit of the Board of Directors of the Company (solely in its capacity as such) in its evaluation of the Transaction. This opinion does not constitute a recommendation as to how any holder of securities should vote or act with respect to the Transaction or any other matter. This opinion does not address the fairness of the Transaction or any aspect or implication thereof to, or any other consideration of or relating to, the holders of any class of securities, creditors, or other constituencies of Empatan, the Company or SMX. In addition, we do not express any opinion as to the fairness of the amount or nature of any compensation to be received by any officers, directors, or employees of any parties to the Transaction, or any class of such persons, whether relative to the Consideration or otherwise. This opinion was approved by the Scura Partners LLC fairness opinion committee. \n\nH-2 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\nBased upon and subject to the foregoing, it is our opinion that, as the date hereof, (i) the Consideration in the Transaction is fair from a financial point of view to the Company and (ii) the fair market value of the SMX equals or exceeds 80% of the amount held by the Company in trust for benefit of its public stockholders (excluding any deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on interest earned on the trust account). \n\nVery truly yours, \n\n/s/ Scura Partners LLC \n\nScura Partners LLC \n\nH-3 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\n**ANNEX I – LIST OF RELEVANT TERRITORIES**\n\n_List of Relevant Territories for the Purposes of Irish Dividend Withholding Tax_\n\n1. |  The Republic of Albania   \n---|---  \n2. |  The Republic of Armenia   \n---|---  \n3. |  Australia   \n---|---  \n4. |  The Republic of Austria   \n---|---  \n5. |  The Kingdom of Bahrain   \n---|---  \n6. |  The Republic of Belarus   \n---|---  \n7. |  Belgium   \n---|---  \n8. |  Bosnia and Herzegovina   \n---|---  \n9. |  The Republic of Botswana   \n---|---  \n10. |  The Republic of Bulgaria   \n---|---  \n11. |  Canada   \n---|---  \n12. |  The Republic of Chile   \n---|---  \n13. |  The People’s Republic of China   \n---|---  \n14. |  The Republic of Croatia   \n---|---  \n15. |  Cyprus   \n---|---  \n16. |  Czech Republic   \n---|---  \n17. |  The Kingdom of Denmark   \n---|---  \n18. |  The Arab Republic of Egypt   \n---|---  \n19. |  The Republic of Estonia   \n---|---  \n20. |  The Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia   \n---|---  \n21. |  Finland   \n---|---  \n22. |  France   \n---|---  \n23. |  Georgia   \n---|---  \n24. |  The Federal Republic of Germany   \n---|---  \n25. |  The Republic of Ghana   \n---|---  \n26. |  The Hellenic Republic (Greece)   \n---|---  \n27. |  Hong Kong   \n---|---  \n28. |  The Republic of Hungary   \n---|---  \n29. |  The Republic of Iceland   \n---|---  \n30. |  The Republic of India   \n---|---  \n31. |  The State of Israel   \n---|---  \n32. |  Italy   \n---|---  \n33. |  Japan   \n---|---  \n  \nI-1 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\n34. |  The Republic of Kazakhstan   \n---|---  \n35. |  The Republic of Kenya   \n---|---  \n36. |  The Republic of Korea   \n---|---  \n37. |  The Republic of Kosovo   \n---|---  \n38. |  The State of Kuwait   \n---|---  \n39. |  The Republic of Latvia   \n---|---  \n40. |  The Republic of Lithuania   \n---|---  \n41. |  The Grand Duchy of Luxembourg   \n---|---  \n42. |  The Republic of Macedonia (now the Republic of North Macedonia)   \n---|---  \n43. |  Malaysia   \n---|---  \n44. |  Malta   \n---|---  \n45. |  The United Mexican States (Mexico)   \n---|---  \n46. |  The Republic of Moldova   \n---|---  \n47. |  Montenegro   \n---|---  \n48. |  The Kingdom of Morocco   \n---|---  \n49. |  The Kingdom of the Netherlands   \n---|---  \n50. |  New Zealand   \n---|---  \n51. |  The Kingdom of Norway   \n---|---  \n52. |  The Islamic Republic of Pakistan   \n---|---  \n53. |  The Republic of Panama   \n---|---  \n54. |  The Republic of Poland   \n---|---  \n55. |  Portuguese Republic   \n---|---  \n56. |  State of Qatar   \n---|---  \n57. |  Romania   \n---|---  \n58. |  Russian Federation   \n---|---  \n59. |  Kingdom of Saudi Arabia   \n---|---  \n60. |  The Republic of Serbia   \n---|---  \n61. |  The Republic of Singapore   \n---|---  \n62. |  Slovak Republic   \n---|---  \n63. |  The Republic of Slovenia   \n---|---  \n64. |  The Republic of South Africa   \n---|---  \n65. |  Kingdom of Spain   \n---|---  \n66. |  Sweden   \n---|---  \n67. |  Switzerland   \n---|---  \n68. |  Kingdom of Thailand   \n---|---  \n  \nI-2 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\n69. |  The Republic of Turkey   \n---|---  \n70. |  United Kingdom   \n---|---  \n71. |  Ukraine   \n---|---  \n72. |  United Arab Emirates   \n---|---  \n73. |  The Republic of Uzbekistan   \n---|---  \n74. |  United States of America   \n---|---  \n75. |  The Socialist Republic of Vietnam   \n---|---  \n76. |  The Republic of Zambia   \n---|---  \n  \nI-3 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\n**Annex J**\n\n**_Final Form_**\n\n**SMX PUBLIC LIMITED COMPANY**\n\n**2022 INCENTIVE EQUITY PLAN**\n\n**1.** |  **PURPOSE**  \n---|---  \n  \nThe Plan is intended to enhance the Company’s and its Affiliates’ ability to attract and retain employees, Consultants and Non-Employee Directors, and to motivate such employees, Consultants and Non-Employee Directors to serve the Company and its Affiliates and to expend maximum effort to improve the business results and earnings of the Company, by providing to such persons an opportunity to acquire or increase a direct proprietary interest in the operations and future success of the Company.

All determinations made by the Board will be conclusive, final and binding on all parties concerned, including the Company, its stockholders, any Grantees and any other Service Providers of the Company and its Affiliates, and their respective successors in interest. \n\n**3.1.3.** **Committee Authority.** The Committee will administer the Plan, provided that the Board will retain the right to exercise the authority of the Committee to the extent consistent with applicable law and the \n\nJ-5 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\napplicable requirements of any securities exchange on which the Shares may then be listed. The Board will have the power and authority to delegate its powers and responsibilities under the Plan to the Committee, which will have full authority to act in accordance with its charter, and with respect to the authority of the Board to act under the Plan, all references to the Board will be deemed to include a reference to the Committee, to the extent such power or responsibilities have been delegated. \n\n**3.1.4.** **Other Delegation**. To the extent permitted by applicable law, the Board may delegate its authority as identified in the Plan to any individual or committee of individuals (who need not be directors), including the authority to make Awards to Grantees who are not subject to Exchange Act § 16. To the extent that the Board delegates its authority to make Awards as provided by this **Section****3.1.4** , all references in the Plan to the Board’s authority to make Awards and determinations with respect thereto will be deemed to include the Board’s delegate. Any such delegate will serve at the pleasure of, and may be removed at any time by the Board. \n\n**3.2.** **No Repricing****.** Notwithstanding any other term or condition of the Plan, the repricing of Options is prohibited without prior approval of the Shareholders. For this purpose, a “repricing” means (1) changing an Option to lower its Option Price, (2) any other action that is treated as a “repricing” under IFRS, (3) repurchasing for cash or canceling an Option at a time when its Option Price is greater than the Fair Market Value of the underlying Shares in exchange for another Award or (4) any other action that has the same effect as clauses (1), (2) or (3), unless the actions contemplated in clauses (1), (2), or (3) occur in connection with a change in capitalization or similar change under **Section****13**. A cancellation and exchange under clause (3) would be considered a “repricing” regardless of whether it is treated as a “repricing” under IFRS and regardless of whether it is voluntary on the part of the Grantee. \n\n**3.3. Separation from Service, Clawbacks and Detrimental Conduct.**\n\n**3.3.1.** **Separation from Service.** Unless otherwise provided under an Award Agreement and to the extent permitted under applicable law, if a Grantee incurs a Separation from Service, the Grantee will forfeit, and the Company will annul and cancel, the unvested portion of any Award, without consideration. \n\n**3.3.2.** **Clawbacks.** Unless otherwise provided under an Award Agreement, all Awards, amounts or benefits received or outstanding under the Plan will be subject to clawback, cancellation, recoupment, rescission, payback, reduction or other similar action in accordance with any Company clawback or similar policy or any applicable law related to such actions. A Grantee’s acceptance of an Award will be deemed to constitute (1) the Grantee’s acknowledgement of and consent to the Company’s application, implementation and enforcement of any applicable Company clawback or similar policy that may apply to the Grantee, whether adopted before or after the Effective Date, and any applicable law relating to clawback, cancellation, recoupment, rescission, payback or reduction of compensation, and (2) the Grantee’s agreement that the Company may take any actions that may be necessary to effectuate any such policy or applicable law, without further consideration or action. \n\n**3.3.3.** **Detrimental Conduct.** Except as otherwise provided by the Board, notwithstanding any other term or condition of the Plan, if a Grantee engages in Detrimental Conduct, whether during the Grantee’s service or after the Grantee’s Separation from Service for any reason, in addition to any other penalties or restrictions that may apply under the Plan, applicable law or otherwise, the Grantee will forfeit or pay back to the Company, as applicable, (1) any and all outstanding Awards granted to the Grantee, including Awards that have become vested or exercisable, (2) any cash or Shares received by the Grantee in connection with the Plan within the 36-month period immediately before the date the Company determines the Grantee has engaged in Detrimental Conduct and (3) the profit realized by the Grantee from the sale or other disposition for consideration of any Shares received by the Grantee in connection with the Plan within the 36-month period immediately before the date the Company determines the Grantee has engaged in Detrimental Conduct. \n\n**3.4.** **Deferral Arrangement.** The Board may permit or require the deferral of any Award payment into a deferred compensation arrangement, subject to such rules and procedures as it may establish and in accordance \n\nJ-6 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\nwith Code § 409A, which may include terms and conditions for the payment or crediting of interest or dividend equivalents, including converting such credits into deferred units. \n\n**3.5.** **No Liability.** No member of the Board will be liable for any action or determination made in good faith with respect to the Plan, any Award or Award Agreement. \n\n**3.6.** **Book Entry.** Notwithstanding any other term or condition of the Plan, the Company may elect to satisfy any requirement under the Plan for the delivery of certificates through the registry of Shareholders or use of book-entry. \n\n**4.** |  **SHARES SUBJECT TO THE PLAN**  \n---|---  \n  \n**4.1.** **Authorized Number of Shares****.** Subject to adjustment under **Section****13** , the initial number of Shares authorized to be awarded under the Plan will be [ ],1 of which [ ]2 Shares available for issuance under the Plan shall be available for issuance as ISOs. Shares issued under the Plan will consist in whole or in part of authorized but unissued Shares, treasury Shares or Shares purchased on the open market or otherwise, all as determined by the Board from time to time. At all times, the Company will reserve and keep available a sufficient number of Shares as will be required to satisfy the requirements of all Awards granted and outstanding under this Plan. \n\n**4.1.1** **Automatic Increases.** The aggregate number of Shares authorized to be awarded under Section 4.1 will automatically increase on January 1 of each year, for a period of not more than ten (10) years, commencing on January 1 of the year following the year in which the Effective Date occurs and ending on (and including) January 1, 2032, in an amount equal to five percent (5%) of the total number of Shares outstanding on December 31 of the immediately preceding calendar year, excluding for this purpose any such outstanding Shares that were granted under the Plan and remain nonvested and subject to forfeiture as of the relevant December 31. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Board may act prior to January 1 of a given year to provide that there will be no January 1 increase for such year or that the increase for such year will be a lesser number of Shares than provided herein. \n\n**4.2. Share Counting.**\n\n**4.2.1.** **General.** Each Share granted in connection with an Award will be counted as one Share against the limit in **Section****4.1** , subject to this **Section****4.2**. Share-based Performance Awards will be counted assuming maximum performance results (if applicable) until such time as actual performance results can be determined. \n\n**4.2.2.** **Expired or Terminated Awards****.** If any Award expires or is terminated, surrendered or forfeited, in whole or in part, the unissued Shares covered by that Award will again be available for the grant of Awards. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Share that is surrendered, forfeited or otherwise disposed of pursuant to **Section****10 or 15.3** will not again become available for the grant of Awards. \n\n**4.2.3.** **Substitute Awards.** In the case of any Substitute Award, such Substitute Award will not be counted against the number of Shares reserved under the Plan. \n\n**5.** |  **EFFECTIVE DATE, DURATION, AND AMENDMENTS**  \n---|---  \n  \n**5.1.** **Term.** The Plan will be effective as of the Effective Date, provided that it has been approved by the Board and Shareholders. The Plan will terminate automatically on the Termination Date and may be terminated on any earlier date as provided in **Section****5.2**. \n\n1 |  NTD: 15% of the outstanding.   \n---|---  \n2 |  NTD: 15% of the outstanding.   \n---|---  \n  \nJ-7 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\n**5.2.** **Amendment and Termination of the Plan****.** The Board may, at any time and from time to time, amend, suspend or terminate the Plan or any Sub-Plan in accordance with this Section 5.2. An amendment will be contingent on approval of the Shareholders to the extent stated by the Board, required by applicable law or required by applicable securities exchange listing requirements. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any amendment to **Section****3.2** will be contingent on the approval of the Shareholders. No Awards may be granted after the Termination Date. The applicable terms and conditions of the Plan and any terms and conditions applicable to Awards granted before the Termination Date will survive the termination of the Plan and continue to apply to such Awards. No amendment, suspension or termination of the Plan or any Sub-Plan will, without the consent of the Grantee, materially impair such Grantee’s rights under any Award previously awarded, except to the extent made to comply with applicable law or rule of any securities exchange or market on which the Shares are listed or admitted for trading or to prevent adverse tax or accounting consequences to the Company or the Grantee. \n\n**6.** |  **AWARD ELIGIBILITY AND LIMITATIONS**  \n---|---  \n  \n**6.1.** **Service Providers****.** Awards may be made to any Service Provider as the Board may determine and designate from time to time. \n\n**6.2.** **Successive Awards.** A Service Provider may receive more than one Award, subject to such restrictions as are provided in the Plan and the Award Agreement. \n\n**6.3.** **Stand-Alone, Additional, Tandem and Substitute Awards.** The Board may grant Awards either alone or in addition to, in tandem with, or, subject to **Section****3.2** , in substitution or exchange for, any other Award or any award granted under another plan of the Company, any Affiliate or any business entity to be acquired by the Company or an Affiliate, or any other right of a Grantee to receive payment from the Company or any Affiliate. Such additional, tandem and substitute or exchange Awards may be granted at any time. If an Award is granted in substitution or exchange for another Award, the Board will have the right to require the surrender of such other Award in consideration for the grant of the new Award. In addition, to the extent permitted under applicable law, Awards may be granted in lieu of cash compensation, including in lieu of cash amounts payable under other plans of the Company or any Affiliate, in which the value of Shares subject to the Award is equivalent in value to the cash compensation. \n\n**7.** |  **AWARD AGREEMENT**  \n---|---  \n  \nEach Award will be evidenced by an Award Agreement, in such forms as the Board will from time to time determine. Without limiting the foregoing, an Award Agreement may be provided in the form of a notice that provides, subject to applicable law, that acceptance of the Award constitutes acceptance of all terms and conditions of the Plan and the notice. Award Agreements granted from time to time or at the same time need not contain similar terms and conditions but will be consistent with the terms and conditions of the Plan. Each Award Agreement evidencing an Award of Options will specify whether such Options are intended to be NSOs or ISOs, and in the absence of such specification such Options will be deemed to be NSOs. \n\n**8.** |  **TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF OPTIONS**  \n---|---  \n  \n**8.1.** **Option Price.** The Option Price of each Option will be fixed by the Board and stated in the related Award Agreement. The Option Price of each Option (except those that constitute Substitute Awards) will be at least the Fair Market Value on the Grant Date of a Share or, to the extent set forth in the applicable Award Agreement, any other Option Price established by—or upon approval by—the Shareholders. In no case will the Option Price of any Option be less than the nominal value of each Share, being $0.0001 per Share as at the Effective Date. If a Grantee is a 10% Shareholder as of the Grant Date, the Option Price of an Option granted to such Grantee that is intended to be an ISO will be not less than 110% of the Fair Market Value of a Share on the Grant Date. \n\nJ-8 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\n**8.2.** **Vesting.** Subject to **Section****8.3** , each Option will become vested and exercisable at such times and under such terms and conditions (including performance requirements) as may be determined by the Board and stated in the Award Agreement.The Board may, but shall not be required to, provide for an acceleration of vesting and/or exercisability in the terms of any Award Agreement upon the occurrence of a specified event or at any other time after the Grant Date of the Award. \n\n**8.3.** **Term****.** Each Option will terminate, and all rights to subscribe for Shares thereunder will cease, upon the expiration of a period not to exceed ten years from the Grant Date or under such circumstances and on any date before ten years from the Grant Date as may be set forth in the Plan or as may be fixed by the Board and stated in the Award Agreement, unless terminated earlier in accordance with Section 3.3 above. If the Grantee is a 10% Shareholder, an Option granted to such Grantee that is intended to be an ISO at the Grant Date will not be exercisable after the expiration of five years from its Grant Date. \n\n**8.4.** **Limitations on Exercise of Option.** Notwithstanding any other term or condition of the Plan, in no event may any Option be exercised, in whole or in part, before the date the Plan is approved by the Board and Shareholders as provided in the Plan or after the occurrence of an event that results in termination of the Option. \n\n**8.5.** **Method of Exercise.** A vested Option may be exercised by the Grantee’s delivery of a notice of exercise to the Company, setting forth the number of Shares with respect to which the Option is to be exercised, accompanied by full payment for the Shares being subscribed for and any applicable taxes. To be effective, notice of exercise must be made in accordance with procedures established by the Board from time to time, and Shares will only be issued and delivered upon receipt of payment. \n\n**8.6.** **Rights of Holders of Options.** An individual holding or exercising an Option will have none of the rights of a Shareholder (for example, the right to receive cash or dividend payments or distributions attributable to the subject Shares or to direct the voting of the subject Shares) until full payment is received in accordance with Section 8.5 above and the Shares covered thereby are issued to such individual as evidenced by the appropriate entry on the books of the Company or of a duly authorized transfer agent or depositary of the Company. Except as provided in **Section****13** or the related Award Agreement, no adjustment will be made for dividends, distributions or other rights for which the record date is before the date of such Share issuance. \n\n**8.7.** **Limitations on Incentive Stock Options.** An Option will constitute an ISO only (1) if the Grantee of the Option is an employee of the Company or of its current or hereafter existing “parent corporation” or “subsidiary corporation,”as defined in Code §§ 424(e) and (f), respectively, and (2) to the extent that the aggregate Fair Market Value (determined at the time the Option is granted) of the Shares with respect to which all ISOs held by such Grantee become exercisable for the first time during any calendar year (under the Plan and all other plans of the Grantee’s employer and its Affiliates) does not exceed US$100,000. This limitation will be applied by taking Options into account in the order in which they were granted. If for any reason an Option intended to be an ISO (or any portion thereof) shall not qualify as an ISO, then, to the extent of such nonqualification, such Option or portion thereof shall be regarded as a NSO appropriately granted under this Plan. \n\n**9.** |  **TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF RSUs AND PHANTOM SHARES**  \n---|---  \n  \n**9.1.** **Restrictions****.** At the time of grant, the Board may establish a Restricted Period and any additional restrictions including the satisfaction of corporate or individual performance objectives applicable to an Award of RSUs or Phantom Shares in accordance with **Section****3**. Each Award of RSUs or Phantom Shares may be subject to a different Restricted Period and additional restrictions. \n\n**9.2. Rights of Holders of RSUs and Phantom Shares.**\n\n**9.2.1.** **Settlement of RSUs.** VestedRSUs may be settled in Shares or cash (or a combination thereof), as determined by the Board. \n\nJ-9 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\n**9.2.2.** **Settlement of Phantom Shares.** VestedPhantom Shares shall be settled in cash. \n\n**9.2.3.** **Deferred Payment.** The Award Agreement will set forth whether the RSUs or Phantom Shares will be settled within the time period specified for “short term deferrals” under Code § 409A or otherwise within the requirements of Code § 409A, in which case the Award Agreement will specify upon which events such RSUs or Phantom Shares will be settled. \n\n**9.2.4.** **Voting and Dividend Rights.** Holders of RSUs will not have rights as Shareholders, including no voting or dividend rights, unless and until the Restricted Period lapses, all conditions are satisfied for settlement of the Award, and Shares are issued in settlement of the Award. Holders of Phantom Shares will not have rights as Shareholders, including no voting or dividend rights. Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to settlement, payment or forfeiture, RSUs and Phantom Shares awarded under the Plan may, at the Board’s discretion, provide for a right to dividend equivalents. Such right entitles the holder to be credited with an amount equal to all dividends paid on one Share while each RSU or Phantom Share, as applicable, is outstanding. Dividend equivalents may be converted into additional RSUs or Phantom Shares. Settlement of dividend equivalents may be made in the form of cash, Shares, other securities, other property, or in a combination of the foregoing. Prior to distribution, any dividend equivalents shall be subject to the same conditions and restrictions as the RSUs or Phantom Shares to which they attach. \n\n**9.2.5.** **Creditor’s Rights.** A holder of RSUs or Phantom Shares will have no rights other than those of a general creditor of the Company or its Affiliates. RSUs and Phantom Shares represent an unfunded and unsecured obligation of the Company or its Affiliates, subject to the applicable Award Agreement. \n\n**9.3.** **Delivery of Shares.** Upon the expiration or termination of any Restricted Period and the satisfaction of any other terms and conditions prescribed by the Board, the restrictions applicable to RSUs settled in Shares will lapse, and, unless otherwise provided in the Award Agreement, appropriate action will be taken to deliver such Shares, free of all such restrictions, to the Grantee or the Grantee’s beneficiary or estate, as the case may be. \n\n**10.** |  **FORM OF PAYMENT FOR OPTIONS**  \n---|---  \n  \nPayment of the Option Price for an Option will be made in cash or in cash equivalents acceptable to the Company or its Affiliates, or, where expressly approved for a Grantee’s Option by the Board and where permitted by law, by any other form of consideration. The Option Price must be paid in full when the Option is exercised. Notwithstanding any provision of this **Section****10** , during any period for which the Shares are publicly traded (i.e., listed on any established stock exchange or a national market system), an exercise by a Non-Employee Director or officer that involves or may involve a direct or indirect extension of credit or arrangement of an extension of credit by the Company, directly or indirectly, in violation of Section 402(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 shall be prohibited with respect to any Award under this Plan. \n\n**11.** |  **TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF PERFORMANCE AWARDS**  \n---|---  \n  \nThe right of a Grantee to exercise or receive a grant or settlement of any Award, and the timing thereof, may be subject to such performance terms and conditions as may be specified by the Board and set forth in an Award Agreement. The Board may use such business criteria and other measures of performance as it may deem appropriate in establishing any performance terms or conditions. \n\n**12.** |  **REQUIREMENTS OF LAW**  \n---|---  \n  \n**12.1.** **General.** The Company will not be required to sell or issue any Shares under any Award if the sale or issuance of such Shares would constitute a violation by the Grantee, any other individual or the Company of any law or regulation of any governmental authority, including any federal or state securities laws or regulations. If at any time the Company determines that the listing, registration or qualification of any Shares subject to an Award on any securities exchange or under any governmental regulatory body is necessary or desirable as a term or \n\nJ-10 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\ncondition of, or in connection with, the issuance or sale of Shares under the Plan, no Shares may be issued or sold to the Grantee unless such listing, registration, or qualification will have been effected or obtained free of any terms and conditions not acceptable to the Company, and any delay caused thereby will in no way affect the date of termination of the Award. Specifically, in connection with the Securities Act, upon the exercise of any Option or the delivery of any Shares underlying an Award, unless a registration statement under the Securities Act is in effect with respect to the Shares covered by such Award, the Company will not be required to sell or issue such Shares unless the Board has received evidence satisfactory to it that the Grantee may acquire such Shares under an exemption from registration under the Securities Act. The Company may, but will not be obligated to, register any securities covered by the Plan under the Securities Act. The Company will not be obligated to take any affirmative action to cause the exercise of an Option or the issuance of Shares under the Plan to comply with any law or regulation of any governmental authority. As to any jurisdiction that expressly imposes the requirement that an Option will not be exercisable until the Shares covered by such Option are registered or are exempt from registration, the exercise of such Option (under circumstances in which the laws of such jurisdiction apply) will be deemed conditioned upon the effectiveness of such registration or the availability of such an exemption. \n\n**12.2.** **Rule 16b-3. **During any time when the Company has a class of equity securities registered under Exchange Act § 12, it is the intent of the Company that Awards and the exercise of Options granted to officers and directors hereunder will qualify for the exemption provided by Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act, to extent Exchange Act § 16 applies to such Grantees. To the extent that any term or condition of the Plan or action by the Board does not comply with the requirements of Rule 16b-3, it will be deemed inoperative to the extent permitted by law and deemed advisable by the Board, and will not affect the validity of the Plan. If Rule 16b-3 is revised or replaced, the Board may modify the Plan in any respect necessary to satisfy the requirements of, or to take advantage of any features of, the revised exemption or its replacement. \n\n**13.** |  **EFFECT OF CHANGES IN CAPITALIZATION**  \n---|---  \n  \n**13.1.** **Changes in****Shares.** If (1) the number of outstanding Shares is increased or decreased or the Shares are changed into or exchanged for a different number or kind of shares or other securities of the Company on account of any recapitalization, reclassification, share split, reverse split, combination of shares, exchange of shares, share dividend or other distribution payable in shares or other increase or decrease in such Shares effected without receipt of consideration by the Company occurring after the Effective Date or (2) there occurs any spin-off, split-up, extraordinary cash dividend or other distribution of assets by the Company, (i) the number and kinds of shares for which grants of Awards may be made, (ii) the number and kinds of shares for which outstanding Awards may be exercised or settled and (iii) the performance goals relating to outstanding Awards, will be equitably adjusted by the Board, subject to Section 13.3 below. In addition, in the event of any such increase or decrease in the number of outstanding shares or other transaction described in clause (2) above, the number and kind of shares for which Awards are outstanding and the Option Price per share of outstanding Options will be equitably adjusted by the Board, subject to Section 13.3 below. \n\n**13.2.** **Change in Control.** In the event of a Change in Control, all Shares acquired under the Plan and all Awards outstanding on the effective date of the Change in Control will be treated in the manner described in the definitive transaction agreement (or, if there is no such provision in the definitive transaction agreement with the Company, in the manner determined by the Board, in its sole discretion). Such determination does not need to treat all Awards (or all portions of an Award) in an identical manner. The treatment specified in the definitive transaction agreement (or determined by the Board in its sole discretion, in the absence of a specific treatment in the definitive transaction agreement) may include, without limitation, one or more of the following with respect to each outstanding Award: \n\n(1) Continuation of the Award by the Company (if the Company is the surviving company); \n\n(2) Assumption of the Award by the surviving company or its parent; \n\n(3) Substitution by the surviving company or its parent of a new award; \n\nJ-11 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\n(4) Cancellation of the Award and a payment to the Grantee of the intrinsic value, if any, of the vested portion of the Award, as determined by the Board, in cash, cash equivalents or equity, subject to any escrow, holdback, earn-out or similar provisions in the transaction agreement and subject to Section 13.3 below; or \n\n(5) Suspension of the Grantee’s right to exercise the Award during a limited period of time preceding the closing of the transaction if such suspension is administratively necessary to permit the closing of the transaction. \n\n**13.3.** **Adjustments.** Adjustments under this **Section****13** related to Shares or other securities of the Company will be made by the Board. No fractional Shares or other securities will be issued under any such adjustment, and any fractions resulting from any such adjustment will be eliminated in each case by rounding downward to the nearest whole Share.Notwithstanding anything else to the contrary: (a) any adjustments made pursuant to Section 13.1 or 13.2 to Awards that are considered “deferred compensation” within the meaning of Code § 409A shall be made in compliance with the requirements of Code § 409A; (b) any adjustments made pursuant to Section 13.1 or 13.2 to Awards that are not considered “deferred compensation” subject to Code § 409A shall be made in such a manner as to ensure that after such adjustment, the Awards either (1) continue not to be subject to Code § 409A or (2) comply with the requirements of Code § 409A; (c) in any event, the Board shall not have the authority to make any adjustments pursuant to Section 13.1 or 13.2 to the extent the existence of such authority would cause an Award that is not intended to be subject to Code § 409A at the date of grant to be subject thereto; and (d) any adjustments made pursuant to Section 13.1 or 13.2 to Awards that are ISOs shall be made in compliance with the requirements of Code § 424(a). \n\n**14.** |  **NO LIMITATIONS ON COMPANY**  \n---|---  \n  \nThe grant of Awards will not affect or limit in any way the right or power of the Company to make adjustments, reclassifications, reorganizations or changes of its capital or business structure or to merge, consolidate, dissolve or liquidate or to sell or transfer all or any part of its business or assets. \n\n**15.** |  **TERMS APPLICABLE GENERALLY TO AWARDS**  \n---|---  \n  \n**15.1.** **Disclaimer of Rights.** No term or condition of the Plan or any Sub-Plan or Award Agreement will be construed to confer on any individual the right to remain in the employ or service of the Company or any Affiliate, or to interfere in any way with any contractual or other right or authority of the Company or any Affiliate either to increase or decrease the compensation or other payments to any individual at any time, or to terminate any employment or other service relationship between any individual and the Company or any Affiliate. In addition, unless otherwise provided in the Plan or stated in the applicable Award Agreement, no Award will be affected by any change of duties or position of the Grantee, so long as such Grantee continues to be a Service Provider. The obligation of the Company to pay any benefits under the Plan will be interpreted as a contractual obligation to pay only those amounts described in the Plan, in the manner and under the terms and conditions prescribed in the Plan. The Plan will in no way be interpreted to require the Company to transfer any amounts to a third party trustee or otherwise hold any amounts in trust or escrow for payment to any Grantee or beneficiary under the Plan. \n\n**15.2.** **Nonexclusivity of the Plan.** Neither the adoption of the Plan nor the submission of the Plan to Shareholders for approval will be construed as creating any limitations on the right and authority of the Board to adopt such other incentive compensation arrangements (either applicable generally to classes of individuals or specifically to particular individuals), as the Board determines desirable. \n\n**15.3.** **Withholding Taxes****and Contributions.** The Company or its Affiliate, as the case may be, will have the right to deduct from payments of any kind otherwise due to a Grantee any federal, state or local taxes and contributions of any kind required by law, in any jurisdiction, to be withheld (1) with respect to the grant of an Award, (2) the vesting of or other lapse of restrictions applicable to an Award, (3) upon the issuance or any \n\nJ-12 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\ntransfer of any Shares, upon the settlement of RSUs or Phantom Shares, or upon the exercise of an Option or (4) otherwise due in connection with an Award. At the time of such grant, vesting, lapse, exercise, issuance, transfer, settlement or other event, the Grantee will pay to the Company or the Affiliate, as the case may be, any amount that the Company or the Affiliate may reasonably determine to be necessary to satisfy such withholding obligation. The Company may, in its discretion, permit the Grantee to satisfy such obligation by remitting Shares freely owned by Grantee or having Shares from the Award withheld, in each case with the Shares remitted or withheld having an aggregate Fair Market Value equal to such withholding obligations. The Fair Market Value of the Shares used to satisfy such withholding obligation will be determined by the Company or the Affiliate as of the date that the amount of tax or contribution to be withheld is to be determined. To the extent applicable, a Grantee may satisfy his withholding obligation only with Shares that are not subject to any repurchase, forfeiture, unfulfilled vesting or other similar requirements. \n\n**15.4.** **Other Terms and Conditions and Employment Agreements.** Each Award Agreement may contain such other terms and conditions not inconsistent with the Plan as may be determined by the Board. In the event of any conflict between the terms and conditions of an employment agreement and an Award Agreement, the terms and conditions of the employment agreement will govern, to the extent not inconsistent with the Plan. \n\n**15.5.** **No Acquired Rights.** The grant of any Award under the Plan is voluntary and occasional and does not give the Grantee any contractual or other right to receive Awards or benefits in lieu of Awards in the future, even if a Grantee has have received Awards repeatedly in the past. \n\n**15.6.** **Discretionary Nature of Plan.** The benefits and rights provided under the Plan are wholly discretionary and, although provided by the Company, do not constitute regular or periodic payments. Unless otherwise required by applicable law, the benefits and rights provided under the Plan are not to be considered part of a Grantee’s salary or compensation or for purposes of calculating any severance, resignation, redundancy or other end of service payments, vacation, bonuses, long-term service awards, indemnification, pension or retirement benefits, or any other payments, benefits or rights of any kind. By acceptance of an Award, a Grantee waives any and all rights to compensation or damages as a result of the termination of employment with the Company or any Affiliate for any reason whatsoever insofar as those rights result or may result from this Plan or any Award. \n\n**15.7.** **Separation from Service.** The Board will determine the effect of a Separation from Service on Awards, and such effect may be set forth in the applicable Award Agreement. Without limiting the foregoing, the Board may provide in an Award Agreement at the time of grant, or any time thereafter with the consent of the Grantee, the effect of and the actions that may be taken upon the occurrence of a Separation from Service, including accelerated vesting or termination, depending on the circumstances surrounding the Separation from Service. \n\n**15.8.** **Severability.** If any term or condition of the Plan or any Award Agreement is determined to be illegal or unenforceable by any court of law in any jurisdiction, the remaining terms and conditions of the Plan and the Award Agreement will be severable and enforceable, and all terms and conditions will remain enforceable in any other jurisdiction. \n\n**15.9.** **Governing Law.** The Plan and all Award Agreements will be construed in accordance with and governed by the laws of Ireland, except as otherwise set forth herein, without regard to the principles of conflicts of law that could cause the application of the laws of any jurisdiction other than Ireland. For purposes of resolving any dispute that arises under the Plan or any Award Agreement, each Grantee will be subject to venue, jurisdiction and other dispute resolution provisions set forth in the applicable Award Agreement. The Plan is not intended to be subject to the United States Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974. \n\n**15.10.** **Code****§****409A.** The Plan is intended to comply with Code § 409A to the extent subject thereto, and, accordingly, to the maximum extent permitted, the Plan will be interpreted and administered to be in compliance \n\nJ-13 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\ntherewith. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any payments described in the Plan or an Award Agreement that are due within the “short-term deferral period” as defined in Code § 409A will not be treated as deferred compensation unless applicable laws require otherwise. For purposes of Code § 409A, each installment payment or benefit to be provided under the Plan or an Award Agreement that constitutes deferred compensation subject to Code § 409A will be treated as a separate payment for purposes of Code § 409A. Notwithstanding any other term or condition of the Plan,with respect to any Award that constitutes a “nonqualified deferred compensation plan” within the meaning Code § 409A, amounts that would otherwise be payable and benefits that would otherwise be provided with respect to such Award that become payable on account of the Grantee’s Separation from Service while a “specified employee” and which would otherwise be paid during the six-month period immediately after the Grantee’s Separation from Service will instead be accumulated (without interest) and paid on the first payroll date after the six-month anniversary of the Grantee’s Separation from Service (or as soon as administratively feasible afterthe appointment of the personal representative or executor of the Grantee’s estate following the Grantee’s death, if earlier). Notwithstanding the foregoingoranything else in the Plan or an Award Agreement to the contrary, neither the Company nor the Board will have any obligation to take any action to prevent the assessment of any additional tax or penalty on any Grantee under Code § 409A and neither the Company nor the Board will have any liability to any Grantee or any other person for such tax or penalty. \n\n**15.11. Transferability of Awards.**\n\n**15.11.1.** **Transfers in General.** Except as provided in **Section****15.11.2** , no Award will be assignable or transferable by the Grantee to whom it is granted, other than by will or the laws of descent and distribution and, during the lifetime of the Grantee, only the Grantee personally (or the Grantee’s personal representative) may exercise rights under the Plan. \n\n**15.11.2.** **Family Transfers****.** If authorized in the applicable Award Agreement, a Grantee may transfer, not for value, all or part of an Award, other than an ISO, to any Family Member. For the purpose of this **Section****15.11.2** , a “not for value” transfer is a transfer that is a gift, a transfer under a domestic relations order in settlement of marital property rights or a transfer to an entity in which more than 50% of the voting interests are owned by Family Members (or the Grantee) in exchange for an interest in that entity. After a transfer under this **Section****15.11.2** , any such Award will continue to be subject to the same terms and conditions as were applicable immediately before transfer. Subsequent transfers of transferred Awards are prohibited except, if permitted under the applicable Award Agreement, to Family Members of the original Grantee in accordance with this S**ection****15.11.2** or by will or the laws of descent and distribution. \n\n**15.12.** **Data Protection.** Where consent is required under applicable data privacy law, a Grantee’s acceptance of an Award will be deemed to constitute the Grantee’s acknowledgement of and consent to the collection and processing of personal data relating to the Grantee so that the Company can meet its obligations and exercise its rights under the Plan and generally administer and manage the Plan. This data will include data about participation in the Plan and Shares offered or received, subscribed for, purchased, or sold under the Plan and other appropriate financial and other data (such as the date on which the Awards were granted) about the Grantee and the Grantee’s participation in the Plan. \n\n**15.13.** **No Trust or Fund Created**. Neither the Plan nor any Award shall create or be construed to create a trust or separate fund of any kind or a fiduciary relationship between the Company and a Grantee or any other Person. To the extent that any Grantee or other Person acquires a right to receive payments from the Company pursuant to an Award, such right shall be no greater than the right of any unsecured general creditor of the Company. \n\n**15.14.** **Plan Construction.** In the Plan, unless otherwise stated, the following uses apply: \n\n(1) References to a statute or law refer to the statute or law and any amendments and any successor statutes or laws, and to all valid and binding governmental regulations, court decisions and other regulatory and judicial authority issued or rendered thereunder, as amended, or their successors, as in effect at the relevant time; \n\nJ-14 \n\n##### [Table of Contents](#toc)\n\n(2) In computing periods from a specified date to a later specified date, the words “from” and “commencing on” (and the like) mean “from and including,” and the words “to,” “until” and “ending on” (and the like) mean “to and including”; \n\n(3) Indications of time of day will be based on the time applicable to the location of the principal headquarters of the Company; \n\n(4) The words “include,” “includes” and “including” (and the like) mean “include, without limitation,” “includes, without limitation” and “including, without limitation” (and the like), respectively; \n\n(5) All references to sections are to sections in the Plan; \n\n(6) All words used will be construed to be of such gender or number as the circumstances and context require; \n\n(7) The captions and headings of sections have been inserted solely for convenience of reference and will not be considered a part of the Plan, nor will any of them affect the meaning or interpretation of the Plan; \n\n(8) Any reference to an agreement, plan, policy, form, document or set of documents, and the rights and obligations of the parties under any such agreement, plan, policy, form, document or set of documents, will mean such agreement, plan, policy, form, document or set of documents as amended from time to time, and any and all modifications, extensions, renewals, substitutions or replacements thereof; and \n\n(9) All accounting terms not specifically defined will be construed in accordance with IFRS. \n\n**15.15.** **Language.** If the Plan, any Award Agreement or any other document related to thereto is translated into a language other than English, and if the translated version is different from the English version, the English language version will take precedence. By acceptance of the Award, the Grantee confirms having read and understood the documents relating to the Plan including, without limitation, the Plan, the Award Agreement, which were provided in English, and waives any requirement for the Company or its Affiliates to provide these documents in any other language. \n\nJ-15 \n"

Those links are as follows:\n• for the Scheme Meeting: https://www.votingonline.com.au/smxsharescheme ;\n• for the Option Scheme Meeting: https://www.votingonline.com.au/smxoptionscheme\n• for the General Meeting https://www.votingonline.com.au/smxgm2023\nIf you have not received a copy of the Scheme Booklet or a proxy form, you should contact SMX – either by\nemail or by post – to be provided with a copy.\n3. Supplementary expert’s report\nAt ASIC’s request, in early January 2023, SMX engaged Nexia Australia to provide a supplementary report\nabout the schemes of arrangement.\nThe supplementary report was commissioned to enable Nexia Australia, as the independent expert, to assess\nwhether, in its view, the transaction remains fair and reasonable and in the best interests of the Shareholders\nand Optionholders, according to the provisions detailed in its original report (dated 7 October 2022 and\nannexed to the Scheme Booklet) and taking into account developments since the date of the original report,\nincluding the matters set out in section 4 below.\nNexia Australia's supplementary report dated 22 January 2023 is attached to this supplementary disclosure\ndocument, as Annexure B.\nFurther supplementary expert’s report\nAs the supplementary report explains, a material assumption of Nexia Australia's analysis is that redemptions\nfrom the Lionheart SPAC will be a maximum of 85%. If redemptions are higher than 85%, a further\nsupplementary expert’s report will be required (unless Nexia Australia decides that such a report is not\nrequired).\nSMX expects that information about the final rate of redemption from the Lionheart SPAC will be known\nbefore the day of Scheme Meeting and the Option Scheme Meeting. Further, it expects to publish that\ninformation – on its website and on its ASX announcement page – at or after 9.00am (AEDT) on 31 January\n2023.\nFurther, if Nexia Australia does issue a further supplementary report, SMX expects to publish the report – at\nthe same time and on the same websites – as the information about Lionheart’s final rate of redemption.\nIf the final redemption rate is below 85%, or if Nexia Australia decides that a further supplementary report is\nnot required, then only information about the final rate of redemption will be provided.\nImportant notice\nThe information about Lionheart’s final rate of redemption and any further supplementary expert report by\nNexia Australia WILL NOT be sent to you. Rather, you will need to obtain the information from SMX’s website\n(https://smx.tech/home, under the “Investor” tab) or from the ASX announcement page for SMX\n(https://www2.asx.com.au/markets/company/smx).\n4. Meeting of Lionheart shareholders\nLionheart intends to hold a meeting of stockholders to approve the transaction on 30 January 2023 at\n1.00PM, Eastern Time (GMT-5) (i.e. 5.00AM on 31 January 2023 in Melbourne).\nSMX has also been informed, and received confirmation, that the F-4 form lodged by Lionheart with the SEC\nhas been approved. Lionheart’s filings from time to time are located on the SEC website, including via the\nfollowing direct link: https://www.sec.gov/edgar/browse/?CIK=0001845991&owner=exclude\nSMX has been informed by Lionheart that stockholders wishing to redeem their shares must give notice\nbefore the Lionheart Shareholders Meeting.. Lionheart has confirmed that it expects to know the maximum\nnumber of redemptions by the morning of 27 January 2023 (US Eastern Time) and will provide this number\nand percentage to the independent expert, with public disclosure of the information to follow after 4:00pm\n(US Eastern Time) on 30 January 2023, following the meeting.\nSMX expects to publish that information in the manner and at the times described in section 3above.\n5. Issue and exercise of ESOP Options\nIsorad Ltd\nParagraphs 5.1(b) and 5.11(c) of the Scheme Booklet disclosed the terms of a commercial agreement\nbetween SMX and Isorad Ltd (Isorad), including the issue of 864,000 options to Isorad. Despite that\nagreement, the options were not actually issued to Isorad.\nThe options have now been issued to Isorad but, because they are ESOP options, will not participate in the\nOptionholder Scheme. The Isorad options will be cancelled with the same form of consideration along with\nthe other ESOP options in accordance with the terms of the proposed transaction with Lionheart.\nExercise of ESOP options by a former employee\nSeparately, SMX notes that 77,025 ESOP options issued to a former employee (and included in options\ndescribed in the Scheme Booklet) have been exercised but that no further shares have been issued to the\nformer employee.\nBy a deed of variation that modifies the Scheme Implementation Deed, SMX has agreed with the former\nemployee, and with Empatan and Lionheart that these options will be taken to be exercised at Completion,\nand immediately converted to Empatan shares.\n6. Entry Into further variation deed\nTo reflect the grant of the ESOP options to Isorad, the treatment of the exercise of the ESOP options by the\nformer employee and certain other matters, Empatan, Lionheart and SMX have entered a further deed of\nvariation that modifies the Scheme Implementation Deed.\nThe deed of variation is attached as Annexure C to this supplementary disclosure document.\n7.

The “Scheme Record Date” is\nanticipated to be 15 February 2023.\n9. Further information\nThe Court has ordered that the information about the final rate of redemption from the Lionheart SPAC and\nany further supplementary report from Nexia Australia be published in the manner described in section 3\nabove.\nAs explained in that section, that information and any further supplementary expert report by Nexia Australia\nWILL NOT be sent to you.

OUTLINE OF THE SCHEMES\nOn 26 July 2022, Security Matters Limited (“SMX” or the “Group”) announced that it had entered into a\nscheme implementation deed with Empatan PLC (“Empatan” or “Parent”) and Lionheart III Corp (“Lionheart”)\n(together the “Combined Group”). The parties entered into a deed of variation to the scheme implementation\ndeed on 8 January 2023.\nEmpatan is a newly incorporated Irish entity established to be the holding company of the Combined Group\nfollowing the implementation of the Scheme. Lionheart is a special purpose acquisition company (“SPAC”)\nlisted on the NASDAQ stock exchange in the US.\nOn completion of the transaction, SMX shareholders will hold shares in Empatan, which will be listed on\nNASDAQ. The transaction is to be implemented through a scheme of arrangement to acquire all of SMX’s\nordinary shares (the “Share Scheme”) and a separate scheme of arrangement in relation to the exercise of\ncertain options held over shares in SMX (the “Option Scheme”) (together the “Schemes”).\nUnder the Share Scheme SMX shareholders immediately prior to the implementation of the Scheme will\nreceive 16,198,372 shares in Empatan in return for 100% of the issued share capital of SMX. The Share\nScheme is conditional on a number of matters including:\n• court approval;\n• SMX and Lionheart shareholder approval;\n• NASDAQ quotation for the Parent being obtained;\n• Parent having net tangible assets of US$5 million following implementation of the Share Scheme;\n• Option Scheme being implemented;\n• Certain SMX employee, founder and service provider option holders agreeing to cancel their options in\nreturn for the issue of new options in the Parent;\n• SMX performance option holders agreeing to the cancellation of their options, which has been agreed\nsubject to implementation of the Schemes; and\n• SMX convertible note holders satisfying the amount owed through the issue of shares in SMX prior to the\nimplementation of the Share Scheme, which has been agreed subject to implementation of the Schemes.\n1\nUnder the Option Scheme eligible option holders will receive 24,480,008 SMX shares and then participate in\nthe Share Scheme. The Option Scheme is conditional on a number of matters including:\n• eligible SMX option holder approval;\n• court approval; and\n• the Share Scheme becoming effective.\nIn respect of the Schemes the following will also occur:\n• An equity raising is being undertaken at US$10 a share (with potentially attached warrants) with the\nintention of raising US$25 million. There is no minimum fundraising and the Schemes are not conditional\non the equity raising.\n• On implementation of the Scheme the board of the Parent will comprise seven directors of which\nLionheart will appoint three directors (including two independent directors) and SMX will appoint four\ndirectors.\n• Empatan will change its name to SMX Public Company Limited.\n• Transaction costs of US$11 million are expected to be incurred.\n• If the Schemes do not proceed then in certain circumstances a break-fee of US$2 million may be payable\nby either SMX or Lionheart.\n2. PURPOSE OF AND BASIS FOR SUPPLEMENTARY REPORT\nThe purpose of this Supplementary Report is to advise the shareholders of SMX on the fairness and\nreasonableness of the Scheme and whether or not it is in the best interests of the shareholders.\nThis report has been prepared in accordance with Section 411 of the Corporations Act (Cth) (“Corporations\nAct”) and guidance provided by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (“ASIC”).\nASIC has issued Regulatory Guide 111 Content of Expert Reports (“RG111”), which outlines the principles\nand matters to be considered in an independent expert’s report. We have had regard to the guidance\nrelevant to a scheme of arrangement in preparing our report.\nThe courts require that documentation provided to shareholders is accompanied by an independent expert\nreport. As such, the Directors of SMX have commissioned an independent expert report in respect of the\nScheme in order to inform the shareholders as to whether the Scheme is fair and reasonable and in the best\ninterests of the shareholders of SMX.\nWe previously prepared a report dated 7 October 2022 that was provided to shareholders along with the\nScheme Booklet on 9 January 2023. As noted in the Scheme Booklet this report had not been updated since\n7 October 2022.\n2\nSince that date the following material changes have occurred and are reflected in our analysis of the Scheme:\n• changes in the capital structure disclosed in the Scheme Booklet dated 9 January 2023, primarily around\nthe expiry of options subject to the Option Scheme and the issue of new employee, founder and service\nprovider options; and\n• SMX entered into additional bridging loan facilities with a number of private investors.\nAccordingly, this Supplementary Report supersedes and replaces our Report of 7 October 2022.\n3. SUMMARY AND OPINION ON SHARE SCHEME\nThis section is a summary of our opinion and cannot substitute for a complete reading of this Supplementary\nReport. Our opinion is based solely on information available as at the date of this Supplementary Report.\nThe principal factors that we have considered in forming our opinion are summarised below.\n3.1.1 Fairness of the Share Scheme\nAs discussed in section 5, in determining whether the Share Scheme is fair to SMX shareholders, we have\ncompared the fair value of a share on a control basis before the implementation of the Share Scheme to the\nfair value of the share in Empatan on a minority basis following the implementation of the Share Scheme.\nThis is summarised below:\nLow Preferred High\nFair value of a share in SMX on a control basis A$0.17 A$0.23 A$0.29\nExchange ratio 10.3624 10.3624 10.3624\nFair value of shares in SMX on a control basis for each A$1.81 A$2.37 A$2.96\nEmpatan share\nFair value of a share in Empatan on a minority basis A$3.26 A$5.07 A$6.43\nThe fair value of shares on a minority basis that SMX shareholders will hold in Empatan after the\nimplementation of the Share Scheme is greater than the fair value of a share held in SMX on a control basis\napplying the exchange ratio.\nTherefore, we have concluded that the Share Scheme is fair.\nA significant assumption in our assessment of fairness is that redemptions are a maximum of\n85%. The level of redemptions will not be known until just prior to the shareholder meeting to\napprove the Share Scheme. Should redemptions be higher than 85% then our approach to the\nassessment of the fairness of the Share Scheme may change and this may affect our opinion on\nthe fairness of the Share Scheme. In the event that redemptions are more than 85% we will\nbe issuing a second supplementary report, which will supersede our opinion in this\nSupplementary Report.\n3\n3.1.2 Reasonableness of the Share Scheme\nIn accordance with RG 111, a transaction is reasonable if:\n• the transaction is fair; or\n• despite not being fair, but considering other significant factors, shareholders should obtain an overall\nbenefit if the transaction proceeds.\nIn forming our opinion we have considered the following relevant factors (see section 9.2).\nAdvantages Disadvantages\n• The Share Scheme is fair • The level of redemptions is unknown and therefore\nthe level of capital available to the ongoing\n• Access to capital to continue to develop SMX’s\noperations may be insufficient.\ntechnology through to commercialisation.\n• Dilution of ownership through the issue of shares to\n• Listing on the NASDAQ exchange providing a deeper\nLionheart shareholders.\ncapital pool for further fundraising.\n• SMX Shareholders will hold a security in a foreign\n• Potential for future liquidity in shares as a result of\nentity and on a foreign exchange following\nbeing listed on a larger exchange\nimplementation of the Share Scheme\nThe Directors have advised us that there are currently no alternatives to the Share Scheme other than the\nstatus quo.\nIf the Share Scheme is not approved, SMX is likely to need further funding to support its ongoing operations\nand development activities. Any subsequent fundraising may be dilutive to shareholders.\nDepending the circumstances of the Share Scheme not proceeding SMX may be either required to pay or\nmay receive a break fee of US$2 million.\nAs the Share Scheme is fair, and taking into consideration the matters above, we have concluded that\nthe Share Scheme is reasonable.\nA significant assumption in our assessment of reasonableness is that redemptions are a\nmaximum of 85%. The level of redemptions will not be known until just prior to the shareholder\nmeeting to approve the Share Scheme. Should redemptions be higher than 85% then our\napproach to the assessment of the reasonableness of the Share Scheme may change and this\nmay affect our opinion on the reasonableness of the Share Scheme. In the event that\nredemptions are more than 85% we will be issuing a second supplementary report, which will\nsupersede our opinion in this Supplementary Report.\n3.2 Opinion on Share Scheme\nAccordingly, in our opinion, the Share Scheme is fair and reasonable and in the best interests of the\nSMX shareholders.\nA significant assumption in our assessment the Share Scheme is that redemptions are a\nmaximum of 85%.

SUMMARY AND OPINION ON OPTION SCHEME\nThis section is a summary of our opinion and cannot substitute for a complete reading of this Supplementary\nReport. Our opinion is based solely on information available as at the date of this Supplementary Report.\nThe principal factors that we have considered in forming our opinion are summarised below.\n4.1.1 Fairness of the Option Scheme\nAs noted in section 5 in determining the fairness of the Option Scheme we have compared the fair value of\na relevant SMX option on a control basis before the implementation of the Schemes to the fair value of the\nshares optionholders will hold in Empatan on a minority basis after the implementation of the Schemes.\nWe have undertaken the comparison for each option subject to Option Scheme and the comparison by option\nis set out in section 10.1.1.\nThe fair value of Empatan shares on a minority basis held for each option is higher than the fair value of\neach option subject to the Option Scheme on a control basis prior to the implementation of the Schemes.\nTherefore, we have concluded that the Option Scheme is fair.\nA significant assumption in our assessment of fairness is that redemptions are a maximum of\n85%. The level of redemptions will not be known until just prior to the optionholder meeting\nto approve the Option Scheme. Should redemptions be higher than 85% then our approach to\nthe assessment of the fairness of the Option Scheme may change and this may affect our opinion\non the fairness of the Option Scheme. In the event that redemptions are more than 85% we\nwill be issuing a second supplementary report, which will supersede our opinion in this\nSupplementary Report.\n4.1.2 Assessment of reasonableness of the Option Scheme\nIn considering the reasonableness of the Option Scheme the advantages and disadvantages as set out for\nthe Share Scheme along with the alternatives to the transaction are also applicable.\nThe Option Scheme has the additional advantage for the SMX optionholders in that they receive shares in\nSMX and ultimately in Empatan without having to pay for the exercise of the options.\nIn accordance with RG 111, a transaction is reasonable if:\n5\n• the transaction is fair; or\n• despite not being fair, but considering other significant factors, shareholders should obtain an overall\nbenefit if the transaction proceeds.\nAs the Option Scheme is fair and, taking into account other significant factors, we have concluded that\nthe Option Scheme is reasonable.\nA significant assumption in our assessment of reasonableness is that redemptions are a\nmaximum of 85%. The level of redemptions will not be known until just prior to the\noptionholder meeting to approve the Option Scheme. Should redemptions be higher than 85%\nthen our approach to the assessment of the reasonableness of the Option Scheme may change\nand this may affect our opinion on the reasonableness of the Share Scheme. In the event that\nredemptions are more than 85% we will be issuing a second supplementary report, which will\nsupersede our opinion in this Supplementary Report.\n4.1.3 Opinion on Option Scheme\nAccordingly, in our opinion, the Option Scheme is fair and reasonable and in the best interests of\nthe SMX optionholders.\nA significant assumption in our assessment the Option Scheme is that redemptions are a\nmaximum of 85%. The level of redemptions will not be known until just prior to the\noptionholder meeting to approve the Option Scheme. Should redemptions be higher than 85%\nthen our approach to the assessment of the fairness and reasonableness of the Option Scheme\nmay change and this may affect our opinion on the fairness and reasonableness of the Option\nScheme and whether or not it is in the optionholders’ best interest. In the event that\nredemptions are more than 85% we will be issuing a second supplementary report, which will\nsupersede our opinion in this Supplementary Report.\nThe ultimate decision on whether to approve the Option Scheme should be based on optionholders’ own\nassessment of their circumstances. We strongly recommend that optionholders consult their own professional\nadvisers, carefully read all relevant documentation provided, including the Scheme Booklet, and consider\ntheir own specific circumstances before voting in favour of or against the Option Scheme.\nYours faithfully\nNexia Sydney Corporate Advisory Pty Ltd\nBrent Goldman\nDirector\n(Authorised Representative of Nexia Sydney Financial Solutions Pty Ltd, AFSL 247300)\n6\nSTRUCTURE OF REPORT\nOur Supplementary Report is set out under the following headings:\n5.

BASIS OF EVALUATION\nRG 111 provides guidance as to matters that should be considered in determining whether a transaction is\nfair and reasonable in a range of circumstances.\nRG 111 state that in deciding an appropriate form of analysis, the expert needs to consider that the main\npurpose of the report is to deal with the concerns that could reasonably be anticipated by those persons\naffected by the transaction. An expert should focus on the purpose and outcome of the transaction; that is\nthe substance of the transaction, rather than the legal mechanism used to effect the transaction.\nRG 111 requires analysis of a transaction under two distinct criteria being:\n• is the offer ‘fair’?; and\n• is it reasonable?\nThat is the opinion of fair and reasonable is not considered as a compound phrase.\nIn determining what is fair and reasonable for a control transaction, RG 111 states that:\n• an offer is fair if the value of the offer price or consideration is equal to or greater than the value of the\nsecurities the subject of the offer, assuming a 100% interest in the target and irrespective of whether\nconsideration is cash or scrip; and\n• an offer is reasonable if it is fair, or if the offer is not fair, the expert believes that there are sufficient\nreasons for security holders to accept the offer in the absence of a higher bid before the close of an\noffer.\nIn determining whether the transaction is fair, the fair value is assumed to be based on a knowledgeable and\nwilling, but not anxious, buyer and a knowledgeable and willing, but not anxious, seller acting at arm’s length.\nRG 111 states that if an expert concluded that a transaction is ‘fair and reasonable’ in the form of a takeover\nbid, an expert would also be able to conclude that the scheme is in the best interests of the shareholders.\nIf an expert concludes that a transaction is ‘not fair but reasonable’ then an expert may still determine that\na transaction is in the best interests of the shareholders with the expert clearly stating that consideration is\nnot equal to or greater than the value of the securities the subject of the scheme but that there are sufficient\nreasons for security holders to vote in favour of the scheme in the absence of a higher offer.\nIf an expert concludes that a scheme is ‘not fair and not reasonable’ then the expert would conclude that the\nscheme was not in the best interests of shareholders.\nFor the purpose of considering whether or not the Share Scheme is fair, we have compared the fair value of\na share in SMX on a control basis prior to the Share Scheme to the fair value of the consideration shares held\nin Empatan on a minority basis after the implementation of the Share Scheme. The fairness of the Share\nScheme has been assessed on this basis given that following implementation of the Share Scheme SMX\nshareholders will hold a minority interest in Empatan.\nFor the purposes of considering whether or not the Option Scheme is fair, we have compared the fair value\nof the options held in SMX on a control basis to the fair value of shares on a minority basis that SMX\noptionholders will hold in Empatan following the implementation of the Option Scheme and Share Scheme.\nThe fairness of the Option Scheme has been assessed on this basis as the SMX options holders will hold a\nminority interest in Empatan following the implementation of the Schemes both of which are conditional on\neach other.\n8\nIn our assessment of the reasonableness of the Scheme, our consideration has included the following\nmatters:\n• the bidder’s pre-existing voting power in securities in SMX;\n• other significant security holding blocks in SMX;\n• the liquidity of the market in SMX’s securities;\n• taxation losses, cash flow or other benefits through achieving 100% ownership of SMX;\n• any special value to the bidder, such as technology, the potential to write-off outstanding loans from\nSMX, etc;\n• the likely market price if the Schemes are not successful;\n• the value to an alternate bidder and the likelihood of an alternative bid being made; and\n• other significant matters set out in sections 9.2 and 10.2.\n5.1 Individual security holders’ circumstances\nThe ultimate decision whether to approve the Schemes should be based on each security holder’s assessment\nof the Schemes, including their own risk profile, liquidity preference, tax position and expectations as to value\nand future market conditions. If in doubt about the Schemes or matters dealt with in this Supplementary\nReport, security holders should seek independent professional advice.\n5.2 Limitations on reliance on information\nThe documents and information relied on for the purposes of this Supplementary Report are set out in\nAppendix B. We have considered and relied upon this information and believe that the information provided\nis reliable, complete and not misleading and we have no reason to believe that documents and material facts\nhave been withheld. The information provided was evaluated through analysis, enquiry and review for the\npurpose of forming an opinion as to whether the Schemes are fair and reasonable and in the best interests\nof the shareholders. However, we do not warrant that our enquiries have identified or verified all of the\nmatters which an audit or extensive examination might disclose.\nWe understand the accounting and other financial information that was provided to us has been prepared in\naccordance with generally accepted accounting principles. SMX prepares its financial statements in\naccordance with Australian Accounting Standards and Lionheart prepares its financial statements in\naccordance US Generally Accepted Accounting Standards.\nAn important part of the information used in forming an opinion of the kind expressed in this Supplementary\nReport is the opinions and judgement of Directors and management. This type of information has also been\nevaluated through analysis, enquiry and review to the extent practical. However, it must be recognised that\nsuch information is not always capable of external verification or validation.\nNSCA are not the auditors of SMX or Lionheart. We have analysed and reviewed information provided by the\nDirectors and management of SMX and Lionheart and made further enquiries where appropriate. Preparation\nof this Supplementary Report does not imply that we have in any way audited the accounts or records of\nSMX or Lionheart.\n9\nIn forming our opinion we have assumed:\n• matters such as title, compliance with laws and regulations and contracts in place are in good standing\nand will remain so and that there are no material legal proceedings, other than as publicly disclosed;\n• the information set out in the Scheme Booklet to be sent to security holders is complete, accurate and\nfairly represented in all material respects; and\n• the publicly available information relied upon by NSCA in its analysis was accurate and not misleading.\nThis Supplementary Report has been prepared after taking into consideration the current economic and\nmarket climate. We take no responsibility for events occurring after the date of this Supplementary Report\nwhich may impact upon this Supplementary Report or which may impact upon the assumptions referred to\nin the Supplementary Report.\n6.

Initially the trust account holds\nUS$10.10 per redeemable Class A common stock. The redemption right can be exercised on a business\ncombination or after 12 months if a business combination has not occurred or an extension to complete\na transaction is not approved.\n• Class B common stock has restrictions on transferability. On a business combination the Class B common\nstock automatically converts to Class A common stock. If the Class A common stock is the same as at\nthe time of listing then this is on a one for one basis. If there has been an increase in Class A Common\nStock, then the Class B common stock converts to be 20% of all Class A common stock.\nUnder the Schemes, Class A and Class B common stockholders will receive one ordinary share in Empatan\nfor each share that they hold.\n7.4.2 Public and private placement warrants\nThe public and private placement warrants have the same terms except that the private warrants have\nrestrictions on transferability.\nThe key terms of the warrants are:\n• exercise price of $11.50 a share;\n• exercisable 30 days after a business combination or 12 months from listing date; and\n• expire after 5 years.\nUnder the Schemes all Lionheart warrants will be converted to public warrants and holders will receive a\nwarrant in Empatan on the same terms as the warrant held.\n23\n7.4.3 Public offer\nUnder the public offering for the IPO, shares were issued for US$10 which comprised one Class A share and\nhalf a warrant per share.\n7.5 Share Price and Volume Trading Analysis\nThe following chart provides a summary of the trading volumes and prices for Lionheart shares from 9\nDecember 2021 (the first day of trading) to 25 July 2022, the last full day of trading prior to the\nannouncement of the Schemes:\nClosing price and daily volume\n$10.05 900,000\n) )\ne 800,000 n\nn $10.00 m\nil( 700,000 u\ne c $9.95 600,000 lo c\nir\np $9.90 500,000\n(\ns\ne\ne r $9.85 400,000 r a\na h\nh 300,000 s\ns $9.80\ng 200,000\nf\no\nn is $9.75 100,000 r e\no b\nlC $9.70 - m\nu\nN\nSource: S&P CapitalIQ\nThe chart above indicates that the closing share price of Lionheart has traded within a range of US$9.84 and\nUS$10.01 over the 180 days to 25 July 2022 (the last full day of trading before the announcement of the\nSchemes) with a closing price of A$10.01.\nPrices and volumes of trading in Lionheart’s shares for the last 180 days prior to 25 July 2022 are summarised\nin the table below.\nPeriod prior to 25 Share Price Low Share Price High Cumulative VWAP\nJuly 2022 volume traded\n1 Day US$10.010 US$10.010 - $ -\n30 Days US$ 9.970 US$10.010 77,040 US$ 9.971\n60 Days US$ 9.950 US$10.010 342,950 US$ 9.989\n90 Days US$ 9.950 US$10.010 588,660 US$ 9.979\n180 Days US$ 9.840 US$10.010 1,637,780 US$ 9.956\nLionheart’s shares have a low level of liquidity, with 14.9% (on an annualised basis) of Lionheart’s capital\nbeing traded in the last 90 days.\n24\n8. VALUATION METHODOLOGIES\n8.1 Definition of market value\nIn forming our opinion as to whether or not the Schemes are fair and reasonable to the SMX Shareholders\nand SMX Optionholders, we have assessed the value of the issued shares and options of SMX on a fair value\nbasis. RG 111 defines fair value as the amount:\n“assuming a knowledgeable and willing, but not anxious, buyer and a knowledgeable and willing, but not\nanxious, seller acting at arm’s length...”\n8.2 Selection of Methodology\nRG 111 provides guidance on the valuation methods that an independent expert should consider. These\nmethods include:\n• the discounted cash flow method and the estimated realisable value of any surplus assets;\n• the application of earnings multiples (appropriate to the business or industry in which the entity operates)\nto the estimated future maintainable earnings or cash flows of the entity, added to the estimated\nrealisable value of any surplus assets;\n• the amount that would be available for distribution to security holders on an orderly realisation of assets;\n• the quoted price for listed securities, when there is a liquid and active market and allowing for the fact\nthat the quoted price may not reflect their value, should 100% of the securities be available for sale;\n• any recent genuine offers received by the target for the entire business, or any business units or assets\nas a basis for valuation of those business units or assets; and\n• the amount that an alternative bidder might be willing to offer if all the securities in the target were\navailable for purchase.\nEach methodology is appropriate in certain circumstances. The decision as to which methodology to apply\ngenerally depends on the nature of the asset being valued, the methodology most commonly applied in\nvaluing such an asset and the availability of appropriate information.\nIn determining the fair value of SMX, we have applied the quoted price and recent genuine offers\nmethodologies. We have determined these to be the most appropriate methodologies as:\n• SMX is yet to generate revenue as it is commercialising its technology;\n• Management has not prepared long-term forecasts on the business through to commercial sales that can\nbe used for a discounted cash flow valuation;\n• There has been trading in SMX’s shares, albeit a low volume; and\n• SMX has issued new equity to investors.\nIn determining the fair value of Lionheart, we have applied the quoted price and genuine recent offers\nmethodologies. We have determined these to be the most appropriate methodologies as:\n• Lionheart’s value reflects the cash held and its NASDAQ listing;\n• Lionheart’s issue price at IPO is a recent genuine offer for Lionheart Shares; and\n• There has been in trading Lionheart’s shares, albeit a low volume.\n25\nIn determining the fair value of options held in SMX, we have applied the binomial valuation methodology.\nWe have applied this methodology as options are exercisable at any time up to expiry. The binomial valuation\nmethodology reflects these exercise rights in determining a fair value.\n9. ASSESSMENT OF SHARE SCHEME\n9.1 Fairness of the Share Scheme\nAs noted in section 5, in determining the fairness of the Share Scheme we have compared the fair value of\na SMX share on a control basis before the implementation of the Schemes to the fair value of a share in\nEmpatan on a minority basis after the implementation of the Schemes.\n9.1.1 Fair value of a SMX share before the implementation of the Schemes\nWe have determined the fair value of a SMX share on a control basis to be as follows:\nLow Preferred High\nFair value of SMX share on a minority basis 1 A$0.15 A$0.18 A$0.22\nControl premium 2 20% 25% 30%\nFair value of SMX share on a control basis A$0.17 A$0.23 A$0.29\nNotes:\n1. The fair value of a share on a minority basis reflects the 90-day VWAP as at 25 July 2022, the last trading\nday before announcement of the Schemes, at the low end of the valuation range. The high end of the\nrange has been determined based on the issue price for the capital raise in October 2021.\n2. A control premium has been applied at 20% to 30% based on long term academic studies which show\naverage control premiums between these ranges.

The share price reflects a minority interest in Lionheart.\nUnder the public offer, shareholders received half a warrant for every share with an exercise price\nof US$11.50 and exercise period of 30 days after a business combination or 12 months from the\n27\npublic offer. We have valued these warrants as having a value of US$0 using a Black-Scholes option\npricing model. In calculating the warrant valuation we used a risk-free rate of 0.17% based on the\nUS 1-year Treasury Bill rate at 3 November 2021 (the date of listing) and a volatility rate of 2%\nbased on the average 12-month volatility rate of SPACs listed on the NASDAQ.\nAll amounts have been converted at the rate of A$1:43:US$1 based on the exchange rate at 17\nJanuary 2023.\n(b) Under the terms of the business combination agreement all Lionheart class A and class B\nshareholders will be offered 1 ordinary shares in Empatan for each share held. The number of shares\nreflects the total class A and class B shares as set out in section 7.4 before any redemptions.\n3.

As\na result, the calculated fair value determined by the multiplication of the presented share price by\nthe number of shares differs due to rounding differences.\n4. Under the Schemes, convertible notes in SMX as set out in section 6.5.5 will be converted into shares\nimmediately before the implementation of the Share Scheme, reducing SMX’s liabilities and therefore\nincreasing its equity value.\n5. Transaction costs of US$11 million are expected to be incurred in implementing the Schemes. The\nestimated transaction costs have been converted at the rate of A$1:43:US$1 based on the exchange rate\nat 17 January 2023.\n6. As set out in section 6.4.2, on implementation of the Schemes a bonus payment of ILS 2.5 million will\nbe paid in settlement of SMX related party loans. This will reduce the cash balance of Empatan and\ntherefore the equity value. The amount has been converted at the rate of A$0.43:ILS1 based on the\nexchange rate at 2 September 2022.\n28\n7.

In our analysis we have applied the mean of identified transactions as\nthe mean redemption assumption. The high and low range is based on approximately one standard\ndeviation of the transactions identified.\nThe redemption amount of US$10.10 has been converted at the rate of A$1:43:US$1 based on the\nexchange rate at 17 January 2023.\n9. As set out in section 6.4.2, SMX entered into loans with private investors raising US$3,760,000 with\n790,000 attaching warrants.\nA number of the loans are either partially or fully repayable with interest on implementation of the\nSchemes. The adjustment reflects the amount payable on implementation of the Schemes and has been\nconverted at the rate of A$1:43:US$1 based on the exchange rate at 17 January 2023.\nThe warrants have a term of five years and an exercise price of US$11.50. Of the 790,000 warrants,\n552,000 warrants allow the investor the right to redeem a warrant for US$5 each at various periods. For\nthese warrants we have determined the fair value of a warrant granted in Empatan to be the maximum\nof the fair value of a warrant determined based on the binomial valuation methodology and the\nredemption amount of US$5 a warrant. In determining the fair value of a warrants we have assumed:\n• fair value of a share in Empatan to be that after the implementation of the Scheme but before\nthe warrants;\n• risk free rate of 3.3% based on the Australian Government 5-year debt rate; and\n30\n• Volatility of 66% based on SMX’s 2-year share price volatility rate.\nAt the low, preferred and high range the redemption rate of US$5 a warrant where is applicable is higher\nthan the fair value of a warrant calculated under the binomial valuation methodology. Therefore, the\nredemption rate for these warrants has been determined to be the fair value of a warrant.\n9.1.3 Conclusion on fairness of Share Scheme\nAs discussed in section 5, in determining whether the Share Scheme is fair to SMX shareholders, we have\ncompared the fair value of a share on a control basis before the implementation of the Share Scheme to the\nfair value of the share in Empatan on a minority basis following the implementation of the Share Scheme.\nThis is summarised below:\nLow Preferred High\nFair value of a share in SMX on a control basis A$0.17 A$0.23 A$0.29\nExchange ratio 10.3624 10.3624 10.3624\nFair value of shares in SMX on a control basis for each A$1.81 A$2.37 A$2.96\nEmpatan share\nFair value of a share in Empatan on a minority basis A$3.26 A$5.07 A$6.43\nThe fair value of shares on a minority basis that SMX shareholders will hold in Empatan after the\nimplementation of the Share Scheme is greater than the fair value of a share held in SMX on a control basis\napplying the exchange ratio.\nTherefore, we have concluded that the Share Scheme is fair.\nA significant assumption in our assessment of fairness is that redemptions are a maximum of\n85%. The level of redemptions will not be known until just prior to the shareholder meeting to\napprove the Share Scheme. Should redemptions be higher than 85% then our approach to the\nassessment of the fairness of the Share Scheme may change and this may affect our opinion on\nthe fairness of the Share Scheme. In the event that redemptions are more than 85% we will\nbe issuing a second supplementary report, which will supersede our opinion in this\nSupplementary Report.\n9.2 Reasonableness of the Share Scheme\n9.2.1 Approach to assessing Reasonableness\nIn forming our conclusions in this Supplementary Report, we have compared the advantages and\ndisadvantages to shareholders if the Share Scheme proceeds.\n9.2.2 Advantages of the Share Scheme\nWe outline below potential advantages of the Share Scheme:\nAdvantage Explanation\nThe Share Scheme is fair As noted in section 9.1.3, the Share Scheme is fair.\n31\nAdvantage Explanation\nAccess to capital to continue to Following the implementation of the Share Scheme, SMX will have\ndevelop SMX’s technology through to access to funding from the unredeemed Class A shares in Lionheart as\ncommercialisation. well as the potential fundraising.\nThe Share Scheme is not conditional on the fund raising and the level\nof funding is currently uncertain. The fundraising is taking place at\nUS$10 a share and potentially associated warrants. Although the final\nterms are not finalised, as the fundraising is intended to be at a price\nabove the fair value we have determined for Empatan after the\nimplementation of the Share Scheme, this will not dilute the fair value\nof Empatan’s shares.\nThe additional funding will provide greater opportunity for SMX to\ndevelop its technology to commercialisation and increase value for SMX\nshareholders in the future.\nListing on the NASDAQ exchange The NASDAQ market is a larger market than the ASX on which SMX is\nproviding a deeper capital pool for currently listed. As a result, there are more potential investors that may\nfurther fundraising. be approached for future investment in Empatan and therefore more\nfunding available to further develop SMX’s technology.\nNASDAQ has a reputation for attracting investment in technology\ncompanies and exposure to this investor market may also increase\nfunding sources and opportunities.\nPotential for future liquidity in shares The exposure to a larger market and investors with a stronger interest\nas a result of being listed on a larger in earlier stage technology companies such as SMX may increase\nexchange demand for shares in Empatan and therefore increase the volume of\ntrading in Empatan’s shares improving the opportunity for SMX\nshareholders to realise their investment.\n9.2.3 Disadvantages of the Share Scheme\nWe outline following the potential disadvantages of the Share Scheme:\nDisadvantage Explanation\nThe level of redemptions is unknown There is no minimum level of funds that are required within Lionheart\nand therefore the level of capital to implement the Share Scheme. The actual level of redemptions will\navailable to the ongoing operations not be known until after Lionheart’s shareholders have voted on the\nmay be insufficient. Share Scheme.\nA higher redemption rate will also impact the amount of funding\navailable to further develop SMX’s technology and may require further\nfundraising activity to be undertaken in the short term.\n32\nDisadvantage Explanation\nDilution of ownership through the Following the implementation of the Scheme, SMX shareholders’ interest\nissue of shares to Lionheart in the underlying operations will reduce.\nshareholders.\nThe level of ongoing ownership that SMX shareholders will have will be\ndependent on the level of Lionheart shareholders that exercise their\nredemption rights and the level of funding drawn down under the\nstandby equity facility.\nBased on the redemption assumptions we have applied in our\ndetermination of the fair value of Empatan after the implementation of\nthe Share Scheme of 85% at the low end of the range to 23% at the\nhigher end of the range then SMX Shareholders will retain an interest of\n67% to 48%, respectively.\nSMX Shareholders will hold a security Following the implementation of the Share Scheme, SMX shareholders\nin a foreign entity and on a foreign will hold shares in an Irish company and shares with be traded on the\nexchange following implementation NASDAQ exchange.\nof the Share Scheme\nThere may implications for holding shares in a foreign company for\nindividual shareholders as well as unfamiliarity with local practices, as\nopposed to those in Australia, governing corporations.\nSMX shareholders may be unfamiliar with the trading practices on\nNASDAQ compared to the ASX, which may impact on the decision to\nown shares in Empatan following the implementation of the Share\nScheme.\n9.2.4 Other considerations\nThe tax implications of the Share Scheme for Australian shareholders are set out in Part A of Annexure A of\nthe Scheme Booklet. The general advice notes that Australian SMX shareholders should be able to obtain\ncapital gains tax roll-over relief and therefore, suffer no adverse tax consequence from the implementation\nof the Share Scheme. Individual SMX shareholders should seek their own independent tax advice.\n9.2.5 Alternatives to the transaction\nThe Directors have advised us that there are currently no alternatives to the Share Scheme, other than the\nstatus quo.\n9.2.6 Implications of the transaction not proceeding\nIf the Share Scheme is not approved, SMX is likely to need further funding to support its ongoing operations\nand development activities. Any subsequent fundraising may be dilutive to shareholders.\nDepending on the circumstances of the Share Scheme not proceeding, SMX may be either required to pay\nor may receive a break fee of US$2 million.\n33\n9.2.7 Conclusion as to Reasonableness\nIn accordance with RG 111, a transaction is reasonable if:\n• the transaction is fair; or\n• despite not being fair, but considering other significant factors, shareholders should obtain an overall\nbenefit if the transaction proceeds.\nAs the Share Scheme is fair and, taking into account other significant factors, we have concluded that\nthe Share Scheme is reasonable.\nA significant assumption in our assessment of reasonableness is that redemptions are a\nmaximum of 85%. The level of redemptions will not be known until just prior to the shareholder\nmeeting to approve the Share Scheme. Should redemptions be higher than 85% then our\napproach to the assessment of the reasonableness of the Share Scheme may change and this\nmay affect our opinion on the reasonableness of the Share Scheme. In the event that\nredemptions are more than 85% we will be issuing a second supplementary report, which will\nsupersede our opinion in this Supplementary Report.\n9.3 Opinion on Share Scheme\nAccordingly, in our opinion, the Share Scheme is fair and reasonable and in the best interests of the\nSMX shareholders.\nA significant assumption in our assessment the Share Scheme is that redemptions are a\nmaximum of 85%. The level of redemptions will not be known until just prior to the shareholder\nmeeting to approve the Share Scheme. Should redemptions be higher than 85% then our\napproach to the assessment of the fairness and reasonableness of the Share Scheme may\nchange and this may affect our opinion on the fairness and reasonableness of the Share Scheme.\nIn the event that redemptions are more than 85% we will be issuing a second supplementary\nreport, which will supersede our opinion in this Supplementary Report.\nThe ultimate decision on whether to approve the Share Scheme should be based on shareholders’ own\nassessment of their circumstances. We strongly recommend that shareholders consult their own professional\nadvisers, carefully read all relevant documentation provided, including the Scheme Booklet, and consider\ntheir own specific circumstances before voting in favour of or against the Share Scheme.\n34\n10. ASSESSMENT OF OPTION SCHEME\n10.1 Fairness of the Option Scheme\nAs noted in section 5, in determining the fairness of the Option Scheme we have compared the fair value of\na relevant SMX option on a control basis before the implementation of the Schemes to the fair value of the\nshares SMX optionholders will hold in Empatan on a minority basis after the implementation of the Schemes.\nThe table below shows the fair value of each option subject to the Option Scheme on a control basis and the\nfair value of shares that each SMX optionholder will hold in Empatan on implementation of the Scheme.\nNumber of Fair value of Empatan shares on\nNumber of Exercise Fair value on a control basis SMX minority basis per share\nExpiry date options Price Low Preferred High shares Low Preferred High\n12/03/2023 4,926,466 A$0.60 A$0.00 A$0.00 A$0.01 3,458,013 A$0.22 A$0.34 A$0.44\n25/03/2023 1,391,255 A$0.60 A$0.00 A$0.00 A$0.01 976,558 A$0.22 A$0.34 A$0.44\n29/05/2023 3,250,000 A$0.60 A$0.00 A$0.00 A$0.01 2,281,258 A$0.22 A$0.34 A$0.44\n14/10/2023 1,698,829 A$0.20 A$0.03 A$0.06 A$0.11 1,526,193 A$0.28 A$0.44 A$0.56\n23/11/2023 3,089,591 A$0.60 A$0.00 A$0.00 A$0.01 2,168,663 A$0.22 A$0.34 A$0.44\n27/11/2023 500,000 A$0.60 A$0.00 A$0.00 A$0.01 701,926 A$0.44 A$0.69 A$0.87\n27/11/2023 1,000,000 A$0.60 A$0.00 A$0.00 A$0.01 350,963 A$0.11 A$0.17 A$0.22\n10/12/2023 1,150,000 A$0.35 A$0.01 A$0.02 A$0.05 894,581 A$0.24 A$0.38 A$0.48\n29/12/2023 1,341,815 A$0.70 A$0.00 A$0.00 A$0.01 897,179 A$0.21 A$0.33 A$0.41\n4/01/2024 500,000 A$0.60 A$0.00 A$0.01 A$0.01 350,963 A$0.22 A$0.34 A$0.44\n4/01/2024 1,000,000 A$0.70 A$0.00 A$0.00 A$0.01 668,631 A$0.21 A$0.33 A$0.41\n5/06/2024 125,000 A$0.31 A$0.02 A$0.05 A$0.08 107,064 A$0.27 A$0.42 A$0.53\n9/07/2024 1,000,000 A$0.60 A$0.01 A$0.02 A$0.03 702,038 A$0.22 A$0.34 A$0.44\n31/12/2024 100,000 A$0.50 A$0.02 A$0.04 A$0.06 77,003 A$0.24 A$0.38 A$0.48\n18/01/2025 300,000 A$0.28 A$0.04 A$0.07 A$0.11 250,481 A$0.26 A$0.41 A$0.52\n28/01/2025 150,000 A$0.39 A$0.03 A$0.05 A$0.08 124,497 A$0.26 A$0.41 A$0.52\n1/06/2025 2,500,000 A$0.20 A$0.06 A$0.10 A$0.15 2,245,737 A$0.28 A$0.44 A$0.56\n25/10/2025 100,000 A$0.36 A$0.04 A$0.07 A$0.11 83,956 A$0.26 A$0.41 A$0.52\n25/03/2027 8,000,001 A$0.40 A$0.06 A$0.09 A$0.13 6,614,307 A$0.26 A$0.40 A$0.51\n32,122,957 24,480,008\n10.1.1 Fair value of options on a control basis before implementation of the Option Scheme\nIn determining the fair value of each option, the expiry date and exercise price are as set out in the table\nabove.

As the underlying share price reflects a control premium and the option derives its\nvalue from the underlying security then the fair value of the option is also on a control basis.\n35\nRisk-free rate\nThe risk-free rate applied to each option reflects the following Australian government debt rates:\nDebt term Rate\nAustralia Government Debt - 2 Year 3.172%\nAustralia Government Debt - 3 Year 3.192%\nAustralia Government Debt - 5 Year 3.312%\nSource: S&P Capital IQ at 17 January 2023\nThe relative risk-free rate applied to each option is based on the debt term nearest to the days to expiry for\neach option and an average if the period to expiry falls between debt-terms.\nVolatility\nThe volatility rate applied reflects volatility in SMX’s share price for the following periods to 25 July 2022, the\nlast day of trading prior to announcement of the Schemes:\nVolatility period Rate\n3 months 160%\n6 months 138%\n12 months 62%\n24 months 66%\nThe relative volatility applied to each option is based on the volatility period nearest to the days to expiry for\neach option and an average if the period to expiry falls between volatility periods.\n10.1.2 Fair value of shares held in Empatan following implementation of the Option Scheme\nThe fair value of shares held in Empatan after the implementation of the Schemes for each option is calculated\nas the number of SMX shares issued per option, dividend by the exchange ratio set out in section 9.1.2\ndivided by the number of options for each expiry date.\nAs an example, for the 100,000 options maturing on 31 December 2024 with an exercise price of A$0.50,\nthe fair value of shares held on a minority basis is calculated as follows:\nLow Preferred High\nNumber of SMX shares received A 77,003 77,003 77,003\nExchange ratio (1) B 10.3624 10.3624 10.3624\nNumber of Empatan shares received C=A / B 7,431 7,431 7,431\nFair value of an Empatan share after D A$3.26 A$5.07 A$6.43\nimplementation of the Schemes (2)\nFair value of shares held after E=C x D A$24,242 A$37,670 A$47,787\nimplementation of the Schemes\nNumber of options held before F 100,000 100,000 100,000\nimplementation of the Schemes\nFair value of Empatan shares held G=E / F A$0.24 A$0.38 A$0.48\nper option\n(1) See section 9.1.2 for calculation of exchange ratio\n(2) Fair value of a share in Empatan on a minority basis after implementation of the Schemes as set out\nin section 9.1.2.\n36\n10.1.3 Conclusion on fairness of the Option Scheme\nAs the fair value of Empatan shares on a minority basis held for each option is higher than the fair value of\neach option subject to the Option Scheme on a control basis prior to the implementation of the Schemes,\nwe have concluded that the Option Scheme is fair.\nA significant assumption in our assessment of fairness is that redemptions are a maximum of\n85%. The level of redemptions will not be known until just prior to the optionholder meeting\nto approve the Option Scheme. Should redemptions be higher than 85% then our approach to\nthe assessment of the fairness of the Option Scheme may change and this may affect our opinion\non the fairness of the Option Scheme and whether or not it is in the shareholders’ best interests.\nIn the event that redemptions are more than 85% we will be issuing a second supplementary\nreport, which will supersede our opinion in this Supplementary Report.\n10.2 Assessment of reasonableness of the Option Scheme\nIn considering the reasonableness of the Option Scheme, we note that the advantages and disadvantages\nas set out for the Share Scheme in section 9.2.2 and 9.2.3 along with the other considerations in 9.2.4,\nalternatives to the transaction in section 9.2.5 and implications of the transaction not proceeding in 9.2.6,\nare applicable.\nThe Option Scheme has the additional advantage for the SMX optionholders in that they receive shares in\nSMX and ultimately in Empatan without having to pay for the exercise of the options.\nIn accordance with RG 111, a transaction is reasonable if:\n• the transaction is fair; or\n• despite not being fair, but considering other significant factors, shareholders should obtain an overall\nbenefit if the transaction proceeds.\nAs the Option Scheme is fair and, taking into account other significant factors, we have concluded that\nthe Option Scheme is reasonable.\nA significant assumption in our assessment of reasonableness is that redemptions are a\nmaximum of 85%. The level of redemptions will not be known until just prior to the\noptionholder meeting to approve the Option Scheme. Should redemptions be higher than 85%\nthen our approach to the assessment of the reasonableness of the Option Scheme may change\nand this may affect our opinion on the reasonableness of the Share Scheme. In the event that\nredemptions are more than 85% we will be issuing a second supplementary report, which will\nsupersede our opinion in this Supplementary Report.\n10.3 Opinion on Option Scheme\nAccordingly, in our opinion, the Option Scheme is fair and reasonable and in the best interests of the\nSMX optionholders.\nA significant assumption in our assessment the Option Scheme is that redemptions are a\nmaximum of 85%. The level of redemptions will not be known until just prior to the\noptionholder meeting to approve the Option Scheme. Should redemptions be higher than 85%\nthen our approach to the assessment of the fairness and reasonableness of the Option Scheme\nmay change and this may affect our opinion on the fairness and reasonableness of the Option\nScheme and whether or not it is in the optionholders’ best interests. In the event that\n37\nredemptions are more than 85% we will be issuing a second supplementary report, which will\nsupersede our opinion in this Supplementary Report.\nThe ultimate decision on whether to approve the Option Scheme should be based on optionholders’ own\nassessment of their circumstances. We strongly recommend that optionholders consult their own professional\nadvisers, carefully read all relevant documentation provided, including the Scheme Booklet, and consider\ntheir own specific circumstances before voting in favour of or against the Option Scheme.\n38\nAPPENDIX A – GLOSSARY\nTerm Definition\nASIC Australian Securities and Investments Commission\nASX Australian Securities Exchange\nCombined Group The group comprising Empatan, SMX and Lionheart following implementation\nof the Schemes\nCompany or SMX Security Matters Limited\nCorporations Act Corporations Act 2001 (Cth)\nEmpatan or Parent Empatan PLC\nFSG Financial Services Guide\nFY2019 the financial year ended or as at 31 December 2019\nFY2020 the financial year ended or as at 31 December 2020\nFY2021 the financial year ended or as at 31 December 2021\nGroup SMX and its subsidiaries\nLionheart Lionheart III Inc\nOption Scheme The scheme of arrangement whereby certain SMX option holders, participate\nin a cashless exercise to acquire SMX shares which then participate in the\nShare Scheme as set out in Section 1.\nNASDAQ NASDAQ exchange\nNSCA Nexia Sydney Corporate Advisory Pty Ltd (ABN 68 114 696 945)\nNSFS Nexia Sydney Financial Solutions Pty Ltd (AFSL 247300)\nReport Previous Independent Expert’s Report dated 7 October 2022\nRG 111 ASIC Regulatory Guide 111: Content of expert Reports\nRG 112 ASIC Regulatory Guide 112: Independence of Experts\nShare Scheme The scheme of arrangement whereby Empatan acquires 100% of SMX as set\nout in Section 1\nScheme Booklet Document sent to shareholders and optionholders on or about 9 January 2023\nSchemes Share Scheme and Option Scheme\nSupplementary Report The Supplementary Independent Expert’s report dated 22 January 2023\nSupplementary Scheme Document sent to shareholders and optionholders on or about the date of\nBooklet this report\nSPAC Special purpose acquisition company\nVWAP Volume Weighted Average Price of shares\n39\nAPPENDIX B - SOURCES OF INFORMATION\n• Australian Securities and Investments Commission’s (ASIC) database\n• Audited financial statements of Security Matters Limited for the years ended 31 December 2019, 2020\nand 2021\n• Reviewed financial statements of Security Matters Limited for the half-year ended 30 June 2022\n• Audited financial statements of Lionheart as at 31 December 2021 and unaudited interim financial\nstatements for the nine months ended 30 September 2022\n• Scheme Booklet and Draft Supplementary Scheme Booklet prepared by SMX\n• Shareholder listing for SMX at 14 January 2023\n• Optionholder listing for SMX at 18 January 2023\n• S&P Capital IQ\n40\nAPPENDIX C - STATEMENT OF DECLARATION & QUALIFICATIONS\nConfirmation of Independence\nPrior to accepting this engagement Nexia Sydney Corporate Advisory Pty Ltd (“NSCA”) determined its\nindependence with respect to SMX and Lionheart with reference to ASIC Regulatory Guide 112: Independence\nof Experts (“RG 112”).

These methods include:\n• the discounted cash flow method;\n• the capitalisation of earnings method;\n• asset based methods; and\n• analysis of share market trading.\nDiscounted Cash Flow Method\nDescription\nOf the various methods noted above, the discounted cash flow method has the strongest theoretical standing.\nIt is also widely used in practice by corporate acquirers and company analysts. The discounted cash flow\nmethod estimates the value of a business by discounting expected future cash flows to a present value using\nan appropriate discount rate. A discounted cash flow valuation requires:\n• a forecast of expected future cash flows;\n• an appropriate discount rate; and\n• an estimate of terminal value.\nIt is necessary to project cash flows over a suitable period of time (generally regarded as being at least five\nyears) to arrive at the net cash flow in each period. For a finite life project or asset this would need to be\ndone for the life of the project. This can be a difficult exercise requiring a significant number of assumptions\nsuch as revenue growth, future margins, capital expenditure requirements, working capital movements and\ntaxation.\nThe discount rate used represents the risk of achieving the projected future cash flows and the time value\nof money. The projected future cash flows are then valued in current day terms using the discount rate\nselected.\nA terminal value reflects the value of cash flows that will arise beyond the explicit forecast period. This is\ncommonly estimated using either a constant growth assumption or a multiple of earnings (as described under\ncapitalisation of future maintainable earnings below). This terminal value is then discounted to current day\nterms and added to the net present value of the forecast cash flows.\nThe discounted cash flow method is often sensitive to a number of key assumptions such as revenue growth,\nfuture margins, capital investment, terminal growth and the discount rate. All of these assumptions can be\nhighly subjective, sometimes leading to a valuation conclusion presented as a range that is too wide to be\nuseful.\n43\nUse of the Discounted Cash Flow Method\nA discounted cash flow approach is usually preferred when valuing:\n• early stage companies or projects;\n• limited life assets such as a mine or toll concession;\n• companies where significant growth is expected in future cash flows; or\n• projects with volatile earnings.\nIt may also be preferred if other methods are not suitable, for example if there is a lack of reliable evidence\nto support a capitalisation of earnings approach. However, it may not be appropriate if reliable forecasts of\ncash flow are not available and cannot be determined.\nCapitalisation of Earnings Method\nDescription\nThe capitalisation of earnings method is a commonly used valuation methodology that involves determining\na future maintainable earnings figure for a business and multiplying that figure by an appropriate\ncapitalisation multiple. This methodology is generally considered a short form of a discounted cash flow,\nwhere a single representative earnings figure is capitalised, rather than a stream of individual cash flows\nbeing discounted. The capitalisation of earnings methodology involves the determination of:\n• a level of future maintainable earnings; and\n• an appropriate capitalisation rate or multiple.\nA multiple can be applied to any of the following measures of earnings:\nRevenue – most commonly used for companies that do not make a positive EBITDA or as a cross-check of\na valuation conclusion derived using another method.\nEBITDA - most appropriate where depreciation distorts earnings, for example in a company that has a\nsignificant level of depreciating assets but little ongoing capital expenditure requirement.\nEBIT - in most cases EBIT will be more reliable than EBITDA as it takes account of the capital intensity of\nthe business.\nNPAT - relevant in valuing businesses where interest is a major part of the overall earnings of the group\n(e.g. financial services businesses such as banks).\nMultiples of EBITDA, EBITA and EBIT value the whole businesses, or its enterprise value irrespective of the\ngearing structure. NPAT (or P/E) values the equity of a business\nThe multiple selected to apply to maintainable earnings reflects expectations about future growth, risk and\nthe time value of money all wrapped up in a single number. Multiples can be derived from three main sources.\nUsing the guideline public company method, market multiples are derived from the trading prices of stocks\nof companies that are engaged in the same or similar lines of business and that are actively traded on a free\nand open market, such as the ASX or the NSX. The merger and acquisition method is a method whereby\n44\nmultiples are derived from transactions of significant interests in companies engaged in the same or similar\nlines of business. In Australia this has been called the comparable transaction methodology.\nUse of the Capitalisation of Earnings Method\nThe capitalisation of earnings method is widely used in practice. It is particularly appropriate for valuing\ncompanies with a relatively stable historical earnings pattern which is expected to continue. This method is\nless appropriate for valuing companies or assets if:\n• there are no suitable listed company or transaction benchmarks for comparison;\n• the asset has a limited life;\n• future earnings or cash flows are expected to be volatile; or\n• there are negative earnings or the earnings of a business are insufficient to justify a value exceeding the\nvalue of the underlying net assets.\nAsset Based Methods\nDescription\nAsset based valuation methods estimate the value of a company based on the realisable value of its net\nassets, less its liabilities. There are a number of asset based methods including:\n• orderly realisation;\n• liquidation value;\n• net assets on a going concern basis;\n• replacement cost; and\n• reproduction cost.\nThe orderly realisation of assets method estimates Fair Market Value by determining the amount that would\nbe distributed to shareholders, after payment of all liabilities including realisation costs and taxation charges\nthat arise, assuming the company is wound up in an orderly manner. The liquidation method is similar to the\norderly realisation of assets method except the liquidation method assumes the assets are sold in a shorter\ntime frame.\nSince wind up or liquidation of the company may not be contemplated, these methods in their strictest form\nmay not necessarily be appropriate. The net assets on a going concern basis method estimates the market\nvalues of the net assets of a company but does not take account of realisation costs.\nThe asset / cost approach is generally used when the value of the business’s assets exceeds the present\nvalue of the cash flows expected to be derived from the ongoing business operations, or the nature of the\nbusiness is to hold or invest in assets. It is important to note that the asset approach may still be the relevant\napproach even if an asset is making a profit. If an asset is making less than an economic rate of return and\nthere is no realistic prospect of it making an economic return in the foreseeable future, an asset approach\nwould be the most appropriate method.\n45\nUse of Asset Based Methods\nAn asset-based approach is a suitable valuation method when:\n• an enterprise is loss making and is not expected to become profitable in the foreseeable future;\n• assets are employed profitably but earn less than the cost of capital;\n• a significant portion of the company’s assets are composed of liquid assets or other investments (such\nas marketable securities and real estate investments); or\n• it is relatively easy to enter the industry (for example, small machine shops and retail establishments).\nAsset based methods are not appropriate if:\n• the ownership interest being valued is not a controlling interest, has no ability to cause the sale of the\ncompany’s assets and the major holders are not planning to sell the company’s assets; or\n• a business has (or is expected to have) an adequate return on capital, such that the value of its future\nincome stream exceeds the value of its assets.\nAnalysis of Share Trading\nThe most recent share trading history provides evidence of the Fair Market Value of the shares in a company\nwhere they are publicly traded in an informed and liquid market. There should also be some similarity\nbetween the size of the parcel of shares being valued and those being traded. Where a company’s shares\nare publicly traded then an analysis of recent trading prices should be considered, at least as a cross-check\nto other valuation methods.\n46\nAnnexure C- Further deed of variation\nDocuSign Envelope ID: EE18B8C1-896C-4E51-8193-4150E5A73F4C\nDeed of Variation - Scheme\nImplementation Deed\nLionheart III Corp\nand\nEmpatan PLC\nand\nSecurity Matters Limited\nACN 626 192 998\n\n\n\n\nDocuSign Envelope ID: EE18B8C1-896C-4E51-8193-4150E5A73F4C\n4\n3.5 Governing law and Jurisdiction\n(a) This Deed is governed by and must be construed in accordance with the laws of\nVictoria.\n(b) The parties submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of that State and the\nCommonwealth of Australia in respect of all matters arising out of or relating to this\nDeed, its performance or subject matter.\nExecuted as a deed\nSigned for and on behalf of Lionheart Ill Corp\nby its duly authorised representative in the\npresence of:\n...... ~~;t~~~~·········\nBy executing this agreement the representative\nstaters that they have received no notice that their\nauthority to do so has been revoked\nYA-UL \\sl' 'Rf\\~ ISkfLD A\n...................................................................\nName of witness (please print) Name (please print)\nSigned and delivered for and on behalf of and\nas a deed of Empatan PLC by its lawful\nappointed attorney in the presence of:\n..................... . ........................ .\n·························~·······················\nSigrrure of witness _.Si orney\nHaggai Alon\nDoron Afik\nName of witness (please print) Name of attorney (please print)\nNaan\nAddress of witness\nCEO\nOccupation of witness\nError!

Purpose\n1.1 The Company’s commitment to disclosure and communication\nSecurity Matters Ltd (ACN 626 192 998) (Company) is committed to the objective of promoting\ninvestor confidence and the rights of shareholders by:\n(a) complying with the continuous disclosure obligations imposed by law;\n(b) ensuring that market releases are presented in a factual, clear and balanced way;\n(c) ensuring that all shareholders have equal and timely access to material information\nconcerning the Company; and\n(d) communicating effectively with shareholders and making it easy for them to participate in\ngeneral meetings.\n1.2 Policy scope\nThis policy outlines corporate governance measures adopted by the Company to further these\ncommitments. It seeks to incorporate and reflect:\n(a) the disclosure obligations contained in the ASX Listing Rules;\n(b) Principle 5 (Make timely and balanced disclosure) and Principle 6 (Respect the rights of\nsecurity holders) of the ASX Corporate Governance Council’s Corporate Governance\nPrinciples and Recommendations; and\n(c) the principles in Guidance Note 8 (Continuous Disclosure: Listing Rules 3.1 – 3.1B) issued by\nthe ASX.\n1.3 Authority\nThe Committee is a committee of the Board established in accordance with Article 25.14 of the\nCompany’s Constitution and authorised by the Board to assist it in fulfilling its statutory, fiduciary\nand regulatory responsibilities. It has the authority and power to exercise the role and\nresponsibilities set out in this charter and granted to it under any separate resolutions of the\nBoard from time to time.\n2. Application of this policy\nThis policy applies to all Officers of the Company.\nDisclosure and materiality guidelines that are intended to complement this policy are contained in\nthe Disclosure and Communication Procedures (the Procedures).\n3. Continuous disclosure reporting obligations\n3.1 What is the Company’s continuous disclosure obligation?\n(a) The Company is listed on the ASX and complies with the continuous disclosure obligations\nin the ASX Listing Rules. These obligations have the force of law under the Corporations Act\nand civil and criminal penalties may result from a breach for the company and individuals.\nM:9941683_1 SMH\nPage 32\n(b) Once the Company becomes aware of any market sensitive information regarding the\nCompany, it must immediately tell the ASX that information, unless an exception applies at\nthat time.\n3.2 When is the Company aware of information?\nThe ASX Listing Rules state that the Company becomes aware of information if an Officer has, or\nought reasonably to have, come into possession of the information in the course of the\nperformance of their duties as an Officer of the Company.\n3.3 What does “immediately mean”?\n“Immediately” means “promptly and without delay”. The standard of promptness expected by\nthe market, the ASX and ASIC is very high; “promptly and without delay” means doing something\nas quickly as it can be done in the circumstances (acting promptly) and not deferring, postponing\nor putting it off to a later time (acting without delay).\n3.4 What is “market sensitive information”?\nMarket sensitive information is information concerning the Company that a reasonable person\nwould expect to have a material effect on the price or value of the Company securities. A\nreasonable person will be taken to have that expectation if the information would, or would be\nlikely to, influence investors in deciding whether to buy, hold or sell the Company securities.\n“Information” is given a broad meaning under the ASX Listing Rules and extends beyond facts to\nmatters of opinion and intention.\n3.5 What is “material”?\nWhat is material depends on the Company’s business activities, size and place in the market.\nA matter may be material even if there is little impact on the Company’s financial position and/or\nfinancial prospects. For example, the matter may have a significant impact on the Company’s\nreputation or perception of the Company’s strategy. In determining whether information was\nmarket sensitive, the ASX looks at the effect that the relevant information had on the market\nprice when it was finally announced to the market. The ASX will generally apply the following\nmateriality guidelines in assessing whether information was market sensitive:\n(a) if the market price of a security has moved 5% or less: the ASX generally regards this as\nconfirmation that the information was not market sensitive;\n(b) if the market price of a security has moved 10% or more: the ASX generally regards the\ninformation as market sensitive and refer the potential breach to ASIC; or\n(c) if the market price of a security has moved between 5 and 10%: the ASX has regard to\nvarious factors to determine whether the information was market sensitive, including the\nnature and significance of the information, and the market capitalisation of the entity.\nThese are guidelines only and may not apply in all circumstances.\n4. Disclosure roles and responsibilities\n4.1 How is a decision about disclosure of information made?\n(a) The Board has established a Disclosure Committee which (or in the absence of a Disclosure\nCommittee, the Board) considers disclosures of potentially market sensitive information to\nM:9941683_1 SMH\nPage 33\nbe made by the Company, and ensures that all potentially market sensitive information has\nbeen assessed for compliance with the Company’s continuous disclosure obligations. The\nDisclosure Committee is governed by the Disclosure Committee Charter (set out in\nAnnexure A) which sets out the roles, responsibilities and membership of the Committee.\n(b) A decision of the Disclosure Committee requires the approval of at least two Disclosure\nOfficers.\n(c) Except as otherwise provided in this policy, all disclosures to the ASX of potentially market\nsensitive information are first approved by the Disclosure Committee. Routine\nadministrative releases are approved by the Company Secretary (or their delegate).\n4.2 Matters requiring additional approval\n(a) While recognising the need to ensure that market sensitive information is disclosed to the\nASX promptly and without delay, approval is obtained in advance from the Board where the\nmarket release relates to the following significant matters:\n(i) a material acquisition or disposal;\n(ii) takeovers, mergers, de-mergers, restructures, schemes of arrangement and all other\ntransactions involving a transfer of control or significant change in the nature or scale\nof the Company’s activities;\n(iii) share buybacks and capital reductions concerning the Company securities;\n(iv) equity capital raisings for the Company;\n(v) material market updates, including any earnings guidance for the Company or other\nreleases regarding forecasts, or the future prospects of the Company;\n(vi) interim and final results;\n(vii) dividend policy and dividend determinations/declarations concerning the Company;\n(viii) any matter in respect of which directors make a recommendation to the Company\nshareholders; and\n(ix) any other matter that the Board determines to be a significant matter affecting the\nCompany.\n(b) Unless the Board resolves otherwise in a specific instance, the Disclosure Committee may\nauthorise non-material changes to market releases previously approved by the Board.\n(c) The Disclosure Committee may approve a release relating to a matter described in section\nSchedule 74.2(a) where that release merely provides that the Company has no information\nto disclose in respect of the relevant matter, unless the Disclosure Committee considers\nthat the matter should be considered by the Chairman or the Board (if the Chairman is not\na member of the Disclosure Committee), in which case the Chairman will be consulted or a\nBoard meeting convened.\n(d) If the Disclosure Committee believes that a meeting of the Board to approve a proposed\nrelease to the ASX in relation to a significant matter described in section Schedule 74.2(a)\ncannot be convened within a timeframe that would allow the Company to comply with its\ncontinuous disclosure obligations:\nM:9941683_1 SMH\nPage 34\n(i) the Disclosure Committee will seek approval of the proposed release from the\nChairman of the Board or, where the Chairman cannot be contacted, the Chairman of\nthe Audit and Risk Committee; or\n(ii) if neither the Chairman of the Board nor the Chairman of the Audit and Risk\nCommittee can be contacted within the required timeframe, the Disclosure\nCommittee will:\n(A) approve the release for disclosure to the ASX, in which case the approved\nrelease must immediately be provided to each member of the Board; or\n(B) recommend to the Company Secretary that a trading halt is requested until the\nBoard can meet or the Chairman of the Board or the Chairman of the Audit\nand Risk Committee can be contacted.\n(e) A referral from the Disclosure Committee to the Board, Chairman or Chairman of the Audit\nand Risk Committee will be accompanied by:\n(i) a recommendation by the Disclosure Committee that the proposed release be\napproved; and\n(ii) confirmation that the Disclosure Committee is satisfied that an appropriate process\nof verification has occurred regarding the factual accuracy of the content of the\nproposed release and that there are no material omissions.\n4.3 Role and responsibilities of the Disclosure Committee and Company Secretary\n(a) The role and responsibilities of the Disclosure Committee are set out in the Disclosure\nCommittee Charter.\n(b) The Company Secretary (or their delegate) is responsible for day to day communication\nwith the ASX in relation to ASX Listing Rule matters and also for the general administration\nof this policy.\n(c) The Company Secretary (or their delegate):\n(i) seeks to ensure that the ASX is immediately notified of any information which needs\nto be disclosed;\n(ii) reviews Board papers and other information referred to the Company Secretary for\nevents that the Company Secretary considers may give rise to disclosure obligations;\nand\n(iii) approves routine administrative market releases.\n4.4 Obligations of all officers and contractors\n(a) This policy is made available to all officers and contractors.\n(b) Officers and contractors must refer any matter or event which may need to be disclosed to\nthe ASX under this Policy to a member of the Disclosure Committee.\n5. Disclosure matters generally\n5.1 Inform the ASX first\nM:9941683_1 SMH\nPage 35\n(a) The Company will not release any information publicly that is required to be disclosed\nthrough the ASX until the Company has received formal confirmation of its release to the\nmarket by the ASX, unless otherwise permitted by the ASX Listing Rules.\n(b) Information is not to be given to the media before it is given to the ASX, even on an\nembargo basis.\n5.2 Correcting a false market and market speculation\n(a) Generally, the Company does not respond to market speculation or rumours unless a\nresponse is required by law or the ASX. If the ASX considers that there is, or is likely to be, a\nfalse market in the Company’s securities and asks the Company to provide information to\ncorrect or prevent a false market, the Company will give the ASX the information needed to\ncorrect or prevent the false market.\n(b) The exceptions in Listing Rule 3.1A do not apply to requests from the ASX for information.\n(c) If any material information disclosed to the market becomes incorrect, the Company will\nrelease an announcement correcting or updating the information.\n5.3 Trading halts and voluntary suspension\n(a) If necessary, the Disclosure Committee may consider and request a trading halt from the\nASX to prevent trading in the Company securities on an uninformed basis and to manage\ndisclosure issues.\n(b) The Disclosure Committee may only make a request to the ASX for a voluntary suspension\nwith the approval of the Board, the Chairman of the Board or the Chairman of the Audit\nand Risk Committee.\n6.
