These forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology, including the words “anticipates,” “believes,” “continue,” “estimates,” “expects,” “intends,” “may,” “plans,” “potential,” “predicts,” “projects,” “should,” “will,” or “would,” or, in each case, their negative or other variations or comparable terminology.\n\nThese forward-looking statements involve significant risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially from the expected results. Most of these factors are outside BEN’s control and are difficult to predict. Factors that may cause such differences include, but are not limited to: uncertainties as to the timing of the acquisition with Cataneo Gmbh (the “Acquisition”); the risk that the Acquisition may not be completed on the anticipated terms in a timely manner or at all; (the failure to satisfy any of the conditions to the consummation of the Acquisition, including the ability to obtain financing to fund the Acquisition on terms that are agreeable to the parties or at all; the possibility that any or all of the various conditions to the consummation of the Acquisition may not be satisfied or waived; the occurrence of any event, change or other circumstance that could give rise to the termination of the purchase agreement; the effect of the announcement or pendency of the transactions contemplated by the purchase agreement on the Company’s ability to retain and hire key personnel, its ability to maintain relationships with its customers, suppliers and others with whom it does business, or its operating results and business generally; risks related to diverting management’s attention from the Company’s ongoing business operations; uncertainty as to the timing of completion of the Acquisition; risks that the benefits of the Acquisition are not realized when and as expected; risks relating to the uncertainty of the projected financial information with respect to BEN; uncertainty regarding and the failure to realize the anticipated benefits from future production-ready deployments; the attraction and retention of qualified directors, officers, employees and key personnel; our ability to grow our customer base; BEN’s history of operating losses; BEN’s need for additional capital to support its present business plan and anticipated growth; technological changes in BEN’s market; the value and enforceability of BEN’s intellectual property protections; BEN’s ability to protect its intellectual property; BEN’s material weaknesses in financial reporting; BEN’s ability to navigate complex regulatory requirements; the ability to maintain the listing of BEN’s securities on a national securities exchange; the ability to implement business plans, forecasts, and other expectations; the effects of competition on BEN’s business; and the risks of operating and effectively managing growth in evolving and uncertain macroeconomic conditions, such as high inflation and recessionary environments. The foregoing list of factors is not exhaustive.\n\nBEN cautions that the foregoing list of factors is not exclusive. BEN cautions readers not to place undue reliance upon any forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date made. BEN does not undertake nor does it accept any obligation or undertaking to release publicly any updates or revisions to any forward-looking statements to reflect any change in its expectations or any change in events, conditions or circumstances on which any such statement is based, and it does not intend to do so unless required by applicable law. Further information about factors that could materially affect BEN, including its results of operations and financial condition, is set forth under “Risk Factors” in BEN’s Annual Report on Form 10-K and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q subsequently filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\n**BEN Contacts:**\n\n**Investor Relations** Susan XuE: [sxu@allianceadvisors.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=DJn4nlDTxHXFFcw3s5mOZb5y4X2-RCQs3rVEZUGc7J0pWJ_Cr5TkUnVJEQJlxPLoA7tLNp8Te1Z-f_Ri_up4VgoRhmy9ik14TSol4RLv0NM=)P: 778-323-0959\n\n**Media Contact** Amy RouyerE: [amy@beninc.ai](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=G_v2ggces8XXtk2jI0F6laCYQ5z5gwEzMOuisrqDJlhH_1mbCGHihA53CwyCO9PXfK3LetmLQNuONvrFzx3hgRPPUFzo7xLCAqqhRe24FR57xSQ-EM5j27L18KyH21QHqehXeLCDuun479UPojsj3uJcowKktTMBrqP_ani1DOk1X1EQDuREgzggruHi8eRGGjBUxyoq5S6jjh7tuk9QrpiqQxlOINjGMXC0Iy2l0qo=)[](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=xiG7Z1pyXUn55WkZpp6iKccLzYoioFClwF153xQV7bO8DFsD8wJ3c7pdRKojglVA4abmW-K8BT4wdRpPSc__OJbA0Ng44co17-yfQpx-zC0M15C6ttpvWj2FTGklp6ZWlsvFQ30OSVM1GlhXIQNebvDDCpzz41Qkg4pflcJrPgzgPXuJbQ7H2lnpaFWwwSpm)P: 503-367-7596\n\n**Source:** Brand Engagement Network, Inc.
