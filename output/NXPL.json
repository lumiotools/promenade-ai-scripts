These transactions are expected to bring both significant long-term growth in their respective markets and importantly, drive positive cashflows as our team works to fully integrate them and implement cost-cutting measures through the fourth quarter of 2024, improving efficiencies and removing redundancies across the organization into 2025,\" said Charles M. Fernandez, Executive Chairman and CEO of NextPlat Corp.\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Highlights:**\n\n  * Consolidated revenue for the third quarter of 2024 was approximately $15.4 million compared to approximately $15.3 million in the same period last year. Total e-Commerce revenues were approximately $3.8 million and $2.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively, an increase of approximately 31% mainly due to the Outfitter acquisition on April 1, 2024. Total Healthcare Operations revenues were approximately $11.5 million and $12.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively, a decrease primarily due to a decline in retail pharmacy prescription reimbursement rates in line with continuing industry trends occurring with U.S. independent pharmacies. Consolidated revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was approximately $49.8 million, an increase of over 136% versus revenue of approximately $21.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily attributable to an increase of approximately $27.3 million from Healthcare Operations as a result of the Progressive Care acquisition on July 1, 2023. Based upon current expectations, available product inventory and the number of new and existing pharmacy service contracts, the Company currently expects full-year 2024 revenue to be in the range of approximately $60 million to $65 million.\n  * Gross profit margin for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, declined to 22.9% primarily attributable to the decrease in retail prescription drug reimbursement rates in Healthcare Operations. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, overall gross profit margin remained consistent at approximately 28% when compared to the prior year period. Gross profit margin for e-Commerce Operations was 28.1%, remaining at near record levels largely due to continued increases in higher margin recurring airtime revenue. Gross profit margin for Healthcare Operations in the third quarter of 2024 was 21.2%. Healthcare Operations continues to experience pressures from medication price increases despite reimbursement rates not keeping pace with those increases.\n  * Operating expenses for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, were approximately $11.5 million compared to approximately $8.1 million for the same period in 2023. A significant 45.2% decrease in recurring selling, general and administrative expenses in the quarter were offset by a non-cash impairment loss of approximately $3.7 million related to intangible assets recognized in the Progressive Care acquisition. Additional expenses included professional fees of approximately $2.1 million mainly attributable to costs related to the merger with Progressive Care as well as non-recurring litigation and other legal fees.\n  * As a result of acquiring a controlling interest in Progressive Care on July 1, 2023, under U.S. GAAP for mergers and acquisitions, the Company recorded previously unrecognized goodwill and other intangibles which were recorded at fair values based on Progressive Care's stock price on July 1, 2023 as well as estimates of future book of business. Declines in Progressive Care's stock price and changes in its estimated book of business caused a decline in the fair value of the goodwill and intangibles. Thus, under U.S. GAAP, the Company was required to adjust its fair value estimates for goodwill and the intangibles resulting in non-cash impairment losses totaling $13.7 million recognized during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The Company now expects no further impairment losses from the acquisition of Progressive Care.\n    * Year-to-date, the Company recorded a total of approximately $34.9 million in operating expenses, which included non-recurring expenses of approximately $13.7 million in non-cash impairment losses and approximately $3.4 million in expenses related to the merger with Progressive Care.\n    * The Company expects significant annual reductions in operating costs through cost savings from ongoing integration efforts of Progressive Care. These efforts include trimming delivery costs, rightsizing staffing, and removing duplicated public company expenses including professional services such as legal and accounting services, as well as the reduction of other selling, general and administrative costs by eliminating existing redundancies.\n  * Net loss attributable to NextPlat Corp common shareholders for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, was approximately $4.2 million, or ($0.22) per diluted share, compared to a net income attributable to NextPlat Corp common shareholders of approximately $3.4 million, or $0.17 diluted earnings per share, reported for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net loss attributable to NextPlat Corp common shareholders was approximately $11.0 million, or ($0.58) per diluted share, compared to a net loss attributable to NextPlat Corp common shareholders of approximately $2.1 million, or ($0.12) per diluted share.\n  * The Company ended the third quarter of 2024 with approximately $20.4 million in cash representing a net cash burn of approximately $5.9 million year-to-date. The use of cash primarily consisted of approximately $3.4 million in non-recurring operating expenses plus approximately $1.0 million related to the Outfitter acquisition, and approximately $1.5 million used in recurring operating expenses.\n\n\n\n**Organizational Highlights and Recent Business Developments:**\n\n  * [On October 1, 2024, the Company completed its proposed merger with Progressive Care in an all-stock transaction, resulting in Progressive Care becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of NextPlat](https://ir.nextplat.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/124/nextplat-announces-completion-of-merger-and-business \"Opens in a new window\"). Representing the Company's Healthcare Operations, Progressive Care continues to support the needs of a growing number of 340B contracted healthcare entities as well as long-term care and assisted living facilities.\n  * In the third quarter, Healthcare Operations filled approximately 128,000 pharmacy prescriptions, a 5% increase from the 122,000 pharmacy prescriptions filled in the year-ago quarter. The Company continues to add pharmacy service contracts with 340B covered entities which are expected to represent a greater proportion of Healthcare Operations revenue going forward, contributing to increased services and prescription revenues throughout the remainder of fiscal 2024 and into fiscal 2025. These contracts have a greater profit margin than the Company's traditional retail pharmacy business.\n  * The Company's technology e-commerce business continued to see increased global demand for satellite-enabled communications devices, producing sales to customers in 95 countries during the third quarter. Recurring, high-margin airtime revenue in the third quarter of 2024 increased to record levels, reflecting growth of 94% vs. 2023 levels driven by both organic growth and the addition of Outfitter Satellite which was acquired in April 2024.\n  * In July, [the Company significantly expanded the scope of its e-commerce program in China to include broad retail distribution and digital/social media marketing capabilities through a new partner](https://ir.nextplat.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/119/nextplat-expands-e-commerce-program-in-china-to-include \"Opens in a new window\"). Several online and offline marketing programs in support of the OPKO Healthcare (Nasdaq: OPK) (\"OPKO\")-branded site on Alibaba Group Holding Limited's (NYSE: BABA) (\"Alibaba\") Tmall Global have already been conducted and product interest and sales continue to grow as in-country product availability increases.

International launch plans are currently in development and Florida Sunshine products are expected to be made available to Chinese consumers on multiple online marketplaces and be featured in campaigns conducted by social media influencers and bloggers starting late in the fourth quarter.\n\n\n\nDavid Phipps, President of NextPlat and CEO of Global Operations, added, \"We have worked to transform our business in terms of products, services and capability to reach consumers globally, including completing the strategic acquisition of Outfitter Satellite and the merger of Progressive Care. These transactions bring unique value to NextPlat as we seek to leverage our existing capabilities to better serve our customers. We are particularly pleased with the continued momentum we are seeing in North America through Outfitter and in China for our initial health and wellness products catalogue supported by our new in-country marketing partner, providing confidence in the large opportunities ahead of us.\"\n\nThe financial information included in this press release should be read in conjunction with the Company's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, which was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission today.\n\n**About NextPlat Corp**\n\nNextPlat is a global e-commerce platform company created to capitalize on multiple high-growth sectors and markets including technology and healthcare.

(NASDAQ: OPK) (\"OPKO\") for the online sales of its OPKO Health Europe products in China including securing a new four-year extension and approval to exclusively market its products in Japan.\n\n[ ![OPKO Health product listing on Tmall Global](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2524437/OPKO_Health_Product_NextPlat_Corp.jpg) ](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2524437/OPKO_Health_Product_NextPlat_Corp.html \"Opens in a new window\")\n\nUnder terms of the [original exclusive e-commerce development program with OPKO](https://ir.nextplat.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/108/nextplats-florida-e-commerce-development-program-to-launch \"Opens in a new window\"), NextPlat launched a OPKO Health branded online storefront on Alibaba Group Holding Limited's (NYSE: BABA) (\"Alibaba\") Tmall Global e-commerce platform in China featuring an assortment of nutraceutical and veterinary products sold and distributed by OPKO Europe. The original one-year exclusive contract has been extended for four years and expanded to include additional e-commerce platforms and digital and social media marketing across China. Additionally, the e-commerce development program was expanded to include the exclusive rights for the sales and marketing of OPKO products to potentially millions of consumers in Japan. According to Statista, Japan was the third largest e-commerce market with revenue exceeding $151 billion in 2023 (source: [Ecommerce Market Size by Country, July 2024 Update, Oberlo](https://www.oberlo.com/statistics/ecommerce-sales-by-country \"Opens in a new window\")).\n\n\"The significant extension and expansion of our agreement with OPKO is evidence of the trust and confidence they have in our ability to penetrate the Chinese market, creating valuable new revenue streams for their business. Since we first launched our program in China through our exclusive relationships with Alibaba, we have successfully expanded our capabilities to provide unmatched turnkey access to millions of Chinese consumers through both online on offline channels. We believe our ability to tap into the broad reach of the most popular online and digital channels in China combined with highly targeted, on the ground experiential marketing capabilities, makes our e-commerce development program a compelling solution for any brand that wishes to reach the Chinese consumer and well enter other large regional markets such as Japan,\" said Charles M. Fernandez, Executive Chairman and CEO of NextPlat.\n\nAs announced previously, the Company has begun the sales of OPKO products in China and has recently engaged Chinese social media influencers and conducted experiential marketing programs targeting sports enthusiasts including trail runners and cyclists as part of its brand-building efforts. The Company is currently in the process of launching new online OPKO storefronts on leading digital sites in China including WeChat which has over 1.3 billion monthly users via the Youzan e-commerce platform, and on Xiaohongshu, a Chinese social media platform with more than 350 million active users on which it will collaborate with influencers and amateurs to increase product exposure and create positive buzz. The launch of a new OPKO storefront on JD.com, China's second largest e-commerce platform in China and a TikTok live stream event are planned during the fourth quarter of 2024. Additionally, the Company is seeking to secure physical distribution of OPKO products into major retail chains, pharmacies and grocery stores in the second half of 2025.\n\nDavid Phipps, President of NextPlat and CEO of Global Operations, added, \"We are encouraged by the early consumer interest we have generated for OPKO's products since our initial launch earlier this year. In the months ahead, we intend to build upon this interest by launching additional storefronts and further tapping into the power of digital marketing and social media engagement to help us reach a greater percentage of Chinese consumers, especially those interested in pursuing an active lifestyle and seeking new options for health and wellness. We look forward to leveraging the broad reach of our e-commerce development model to expand OPKO's presence into the large and valuable Japanese marketplace, the world's third largest e-commerce market in terms of revenue spent online.\"\n\nOPKO is a global diversified diagnostic and pharmaceutical healthcare company with over 5,500 employees spanning nine countries. The distribution agreement with OPKO's European division represents the first relationship resulting from the Company's Florida E-commerce Development program which includes a [merchant sourcing agreement with Alibaba's Tmall Global](https://ir.nextplat.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/102/nextplat-signs-merchant-sourcing-agreement-with-tmall \"Opens in a new window\") designed to provide American businesses with easy access to the Chinese consumer market.\n\n**About NextPlat Corp** NextPlat is a global e-commerce platform company created to capitalize on multiple high-growth sectors and markets including technology and healthcare.

          "content": "November 14, 2024\nNextPlat Reports $49.8 Million in\nConsolidated Revenue for the Nine Months\nEnded September 30, 2024, Representing a\n136% Increase Over 2023 Results\nCompany Sees Initial Sales Momentum in China for OPKO Health Products as it Prepares\nfor the Launch of its Florida Sunshine Brand of Vitamins and Supplements\nCOCONUT GROVE, Fla., Nov. 14, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- NextPlat Corp (NASDAQ: NXPL,\nNXPLW) (\"NextPlat\" or the \"Company\"), a global e-Commerce provider, today announced\nresults for its third fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024 which includes the consolidation\nof the operations of its e-Commerce Operations with the results of its Healthcare Operations\nfrom Progressive Care LLC (formerly Progressive Care Inc., or \"Progressive Care\").\n\"Top-line results for the first nine months of 2024 reflect the positive contributions of\nProgressive Care, providing us access into the large healthcare contracted services market,\nand our most recent acquisition, Outfitter Satellite, bolstering our e-Commerce business.\nThese transactions are expected to bring both significant long-term growth in their respective\nmarkets and importantly, drive positive cashflows as our team works to fully integrate them\nand implement cost-cutting measures through the fourth quarter of 2024, improving\nefficiencies and removing redundancies across the organization into 2025,\" said Charles M.\nFernandez, Executive Chairman and CEO of NextPlat Corp.\nThird Quarter 2024 Financial Highlights:\nConsolidated revenue for the third quarter of 2024 was approximately $15.4 million\ncompared to approximately $15.3 million in the same period last year. Total e-\nCommerce revenues were approximately $3.8 million and $2.9 million for the three\nmonths ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively, an increase of\napproximately 31% mainly due to the Outfitter acquisition on April 1, 2024. Total\nHealthcare Operations revenues were approximately $11.5 million and $12.4 million for\nthe three months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively, a decrease\nprimarily due to a decline in retail pharmacy prescription reimbursement rates in line\nwith continuing industry trends occurring with U.S. independent pharmacies.\nConsolidated revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was\napproximately $49.8 million, an increase of over 136% versus revenue of\napproximately $21.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily\nattributable to an increase of approximately $27.3 million from Healthcare Operations\nas a result of the Progressive Care acquisition on July 1, 2023. Based upon current\nexpectations, available product inventory and the number of new and existing\npharmacy service contracts, the Company currently expects full-year 2024 revenue to\nbe in the range of approximately $60 million to $65 million.\nGross profit margin for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, declined to 22.9%\nprimarily attributable to the decrease in retail prescription drug reimbursement rates in\nHealthcare Operations. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, overall gross\nprofit margin remained consistent at approximately 28% when compared to the prior\nyear period. Gross profit margin for e-Commerce Operations was 28.1%, remaining at\nnear record levels largely due to continued increases in higher margin recurring airtime\nrevenue. Gross profit margin for Healthcare Operations in the third quarter of 2024\nwas 21.2%. Healthcare Operations continues to experience pressures from medication\nprice increases despite reimbursement rates not keeping pace with those increases.\nOperating expenses for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, were approximately\n$11.5 million compared to approximately $8.1 million for the same period in 2023. A\nsignificant 45.2% decrease in recurring selling, general and administrative expenses in\nthe quarter were offset by a non-cash impairment loss of approximately $3.7 million\nrelated to intangible assets recognized in the Progressive Care acquisition. Additional\nexpenses included professional fees of approximately $2.1 million mainly attributable\nto costs related to the merger with Progressive Care as well as non-recurring litigation\nand other legal fees.\nAs a result of acquiring a controlling interest in Progressive Care on July 1, 2023,\nunder U.S. GAAP for mergers and acquisitions, the Company recorded previously\nunrecognized goodwill and other intangibles which were recorded at fair values based\non Progressive Care's stock price on July 1, 2023 as well as estimates of future book\nof business. Declines in Progressive Care's stock price and changes in its estimated\nbook of business caused a decline in the fair value of the goodwill and intangibles.\nThus, under U.S. GAAP, the Company was required to adjust its fair value estimates\nfor goodwill and the intangibles resulting in non-cash impairment losses totaling\n$13.7 million recognized during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The\nCompany now expects no further impairment losses from the acquisition of\nProgressive Care.\nYear-to-date, the Company recorded a total of approximately $34.9 million in\noperating expenses, which included non-recurring expenses of approximately\n$13.7 million in non-cash impairment losses and approximately $3.4 million in\nexpenses related to the merger with Progressive Care.\nThe Company expects significant annual reductions in operating costs through\ncost savings from ongoing integration efforts of Progressive Care. These efforts\ninclude trimming delivery costs, rightsizing staffing, and removing duplicated\npublic company expenses including professional services such as legal and\naccounting services, as well as the reduction of other selling, general and\nadministrative costs by eliminating existing redundancies.\nNet loss attributable to NextPlat Corp common shareholders for the quarter ended\nSeptember 30, 2024, was approximately $4.2 million, or ($0.22) per diluted share,\ncompared to a net income attributable to NextPlat Corp common shareholders of\napproximately $3.4 million, or $0.17 diluted earnings per share, reported for the\nquarter ended September 30, 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024,\nnet loss attributable to NextPlat Corp common shareholders was approximately\n$11.0 million, or ($0.58) per diluted share, compared to a net loss attributable to\nNextPlat Corp common shareholders of approximately $2.1 million, or ($0.12) per\ndiluted share.\nThe Company ended the third quarter of 2024 with approximately $20.4 million in cash\nrepresenting a net cash burn of approximately $5.9 million year-to-date. The use of\ncash primarily consisted of approximately $3.4 million in non-recurring operating\nexpenses plus approximately $1.0 million related to the Outfitter acquisition, and\napproximately $1.5 million used in recurring operating expenses.\nOrganizational Highlights and Recent Business Developments:\nOn October 1, 2024, the Company completed its proposed merger with Progressive\nCare in an all-stock transaction, resulting in Progressive Care becoming a wholly\nowned subsidiary of NextPlat. Representing the Company's Healthcare Operations,\nProgressive Care continues to support the needs of a growing number of 340B\ncontracted healthcare entities as well as long-term care and assisted living facilities.\nIn the third quarter, Healthcare Operations filled approximately 128,000 pharmacy\nprescriptions, a 5% increase from the 122,000 pharmacy prescriptions filled in the\nyear-ago quarter. The Company continues to add pharmacy service contracts with\n340B covered entities which are expected to represent a greater proportion of\nHealthcare Operations revenue going forward, contributing to increased services and\nprescription revenues throughout the remainder of fiscal 2024 and into fiscal 2025.\nThese contracts have a greater profit margin than the Company's traditional retail\npharmacy business.\nThe Company's technology e-commerce business continued to see increased global\ndemand for satellite-enabled communications devices, producing sales to customers in\n95 countries during the third quarter. Recurring, high-margin airtime revenue in the\nthird quarter of 2024 increased to record levels, reflecting growth of 94% vs. 2023\nlevels driven by both organic growth and the addition of Outfitter Satellite which was\nacquired in April 2024.\nIn July, the Company significantly expanded the scope of its e-commerce program in\nChina to include broad retail distribution and digital/social media marketing capabilities\nthrough a new partner. Several online and offline marketing programs in support of the\nOPKO Healthcare (Nasdaq: OPK) (\"OPKO\")-branded site on Alibaba Group Holding\nLimited's (NYSE: BABA) (\"Alibaba\") Tmall Global have already been conducted and\nproduct interest and sales continue to grow as in-country product availability increases.\nRecently, OPKO's \"ArtilaneÂ®\" joint care product was featured as a Tmall \"Top 10 Most\nPopular New Products For Healthcare\" list based upon comprehensive data such as\nproduct clicks, collections, and purchases. In October, NextPlat was awarded a four-\nyear extension of the OPKO Healthcare e-commerce program for China which was\nexpanded to include product sales in Japan.\nDuring the quarter, the Company continued to advance the launch of its Florida\nSunshine line of branded vitamins and supplements with the initial launch of its\ninternational e-commerce storefronts in the United Kingdom and on Amazon UK.\nInternational launch plans are currently in development and Florida Sunshine products\nare expected to be made available to Chinese consumers on multiple online\nmarketplaces and be featured in campaigns conducted by social media influencers and\nbloggers starting late in the fourth quarter.\nDavid Phipps, President of NextPlat and CEO of Global Operations, added, \"We have\nworked to transform our business in terms of products, services and capability to reach\nconsumers globally, including completing the strategic acquisition of Outfitter Satellite and\nthe merger of Progressive Care. These transactions bring unique value to NextPlat as we\nseek to leverage our existing capabilities to better serve our customers. We are particularly\npleased with the continued momentum we are seeing in North America through Outfitter and\nin China for our initial health and wellness products catalogue supported by our new in-\ncountry marketing partner, providing confidence in the large opportunities ahead of us.\"\nThe financial information included in this press release should be read in conjunction with\nthe Company's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2024,\nwhich was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission today.\nAbout NextPlat Corp\nNextPlat is a global e-commerce platform company created to capitalize on multiple high-\ngrowth sectors and markets including technology and healthcare.

These transactions are expected to bring both significant long-term growth in their respective markets and importantly, drive positive cashflows as our team works to fully integrate them and implement cost-cutting measures through the fourth quarter of 2024, improving efficiencies and removing redundancies across the organization into 2025,\" said Charles M. Fernandez, Executive Chairman and CEO of NextPlat Corp.\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Highlights:**\n\n  * Consolidated revenue for the third quarter of 2024 was approximately $15.4 million compared to approximately $15.3 million in the same period last year. Total e-Commerce revenues were approximately $3.8 million and $2.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively, an increase of approximately 31% mainly due to the Outfitter acquisition on April 1, 2024. Total Healthcare Operations revenues were approximately $11.5 million and $12.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively, a decrease primarily due to a decline in retail pharmacy prescription reimbursement rates in line with continuing industry trends occurring with U.S. independent pharmacies. Consolidated revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was approximately $49.8 million, an increase of over 136% versus revenue of approximately $21.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily attributable to an increase of approximately $27.3 million from Healthcare Operations as a result of the Progressive Care acquisition on July 1, 2023. Based upon current expectations, available product inventory and the number of new and existing pharmacy service contracts, the Company currently expects full-year 2024 revenue to be in the range of approximately $60 million to $65 million.\n  * Gross profit margin for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, declined to 22.9% primarily attributable to the decrease in retail prescription drug reimbursement rates in Healthcare Operations. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, overall gross profit margin remained consistent at approximately 28% when compared to the prior year period. Gross profit margin for e-Commerce Operations was 28.1%, remaining at near record levels largely due to continued increases in higher margin recurring airtime revenue. Gross profit margin for Healthcare Operations in the third quarter of 2024 was 21.2%. Healthcare Operations continues to experience pressures from medication price increases despite reimbursement rates not keeping pace with those increases.\n  * Operating expenses for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, were approximately $11.5 million compared to approximately $8.1 million for the same period in 2023. A significant 45.2% decrease in recurring selling, general and administrative expenses in the quarter were offset by a non-cash impairment loss of approximately $3.7 million related to intangible assets recognized in the Progressive Care acquisition. Additional expenses included professional fees of approximately $2.1 million mainly attributable to costs related to the merger with Progressive Care as well as non-recurring litigation and other legal fees.\n  * As a result of acquiring a controlling interest in Progressive Care on July 1, 2023, under U.S. GAAP for mergers and acquisitions, the Company recorded previously unrecognized goodwill and other intangibles which were recorded at fair values based on Progressive Care's stock price on July 1, 2023 as well as estimates of future book of business. Declines in Progressive Care's stock price and changes in its estimated book of business caused a decline in the fair value of the goodwill and intangibles. Thus, under U.S. GAAP, the Company was required to adjust its fair value estimates for goodwill and the intangibles resulting in non-cash impairment losses totaling $13.7 million recognized during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The Company now expects no further impairment losses from the acquisition of Progressive Care.\n    * Year-to-date, the Company recorded a total of approximately $34.9 million in operating expenses, which included non-recurring expenses of approximately $13.7 million in non-cash impairment losses and approximately $3.4 million in expenses related to the merger with Progressive Care.\n    * The Company expects significant annual reductions in operating costs through cost savings from ongoing integration efforts of Progressive Care. These efforts include trimming delivery costs, rightsizing staffing, and removing duplicated public company expenses including professional services such as legal and accounting services, as well as the reduction of other selling, general and administrative costs by eliminating existing redundancies.\n  * Net loss attributable to NextPlat Corp common shareholders for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, was approximately $4.2 million, or ($0.22) per diluted share, compared to a net income attributable to NextPlat Corp common shareholders of approximately $3.4 million, or $0.17 diluted earnings per share, reported for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net loss attributable to NextPlat Corp common shareholders was approximately $11.0 million, or ($0.58) per diluted share, compared to a net loss attributable to NextPlat Corp common shareholders of approximately $2.1 million, or ($0.12) per diluted share.\n  * The Company ended the third quarter of 2024 with approximately $20.4 million in cash representing a net cash burn of approximately $5.9 million year-to-date. The use of cash primarily consisted of approximately $3.4 million in non-recurring operating expenses plus approximately $1.0 million related to the Outfitter acquisition, and approximately $1.5 million used in recurring operating expenses.\n\n\n\n**Organizational Highlights and Recent Business Developments:**\n\n  * [On October 1, 2024, the Company completed its proposed merger with Progressive Care in an all-stock transaction, resulting in Progressive Care becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of NextPlat](https://ir.nextplat.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/124/nextplat-announces-completion-of-merger-and-business \"Opens in a new window\"). Representing the Company's Healthcare Operations, Progressive Care continues to support the needs of a growing number of 340B contracted healthcare entities as well as long-term care and assisted living facilities.\n  * In the third quarter, Healthcare Operations filled approximately 128,000 pharmacy prescriptions, a 5% increase from the 122,000 pharmacy prescriptions filled in the year-ago quarter. The Company continues to add pharmacy service contracts with 340B covered entities which are expected to represent a greater proportion of Healthcare Operations revenue going forward, contributing to increased services and prescription revenues throughout the remainder of fiscal 2024 and into fiscal 2025. These contracts have a greater profit margin than the Company's traditional retail pharmacy business.\n  * The Company's technology e-commerce business continued to see increased global demand for satellite-enabled communications devices, producing sales to customers in 95 countries during the third quarter. Recurring, high-margin airtime revenue in the third quarter of 2024 increased to record levels, reflecting growth of 94% vs. 2023 levels driven by both organic growth and the addition of Outfitter Satellite which was acquired in April 2024.\n  * In July, [the Company significantly expanded the scope of its e-commerce program in China to include broad retail distribution and digital/social media marketing capabilities through a new partner](https://ir.nextplat.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/119/nextplat-expands-e-commerce-program-in-china-to-include \"Opens in a new window\"). Several online and offline marketing programs in support of the OPKO Healthcare (Nasdaq: OPK) (\"OPKO\")-branded site on Alibaba Group Holding Limited's (NYSE: BABA) (\"Alibaba\") Tmall Global have already been conducted and product interest and sales continue to grow as in-country product availability increases. Recently, [OPKO's \"ArtilaneÂ®\" joint care product](https://opkoeurope.com/en/product/artilane-classic/ \"Opens in a new window\") was featured as a Tmall \"Top 10 Most Popular New Products For Healthcare\" list based upon comprehensive data such as product clicks, collections, and purchases. [In October, NextPlat was awarded a four-year extension of the OPKO Healthcare e-commerce program for China which was expanded to include product sales in Japan](https://ir.nextplat.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/125/nextplat-secures-four-year-extension-of-opko-healthcare \"Opens in a new window\").\n  * During the quarter, the Company continued to advance the launch of its Florida Sunshine line of branded vitamins and supplements with the initial launch of its international e-commerce storefronts in the [United Kingdom](https://floridasunshine.co.uk/ \"Opens in a new window\") and on [Amazon UK](https://www.amazon.co.uk/stores/page/17E57B2D-7E11-4F18-8190-74E69A83555E?ingress=0&visitId=57ae43a6-0777-4784-a2d0-97c78a6cdbae&ref_=pe_21846591_789010401 \"Opens in a new window\"). International launch plans are currently in development and Florida Sunshine products are expected to be made available to Chinese consumers on multiple online marketplaces and be featured in campaigns conducted by social media influencers and bloggers starting late in the fourth quarter.\n\n\n\nDavid Phipps, President of NextPlat and CEO of Global Operations, added, \"We have worked to transform our business in terms of products, services and capability to reach consumers globally, including completing the strategic acquisition of Outfitter Satellite and the merger of Progressive Care. These transactions bring unique value to NextPlat as we seek to leverage our existing capabilities to better serve our customers. We are particularly pleased with the continued momentum we are seeing in North America through Outfitter and in China for our initial health and wellness products catalogue supported by our new in-country marketing partner, providing confidence in the large opportunities ahead of us.\"\n\nThe financial information included in this press release should be read in conjunction with the Company's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, which was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission today.\n\n**About NextPlat Corp**\n\nNextPlat is a global e-commerce platform company created to capitalize on multiple high-growth sectors and markets including technology and healthcare.
