This proposal, which is commonly referred to as “say-on-pay”, is required by the\nDodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, which added Section 14A to the Securities\nExchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act). The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of the\nCompany’s common stock represented at the meeting is required to approve Proposal Two. Abstentions and votes\nagainst may be specified on this proposal. Since the approval of Proposal Two requires the approval of the holders\nof a majority of the shares of the Company’s common stock represented at the meeting, abstentions, broker non-\nvotes (see below) and votes against will have the effect of a negative vote.\nBrokers cannot vote on their customers’ behalf on “non-routine” proposals (Proposals One and Two)\nwithout voting instructions from their customers. Because brokers require their customers’ direction to vote on such\nnon-routine matters, it is critical that stockholders provide their brokers with voting instructions. If you hold your\nshares in street name and do not provide voting instructions to your bank, broker or other custodian, your shares will\nnot be voted on Proposals One, Two and Three (a “broker non-vote”). Because a plurality of votes cast will be used\nto determine the results of the election of directors (Proposal One), abstentions and broker non-votes will have no\n1\neffect on the outcome of the votes on Proposal One. Abstentions, however, are counted towards establishing a\nquorum for the Annual Meeting.\nWith respect to Proposal Three, the Company is providing you with the opportunity to ratify the\nappointment of our Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm. The affirmative vote of the holders of a\nmajority of the shares of the Company’s common stock represented at the meeting is required to ratify Proposal\nThree. Abstentions and votes against may be specified on this proposal. Brokers and other record holders have\ndiscretion to vote on this proposal in the absence of written instructions from the beneficial holder of shares. Since\nthe ratification of Proposal Three requires the approval of the holders of a majority of the shares of the Company’s\ncommon stock represented at the meeting, abstentions and votes against will have the effect of a negative vote.\nApproximately 739 of our stockholders hold their shares through a stockbroker, bank, trustee, or other\nnominee (Beneficial Owner), and approximately 636 of our stockholders hold their shares directly in their own name\n(Stockholder of Record). As summarized below, there are some distinctions between shares held beneficially and\nthose owned of record.\nBeneficial Owner: If your shares are held in a stock brokerage account or by a bank, broker, trustee, or\nother nominee, you are considered the beneficial owner of shares held in “street name” and these proxy materials are\nbeing made available to you through your bank, broker, trustee, or nominee, which is considered the stockholder of\nrecord of those shares. As the beneficial owner, you have the right to direct your bank, broker, trustee, or nominee\non how to vote the shares you own beneficially, and you are also invited to attend the meeting via the live audio\nwebcast and/or the telephone conference call. Your bank, broker, trustee, or nominee is obligated to provide you\nwith voting instructions for use in instructing the bank, broker, trustee, or nominee how to vote these shares.\nHowever, since you are not the stockholder of record, you may not vote these shares unless you have a proxy from\nthe bank, broker, trustee or nominee that is the holder of record of the shares giving you the right as beneficial owner\nto vote the shares during the live audio webcast meeting via the telephone conference call link. If you do not give\ninstructions to your bank, brokerage firm, trustee or other nominee, they will not be allowed to vote your shares with\nrespect to certain “non-discretionary” proposals, but will be able to vote your shares with respect to certain\n“discretionary” proposals. The election of directors (Proposal One) and the advisory vote to approve executive\ncompensation (Proposal Two) are considered to be “non-discretionary” proposals on which banks and brokerage\nfirms may not vote without instructions from the beneficial owner. “Broker non-votes” for “non-discretionary”\nproposals are votes with respect to shares that are held in “street name” by a bank, brokerage firm, trustee or other\nnominee that indicates on its proxy that it does not have discretionary authority to vote on a particular matter. The\nratification of the appointment of our Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm (Proposal Three) is\nconsidered to be a “discretionary” proposal on which banks, brokerage firms, trustees or other nominees may vote in\nthe absence of instructions from the beneficial owner.\nStockholder of Record: If your shares are registered directly in your name with ImmuCell’s transfer agent,\nEquiniti Trust Company LLC, you are considered the stockholder of record of those shares and these proxy\nmaterials are being made available directly to you by the Company. As the stockholder of record, you have the right\nto grant your voting proxy directly to the Company or to vote in person at the live audio webcast meeting via the\ntelephone conference call link.\nVoting Results: The preliminary voting results will be announced at the meeting. The final voting results\nwill be tallied by the voting inspector and reported in a Current Report on Form 8-K, which will be filed with the\nSEC within four business days after the meeting.\nEXPENSES AND SOLICITATION\nThe cost of preparing, assembling, and mailing the proxy material and of reimbursing banks, brokers,\nnominees and fiduciaries for the out-of-pocket and clerical expenses of transmitting copies of the proxy material to\nthe beneficial owners of shares held of record by such persons will be borne by the Company. Although the\nCompany reserves the right to do so, the Company does not currently intend to solicit proxies otherwise than by use\nof the mail, but certain officers, employees and advisors of the Company, without additional compensation, may use\ntheir personal efforts, by telephone or otherwise, to obtain proxies.\n2\nSTOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS, DIRECTOR NOMINATIONS AND COMMUNICATIONS\nProposals (other than director nominations, which are addressed in the following paragraph) of\nstockholders of the Company intended to be presented at the 2024 Annual Meeting of Stockholders must be received\nby the Company at its principal place of business no later than December 31, 2023 (which date is 120 days prior to\nthe first anniversary of on or about when the 2023 Proxy Statement was first mailed to stockholders) to be eligible\nfor possible inclusion in the Company’s Proxy Statement and form of proxy relating to the 2024 meeting. Certified\nmail addressed to the Secretary of the Company is advised. No such proposals were received by the Company by\nDecember 31, 2023 for inclusion in the Company’s Proxy Statement and form of proxy relating to the 2024 Annual\nMeeting of Stockholders.\nThe Nominating Committee of the Board of Directors will consider nominees for director recommended by\nstockholders, applying the same evaluation standards as it would apply to candidates identified by management,\nother members of the Board of Directors or the Nominating Committee. Recommendations for director nominees\nmay be sent to the Nominating Committee through the Secretary of the Company. Under the advance notice\nprovisions in the Company’s By-laws, stockholders intending to formally nominate a person for election as a\ndirector at the Annual Meeting, as distinguished from recommending a candidate to the Nominating Committee,\nmust notify the Nominating Committee through the Secretary of the Company in writing of this intent not less than\n60 nor more than 90 days prior to the first anniversary of the preceding year’s Annual Meeting and meet other\nrequirements set forth in the By-laws. If the date of the Annual Meeting is changed by more than 30 days from such\nanniversary date, the notice from the stockholder must be received not later than the close of business on the tenth\nday following the day on which notice of the date of such Annual Meeting was mailed to stockholders. Such notice\nmust comply with the provisions set forth in the By-laws. No such nomination by stockholders was received by the\nSecretary of the Company for consideration in connection with the 2024 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. A copy of\nthe relevant provisions of the By-laws will be sent to any stockholder who requests these in writing. Such requests\nshould be addressed to the Secretary of the Company.\nStockholders that wish to send communications to the Board of Directors for any reason may do so by mail\nsent to ImmuCell Corporation, 56 Evergreen Drive, Portland, Maine 04103, Attention: Secretary. The Secretary is\nresponsible for bringing any such communications to the attention of the full Board of Directors at its next regularly\nscheduled meeting, which is generally quarterly. Additionally, after adjournment of the formal business matters at\neach year’s Annual Meeting, there is an opportunity for stockholders to communicate directly with the Company’s\nmanagement and directors. All directors attended the 2023 Annual Meeting of Stockholders virtually and plan to\nattend the 2024 Annual Meeting of Stockholders virtually.\nAll shares represented by proxies in the form enclosed herewith will be voted at the meeting and\nadjournments thereof in accordance with the terms of such proxies and the pertinent statements included herein\nrelative to the exercise of the power granted by said proxies, provided such proxies appear to be valid and executed\nby stockholders of record entitled to vote thereat and have not previously been revoked. A proxy may be revoked at\nany time prior to its exercise by the filing with the Secretary of the Company of an instrument revoking such proxy\nor a duly executed proxy bearing a later date. A stockholder’s proxy will not be voted if the stockholder attends the\nvirtual meeting and elects to vote in person (during the live audio webcast via the telephone conference link). Where\nthe person solicited specifies in his, her or its proxy a choice with respect to any matter to be acted upon, the shares\nwill be voted in accordance with the specification so made. If a stockholder fails to so specify with respect to such\nproposals, the proxy will be voted FOR the election of the nominees listed in Proposal One, FOR the advisory vote\nto approve executive compensation outlined in Proposal Two and FOR the ratification of the appointment of the\nIndependent Registered Public Accounting Firm described in Proposal Three.\nLEADERSHIP STRUCTURE OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS\nWith approval from the Board of Directors, the Compensation and Stock Option Committee determined\nthat the title of President and CEO should be given to an individual not being the same person holding the title of\nChair. The objective of this policy is to avoid a concentration of authority in any one person. Mr. Michael F.\nBrigham has served as President and CEO since February 2000. He also serves as the Company’s Principal\nFinancial Officer. Mr. Brigham is responsible for the day-to-day operations of the Company and for managing the\nactions of the two other executive officers, as well as those of several senior managers. Since February 2013, Dr.\n3\nDavid S. Tomsche has served as Chair of the Board of Directors, leading the Company as its independent non-\nexecutive board chair. Dr. Tomsche works with the CEO in preparing the agenda for each board meeting and\npresides over all board meetings and meetings of the non-employee directors. He provides advice to the CEO and\nserves as principal liaison between the board and the CEO. Ms. Bobbi Jo Brockmann has served as Vice President of\nSales and Marketing since February 2015. Ms. Elizabeth L. Williams has served as Vice President of Manufacturing\nOperations since April 2016. It is the policy of the Board of Directors to have a portion of the meeting without the\npresence of the executive officers each time that the board or any of its committees meets to assure that candid\ndiscussions of business matters are conducted with and without the influence of the executive officers. The board\ndelegates certain authority and responsibility to its committees, as described below.\nTHE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND ITS COMMITTEES\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, the Board of Directors of the Company held four regular\nmeetings and two special meetings and took action by unanimous written consent four times. The committees of the\nBoard of Directors are the Audit Committee, the Compensation and Stock Option Committee and the Nominating\nCommittee. During the year ended December 31, 2023, each director attended at least 75 percent of the aggregate of\n(i) the total number of meetings of the Board of Directors and (ii) the total number of meetings held by all\ncommittees of the board on which he or she served (during the periods that he or she served). The board has not set a\nformal policy for required meeting attendance. A high level of attendance and participation is expected, and to date\ndirectors have fulfilled this expectation. At the first meeting of the board following this year’s Annual Meeting,\nexecutive officers will be appointed and, effective upon the election of directors at this year’s Annual Meeting,\ndirectors will be appointed to serve on the various board committees until the next Annual Meeting and until their\nsuccessors are elected.\nThe Board of Directors has established an Audit Committee for the purpose of overseeing the accounting\nand financial reporting processes of the Company and the audits and reviews of its financial statements. The Audit\nCommittee engages the Company’s Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm, consults with such auditors\nwith regard to audit plans, reviews the annual reports of the independent auditors, oversees the adequacy of the\nCompany’s internal operating procedures and controls, meets with management and the auditors to review quarterly\nand annual financial results, authorizes the public release of press releases covering financial results, reviews and\nauthorizes quarterly and annual reports filed with the SEC and otherwise oversees compliance with certain legal,\nethical and regulatory matters. The development and manufacture of efficacious products with and without\nregulatory approval is subject to considerable risk. The Audit Committee takes the lead on oversight of credit,\nliquidity and operational risk, but the entire board, in conjunction with the executive officers, is very involved with\nreviewing Audit Committee recommendations and making independent assessments of risks in all areas of the\nCompany’s business. The Company does not have a specific risk management department, but the Company’s\nDirector of Finance and Administration and its President and CEO manage and contract for the Company’s\ninsurance coverages in consultation with outside experts, in addition to identifying, managing and monitoring risk in\nareas not specifically covered by insurance. The Director of Finance and Administration reports to the President and\nCEO, who reports to the board. The Audit Committee’s current members are Mr. Gathagan, Mr. Rosgen, Dr.\nTomsche and Mr. Wainman. Mr. Wainman serves as Chair of the Audit Committee. All members of the Audit\nCommittee meet the heightened independence and expertise requirements for audit committees under applicable\nSEC and NASDAQ Stock Market rules. The Audit Committee held eight meetings during the year ended December\n31, 2023. The Audit Committee Report can be found later in this Proxy Statement, and the “Charter and Powers of\nthe Audit Committee” has been posted on the Company’s website (http://immucell.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2017/05/charter.pdf). Information on the Company’s website does not constitute part of this Proxy\nStatement.\nThe Board of Directors has established a Compensation and Stock Option Committee (Compensation\nCommittee) for the purpose of reviewing and recommending salary, bonus and other benefits for executive officers\nand directors of the Company. The Compensation Committee is responsible for administering the Company’s 2010\nStock Option and Incentive Plan and the 2017 Stock Option and Incentive Plan. The Compensation Committee’s\ncurrent members are Ms. Basse and Mr. Rosgen, each of whom are independent directors. Mr. Rosgen serves as\nChair of the Compensation Committee. The Compensation Committee held six meetings during the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023. The Compensation Committee does not have a charter but instead operates within the authority\nprovided by the Company’s By-laws and authorizing resolutions adopted by the board. Its recommendations on\n4\nexecutive and director compensation are subject to review and final approval by the Board of Directors, a majority\nof whose members are independent directors. The Compensation Committee considers recommendations from Mr.\nBrigham, the Company’s President and CEO, relevant to a determination of executive and director compensation,\nbut neither he nor Ms. Brockmann participates in votes of the Compensation Committee or the board in this regard.\nIn recent years, the Compensation Committee has not retained or relied upon outside consultants to assist in its\ndetermination of executive or director compensation but does consider available compensation data. During the end\nof 2021 and beginning of 2022, the Compensation Committee did consider certain information provided by a\nconsultant.\nThe Board of Directors has established a Nominating Committee for the purpose of recommending to the\nfull board the number of directors to serve on the board, criteria for board membership and nominees for election to\nthe board. In doing so, the Nominating Committee considers the integrity and relevant business experience of each\nnominee. The Nominating Committee values diversity, believing that the Company benefits from decision making\nthat includes a range of opinions, points of view and experience. For instance, the Nominating Committee would not\nwant a board comprised only of directors having principally financial expertise or only of directors whose principal\nexperience is in the dairy and beef industries. Likewise, the Nominating Committee believes that a board consisting\nof all men or all women would not be as strong as a gender-diverse board. While there is always room for\nimprovement, the Nominating Committee believes that it has made substantial progress towards achieving these\nboard diversity goals. To be considered for nomination to the board, a candidate must meet the following minimum\ncriteria: 1) reputation for integrity and high ethical standards, 2) willingness and ability to contribute positively to\nthe Company’s decision-making process, 3) absence of any conflict of interest, or appearance of conflict of interest\nand 4) commitment to understanding the Company’s business and associated business risks and to devoting\nadequate time and effort to create value for the Company and its stockholders. All nominees included on this year’s\nproxy card were recommended by the Nominating Committee and then approved by a vote of the board. The\nCommittee’s current members are Ms. Basse and Mr. Wainman, each of whom are independent directors. Ms. Basse\nserves as Chair of the Nominating Committee. The Nominating Committee held three meetings during the year\nended December 31, 2023. Provisions for stockholders to nominate candidates for election as directors are described\nabove under the caption, “STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS, DIRECTOR NOMINATIONS AND\nCOMMUNICATIONS”. Upon recommendation of the Nominating Committee, the Board of Directors adopted a\ncharter for the Nominating Committee in December 2012. This charter sets forth the policy to be utilized by the\nNominating Committee in considering nominees identified by management to serve as directors for the Company.\nThe Charter of the Nominating Committee has been posted to the Company’s website (http://immucell.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/04/Nominating-Committee-Charter.pdf). The Nominating Committee applies the same\nevaluation standards in considering nominees for director recommended by stockholders.\nDIRECTOR COMPENSATION\nThe following table contains information as to the compensation paid by the Company to its non-executive\ndirectors for services rendered during the year ended December 31, 2023:\nFees\nEarned or Stock\nPaid Option All Other\nName in Cash Awards(1)(2) Compensation Total\nGloria J.

These options had an\nexercise price equal to $7.08 per share, which was the fair market value of the common stock on the date of grant,\nand they vested on March 18, 2021. These options expired March 18, 2023.

In evaluating the independence of directors, the\nboard did consider the matters described above under the caption “CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS, RELATED\nTRANSACTIONS, AND DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE”. If any of the individuals named above should not be\navailable for election as contemplated, it is the intention of the persons named in the proxy to vote for such other\nperson or persons as management may recommend. Management has no reason to believe any nominees will be\nunavailable. Any vacancies that may occur during the year may be filled by the Board of Directors to serve until the\nnext Annual Meeting.\nUnder Nasdaq’s Board Diversity Rule, all operating companies listed on Nasdaq’s U.S. exchange are\nrequired to publicly disclose diversity statistics regarding their Board of Directors using the Board Diversity Matrix.\nThe following chart describes the diversity characteristics of the seven directors serving the Company as of the filing\ndate of this Proxy Statement:\nBoard Diversity Matrix\nBoard Size:\nTotal Number of Directors 7\nFemale Male Non-Binary Did not Disclose\nGender\nGender:\nDirectors 2 5 0 0\nNumber of Directors who identify in Any of the Categories Below:\nAfrican American or Black 0 0 0 0\nAlaskan Native or Native American 0 0 0 0\nAsian (other than South Asian) 0 0 0 0\nSouth Asian 0 0 0 0\nHispanic or Latinx 0 0 0 0\nNative Hawaiian or Pacific Islander 0 0 0 0\nWhite 2 5 0 0\nTwo or More Races or Ethnicities 0 0 0 0\nLGBTQ+ 0\nPersons with Disabilities 0\nThe Board of Directors recommends that you vote FOR the election of the seven nominees listed above.\nNON-BINDING, ADVISORY VOTE TO APPROVE EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION (Proposal Two)\n17\nAs required by Section 14A of the Exchange Act, which was enacted pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Wall\nStreet Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, the Company is asking its stockholders to approve, on a non-\nbinding, advisory basis, the compensation of its named executive officers, as disclosed in this Proxy Statement\npursuant to the compensation disclosure rules of the SEC. This proposal is commonly referred to as \"say-on-pay.\"\nWe currently present such proposal to stockholders on an annual basis.\nWe maintain a simple executive compensation program that consists almost entirely of base salary and\nperiodic stock option grants, with the possibility of annual discretionary bonuses and some contractually delineated\nbonus opportunities described above. Annual bonus payments awarded to these named executive officers by the\nCompany since 2020 have been limited to $25,000, $22,500 and $12,645 of variable compensation and discretionary\nbonuses paid to Ms. Brockmann in March of 2023, March of 2022 and February of 2021, respectively, and $25,000\nand $5,000 of variable compensation and discretionary bonuses paid to Ms. Williams in August of 2023 and\nFebruary of 2020. These elements of compensation have been selected by the Compensation and Stock Option\nCommittee (Compensation Committee) because the Compensation Committee believes that they effectively achieve\nthe fundamental goals of our compensation program, which are to attract, motivate, retain and reward exceptionally\ntalented executives; to align executive interests and stockholder interests through an appropriate mix of long-term\nand short-term incentives; and to maximize the financial efficiency of the program from risk, tax, accounting, and\ncash flow perspectives.\nExcept as described above, including under “EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENTS” above, the Company\ndoes not provide any compensation or benefit plans to these named executive officers that are not also available to\nother employees. The Company differentiates among key employees primarily based on size of base salary and size\nand frequency of stock option grants. Annual compensation decisions for the named executive officers are made by\nthe Compensation Committee based on performance and market-related factors. Features of our compensation\nprogram for the named executive officers include the following:\n● A majority of total compensation is fixed but is regularly reviewed and evaluated based on both long-\nterm and short-term corporate performance.\n● As described above under “EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENTS”, the Company has entered into a\nDeferred Compensation Agreement with Mr. Brigham providing for certain deferred compensation and\nseverance payments to Mr. Brigham under certain circumstances.\n● As also described above under “EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENTS”, the Company has entered into\nincentive compensation agreements with each of the named executive officers, except for Mr.\nBrigham, that provide for certain variable compensation if certain financial results and regulatory\nobjectives are achieved.\n● Equity awards, which consist of stock options, generally vest after a three-year period. The\nCompensation Committee believes that such awards, as well as their vesting schedules, align the\ninterests of key employees and stockholders.\n● From time to time, the Compensation Committee reviews compensation against a peer group\n(companies of similar size and structure and most often in the same industry) and considers the\nopinions of independent consultants with regards to the estimated replacement costs for current\nexecutive officers to ensure that total compensation is both competitive and appropriate.\n● The Compensation Committee annually reviews risk associated with our compensation program to\nensure that our program does not create incentives that would encourage subjecting the Company to\nrisks that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company.\nThe Company is asking its stockholders to indicate their support for the executive compensation as\ndescribed in this Proxy Statement. This vote is not intended to address any specific item of compensation, but rather\nthe overall compensation of the named executive officers and the philosophy, policies and practices described in this\n18\nproxy statement. Our Board of Directors is asking stockholders to approve a non-binding, advisory vote on the\nfollowing resolution:\nRESOLVED, that the compensation paid to the named executive officers of the Company, as disclosed\npursuant to Item 402 of Regulation S-K, including the “SUMMARY COMPENSATION TABLE” and\n“OUTSTANDING EQUITY AWARDS” table, is hereby approved.\nAs an advisory vote, this proposal is not binding. The outcome of this advisory vote does not overrule any\ndecision by the Company or the Board of Directors (or any committee thereof), create or imply any change to the\nfiduciary duties of the Company or the Board of Directors (or any committee thereof), or create or imply any\nadditional fiduciary duties for the Company or the Board of Directors (or any committee thereof). However, the\nCompensation Committee and Board of Directors value the opinions expressed by stockholders in their vote on this\nproposal and will consider the outcome of the vote when making future compensation decisions for these key\nemployees.\nThe Board of Directors recommends that you vote FOR the approval of the non-binding, advisory\nresolution on compensation for the named executive officers.\nRATIFICATION OF APPOINTMENT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC\nACCOUNTING FIRM (Proposal Three)\nOn March 18, 2024, the Audit Committee appointed Wipfli LLP to serve as our Independent Registered\nPublic Accounting Firm for the year ending December 31, 2024. The Audit Committee’s engagement of this firm\nwas made in accordance with procedures contemplated in that committee’s charter. This decision is expected to be\nratified by the Board of Directors at its next regularly scheduled meeting.\nAlthough stockholder approval of the Audit Committee’s selection of Wipfli LLP is not required by law,\nthe Board of Directors believes that it is advisable to give stockholders an opportunity to ratify this selection. A\nrepresentative of Wipfli LLP is expected to be present (virtually) at the Annual Meeting with an opportunity to make\na statement if he or she desires to do so and is expected to be available to respond to appropriate questions during\nthe live audio webcast via the telephone conference call link. If this proposal is not approved at the Annual Meeting,\nthe Audit Committee will reconsider its selection of Wipfli LLP. Even if the appointment is ratified, the Audit\nCommittee, in its discretion, can direct the appointment of a different firm at any time during the year if the Audit\nCommittee determines that such a change would be in the Company’s and the stockholders’ best interests.\nPrincipal Accounting Fees and Services\nOn April 12, 2019, the Audit Committee appointed Wipfli LLP for the first time as its Independent\nRegistered Public Accounting Firm (IRPAF) for the year ended December 31, 2019 beginning with a customary\nreview of the Company’s financial statements as of and for the quarter ended March 31, 2019. On March 20, 2020,\nthe Audit Committee appointed Wipfli LLP as its IRPAF for the year ended December 31, 2020. On March 23,\n2021, the Audit Committee appointed Wipfli as its IRPAF for the year ended December 31, 2021. On March 23,\n2022, the Audit Committee appointed Wipfli as its IRPAF for the year ended December 31, 2022. On March 22,\n2023, the Audit Committee appointed Wipfli as its IRPAF for the year ended December 31, 2023. In each case,\nthese appointments were subsequently ratified by the Board of Directors.\nSet forth below is a summary of the fees incurred for services rendered by the Company’s Independent\nRegistered Public Accounting Firm, Wipfli LLP, for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022:\n2023 2022\nAudit Fees (1) $ 140,000 $ 130,000\nAudit-Related Fees (2) 550 19,000\nTotal $ 140,550 $ 149,000\n(1) The Audit Fees include fees billed by or accrued for the auditors for their reviews of the quarterly financial\nstatements included in the Company’s Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the first three quarters of each year\n19\nand their audits of the annual financial statements included in the Company’s Annual Reports on Form 10-K\nand incidental expenses.\n(2) Audit-Related Fees include fees paid to Wipfli LLP related to the issuance of a consent for a registration\nstatement during 2023 and related to the restatement of the Company’s Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for\nthe three-month periods ended June 30, 2022 and March 31, 2022 during 2022.\nPre-Approval Policy\nIn accordance with the procedures set forth in its charter, the Audit Committee pre-approves all auditing\nservices and permitted non-audit services (including the fees and other terms of those services) to be performed for\nthe Company by its Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm. Such approval may be accomplished by\napproving the terms of the engagement prior to the engagement of the Independent Registered Public Accounting\nFirm with respect to such services or by establishing detailed pre-approval policies and procedures to govern such\nengagement. The Audit Committee authorizes management to spend up to $5,000 per year for services that are not\nanticipated at the time of the engagement, provided that the Audit Committee is promptly informed of such services.\nAudit Committee Financial Expert\nMr. Paul R. Wainman, who joined our Board of Directors in March of 2014 and currently serves as Chair\nof the Audit Committee, and Mr. Bryan K. Gathagan, who joined our Board of Directors in June of 2023, both meet\nthe criteria for “audit committee financial expert” as defined by SEC rules. It is the opinion of the Company’s Board\nof Directors that the Company addresses its audit functions with a depth of penetration and rigor that meets the\nintent of the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for the following reasons:\n● All four members of the Audit Committee are independent directors, as defined by the SEC and\nNASDAQ.\n● The four members of the Audit Committee have knowledge of accounting for both their own\nbusinesses as well as for the Company.\n● Internal audit work of the Company is performed by its Director of Finance and Administration, two\nFinance and Administrative Associates and its Manager of Administrative Operations.\n● The Company also continuously reviews, at its own initiative, the expertise of the members of its\nBoard of Directors and its Audit Committee.\nAUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT\nThe Audit Committee of the Board of Directors reviews the financial reporting process, the system of\ninternal controls, the audit process and the process for monitoring compliance with certain applicable laws and\nregulations. The Audit Committee is responsible for selecting and hiring the Independent Registered Public\nAccounting Firm and meets with those accountants (in person or by telephone) before each quarterly press release\nconcerning the Company’s financial results. The Audit Committee approves the public disclosure and filing with the\nSEC of the related press releases. After reviewing the quarterly and annual reports that are prepared by management,\nthe Audit Committee authorizes the filing of such reports with the SEC. All members of the Audit Committee meet\nthe heightened independence and expertise requirements for audit committees under applicable NASDAQ Stock\nMarket rules. Mr. Wainman joined the Audit Committee in March of 2014 and serves as its Chair. Mr. Rosgen\njoined the Audit Committee in April of 2018. Dr. Tomsche joined the Audit Committee in June of 2021. Mr.\nGathagan joined the Audit Committee in June of 2023. The Audit Committee currently operates under a charter\nadopted by the board in 2004.

The Audit Committee has discussed with Wipfli LLP various\ncommunications that Wipfli LLP is required to provide to the Audit Committee including the matters required to be\n20\ndiscussed by Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) Auditing Standards No. 1301\n(Communication with Audit Committees). The Audit Committee received from Wipfli LLP the written disclosures\nand the letter required by applicable requirements of the PCAOB concerning independence and has discussed the\nauditor’s independence with them.\nBased on the review and discussions noted above, the Audit Committee recommended to the board that the\nCompany’s audited financial statements be included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal\nyear ended December 31, 2023 and be filed with the SEC.\nThis report of the Audit Committee shall not be deemed incorporated by reference by any general statement\nincorporating this Proxy Statement by reference into any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the\nSecurities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, except to the extent that the Company specifically incorporates this\ninformation by reference and shall not otherwise be deemed filed under such Acts.\nSubmitted by: Audit Committee\nBryan K.

THE GIVING OF SUCH PROXY WILL NOT AFFECT\nYOUR RIGHT TO VOTE IF YOU ATTEND THE MEETING IN PERSON (THROUGH THE LIVE\nAUDIO WEBCAST OR VIA THE TELEPHONE CONFERENCE CALL).\nImmuCell Corporation\n56 Evergreen Drive\nPortland, ME 04103\nPROXY STATEMENT\nAnnual Meeting of Stockholders to be Held on June 13, 2024\nThis Proxy Statement is furnished in connection with the solicitation by the Board of Directors of\nImmuCell Corporation (the Company), a Delaware corporation, of proxies to be voted at the Annual Meeting of\nStockholders of the Company to be held at 9:30 AM ET on Thursday, June 13, 2024 remotely via a live audio\nwebcast and telephone conference call, and any and all adjournments thereof, for the purposes set forth in the\naccompanying Notice of Annual Meeting of Stockholders. This Proxy Statement and the enclosed proxy card are\nfirst being given or sent to stockholders on or about April 26, 2024. Stockholders who execute proxies may revoke\nthem at any time before exercise thereof.\nVOTING OF OUTSTANDING COMMON STOCK\nOnly stockholders of record at the close of business on Monday, April 15, 2024, the record date, are\nentitled to notice of, and to vote at, the Annual Meeting of Stockholders and at any adjournments thereof. As of such\ndate, there were 7,824,186 shares of common stock of the Company issued and outstanding. Each share is entitled to\none vote with respect to all matters to be acted upon at the meeting. The holders of one-third of the shares of the\nCompany’s common stock outstanding and entitled to vote, represented at the meeting in person (during the live\naudio webcast and telephone conference call) or by proxy, shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business.\nVotes cast in person (during the live audio webcast meeting via the telephone conference call link) or by proxy at\nthe meeting will be tabulated by the voting inspector appointed for the meeting.\nOur Board of Directors is asking for your proxy. Giving us your proxy means that you authorize the\npersons named in this proxy to vote your shares at the Annual Meeting in the manner that you direct, or if you do\nnot direct us in your signed proxy, in the manner as recommended by the Board of Directors in this Proxy\nStatement. You can vote for the director nominees or withhold your vote for one or all nominees. You also can vote\nfor or against the other proposals or abstain from voting. If you request a proxy card, and return your signed proxy\ncard, but do not give voting instructions, the shares represented by that proxy will be voted FOR each proposal.\nWith regard to the election of directors (Proposal One), votes may be cast in favor or withheld. The\nnominees for director receiving a plurality of the votes cast by the holders of the common stock represented at the\nmeeting in person or by proxy will be elected. This means that the six nominees receiving the largest number of\nvotes cast will be elected.\nWith respect to Proposal Two, the Company is providing you with the opportunity to vote to approve, on a\nnon-binding, advisory basis, the compensation of the three executive officers named in the “SUMMARY\nCOMPENSATION TABLE” of this Proxy Statement, as disclosed in accordance with the rules of the Securities\nand Exchange Commission (SEC). This proposal, which is commonly referred to as “say-on-pay”, is required by the\nDodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, which added Section 14A to the Securities\nExchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act). The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of the\nCompany’s common stock represented at the meeting is required to approve Proposal Two. Abstentions and votes\nagainst may be specified on this proposal. Since the approval of Proposal Two requires the approval of the holders\nof a majority of the shares of the Company’s common stock represented at the meeting, abstentions, broker non-\nvotes (see below) and votes against will have the effect of a negative vote.\nBrokers cannot vote on their customers’ behalf on “non-routine” proposals (Proposals One and Two)\nwithout voting instructions from their customers. Because brokers require their customers’ direction to vote on such\nnon-routine matters, it is critical that stockholders provide their brokers with voting instructions. If you hold your\nshares in street name and do not provide voting instructions to your bank, broker or other custodian, your shares will\nnot be voted on Proposals One, Two and Three (a “broker non-vote”). Because a plurality of votes cast will be used\nto determine the results of the election of directors (Proposal One), abstentions and broker non-votes will have no\n1\neffect on the outcome of the votes on Proposal One. Abstentions, however, are counted towards establishing a\nquorum for the Annual Meeting.\nWith respect to Proposal Three, the Company is providing you with the opportunity to ratify the\nappointment of our Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm. The affirmative vote of the holders of a\nmajority of the shares of the Company’s common stock represented at the meeting is required to ratify Proposal\nThree. Abstentions and votes against may be specified on this proposal. Brokers and other record holders have\ndiscretion to vote on this proposal in the absence of written instructions from the beneficial holder of shares. Since\nthe ratification of Proposal Three requires the approval of the holders of a majority of the shares of the Company’s\ncommon stock represented at the meeting, abstentions and votes against will have the effect of a negative vote.\nApproximately 739 of our stockholders hold their shares through a stockbroker, bank, trustee, or other\nnominee (Beneficial Owner), and approximately 636 of our stockholders hold their shares directly in their own name\n(Stockholder of Record). As summarized below, there are some distinctions between shares held beneficially and\nthose owned of record.\nBeneficial Owner: If your shares are held in a stock brokerage account or by a bank, broker, trustee, or\nother nominee, you are considered the beneficial owner of shares held in “street name” and these proxy materials are\nbeing made available to you through your bank, broker, trustee, or nominee, which is considered the stockholder of\nrecord of those shares. As the beneficial owner, you have the right to direct your bank, broker, trustee, or nominee\non how to vote the shares you own beneficially, and you are also invited to attend the meeting via the live audio\nwebcast and/or the telephone conference call. Your bank, broker, trustee, or nominee is obligated to provide you\nwith voting instructions for use in instructing the bank, broker, trustee, or nominee how to vote these shares.\nHowever, since you are not the stockholder of record, you may not vote these shares unless you have a proxy from\nthe bank, broker, trustee or nominee that is the holder of record of the shares giving you the right as beneficial owner\nto vote the shares during the live audio webcast meeting via the telephone conference call link. If you do not give\ninstructions to your bank, brokerage firm, trustee or other nominee, they will not be allowed to vote your shares with\nrespect to certain “non-discretionary” proposals, but will be able to vote your shares with respect to certain\n“discretionary” proposals. The election of directors (Proposal One) and the advisory vote to approve executive\ncompensation (Proposal Two) are considered to be “non-discretionary” proposals on which banks and brokerage\nfirms may not vote without instructions from the beneficial owner. “Broker non-votes” for “non-discretionary”\nproposals are votes with respect to shares that are held in “street name” by a bank, brokerage firm, trustee or other\nnominee that indicates on its proxy that it does not have discretionary authority to vote on a particular matter. The\nratification of the appointment of our Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm (Proposal Three) is\nconsidered to be a “discretionary” proposal on which banks, brokerage firms, trustees or other nominees may vote in\nthe absence of instructions from the beneficial owner.\nStockholder of Record: If your shares are registered directly in your name with ImmuCell’s transfer agent,\nEquiniti Trust Company LLC, you are considered the stockholder of record of those shares and these proxy\nmaterials are being made available directly to you by the Company. As the stockholder of record, you have the right\nto grant your voting proxy directly to the Company or to vote in person at the live audio webcast meeting via the\ntelephone conference call link.\nVoting Results: The preliminary voting results will be announced at the meeting. The final voting results\nwill be tallied by the voting inspector and reported in a Current Report on Form 8-K, which will be filed with the\nSEC within four business days after the meeting.\nEXPENSES AND SOLICITATION\nThe cost of preparing, assembling, and mailing the proxy material and of reimbursing banks, brokers,\nnominees and fiduciaries for the out-of-pocket and clerical expenses of transmitting copies of the proxy material to\nthe beneficial owners of shares held of record by such persons will be borne by the Company. Although the\nCompany reserves the right to do so, the Company does not currently intend to solicit proxies otherwise than by use\nof the mail, but certain officers, employees and advisors of the Company, without additional compensation, may use\ntheir personal efforts, by telephone or otherwise, to obtain proxies.\n2\nSTOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS, DIRECTOR NOMINATIONS AND COMMUNICATIONS\nProposals (other than director nominations, which are addressed in the following paragraph) of\nstockholders of the Company intended to be presented at the 2024 Annual Meeting of Stockholders must be received\nby the Company at its principal place of business no later than December 31, 2023 (which date is 120 days prior to\nthe first anniversary of on or about when the 2023 Proxy Statement was first mailed to stockholders) to be eligible\nfor possible inclusion in the Company’s Proxy Statement and form of proxy relating to the 2024 meeting. Certified\nmail addressed to the Secretary of the Company is advised. No such proposals were received by the Company by\nDecember 31, 2023 for inclusion in the Company’s Proxy Statement and form of proxy relating to the 2024 Annual\nMeeting of Stockholders.\nThe Nominating Committee of the Board of Directors will consider nominees for director recommended by\nstockholders, applying the same evaluation standards as it would apply to candidates identified by management,\nother members of the Board of Directors or the Nominating Committee. Recommendations for director nominees\nmay be sent to the Nominating Committee through the Secretary of the Company. Under the advance notice\nprovisions in the Company’s By-laws, stockholders intending to formally nominate a person for election as a\ndirector at the Annual Meeting, as distinguished from recommending a candidate to the Nominating Committee,\nmust notify the Nominating Committee through the Secretary of the Company in writing of this intent not less than\n60 nor more than 90 days prior to the first anniversary of the preceding year’s Annual Meeting and meet other\nrequirements set forth in the By-laws. If the date of the Annual Meeting is changed by more than 30 days from such\nanniversary date, the notice from the stockholder must be received not later than the close of business on the tenth\nday following the day on which notice of the date of such Annual Meeting was mailed to stockholders. Such notice\nmust comply with the provisions set forth in the By-laws. No such nomination by stockholders was received by the\nSecretary of the Company for consideration in connection with the 2024 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. A copy of\nthe relevant provisions of the By-laws will be sent to any stockholder who requests these in writing. Such requests\nshould be addressed to the Secretary of the Company.\nStockholders that wish to send communications to the Board of Directors for any reason may do so by mail\nsent to ImmuCell Corporation, 56 Evergreen Drive, Portland, Maine 04103, Attention: Secretary. The Secretary is\nresponsible for bringing any such communications to the attention of the full Board of Directors at its next regularly\nscheduled meeting, which is generally quarterly. Additionally, after adjournment of the formal business matters at\neach year’s Annual Meeting, there is an opportunity for stockholders to communicate directly with the Company’s\nmanagement and directors. All directors attended the 2023 Annual Meeting of Stockholders virtually and plan to\nattend the 2024 Annual Meeting of Stockholders virtually.\nAll shares represented by proxies in the form enclosed herewith will be voted at the meeting and\nadjournments thereof in accordance with the terms of such proxies and the pertinent statements included herein\nrelative to the exercise of the power granted by said proxies, provided such proxies appear to be valid and executed\nby stockholders of record entitled to vote thereat and have not previously been revoked. A proxy may be revoked at\nany time prior to its exercise by the filing with the Secretary of the Company of an instrument revoking such proxy\nor a duly executed proxy bearing a later date. A stockholder’s proxy will not be voted if the stockholder attends the\nvirtual meeting and elects to vote in person (during the live audio webcast via the telephone conference link). Where\nthe person solicited specifies in his, her or its proxy a choice with respect to any matter to be acted upon, the shares\nwill be voted in accordance with the specification so made. If a stockholder fails to so specify with respect to such\nproposals, the proxy will be voted FOR the election of the nominees listed in Proposal One, FOR the advisory vote\nto approve executive compensation outlined in Proposal Two and FOR the ratification of the appointment of the\nIndependent Registered Public Accounting Firm described in Proposal Three.\nLEADERSHIP STRUCTURE OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS\nWith approval from the Board of Directors, the Compensation and Stock Option Committee determined\nthat the title of President and CEO should be given to an individual not being the same person holding the title of\nChair. The objective of this policy is to avoid a concentration of authority in any one person. Mr. Michael F.\nBrigham has served as President and CEO since February 2000. He also serves as the Company’s Principal\nFinancial Officer. Mr. Brigham is responsible for the day-to-day operations of the Company and for managing the\nactions of the two other executive officers, as well as those of several senior managers. Since February 2013, Dr.\n3\nDavid S. Tomsche has served as Chair of the Board of Directors, leading the Company as its independent non-\nexecutive board chair. Dr. Tomsche works with the CEO in preparing the agenda for each board meeting and\npresides over all board meetings and meetings of the non-employee directors. He provides advice to the CEO and\nserves as principal liaison between the board and the CEO. Ms. Bobbi Jo Brockmann has served as Vice President of\nSales and Marketing since February 2015. Ms. Elizabeth L. Williams has served as Vice President of Manufacturing\nOperations since April 2016. It is the policy of the Board of Directors to have a portion of the meeting without the\npresence of the executive officers each time that the board or any of its committees meets to assure that candid\ndiscussions of business matters are conducted with and without the influence of the executive officers. The board\ndelegates certain authority and responsibility to its committees, as described below.\nTHE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND ITS COMMITTEES\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, the Board of Directors of the Company held four regular\nmeetings and two special meetings and took action by unanimous written consent four times. The committees of the\nBoard of Directors are the Audit Committee, the Compensation and Stock Option Committee and the Nominating\nCommittee. During the year ended December 31, 2023, each director attended at least 75 percent of the aggregate of\n(i) the total number of meetings of the Board of Directors and (ii) the total number of meetings held by all\ncommittees of the board on which he or she served (during the periods that he or she served). The board has not set a\nformal policy for required meeting attendance. A high level of attendance and participation is expected, and to date\ndirectors have fulfilled this expectation. At the first meeting of the board following this year’s Annual Meeting,\nexecutive officers will be appointed and, effective upon the election of directors at this year’s Annual Meeting,\ndirectors will be appointed to serve on the various board committees until the next Annual Meeting and until their\nsuccessors are elected.\nThe Board of Directors has established an Audit Committee for the purpose of overseeing the accounting\nand financial reporting processes of the Company and the audits and reviews of its financial statements. The Audit\nCommittee engages the Company’s Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm, consults with such auditors\nwith regard to audit plans, reviews the annual reports of the independent auditors, oversees the adequacy of the\nCompany’s internal operating procedures and controls, meets with management and the auditors to review quarterly\nand annual financial results, authorizes the public release of press releases covering financial results, reviews and\nauthorizes quarterly and annual reports filed with the SEC and otherwise oversees compliance with certain legal,\nethical and regulatory matters. The development and manufacture of efficacious products with and without\nregulatory approval is subject to considerable risk. The Audit Committee takes the lead on oversight of credit,\nliquidity and operational risk, but the entire board, in conjunction with the executive officers, is very involved with\nreviewing Audit Committee recommendations and making independent assessments of risks in all areas of the\nCompany’s business. The Company does not have a specific risk management department, but the Company’s\nDirector of Finance and Administration and its President and CEO manage and contract for the Company’s\ninsurance coverages in consultation with outside experts, in addition to identifying, managing and monitoring risk in\nareas not specifically covered by insurance. The Director of Finance and Administration reports to the President and\nCEO, who reports to the board. The Audit Committee’s current members are Mr. Gathagan, Mr. Rosgen, Dr.\nTomsche and Mr. Wainman. Mr. Wainman serves as Chair of the Audit Committee. All members of the Audit\nCommittee meet the heightened independence and expertise requirements for audit committees under applicable\nSEC and NASDAQ Stock Market rules. The Audit Committee held eight meetings during the year ended December\n31, 2023. The Audit Committee Report can be found later in this Proxy Statement, and the “Charter and Powers of\nthe Audit Committee” has been posted on the Company’s website (http://immucell.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2017/05/charter.pdf). Information on the Company’s website does not constitute part of this Proxy\nStatement.\nThe Board of Directors has established a Compensation and Stock Option Committee (Compensation\nCommittee) for the purpose of reviewing and recommending salary, bonus and other benefits for executive officers\nand directors of the Company. The Compensation Committee is responsible for administering the Company’s 2010\nStock Option and Incentive Plan and the 2017 Stock Option and Incentive Plan. The Compensation Committee’s\ncurrent members are Ms. Basse and Mr. Rosgen, each of whom are independent directors. Mr. Rosgen serves as\nChair of the Compensation Committee. The Compensation Committee held six meetings during the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023. The Compensation Committee does not have a charter but instead operates within the authority\nprovided by the Company’s By-laws and authorizing resolutions adopted by the board. Its recommendations on\n4\nexecutive and director compensation are subject to review and final approval by the Board of Directors, a majority\nof whose members are independent directors. The Compensation Committee considers recommendations from Mr.\nBrigham, the Company’s President and CEO, relevant to a determination of executive and director compensation,\nbut neither he nor Ms. Brockmann participates in votes of the Compensation Committee or the board in this regard.\nIn recent years, the Compensation Committee has not retained or relied upon outside consultants to assist in its\ndetermination of executive or director compensation but does consider available compensation data. During the end\nof 2021 and beginning of 2022, the Compensation Committee did consider certain information provided by a\nconsultant.\nThe Board of Directors has established a Nominating Committee for the purpose of recommending to the\nfull board the number of directors to serve on the board, criteria for board membership and nominees for election to\nthe board. In doing so, the Nominating Committee considers the integrity and relevant business experience of each\nnominee. The Nominating Committee values diversity, believing that the Company benefits from decision making\nthat includes a range of opinions, points of view and experience. For instance, the Nominating Committee would not\nwant a board comprised only of directors having principally financial expertise or only of directors whose principal\nexperience is in the dairy and beef industries. Likewise, the Nominating Committee believes that a board consisting\nof all men or all women would not be as strong as a gender-diverse board. While there is always room for\nimprovement, the Nominating Committee believes that it has made substantial progress towards achieving these\nboard diversity goals. To be considered for nomination to the board, a candidate must meet the following minimum\ncriteria: 1) reputation for integrity and high ethical standards, 2) willingness and ability to contribute positively to\nthe Company’s decision-making process, 3) absence of any conflict of interest, or appearance of conflict of interest\nand 4) commitment to understanding the Company’s business and associated business risks and to devoting\nadequate time and effort to create value for the Company and its stockholders. All nominees included on this year’s\nproxy card were recommended by the Nominating Committee and then approved by a vote of the board. The\nCommittee’s current members are Ms. Basse and Mr. Wainman, each of whom are independent directors. Ms. Basse\nserves as Chair of the Nominating Committee. The Nominating Committee held three meetings during the year\nended December 31, 2023. Provisions for stockholders to nominate candidates for election as directors are described\nabove under the caption, “STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS, DIRECTOR NOMINATIONS AND\nCOMMUNICATIONS”. Upon recommendation of the Nominating Committee, the Board of Directors adopted a\ncharter for the Nominating Committee in December 2012. This charter sets forth the policy to be utilized by the\nNominating Committee in considering nominees identified by management to serve as directors for the Company.\nThe Charter of the Nominating Committee has been posted to the Company’s website (http://immucell.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/04/Nominating-Committee-Charter.pdf). The Nominating Committee applies the same\nevaluation standards in considering nominees for director recommended by stockholders.\nDIRECTOR COMPENSATION\nThe following table contains information as to the compensation paid by the Company to its non-executive\ndirectors for services rendered during the year ended December 31, 2023:\nFees\nEarned or Stock\nPaid Option All Other\nName in Cash Awards(1)(2) Compensation Total\nGloria J.

Upon separation from the\nCompany for any reason, Mr. Brigham’s Deferred Compensation Agreement allows Mr. Brigham to be paid, among\nother amounts, all earned and unused paid time off (which expense totaling $222,379 was accrued during the first\nquarter of 2022 and $230,162 and $222,379 was included in accounts payable and accrued expenses on the\naccompanying balance sheets as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively) and to receive up to an additional\n$300,000 in deferred compensation (which amount is being accrued over the three-year period ending in January\n2025). This deferred compensation payment vested as to $100,000 on January 1, 2023 and an additional $100,000\non January 1, 2024.

This proposal is commonly referred to as \"say-on-pay.\"\nWe currently present such proposal to stockholders on an annual basis.\nWe maintain a simple executive compensation program that consists almost entirely of base salary and\nperiodic stock option grants, with the possibility of annual discretionary bonuses and some contractually delineated\nbonus opportunities described above. Annual bonus payments awarded to these named executive officers by the\nCompany since 2020 have been limited to $25,000, $22,500 and $12,645 of variable compensation and discretionary\nbonuses paid to Ms. Brockmann in March of 2023, March of 2022 and February of 2021, respectively, and $25,000\nand $5,000 of variable compensation and discretionary bonuses paid to Ms. Williams in August of 2023 and\nFebruary of 2020. These elements of compensation have been selected by the Compensation and Stock Option\nCommittee (Compensation Committee) because the Compensation Committee believes that they effectively achieve\nthe fundamental goals of our compensation program, which are to attract, motivate, retain and reward exceptionally\ntalented executives; to align executive interests and stockholder interests through an appropriate mix of long-term\nand short-term incentives; and to maximize the financial efficiency of the program from risk, tax, accounting, and\ncash flow perspectives.\nExcept as described above, including under “EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENTS” above, the Company\ndoes not provide any compensation or benefit plans to these named executive officers that are not also available to\nother employees. The Company differentiates among key employees primarily based on size of base salary and size\nand frequency of stock option grants. Annual compensation decisions for the named executive officers are made by\nthe Compensation Committee based on performance and market-related factors. Features of our compensation\nprogram for the named executive officers include the following:\n● A majority of total compensation is fixed but is regularly reviewed and evaluated based on both long-\nterm and short-term corporate performance.\n● As described above under “EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENTS”, the Company has entered into a\nDeferred Compensation Agreement with Mr. Brigham providing for certain deferred compensation and\nseverance payments to Mr. Brigham under certain circumstances.\n● As also described above under “EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENTS”, the Company has entered into\nincentive compensation agreements with each of the named executive officers, except for Mr.\nBrigham, that provide for certain variable compensation if certain financial results and regulatory\nobjectives are achieved.\n● Equity awards, which consist of stock options, generally vest after a three-year period. The\nCompensation Committee believes that such awards, as well as their vesting schedules, align the\ninterests of key employees and stockholders.\n● From time to time, the Compensation Committee reviews compensation against a peer group\n(companies of similar size and structure and most often in the same industry) and considers the\nopinions of independent consultants with regards to the estimated replacement costs for current\nexecutive officers to ensure that total compensation is both competitive and appropriate.\n● The Compensation Committee annually reviews risk associated with our compensation program to\nensure that our program does not create incentives that would encourage subjecting the Company to\nrisks that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company.\nThe Company is asking its stockholders to indicate their support for the executive compensation as\ndescribed in this Proxy Statement. This vote is not intended to address any specific item of compensation, but rather\nthe overall compensation of the named executive officers and the philosophy, policies and practices described in this\n18\nproxy statement. Our Board of Directors is asking stockholders to approve a non-binding, advisory vote on the\nfollowing resolution:\nRESOLVED, that the compensation paid to the named executive officers of the Company, as disclosed\npursuant to Item 402 of Regulation S-K, including the “SUMMARY COMPENSATION TABLE” and\n“OUTSTANDING EQUITY AWARDS” table, is hereby approved.\nAs an advisory vote, this proposal is not binding. The outcome of this advisory vote does not overrule any\ndecision by the Company or the Board of Directors (or any committee thereof), create or imply any change to the\nfiduciary duties of the Company or the Board of Directors (or any committee thereof), or create or imply any\nadditional fiduciary duties for the Company or the Board of Directors (or any committee thereof). However, the\nCompensation Committee and Board of Directors value the opinions expressed by stockholders in their vote on this\nproposal and will consider the outcome of the vote when making future compensation decisions for these key\nemployees.\nThe Board of Directors recommends that you vote FOR the approval of the non-binding, advisory\nresolution on compensation for the named executive officers.\nRATIFICATION OF APPOINTMENT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC\nACCOUNTING FIRM (Proposal Three)\nOn March 18, 2024, the Audit Committee appointed Wipfli LLP to serve as our Independent Registered\nPublic Accounting Firm for the year ending December 31, 2024. The Audit Committee’s engagement of this firm\nwas made in accordance with procedures contemplated in that committee’s charter. This decision is expected to be\nratified by the Board of Directors at its next regularly scheduled meeting.\nAlthough stockholder approval of the Audit Committee’s selection of Wipfli LLP is not required by law,\nthe Board of Directors believes that it is advisable to give stockholders an opportunity to ratify this selection. A\nrepresentative of Wipfli LLP is expected to be present (virtually) at the Annual Meeting with an opportunity to make\na statement if he or she desires to do so and is expected to be available to respond to appropriate questions during\nthe live audio webcast via the telephone conference call link.
