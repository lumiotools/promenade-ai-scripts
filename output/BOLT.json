We are particularly excited about our next-generation ISAC BDC-4182, which builds on the lessons we learned from our clinical experience with BDC-1001. We believe that BDC-4182’s dramatic increase in potency and activity will potentially enable the treatment of patients whose tumors have lower claudin 18.2 expression and may provide even better anti-tumor activity than conventional ADCs. We presented some of the data that underlies this excitement at SITC, and the team is hard at work preparing for a clinical trial initiation of BDC-4182 in the second quarter next year.”\n\n**Recent Highlights and Anticipated Milestones**\n\n  * **Presented updated clinical activity of BDC-4182 at the 39****th****Annual Meeting of the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer (SITC).** BDC-4182 is a next-generation BoltbodyTM ISAC clinical candidate targeting claudin 18.2, a novel, clinically validated target in oncology with expression in gastric/gastroesophageal junction cancer, pancreatic cancer, and other tumor types. BDC-4182 has advanced into IND-enabling activities, supported by _in vitro_ and _in vivo_ experiments demonstrating potent anti-tumor activity in multiple preclinical models, with clinical trial initiation expected in 2025. BDC-4182 was well tolerated in non-human primates at the highest dose tested (12mg/kg) with an acceptable safety profile. BDC-4182 outperformed cytotoxic claudin 18.2 ADCs in syngeneic models and BDC-4182’s favorable toxicology profile enables a variety of potential future combinations.\n  * **Presented key learnings from Phase 1 dose-escalation trial of BDC-1001 at SITC.** First-generation ISAC BDC-1001 demonstrated immunological activity in this first-in-human trial, particularly in patients with high HER2 antigen expression. Greater immune activation appeared to be associated with clinical benefit. Pharmacodynamic changes were observed in patients whose tumors had higher levels of HER2 and were statistically significant in patients with HER2 IHC 3+ tumors. Data supports the hypothesis that an ISAC with enhanced immune activation could offer greater efficacy, warranting further testing in next-generation ISACs.\n  * **Advanced to cohort 7 (10 mg/kg) in the Phase 1 study of BDC-3042 in patients with advanced cancers.** BDC-3042 is a proprietary agonist antibody that targets Dectin-2, an immune-activating receptor expressed by tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). This single-agent, dose-escalation Phase 1 clinical study is evaluating BDC-3042 in patients with metastatic or unresectable triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), colorectal cancer, clear cell renal cell carcinoma, head and neck cancer, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), ovarian cancer, or melanoma.\n  * **Collaborations with Genmab and Toray continue to progress.** The Company continues to work with its collaborators to discover and develop ISACs for the treatment of cancer. Genmab and the Company have selected a product to advance into development for the collaboration’s first program. The Genmab collaboration also continues research and development on additional programs.\n  * **Cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities were $84.4 million as of September 30, 2024.** Cash on hand is expected to fund multiple milestones and operations through mid-2026.\n\n\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results**\n\n  * **Collaboration Revenue –** Collaboration revenue was $1.1 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to $2.5 million for the same quarter in 2023. Revenue in the comparative periods was generated from services performed under the R&D collaborations as we fulfill our performance obligations.\n\n\n  * **Research and Development (R &D) Expenses –** R&D expenses were $13.8 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to $15.0 million for the same quarter in 2023. The decrease between the comparable periods was mainly due to a decrease in salary and related expenses primarily as a result of the May 2024 restructuring, partially offset by an increase in contract manufacturing expenses.\n\n\n  * **General and Administrative (G &A) Expenses –** G&A expenses were $3.8 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to $5.8 million for the same quarter in 2023. The decrease between the comparable periods was mainly due to a decrease in salary and related expenses primarily as a result of the May 2024 restructuring.\n\n\n  * **Loss from Operations –** Loss from operations was $16.4 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to $18.2 million for the same quarter in 2023.\n\n\n\n**About the Boltbody™ Immune-Stimulating Antibody Conjugate (ISAC) Platform** Bolt Biotherapeutics’ Boltbody ISAC platform harnesses the precision of antibodies with the power of the innate and adaptive immune system to generate a productive anti-cancer response.

Dr. Dupont brings more than two decades of experience in the field of oncology and immuno-oncology. With the appointment of Dr. Dupont, Executive Partner at Sofinnova Investments, Dr. Jim Healy, M.D., Ph.D., also at Sofinnova, will be stepping down as Lead Independent Director. In addition, Frank D. Lee will be departing the Board and Brian O’Callaghan, CEO of Deep Genomics, will be assuming the role of Chair.\n\n“Jakob has deep experience in successfully developing therapies that help cancer patients, and we are honored to have him join our Board of Directors. Jakob’s proven track record and knowledge in drug development will be beneficial as we continue to advance our pipeline and support our collaborations,” said Willie Quinn, Chief Executive Officer. “Jim and Frank have provided excellent counsel to Bolt and on behalf of the whole Board of Directors, I would like to thank them for their insights and dedication. I am also excited that Brian is stepping forward to be Chair of the board, and we all look forward to his leadership.”\n\nDr. Dupont is Executive Partner, Private Equity at Sofinnova Investments. Prior to joining Sofinnova, Dr. Dupont was Global Head of Research & Development and Executive Vice President at Atara Biotherapeutics, where he led the development and regulatory approval of EBVallo®. He also served as Chief Medical Officer at Gossamer Bio. Before Gossamer Bio, Dr. Dupont served as Vice President and Global Head of Breast and Gynecologic Cancer Development for Genentech/Roche, where he was responsible for the global development of Herceptin®, Perjeta®, Kadcyla®, and Tecentriq®, among others, and where he previously led the development of Avastin® for Gynecologic and Breast Cancers when starting his industry career.

Weill Medical College of Cornell University.\n\n“I’m pleased to join the Bolt Biotherapeutics Board of Directors,” said Jakob Dupont, M.D., Executive Partner, Private Equity, Sofinnova Investments. “The recent strategic restructuring has left Bolt in an enviable position of having an ongoing clinical trial with a first-in-class Dectin-2 agonist and a near-clinical ISAC program targeting Claudin 18.2. Additionally, Bolt has the resources, in the form of cash, platform technology, and a solid team, to pursue its mission of harnessing the power of the immune system to improve lives and eradicate cancer. I look forward to sharing my experience with the Bolt team as they advance their pipeline programs through clinical development.”\n\n**About Bolt Biotherapeutics, Inc.** Bolt Biotherapeutics is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing novel immunotherapies for the treatment of cancer.
