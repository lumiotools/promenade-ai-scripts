In order to assure the viability of Awards granted to Participants in various jurisdictions, the Committee may provide for such special terms as it may consider necessary or appropriate to accommodate differences in local law, tax policy, or custom applicable in the jurisdiction in which the Participant resides, is employed, operates or is incorporated. Moreover, the Committee may approve such supplements to, or amendments, restatements, or alternative versions of, the Plan as it may consider necessary or appropriate for such purposes without thereby affecting the terms of the Plan as in effect for any other purpose; _provided, however_ , that no such supplements, amendments, restatements, or alternative versions shall increase the share limitations contained in Section 3.1 of the Plan.

The Committee shall determine the methods by which the exercise price of an Option may be paid, the form of payment, including, without limitation (i) cash or check denominated in U.S. Dollars, (ii) to the extent permissible under the Applicable Laws, cash or check in Chinese Renminbi, (iii) cash or check denominated in any other local currency as approved by the Committee, (iv) Shares held for such period of time as may be required by the Committee in order to avoid adverse financial accounting consequences and having a Fair Market Value on the date of delivery equal to the aggregate exercise price of the Option or exercised portion thereof, (v) after the Trading Date the delivery of a notice that the Participant has placed a market sell order with a broker with respect to Shares then issuable upon exercise of the Option, and that the broker has been directed to pay a sufficient portion of the net proceeds of the sale to the Company in satisfaction of the Option exercise price; _provided_ that payment of such proceeds is then made to the Company upon settlement of such sale, (vi) other property acceptable to the Committee with a Fair Market Value equal to the exercise price, or (vii) any combination of the foregoing. Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan to the contrary, no Eligible Participant who is a member of the Board or an “executive officer” of the Company within the meaning of Section 13(k) of the Exchange Act shall be permitted to pay the exercise price of an Option in any method which would violate Section 13(k) of the Exchange Act.  \n---|---  \n  \n6\n\n5.1.4| Evidence of Grant. All Options shall be evidenced by an Award Agreement between the Company and the Participant. The Award Agreement shall include such additional provisions as may be specified by the Committee.  \n---|---  \n5.1.5| Effects of Termination of Employment or Service on Options. Termination of employment or service shall have the following effects on Options granted to the Eligible Participants:  \n---|---  \n(i)| Dismissal for Cause. Unless otherwise provided in the Award Agreement, if an Eligible Participant’s employment by or service to the Service Recipient is terminated by the Service Recipient for Cause, the Eligible Participant’s Options will terminate upon such termination, whether or not the Option is then vested and/or exercisable;  \n---|---  \n(ii)| Death or Disability. Unless otherwise provided in the Award Agreement, if an Eligible Participant’s employment by or service to the Service Recipient terminates as a result of the Eligible Participant’s death or Disability:  \n---|---  \n(a)| the Eligible Participant (or his or her legal representative or beneficiary, in the case of the Eligible Participant’s Disability or death, respectively), will have until the date that is 12 months after the Eligible Participant’s termination of Employment to exercise the Eligible Participant’s Options (or portion thereof) to the extent that such Options were vested and exercisable on the date of the Eligible Participant’s termination of Employment on account of death or Disability;  \n---|---  \n(b)| the Options, to the extent not vested and exercisable on the date of the Eligible Participant’s termination of Employment or service, shall terminate upon the Eligible Participant’s termination of Employment or service on account of death or Disability; and  \n---|---  \n(c)| the Options, to the extent exercisable for the 12-month period following the Eligible Participant’s termination of Employment or service and not exercised during such period, shall terminate at the close of business on the last day of the 12-month period.  \n---|---  \n(iii)| Other Terminations of Employment or Service. Unless otherwise provided in the Award Agreement, if an Eligible Participant’s employment by or service to the Service Recipient terminates for any reason other than a termination by the Service Recipient for Cause or because of the Eligible Participant’s death or Disability:  \n---|---  \n(a)| the Eligible Participant will have until the date that is 90 days after the Eligible Participant’s termination of Employment or service to exercise his or her Options (or portion thereof) to the extent that such Options were vested and exercisable on the date of the Eligible Participant’s termination of Employment or service;  \n---|---  \n  \n7\n\n(b)| the Options, to the extent not vested and exercisable on the date of the Eligible Participant’s termination of Employment or service, shall terminate upon the Eligible Participant’s termination of Employment or service; and  \n---|---  \n(c)| the Options, to the extent exercisable for the 90-day period following the Eligible Participant’s termination of Employment or service and not exercised during such period, shall terminate at the close of business on the last day of the 90-day period.  \n---|---  \n5.2| Incentive Share Options. Incentive Share Options may be granted to Employees of the Company or a Subsidiary of the Company.

The terms of any Incentive Share Options granted pursuant to the Plan, in addition to the requirements of Section 5.1, must comply with the following additional provisions of this Section 5.2:  \n---|---  \n5.2.1| Individual Dollar Limitation. The aggregate Fair Market Value (determined as of the time the Option is granted) of all Shares with respect to which Incentive Share Options are first exercisable by an Eligible Participant in any calendar year may not exceed $100,000 or such other limitation as imposed by Section 422(d) of the Code, or any successor provision. To the extent that Incentive Share Options are first exercisable by an Eligible Participant in excess of such limitation, the excess shall be considered Non-Qualified Share Options.  \n---|---  \n5.2.2| Exercise Price. The exercise price of an Incentive Share Option shall be equal to the Fair Market Value on the date of grant. However, the exercise price of any Incentive Share Option granted to any individual who, at the date of grant, owns Shares possessing more than ten percent of the total combined voting power of all classes of shares of the Company or any Parent or Subsidiary of the Company may not be less than 110% of Fair Market Value on the date of grant and such Option may not be exercisable for more than five years from the date of grant.  \n---|---  \n5.2.3| Transfer Restriction.

The Committee, in its sole discretion, shall determine the number of Restricted Shares to be granted to each Eligible Participant.  \n---|---  \n6.2| Restricted Shares Award Agreement. Each Award of Restricted Shares shall be evidenced by an Award Agreement that shall specify the period of restriction, the number of Restricted Shares granted, and such other terms and conditions as the Committee, in its sole discretion, shall determine. Unless the Committee determines otherwise, Restricted Shares shall be held by the Company as escrow agent until the restrictions on such Restricted Shares have lapsed.  \n---|---  \n6.3| Issuance and Restrictions. Restricted Shares shall be subject to such restrictions on transferability and other restrictions as the Committee may impose (including, without limitation, limitations on the right to vote Restricted Shares or the right to receive dividends on the Restricted Shares). These restrictions may lapse separately or in combination at such times, pursuant to such circumstances, in such installments, or otherwise, as the Committee determines at the time of the grant of the Award or thereafter.  \n---|---  \n6.4| Forfeiture/Repurchase. Except as otherwise determined by the Committee at the time of the grant of the Award or thereafter, upon termination of employment or service during the applicable restriction period, Restricted Shares that are at that time subject to restrictions shall, subject to Applicable Laws, be forfeited or repurchased in accordance with the Award Agreement; provided, however, the Committee may (a) provide in any Restricted Share Award Agreement that restrictions or forfeiture and repurchase conditions relating to Restricted Shares will be waived in whole or in part in the event of terminations resulting from specified causes, and (b) in other cases waive in whole or in part restrictions or forfeiture and repurchase conditions relating to Restricted Shares.  \n---|---  \n6.5| Certificates for Restricted Shares. Restricted Shares granted pursuant to the Plan may be evidenced in such manner as the Committee shall determine. If certificates representing Restricted Shares are registered in the name of the Eligible Participant, certificates must bear an appropriate legend referring to the terms, conditions, and restrictions applicable to such Restricted Shares, and the Company may, at its discretion, retain physical possession of the certificate until such time as all applicable restrictions lapse.  \n---|---  \n6.6| Removal of Restrictions. Except as otherwise provided in this Section 6, Restricted Shares granted under the Plan shall be released from escrow as soon as practicable after the last day of the period of restriction. The Committee, in its discretion, may accelerate the time at which any restrictions shall lapse or be removed. After the restrictions have lapsed, the Eligible Participant shall be entitled to have any legend or legends under Section 6.5 removed from his or her Share certificate, and the Shares shall be freely transferable by the Eligible Participant, subject to applicable legal restrictions. The Committee (in its discretion) may establish procedures regarding the release of Shares from escrow and the removal of legends, as necessary or appropriate to minimize administrative burdens on the Company.  \n---|---  \n  \n9\n\n7.| RESTRICTED SHARE UNITS  \n---|---  \n7.1| Grant of Restricted Share Units. The Committee, at any time and from time to time, may grant Restricted Share Units to Eligible Participants as the Committee, in its sole discretion, shall determine. The Committee, in its sole discretion, shall determine the number of Restricted Share Units to be granted to each Eligible Participant.  \n---|---  \n7.2| Restricted Share Units Award Agreement.

Except as otherwise determined by the Committee at the time of the grant of the Award or thereafter, upon termination of employment or service during the applicable vesting period, Restricted Share Units that are at that time unvested shall, subject to Applicable Laws, be forfeited or repurchased in accordance with the Award Agreement; provided, however, the Committee may (a) provide in any Share Award Award Agreement that restrictions or forfeiture and repurchase conditions relating to Restricted Share Units will be waived in whole or in part in the event of terminations resulting from specified causes, and (b) in other cases waive in whole or in part restrictions or forfeiture and repurchase conditions relating to Restricted Share Units.  \n---|---  \n8.| PROVISIONS APPLICABLE TO AWARDS  \n---|---  \n8.1| Award Agreement. Awards under the Plan shall be evidenced by Award Agreements that set forth the terms, conditions and limitations for each Award which may include the term of an Award, the provisions applicable in the event the Eligible Participant’s employment or service terminates, and the Company’s authority to unilaterally or bilaterally amend, modify, suspend, cancel or rescind an Award.  \n---|---  \n8.2| No Transferability; Limited Exception to Transfer Restrictions.  \n---|---  \n8.2.1| Limits on Transfer. Unless otherwise expressly provided in (or pursuant to) this Section 8.2, by applicable law and by the Award Agreement, as the same may be amended:  \n---|---  \n(i)| all Awards are non-transferable and will not be subject in any manner to sale, transfer, anticipation, alienation, assignment, pledge, encumbrance or charge;  \n---|---  \n(ii)| Awards will be exercised only by or vested to the Eligible Participant; and  \n---|---  \n(iii)| amounts payable or shares issuable pursuant to an Award will be delivered only to (or for the account of), and, in the case of Shares, registered in the name of, the Eligible Participant.  \n---|---  \n  \nIn addition, the shares shall be subject to the restrictions set forth in the applicable Award Agreement.\n\n10\n\n8.2.2| Further Exceptions to Limits on Transfer. The exercise and transfer restrictions in Section 8.2.1 will not apply to:  \n---|---  \n(i)| transfers to the Company or a Subsidiary;  \n---|---  \n(ii)| transfers by gift to “immediate family” as that term is defined in SEC Rule 16a-1(e) promulgated under the Exchange Act;  \n---|---  \n(iii)| the designation of a beneficiary to receive benefits if the Eligible Participant dies or, if the Eligible Participant has died, transfers to or exercises by the Eligible Participant’s beneficiary, or, in the absence of a validly designated beneficiary, transfers by will or the laws of descent and distribution; or  \n---|---  \n(iv)| if the Eligible Participant has suffered a disability, permitted transfers or exercises on behalf of the Eligible Participant by the Eligible Participant’s duly authorized legal representative; or  \n---|---  \n(v)| subject to the prior approval of the Committee or an executive officer or director of the Company authorized by the Committee, transfer to one or more natural persons who are the Eligible Participant’s family members or entities owned and controlled by the Eligible Participant and/or the Eligible Participant’s family members, including but not limited to trusts or other entities whose beneficiaries or beneficial owners are the Eligible Participant and/or the Eligible Participant’s family members, or to such other persons or entities as may be expressly approved by the Committee, pursuant to such conditions and procedures as the Committee may establish. Any permitted transfer shall be subject to the condition that the Committee receives evidence satisfactory to it that the transfer is being made for estate and/or tax planning purposes and on a basis consistent with the Company’s lawful issue of securities.  \n---|---  \n  \nNotwithstanding anything else in this Section 8.2.2 to the contrary, but subject to compliance with all Applicable Laws, Incentive Share Options, Restricted Shares and Restricted Share Units will be subject to any and all transfer restrictions under the Code applicable to such Awards or necessary to maintain the intended tax consequences of such Awards. Notwithstanding clause (ii) above but subject to compliance with all Applicable Laws, any contemplated transfer by gift to “immediate family” as referenced in clause (ii) above is subject to the condition precedent that the transfer be approved by the Committee in order for it to be effective.\n\n11\n\n8.3| Beneficiaries. Notwithstanding Section 8.2, an Eligible Participant may, in the manner determined by the Committee, designate a beneficiary to exercise the rights of the Eligible Participant and to receive any distribution with respect to any Award upon the Eligible Participant’s death. A beneficiary, legal guardian, legal representative, or other person claiming any rights pursuant to the Plan is subject to all terms and conditions of the Plan and any Award Agreement applicable to the Eligible Participant, except to the extent the Plan and Award Agreement otherwise provide, and to any additional restrictions deemed necessary or appropriate by the Committee. If the Eligible Participant is married and resides in a community property state, a designation of a person other than the Eligible Participant’s spouse as his or her beneficiary with respect to more than 50% of the Eligible Participant’s interest in the Award shall not be effective without the prior written consent of the Eligible Participant’s spouse. If no beneficiary has been designated or survives the Eligible Participant, payment shall be made to the person entitled thereto pursuant to the Eligible Participant’s will or the laws of descent and distribution. Subject to the foregoing, a beneficiary designation may be changed or revoked by an Eligible Participant at any time provided the change or revocation is filed with the Committee.  \n---|---  \n8.4| Performance Objectives and Other Terms. The Committee, in its discretion, shall set performance objectives, restrictions or other vesting criteria which, depending on the extent to which they are met, will determine the number or value of the Awards that will be granted or paid out to the Eligible Participants.  \n---|---  \n8.5| Share Certificates. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Company shall not be required to issue or deliver any certificates evidencing the Shares pursuant to the exercise of any Award, unless and until the Committee has determined, with advice of counsel, that the issuance and delivery of such certificates is in compliance with all Applicable Laws, regulations of governmental authorities and, if applicable, the requirements of any exchange on which the Shares are listed or traded. All Share certificates delivered pursuant to the Plan are subject to any stop-transfer orders and other restrictions as the Committee deems necessary or advisable to comply with all Applicable Laws, and the rules of any national securities exchange or automated quotation system on which the Shares are listed, quoted, or traded. The Committee may place legends on any Share certificate to reference restrictions applicable to the Shares. In addition to the terms and conditions provided herein, the Committee may require that an Eligible Participant make such reasonable covenants, agreements, and representations as the Committee, in its discretion, deems advisable in order to comply with any such laws, regulations, or requirements. The Committee shall have the right to require any Eligible Participant to comply with any timing or other restrictions with respect to the settlement or exercise of any Award, including a window-period limitation, as may be imposed in the discretion of the Committee.  \n---|---  \n8.6| Paperless Administration. Subject to Applicable Laws, the Committee may make Awards, provide applicable disclosure and procedures for exercise of Awards by an internet website or interactive voice response system for the paperless administration of Awards.  \n---|---  \n  \n12\n\n8.7| Foreign Currency. An Eligible Participant may be required to provide evidence that any currency used to pay the exercise price of any Award were acquired and taken out of the jurisdiction in which the Eligible Participant resides in accordance with Applicable Laws, including foreign exchange control laws and regulations. In the event the exercise price for an Award is paid in Chinese Renminbi or other foreign currency, as permitted by the Committee, the amount payable will be determined by conversion from U.S. dollars at the official rate promulgated by the People’s Bank of China for Chinese Renminbi, or for jurisdictions other than the Peoples Republic of China, the exchange rate as selected by the Committee on the date of exercise or the other date the Committee deems reasonable and practicable.  \n---|---  \n9.| CHANGES IN CAPITAL STRUCTURE  \n---|---  \n9.1| Adjustments. In the event of any dividend, share split, combination or exchange of Shares, amalgamation, arrangement or consolidation, spin-off, recapitalization or other distribution (other than normal cash dividends) of Company assets to its shareholders, or any other change affecting the Shares or the share price of a Share, the Committee shall make such proportionate adjustments, if any, as the Committee in its discretion may deem appropriate to reflect such change with respect to (a) the aggregate number and type of shares that may be issued under the Plan (including, but not limited to, adjustments of the limitations in Section 3.1); (b) the terms and conditions of any outstanding Awards (including, without limitation, any applicable performance targets or criteria with respect thereto); and (c) the grant or exercise price per Share for any outstanding Awards under the Plan.  \n---|---  \n9.2| Material Transactions. Except as may otherwise be provided in any Award Agreement or any other written agreement entered into by and between the Company and an Eligible Participant, if the Committee anticipates the occurrence, or upon the occurrence, of a Material Transaction, the Committee may, in its sole discretion, provide for (i) any and all Awards outstanding hereunder to terminate at a specific time in the future and shall give each Eligible Participant the right to exercise the vested portion of such Awards during a period of time as the Committee shall determine, or (ii) the purchase of any Award for an amount of cash equal to the amount that could have been attained upon the exercise of such Award (and, for the avoidance of doubt, if as of such date the Committee determines in good faith that no amount would have been attained upon the exercise of such Award, then such Award may be terminated by the Company without payment), or (iii) the replacement of such Award with other rights or property selected by the Committee in its sole discretion or the assumption of or substitution of such Award by the successor or surviving corporation, or a Parent or Subsidiary thereof, with appropriate adjustments as to the number and kind of Shares and prices, or (iv) payment of such Award in cash based on the value of Shares on the date of the Material Transaction plus reasonable interest on the Award through the date as determined by the Committee when such Award would otherwise be vested or have been paid in accordance with its original terms, if necessary to comply with Section 409A of the Code.  \n---|---  \n9.3| Outstanding Awards — Other Changes. In the event of any other change in the capitalization of the Company or corporate change other than those specifically referred to in this Section 9, the Committee may, in its absolute discretion, make such adjustments in the number and class of shares subject to Awards outstanding on the date on which such change occurs and in the per share grant or exercise price of each Award as the Committee may consider appropriate to prevent dilution or enlargement of rights.  \n---|---  \n9.4| No Other Rights. Except as expressly provided in the Plan, no Eligible Participant shall have any rights by reason of any subdivision or consolidation of Shares of any class, the payment of any dividend, any increase or decrease in the number of shares of any class or any dissolution, liquidation, merger, or consolidation of the Company or any other corporation. Except as expressly provided in the Plan or pursuant to action of the Committee under the Plan, and no issuance by the Company of shares of any class, or securities convertible into shares of any class, shall affect, and no adjustment by reason thereof shall be made with respect to, the number of Shares subject to an Award or the grant or exercise price of any Award.  \n---|---  \n  \n13\n\n10.| ADMINISTRATION  \n---|---  \n10.1| Committee. The Plan shall be administered by the Board or a committee of one or more members of the Board (the “Committee”) to whom the Board shall delegate the authority to grant or amend Awards to Eligible Participants other than any of the Committee members, Independent Directors and executive officers of the Company. Reference to the Committee shall refer to the Board in absence of the Committee. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the full Board, acting by majority of its members in office, shall conduct the general administration of the Plan if required by Applicable Laws, and with respect to Awards granted to the Committee members, Independent Directors and executive officers of the Company and for purposes of such Awards the term “Committee” as used in the Plan shall be deemed to refer to the Board.  \n---|---  \n10.2| Action by the Committee. A majority of the Committee shall constitute a quorum. The acts of a majority of the members present at any meeting at which a quorum is present, and acts approved unanimously in writing all members of the Committee in lieu of a meeting, shall be deemed the acts of the Committee. Each member of the Committee is entitled to, in good faith, rely or act upon any report or other information furnished to that member by any officer or other employee of a Group Entity, the Company’s independent certified public accountants, or any executive compensation consultant or other professional retained by the Company to assist in the administration of the Plan.  \n---|---  \n10.3| Authority of the Committee. Subject to any specific designation in the Plan, the Committee has the exclusive power, authority and discretion to:  \n---|---  \n10.3.1| designate Eligible Participants to receive Awards;  \n---|---  \n10.3.2| determine the type or types of Awards to be granted to each Eligible Participant;  \n---|---  \n10.3.3| determine the number of Awards to be granted and the number of Shares to which an Award will relate;  \n---|---  \n10.3.4| determine the terms and conditions of any Award granted pursuant to the Plan, including, but not limited to, the exercise price, grant price, or purchase price, any restrictions or limitations on the Award, any schedule for lapse of forfeiture restrictions or restrictions on the exercisability of an Award, and accelerations or waivers thereof, and any provisions related to non-competition and recapture of gain on an Award, based in each case on such considerations as the Committee in its sole discretion determines;  \n---|---  \n10.3.5| determine whether, to what extent, and pursuant to what circumstances an Award may be settled in, or the exercise price of an Award may be paid in, cash, Shares, other Awards, or other property, or an Award may be canceled, forfeited, or surrendered;  \n---|---  \n10.3.6| prescribe the form of each Award Agreement, which need not be identical for each Eligible Participant;  \n---|---  \n  \n14\n\n10.3.7| decide all other matters that must be determined in connection with an Award;  \n---|---  \n10.3.8| establish, adopt, or revise any rules and regulations as it may deem necessary or advisable to administer the Plan;  \n---|---  \n10.3.9| interpret the terms of, and any matter arising pursuant to, the Plan or any Award Agreement;  \n---|---  \n10.3.10| amend terms and conditions of Award Agreements; and  \n---|---  \n10.3.11| make all other decisions and determinations that may be required pursuant to the Plan or as the Committee deems necessary or advisable to administer the Plan, including design and adopt from time to time new types of Awards that are in compliance with Applicable Laws.  \n---|---  \n10.4| Decisions Binding.

The Plan shall become effective as of the date on which the Board adopts the Plan or as otherwise specified by the Board when adopting the Plan (the “Effective Date”).  \n---|---  \n11.2| Expiration Date. The Plan will expire on, and no Award may be granted pursuant to the Plan after, the tenth anniversary of the Effective Date. Any Awards that are outstanding on the tenth anniversary of the Effective Date shall remain in force according to the terms of the Plan and the applicable Award Agreement.  \n---|---  \n12.| AMENDMENT, MODIFICATION, AND TERMINATION  \n---|---  \n12.1| Amendment, Modification, and Termination. At any time and from time to time, the Board may terminate, amend or modify the Plan; provided, however, that (a) to the extent necessary and desirable to comply with Applicable Laws or stock exchange rules, the Company shall obtain shareholder approval of any Plan amendment in such a manner and to such a degree as required, unless the Company decides to follow home country practice, and (b) unless the Company decides to follow home country practice, shareholder approval is required for any amendment to the Plan that (i) increases the number of Shares available under the Plan (other than any adjustment as provided by Section 9 or Section 3.1.1), or (ii) permits the Committee to extend the term of the Plan or the exercise period for an Option beyond ten years from the date of grant.  \n---|---  \n12.2| Awards Previously Granted. Except with respect to amendments made pursuant to Section 12.1, no termination, amendment, or modification of the Plan shall adversely affect in any material way any Award previously granted pursuant to the Plan without the prior written consent of the Eligible Participant.  \n---|---  \n  \n15\n\n13.| GENERAL PROVISIONS  \n---|---  \n13.1| No Rights to Awards. No Eligible Participant, employee, or other person shall have any claim to be granted any Award pursuant to the Plan, and neither the Company nor the Committee is obligated to treat Eligible Participants, employees, and other persons uniformly.  \n---|---  \n13.2| No Shareholders Rights. No Award gives the Eligible Participant any of the rights of a shareholder of the Company unless and until Shares are in fact issued to such person in connection with such Award.  \n---|---  \n13.3| Taxes. No Shares shall be delivered under the Plan to any Eligible Participant until such Eligible Participant has made arrangements acceptable to the Committee for the satisfaction of any income and employment tax withholding obligations under Applicable Laws. The Company or any Subsidiary shall have the authority and the right to deduct or withhold, or require an Eligible Participant to remit to the Company, an amount sufficient to satisfy all applicable taxes (including the Eligible Participant’s payroll tax obligations) required or permitted by Applicable Laws to be withheld with respect to any taxable event concerning an Eligible Participant arising as a result of this Plan. The Committee may in its discretion and in satisfaction of the foregoing requirement allow an Eligible Participant to elect to have the Company withhold Shares otherwise issuable under an Award (or allow the return of Shares) having a Fair Market Value equal to the sums required to be withheld. Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan, the number of Shares which may be withheld with respect to the issuance, vesting, exercise or payment of any Award (or which may be repurchased from the Eligible Participant of such Award after such Shares were acquired by the Eligible Participant from the Company) in order to satisfy any income and payroll tax liabilities applicable to the Eligible Participant with respect to the issuance, vesting, exercise or payment of the Award shall, unless specifically approved by the Committee, be limited to the number of Shares which have a Fair Market Value on the date of withholding or repurchase equal to the aggregate amount of such liabilities based on the minimum statutory withholding rates for the applicable income and payroll tax purposes that are applicable to such supplemental taxable income.  \n---|---  \n13.4| No Right to Employment or Services. Nothing in the Plan or any Award Agreement shall interfere with or limit in any way the right of the Service Recipient to terminate any Eligible Participant’s employment or services at any time, nor confer upon any Eligible Participant any right to continue in the employment or services of any Service Recipient.  \n---|---  \n13.5| Unfunded Status of Awards. The Plan is intended to be an “unfunded” plan for incentive compensation. With respect to any payments not yet made to an Eligible Participant pursuant to an Award, nothing contained in the Plan or any Award Agreement shall give the Eligible Participant any rights that are greater than those of a general creditor of the relevant Group Entity.  \n---|---  \n  \n16\n\n13.6| Indemnification. To the extent allowable pursuant to Applicable Laws, each member of the Committee or of the Board shall be indemnified and held harmless by the Company from any loss, cost, liability, or expense that may be imposed upon or reasonably incurred by such member in connection with or resulting from any claim, action, suit, or proceeding to which he or she may be a party or in which he or she may be involved by reason of any action or failure to act pursuant to the Plan and against and from any and all amounts paid by him or her in satisfaction of judgment in such action, suit, or proceeding against him or her; provided he or she gives the Company an opportunity, at its own expense, to handle and defend the same before he or she undertakes to handle and defend it on his or her own behalf. The foregoing right of indemnification shall not be exclusive of any other rights of indemnification to which such persons may be entitled pursuant to the Company’s currently effectively memorandum and articles of association, as a matter of law, or otherwise, or any power that the Company may have to indemnify them or hold them harmless.  \n---|---  \n13.7| Relationship to Other Benefits. No payment pursuant to the Plan shall be taken into account in determining any benefits pursuant to any pension, retirement, savings, profit sharing, group insurance, welfare or other benefit plan of any Group Entity except to the extent otherwise expressly provided in writing in such other plan or an agreement thereunder.  \n---|---  \n13.8| Expenses. The expenses of administering the Plan shall be borne by the Group Entities.  \n---|---  \n13.9| Titles and Headings. The titles and headings of the Sections in the Plan are for convenience of reference only and, in the event of any conflict, the text of the Plan, rather than such titles or headings, shall control.  \n---|---  \n13.10| Fractional Shares. No fractional Shares shall be issued and the Committee shall determine, in its discretion, whether cash shall be given in lieu of fractional Shares or whether such fractional Shares shall be eliminated by rounding up or down as appropriate.  \n---|---  \n13.11| Limitations Applicable to Section 16 Persons. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Plan, and any Award granted or awarded to any Eligible Participant who is then subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act, shall be subject to any additional limitations set forth in any applicable exemptive rule under Section 16 of the Exchange Act (including any amendment to Rule 16b-3 of the Exchange Act) that are requirements for the application of such exemptive rule. To the extent permitted by the Applicable Laws, the Plan and Awards granted or awarded hereunder shall be deemed amended to the extent necessary to conform to such applicable exemptive rule.  \n---|---  \n13.12| Government and Other Regulations. The obligation of the Company to make payment of awards in Shares or otherwise shall be subject to all Applicable Laws, including but not limited to foreign exchange control laws and regulations in applicable jurisdictions, and to such approvals by government agencies as may be required. The Company shall be under no obligation to register any of the Shares paid pursuant to the Plan under the Securities Act or any other similar law in any applicable jurisdiction.
