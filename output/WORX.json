SCWorx is a key partner for\nhealthcare providers to enable; Patient\n• Better decision-making utilizing accurate data,\n• Significant reductions in product costs and utilization,\nClinical\n• Interoperability of crucial business systems;\nSupply, Patient and Finance. Supply\nFinance\nSCWorx Overview\n• Proprietary software allowing hospitals the ability to easily and in real-time analyze and take action for cost\nsavings and efficiency\n• The largest, fully-attributed database of product information in the healthcare industry\n• Over 12,000,000 item database with each item assigned up to 266 attributes\n• Growth in market penetration to over 1,300 hospitals nationwide\n• 3-year annual customer retention of 96%, 96% and 100%\n• Strategic sales reorganization in 2022 to focus on a 100% SaaS recurring revenue model\n• Current SaaS monthly recurring revenue has increased approximately 24% over the last 12 months\n• Customers consist of some the largest and most prestigious hospitals in the country (Yale New Haven,\nHackensack Meridien, Providence, etc)\nSCWorx Overview\nWithin a hospital data for one medical\nprocedure is entered in three different\napplications by three different teams of people\nusing data that is unique to each hospital\ndepartment and business system and frequently\nFINANCE\ncontains incorrect or incomplete data.\nSUPPLY\nSCWorx corrects the data and establishes an\ninteroperable Single Source of Truth between\nClinical\nthe three core business systems within a\nhospital; Supply (Inventory), Clinical (Patient)\nand Finance (Billing/Rebate).\nSolution Overview\nSCWorx begins by repairing, and completing, the data within each of the three critical systems. Many of the items in these\nsystems lack the attributes needed for proper identification, utilization, invoicing and rebates. Then we establish\ninteroperability between these systems. It seems simple but there are between 25,000 and 500,000 items used at each\nhospital. Each item has up to 266 attributes and some of them are critical (i.e. latex or latex free, expiration dates, codes for\nrecall notices, etc).\nOnce the data is normalized\nand the critical systems are\nStandard\nintegrated SCWorx provides\nBone Screw\na depth of information that\ndoesn’t exist today. For\nexample; procedure cost\ncomparison by doctor,\naccurate rebate tracking,\naccurate benchmarking\ncomparison between\nhospitals, correct item\nbilling, among many other\ndata points.\nHealthcare Provider Benefits\nSCWorx establishes an interoperable item master with enriched and normalized data\n Daily new item add automation\n Full data integration with ERP, EMR and Financial systems\nIntegration\n Accurate Spend Analytics\nContract Item Add\n Opportunity identification and real-time savings tracking\n Increased revenue\nRebate Analytics\n Cost and Labor efficiencies\n Real-time rebate management control and management\nEfficiencies Savings\n Contract management automation\nRevenue\nCost effective solution – Only pay for what you need\nCustomer Results\n Identified over $14 million in savings opportunities for a prestigious academic healthcare institution located in the northeast,\n Assisted a healthcare provider ranked as the number one hospital in the state by US News with recognizing $4 million in\nmissed charges,\n Recently worked with the #18 ranked hospital in the country on a price audit resulting in $800,000 in savings solely for\northopedic products,\n Helped a Pennsylvania hospital re-engineer spine component pricing to secure more favorable pricing from their vendors\nwhich resulted in a 17% savings totaling $1,800,000,\n Assisted a Top 10 Healthcare IDN with the successful ERP migration and ongoing data maintenance of over 300,000 items\nfrom Peoplesoft and McKesson PMM to Oracle Cloud,\n SCWorx enabled a leading healthcare provider to reduce the timeframe of processing new items from seven business days\nto one,\n A highly ranked healthcare provider utilizes the SCWorx contract management platform to maintain the latest price updates\nto ensure immediate accuracy and the avoidance of delays and downstream price and billing errors,\n A large hospital system in New York utilized the SCWorx platform for price parity analysis, elimination of duplicate items\nand multiple contracts for a total cost savings opportunity (i.e. overspend) of nearly $1 million.\nCompetitive Comparison\nSCWorx approaches healthcare data management with a foundational level service approach which\nprovides a more cost effective and significantly improved service over competing solutions.\nThe following example demonstrates a 20% cost savings over a hospitals current data management\nprovider.\nSample of\nimprovements over a\ncompeting healthcare\nexchange company:\nSCWorx delivers a proven higher quality of service at a lower price than the competitors in the\nhealthcare data industry.

All statements other than statements of historical fact contained in this Form 10-Q are forward-\nlooking statements. These statements, among other things, relate to our business strategy, goals and expectations concerning our future operations, prospects, plans and\nobjectives of management. The words “anticipate”, “believe”, “continue”, “could”, “estimate”, “expect”, “intend”, “may”, “plan”, “predict”, “project”, “will”, and\nsimilar terms and phrases are used to identify forward-looking statements in this presentation.\nOur operations involve risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside our control, and any one of which, or a combination of which, could materially affect our\nresults of operations and whether the forward-looking statements ultimately prove to be correct. We have based these forward-looking statements largely on our current\nexpectations and projections about future events and trends that we believe may affect our financial condition, results of operations, business strategy, short-term and long-term\nbusiness operations and objectives, and financial needs. Forward-looking statements in this Form 10-Q include, without limitation, statements reflecting management’s\nexpectations for future financial performance and operating expenditures (including our ability to continue as a going concern, to raise additional capital and to succeed in our\nfuture operations), expected growth, profitability and business outlook and increased operating expenses.\nForward-looking statements are only current predictions and are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties, and other factors that may cause our actual\nresults, levels of activity, performance, or achievements to be materially different from those anticipated by such statements. These factors include, among other things, the\nunknown risks and uncertainties that we believe could cause actual results to differ from these forward looking statements as set forth under the heading, “Risk Factors” in\nour Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. New risks and uncertainties emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict all\nof the risks and uncertainties that could have an impact on the forward-looking statements, including without limitation, risks and uncertainties relating to our ability to:\n● reverse the recent decline in our revenue and resume growing our revenue;\n● resolve the various litigation proceedings pending against us on favorable terms or at all;\n● obtain additional financing in sufficient amounts or on acceptable terms so that we can fund our business plan;\n● reduce our dependence on third-party subcontractors to perform some of the work on our contracts;\n● mitigate the impact of new or changed laws, regulations or other industry standards that could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business;\n● mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our revenues;\n● adopt and master new technologies and adjust certain fixed costs and expenses to adapt to our industry’s and customers’ evolving demands; and\n● mitigate the impact of changes in general market, economic and political conditions in the United States and global economies or financial markets, including\nthose resulting from natural or man-made disasters.\nAlthough we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements contained in this Form 10-Q are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results,\nlevels of activity, performance, or achievements. In light of inherent risks, uncertainties and assumptions, the future events and trends discussed in this Form 10-Q may not\noccur and actual results could differ materially and adversely from those anticipated or implied in the forward-looking statements. Except as required by law, we are under no\nduty to update or revise any of such forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise, after the date of this Form 10-Q.\nYou should read this Form 10-Q with the understanding that our actual future results, levels of activity, performance and events and circumstances may be materially\ndifferent from what we expect.\nAll references to “SCWorx,” “we,” “us,” “our” or the “Company” mean SCWorx Corp., a Delaware corporation, and where appropriate, its wholly owned\nsubsidiaries.\nii\nPART I – FINANCIAL INFORMATION\nItem 1.

Description of Business\nNature of Business\nSCWorx, LLC (n/k/a SCW FL Corp.) (“SCW LLC”) was a privately held limited liability company which was organized in Florida on November 17, 2016. On\nDecember 31, 2017, SCW LLC acquired Primrose Solutions, LLC (“Primrose”), a Delaware limited liability company, which became its wholly-owned subsidiary and focused\non developing functionality for the software now used and sold by SCWorx Corp. (the “Company” or “SCWorx”). The majority interest holders of Primrose were interest\nholders of SCW LLC and based upon Staff Accounting Bulletin Topic 5G, the technology acquired has been accounted for at predecessor cost of $0. To facilitate the planned\nacquisition by Alliance MMA, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Alliance”), on June 27, 2018, SCW LLC merged with and into a newly-formed entity, SCWorx Acquisition Corp.,\na Delaware corporation (“SCW Acquisition”), with SCW Acquisition being the surviving entity. Subsequently, on August 17, 2018, SCW Acquisition changed its name to\nSCWorx Corp. On November 30, 2018, the Company and certain of its stockholders agreed to cancel 6,510 shares of common stock. In June 2018, the Company began to\ncollect subscriptions for common stock. From June to November 2018, the Company collected $1,250,000 in subscriptions and issued 3,125 shares of common stock to new\nthird-party investors. In addition, on February 1, 2019, (i) SCWorx Corp. (f/k/a SCWorx Acquisition Corp.) changed its name to SCW FL Corp. (to allow Alliance to change its\nname to SCWorx Corp.) and (ii) Alliance acquired SCWorx Corp. (n/k/a SCW FL Corp.) in a stock-for-stock exchange transaction and changed Alliance’s name to SCWorx\nCorp., which is the Company’s current name, with SCW FL Corp. becoming the Company’s subsidiary. On March 16, 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, SCWorx\nestablished a wholly-owned subsidiary, Direct-Worx, LLC to endeavor to source and provide critical, difficult-to-find items for the healthcare industry which it has since\nceased.\nOn October 6, 2023, following stockholder approval at the Company’s annual meeting, the Company amended its certificate of incorporation to implement a 1 for 15\nreverse split of its common stock. The effect of the reverse stock split was to combine every 15 shares of outstanding common stock into one share of common stock. The\nreverse stock split was effective at the opening of the trading day on October 11, 2023.\nThe effects of the reverse stock split have been reflected in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for all periods presented.\nOperations of the Business\nSCWorx is a provider of data content and services related to the repair, normalization and interoperability of information for healthcare providers and big data analytics\nfor the healthcare industry.\nSCWorx has developed and markets health information technology solutions and associated services that improve healthcare processes and information flow within\nhospitals. SCWorx’s software platform enables healthcare providers to simplify, repair, and organize its data (“data normalization”), allows the data to be utilized across\nmultiple internal software applications (“interoperability”) and provides the basis for sophisticated data analytics (“big data”). SCWorx’s solutions are designed to improve the\nflow of information quickly and accurately between the existing supply chain, electronic medical records, clinical systems, and patient billing functions. The software is\ndesigned to achieve multiple operational benefits such as supply chain cost reductions, decreased accounts receivables aging, accelerated and more accurate billing, contract\noptimization, increased supply chain management and cost visibility, synchronous Charge Description Master (“CDM”) and control of vendor rebates and contract\nadministration fees.\n7\nSCWorx empowers healthcare providers to maintain comprehensive access and visibility to an advanced business intelligence that enables better decision-making and\nreductions in product costs and utilization, ultimately leading to accelerated and accurate patient billing. SCWorx’s software modules perform separate functions as follows:\n● virtualized Item Master File repair, expansion and automation;\n● CDM management;\n● contract management;\n● request for proposal automation;\n● rebate management;\n● big data analytics modeling; and\n● data integration and warehousing.\nSCWorx continues to provide transformational data-driven solutions to some of the finest, most well-respected healthcare providers in the United States. Clients are\ngeographically dispersed throughout the country. The Company’s focus is to assist healthcare providers with issues they have pertaining to data interoperability. SCWorx\nprovides these solutions through a combination of direct sales and relationships with strategic partners.\nSCWorx’s software solutions are delivered to clients within a fixed term period, typically a three-to-five-year contracted term, where such software is hosted in\nSCWorx data centers (Amazon Web Service’s “AWS” or RackSpace) and accessed by the client through a secure connection in a software as a service (“SaaS”) delivery\nmethod.\nSCWorx currently sells its solutions and services in the United States to hospitals and health systems through its direct sales force and its distribution and reseller\npartnerships.\nImpact of the COVID-19 Pandemic\nThe Company’s operations and business have experienced disruption due to the unprecedented conditions surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic which spread\nthroughout the United States and the world. The outbreak adversely impacted new customer acquisition. The Company has followed the recommendations of local health\nauthorities to minimize exposure risk for its team members since the outbreak.\nIn addition, the Company’s customers (hospitals) also experienced extraordinary disruptions to their businesses and supply chains, while experiencing unprecedented\ndemand for health care services related to COVID-19. As a result of these extraordinary disruptions to the Company’s customers’ business, the Company’s customers were\nfocused on meeting the nation’s health care needs in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, the Company believes that its customers were not able to focus resources\non expanding the utilization of the Company’s services, which has adversely impacted the Company’s growth prospects, at least until the adverse effects of the pandemic\nsubside. In addition, the financial impact of COVID-19 on the Company’s hospital customers could cause the hospitals to delay payments due to the Company for services,\nwhich could negatively impact the Company’s cash flows.\nNote 2. Liquidity and Going Concern\nThe accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles\n(“U.S. GAAP”), which contemplates continuation of the Company as a going concern and the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of\nbusiness. The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustment that might become necessary should the Company be unable to continue as\na going concern.\n8\nThe Company has suffered recurring losses from operations and incurred a net loss of $940,935 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and $3,981,144 for the\nyear ended December 31, 2023. The accumulated deficit as of September 30, 2024 was $30,780,776. The Company has not yet achieved profitability and expects to continue to\nincur cash outflows from operations. It is expected that its operating losses will continue and, as a result, the Company will eventually need to generate significant increases in\nproduct revenues to achieve profitability. These conditions indicate that there is substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern within one year\nafter the financial statement issuance date.\nAs of the filing date of this Report, the Company has only limited cash on hand, and management believes that there may not be sufficient capital resources from\noperations and existing financing arrangements in order to meet operating expenses and working capital requirements for the next twelve months.\nAccordingly, the Company is evaluating various alternatives, including reducing operating expenses, securing additional financing through debt or equity securities to\nfund future business activities and other strategic alternatives. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to generate the level of operating revenues in its\nbusiness plan, or if additional sources of financing will be available on acceptable terms, if at all. If no additional sources of financing are available, our future operating\nprospects may be adversely affected. The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this\nuncertainty.\nNote 3. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nBasis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation\nThe accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and the rules and regulations of the U.S.\nSecurities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). They do not include all of the information and footnotes required by U.S. GAAP for complete consolidated financial\nstatements. Therefore, these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company’s audited financial statements and notes\nthereto contained in its report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on September 23, 2024.\nThe accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of SCWorx and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All material\nintercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nThe unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included herein are unaudited; however, they contain all normal recurring accruals and adjustments that, in\nthe opinion of management, are necessary to present fairly the Company’s financial position at September 30, 2024, the results of its operations for the three and nine months\nended September 30, 2024 and cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 are\nnot necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for future quarters or the full year.\nReclassifications\nCertain balances in previously issued unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to be consistent with the current period\npresentation. The reclassification had no impact on total financial position, net loss, or stockholders’ equity.\nCash\nCash is maintained with various financial institutions. Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of\ncash deposits. Accounts at each institution are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) up to $250,000. The Company did not have amounts in excess of\nthe FDIC insured limit as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.\n9\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nManagement applies fair value accounting for significant financial assets and liabilities and non-financial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair\nvalue in the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements on a recurring basis. Management defines fair value as the price that would be received from selling an asset\nor paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. When determining the fair value measurements for assets and\nliabilities, which are required to be recorded at fair value, management considers the principal or most advantageous market in which the Company would transact and the\nmarket-based risk measurements or assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, such as risks inherent in valuation techniques, transfer\nrestrictions and credit risk. Fair value is estimated by applying the following hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value into three levels and bases the\ncategorization within the hierarchy upon the lowest level of input that is available and significant to the fair value measurement: Level 1 - Quoted prices in active markets for\nidentical assets or liabilities. Level 2 - Observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities, quoted prices for identical or similar\nassets or liabilities in inactive markets, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or\nliabilities. Level 3 - Inputs that are generally unobservable and typically reflect management’s estimate of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or\nliability.\nFair value of stock options and warrants\nManagement uses the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to calculate the fair value of stock options and warrants. Use of this method requires management to make\nassumptions and estimates about the expected life of options and warrants, anticipated forfeitures, the risk-free rate, and the volatility of the Company’s share price. In making\nthese assumptions and estimates, management relies on historical market data.\nConcentration of Credit and Other Risks\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject the Company to significant concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash and accounts receivable. The\nCompany believes that any concentration of credit risk in its accounts receivable is substantially mitigated by the Company’s evaluation process, relatively short collection\nterms and the high level of credit worthiness of its customers. The Company performs ongoing internal credit evaluations of its customers’ financial condition, obtains deposits\nand limits the amount of credit extended when deemed necessary but generally requires no collateral.\nSignificant customers are those which represent more than 10% of the Company’s revenue for each period presented, or the Company’s accounts receivable balance as\nof each respective balance sheet date. For each significant customer, revenue as a percentage of total revenue and accounts receivable as a percentage of total net accounts\nreceivable are as follows:\nRevenue For the Accounts\nnine months ended Receivable\nSeptember 30, September 30,\nCustomers 2024 2023 2024 2023\nCustomer A 14% 11% 4% 12%\nCustomer B 13% 10% 12% 10%\nCustomer C 19% 15% 59% 12%\nCustomer D 3% 12% -% 6%\nAllowance for Credit Losses\nAccounts receivable are comprised of amounts billed and currently due from customers. Accounts receivable are amounts related to any unconditional right the\nCompany has for receiving consideration and are presented as accounts receivable in the condensed consolidated balance sheets. The Company maintains an allowance for\ncredit losses for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. The Company employs an expected credit loss model utilizing\nhistorical loss rates and historical trends in credit quality indicators (e.g., delinquency, risk ratings), adjusted to reflect current economic conditions and knowledge or customer\nrelationships.\nManagement considers the following factors when determining the collectability of specific customer accounts: customer creditworthiness, past transaction history\nwith the customer, current industry trends, changes in customer payment terms, and specific customer situations. The Company’s normal collection cycle ranges between thirty\nand 60 days. Estimated uncollectible amounts are charged to earnings and a credit to a valuation allowance. Balances which remain outstanding after reasonable collection\nefforts are written off through a charge to the valuation allowance and a credit to accounts receivable. The Company has assessed that certain receivables may not be collectable\nand has recorded an allowance for credit losses of $20,000 as of September 30, 2024. The Company did not record an allowance for credit losses as of December 31, 2023.\n10\nGoodwill\nGoodwill is recorded as the difference, if any, between the aggregate consideration paid for an acquisition and the fair value of the net tangible and identified\nintangible assets acquired under a business combination. Goodwill also includes acquired assembled workforce, which does not qualify as an identifiable intangible asset. The\nCompany reviews impairment of goodwill annually in the fourth quarter, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that the goodwill might be impaired. The\nCompany first assesses qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test. If, after assessing the totality of events or\ncircumstances, the Company determines that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then the quantitative goodwill\nimpairment test is unnecessary.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company recognizes revenue in accordance with Accounting Standard Codification (“ASC”) Topic 606 to depict the transfer of promised goods or services in an\namount that reflects the consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. To determine revenue recognition for arrangements\nwithin the scope of Topic 606 the Company performs the following steps:\n● Step 1: Identify the contract(s) with a customer\n● Step 2: Identify the performance obligations in the contract\n● Step 3: Determine the transaction price\n● Step 4: Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract\n● Step 5: Recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation\nThe Company follows the accounting revenue guidance under Topic 606 to determine whether contracts contain more than one performance obligation. Performance\nobligations are the unit of accounting for revenue recognition and generally represent the distinct goods or services that are promised to the customer.\nThe Company has identified the following performance obligations in its SaaS contracts with customers:\n1) Data Normalization: which includes data preparation, product and vendor mapping, product categorization, data enrichment and other data related services,\n2) Software-as-a-service (“SaaS”): which is generated from clients’ access of and usage of the Company’s hosted software solutions on a subscription basis for a\nspecified contract term, which is usually annually. In SaaS arrangements, the client cannot take possession of the software during the term of the contract and\ngenerally has the right to access and use the software and receive any software upgrades published during the subscription period,\n3) Maintenance: which includes ongoing data cleansing and normalization, content enrichment, and optimization, and\n4) Professional Services: mainly related to specific customer projects to manage and/or analyze data and review for cost reduction opportunities\n11\nA contract will typically include Data Normalization, SaaS and Maintenance, which are distinct performance obligations and are accounted for separately. The\ntransaction price is allocated to each separate performance obligation on a relative stand-alone selling price basis. Significant judgement is required to determine the stand-alone\nselling price for each distinct performance obligation and is typically estimated based on observable transactions when these services are sold on a stand-alone basis. At contract\ninception, an assessment of the goods and services promised in the contracts with customers is performed and a performance obligation is identified for each distinct promise to\ntransfer to the customer a good or service (or bundle of goods or services). To identify the performance obligations, the Company considers all the goods or services promised\nin the contract regardless of whether they are explicitly stated or are implied by customary business practices. Revenue is recognized when the performance obligation has been\nmet. The Company considers control to have transferred upon delivery because the Company has a present right to payment at that time, the Company has transferred use of the\ngood or service, and the customer is able to direct the use of, and obtain substantially all the remaining benefits from, the good or service.\nThe Company’s SaaS and Maintenance contracts typically have termination for convenience without penalty clauses and accordingly, are generally accounted for as\nmonth-to-month agreements. If it is determined that the Company has not satisfied a performance obligation, revenue recognition will be deferred until the performance\nobligation is deemed to be satisfied.\nRevenue recognition for the Company’s performance obligations are as follows:\nData Normalization and Professional Services\nThe Company’s Data Normalization and Professional Services are typically fixed fee. When these services are not combined with SaaS or Maintenance revenues as a\nsingle unit of accounting, these revenues are recognized as the services are rendered and when contractual milestones are achieved and accepted by the customer. When these\nservices are combined with SaaS or Maintenance revenues, revenues recognized ratably over the period of the contract.\nSaaS and Maintenance\nSaaS and Maintenance revenues are recognized ratably over the contract terms beginning on the commencement date of each contract, which is the date on which the\nCompany’s service is made available to customers.\nThe Company does have some contracts that have payment terms that differ from the timing of revenue recognition, which requires the Company to assess whether the\ntransaction price for those contracts include a significant financing component. The Company has elected the practical expedient that permits an entity to not adjust for the\neffects of a significant financing component if it expects that at the contract inception, the period between when the entity transfers a promised good or service to a customer\nand when the customer pays for that good or service will be one year or less. The Company does not maintain contracts in which the period between when the entity transfers a\npromised good or service to a customer and when the customer pays for that good or service exceeds the one-year threshold.\nThe Company has one revenue stream, from the SaaS business, and believes it has presented all varying factors that affect the nature, timing and uncertainty of\nrevenues and cash flows.\n12\nRemaining Performance Obligations\nAs of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had $159,333 and $378,583, respectively, of remaining performance obligations recorded as deferred\nrevenue. The Company expects to recognize the revenue relating to the current performance obligations during the following 12 month period.\nCosts to Obtain and Fulfill a Contract\nCosts to fulfill a contract typically include costs related to satisfying performance obligations as well as general and administrative costs that are not explicitly\nchargeable to customer contracts. These expenses are recognized and expensed when incurred in accordance with ASC 340-40.\nCost of Revenues\nCost of revenues primarily represent data center hosting costs, consulting services and maintenance of the Company’s large data array that were incurred in delivering\nprofessional services and maintenance of the Company’s large data array during the periods presented.\nContract Balances\nContract assets arise when the associated revenue was earned prior to the Company’s unconditional right to receive a payment under a contract with a customer\n(unbilled revenue) and are derecognized when either it becomes a receivable or the cash is received. There were no contract assets as of September 30, 2024 and December 31,\n2023.\nContract liabilities arise when customers remit contractual cash payments in advance of the Company satisfying its performance obligations under the contract and are\nderecognized when the revenue associated with the contract is recognized when the performance obligation is satisfied. Contract liabilities were $159,333 and $378,583 as of\nSeptember 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company recognized revenue that was included in its contract liability balance at the end of the prior\nyears of $365,083 and 513,833, respectively.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes in accordance with ASC Topic 740, “Income Taxes.” Under this method, income tax\nexpense is recognized for the amount of: (i) taxes payable or refundable for the current year and (ii) deferred tax consequences of temporary differences resulting from matters\nthat have been recognized in an entity’s financial statements or tax returns. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable\nincome in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is\nrecognized in the results of operations in the period that includes the enactment date.\nValuation allowances are provided if, based upon the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be\nrealized. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company has evaluated available evidence and concluded that the Company may not realize all the benefits of\nits deferred tax assets; therefore, a valuation allowance has been established for its deferred tax assets.\nASC Topic 740-10-30 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise’s financial statements and prescribes a recognition threshold\nand measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. ASC Topic 740-10-40\nprovides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure, and transition. The Company has no material uncertain tax\npositions for any of the reporting periods presented.\nThere was no income tax expense for three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.\n13\nStock-Based Compensation\nThe Company accounts for stock-based compensation expense in accordance with the authoritative guidance on share-based payments. Under the provisions of the\nguidance, stock-based compensation expense is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the option or warrant using a Black-Scholes option pricing model and is\nrecognized as expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period.\nThe authoritative guidance also requires that the Company measures and recognizes stock-based compensation expense upon modification of the term of stock award.\nThe stock-based compensation expense for such modification is accounted for as a repurchase of the original award and the issuance of a new award.\nCalculating stock-based compensation expense requires the input of highly subjective assumptions, including the expected term of the stock-based awards, stock price\nvolatility, and the pre-vesting option forfeiture rate. The Company estimates the expected life of options granted based on historical exercise patterns, which are believed to be\nrepresentative of future behavior. The Company estimates the volatility of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant based on historical volatility. The assumptions\nused in calculating the fair value of stock-based awards represent the Company’s best estimates, but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of\nmanagement’s judgment. As a result, if factors change and the Company uses different assumptions, its stock-based compensation expense could be materially different in the\nfuture. In addition, the Company is required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and only recognize expense for those shares expected to vest. The Company estimates the\nforfeiture rate based on historical experience of its stock-based awards that are granted, exercised and cancelled. If the actual forfeiture rate is materially different from the\nestimate, stock-based compensation expense could be significantly different from what was recorded in the current period. The Company also grants performance-based\nrestricted stock awards to employees and consultants. These awards will vest if certain employee\\consultant-specific or Company-designated performance targets are achieved.\nIf minimum performance thresholds are achieved, each award will convert into a designated number of the Company’s common stock. If minimum performance thresholds are\nnot achieved, then no shares will be issued. Based upon the expected levels of achievement, stock-based compensation is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite\nservice period. The expected levels of achievement are reassessed over the requisite service periods and, to the extent that the expected levels of achievement change, stock-\nbased compensation is adjusted in the period of change and recorded on the statements of operations and the remaining unrecognized stock-based compensation is recorded\nover the remaining requisite service period. Refer to Note 7, Stockholders’ Equity, for additional detail.\nLoss Per Share\nThe Company computes earnings (loss) per share in accordance with ASC 260, “Earnings per Share” which requires presentation of both basic and diluted earnings\n(loss) per share (“EPS”) on the face of the income statement. Basic EPS is computed by dividing the loss available to common shareholders (numerator) by the weighted\naverage number of shares outstanding (denominator) during the period. Diluted EPS gives effect to all dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period using the\ntreasury stock method and convertible preferred stock using the if-converted method. In computing diluted EPS, the average stock price for the period is used in determining\nthe number of shares assumed to be purchased from the exercise of stock options or warrants and the exercise of fully vested restricted stock units. Diluted EPS excludes all\ndilutive potential shares if their effect is anti-dilutive.\nIndemnification\nThe Company provides indemnification of varying scope to certain customers against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from\nthe use of the Company’s software. In accordance with authoritative guidance for accounting for guarantees, the Company evaluates estimated losses for such indemnification.\nThe Company considers such factors as the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. To date, no\nsuch claims have been filed against the Company and no liability has been recorded in its condensed consolidated financial statements.\nAs permitted under Delaware law, the Company has agreements whereby it indemnifies its officers and directors for certain events or occurrences while the officer or\ndirector is, or was, serving at the Company’s request in such capacity. The maximum potential amount of future payments the Company could be required to make under these\nindemnification agreements is unlimited. In addition, the Company has directors’ and officers’ liability insurance coverage that is intended to reduce its financial exposure and\nmay enable it to recover any payments above the applicable policy retention, should they occur.\n14\nContingencies\nThe Company records a liability when the Company believes that it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If the\nCompany determines that a loss is reasonably possible, and the loss or range of loss can be estimated, the Company discloses the possible loss in the notes to the unaudited\ncondensed consolidated financial statements. The Company reviews the developments in its contingencies that could affect the amount of the provisions that has been\npreviously recorded, and the matters and related possible losses disclosed. The Company adjusts provisions and changes to its disclosures accordingly to reflect the impact of\nnegotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel, and updated information. Significant judgment is required to determine both the probability and the estimated\namount.\nLegal costs associated with loss contingencies are accrued based upon legal expenses incurred by the end of the reporting period.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts\nreported and disclosed in the unaudited consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. The Company regularly evaluates estimates and assumptions related to the\nallowance for doubtful accounts, the estimated useful lives and recoverability of long-lived assets, stock-based compensation, goodwill, and deferred income tax asset valuation\nallowances. The Company bases its estimates and assumptions on current facts, historical experience and various other factors that it believes to be reasonable under the\ncircumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the accrual of costs and expenses that are not\nreadily apparent from other sources. The actual results experienced by the Company may differ materially and adversely from the Company’s estimates. To the extent there are\nmaterial differences between the estimates and the actual results, future results of operations will be affected. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nFrom time to time, new accounting pronouncements are issued by FASB that are adopted by the Company as of the specified effective date. If not discussed,\nmanagement believes that the impact of recently issued standards, which are not yet effective, will not have a material impact on the Company’s financial statements upon\nadoption.\nNote 4. Loans Payable\nCARES funding\nOn May 5, 2020, the Company obtained a $293,972 unsecured loan payable through the Paycheck Protection Program (“PPP”), which was enacted as part of the\nCoronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (the “CARES ACT”). The funds were received from Bank of America through a loan agreement pursuant to the CARES\nAct. The CARES Act was established in order to enable small businesses to pay employees during the economic slowdown caused by COVID-19 by providing forgivable loans\nto qualifying businesses for up to 2.5 times their average monthly payroll costs. The amount borrowed under the CARES Act and used for payroll costs, rent, mortgage interest,\nand utility costs during the 24 week period after the date of loan disbursement is eligible to be forgiven provided that (a) the Company uses the PPP Funds during the eight\nweek period after receipt thereof, and (b) the PPP Funds are only used to cover payroll costs (including benefits), rent, mortgage interest, and utility costs. While the full loan\namount may be forgiven, the amount of loan forgiveness will be reduced if, among other reasons, the Company does not maintain staffing or payroll levels or less than 60% of\nthe loan proceeds are used for payroll costs. Principal and interest payments on any unforgiven portion of the PPP Funds (the “PPP Loan”) will be deferred to the date the SBA\nremits the borrower’s loan forgiveness amount to the lender or, if the borrower does not apply for loan forgiveness, 10 months after the end of the borrower’s loan forgiveness\nperiod for nine months and will accrue interest at a fixed annual rate of 1.0% and carry a two year maturity date. There is no prepayment penalty on the CARES Act Loan. In\nMay 2022, the Company was granted an extension on the maturity date of this note until March 5, 2025. The loan was partially forgiven in the amount of $139,569 in\nSeptember 2022. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the remaining balance was $41,949 and $90,359, respectively.\n15\nOn April 12, 2024, the Company issued a secured promissory note in the face amount of $330,000, in exchange for which it received cash in the amount of $300,000.\nIn addition to the original issue discount of $30,000, the note bears interest at the rate of 5% per annum, was originally due May 10, 2024 and subsequently extended until July\n12, 2024 and is secured by all the Company assets. On July 15, 2024, the balance of the promissory note was rolled into a new convertible loan offering.\nConvertible Loans\nOn July 15, 2024, the Company issued an aggregate $1,155,000 in convertible notes bearing interest at 10% per annum. The notes mature on December 31, 2025 and\nis convertible, into the Company’s common stock at a price of $1.43 per share, subject to certain adjustments, at the holder’s request. The noteholders and certain third parties\nwere also granted detachable 5 year warrants to purchase an aggregate of 4,887,118 shares of the Company’s common stock at exercise prices ranging from $1.43 to $1.692 per\nshare. The Company valued the warrants at $6,163,572 using the Black-Scholes pricing model. The Company has allocated the note proceeds based on relative fair value and\nhas recorded the value of the warrants as a discount to the debt in the amount of $973,200. At September 30, 2024, the principal balances were still outstanding and is included\non the Company’s condensed consolidated balance sheets net of discounts at $7,112. The Company has accrued interest for the notes in the amount of $24,223, which is\nincluded in accounts payable and accrued liabilities on the Company’s unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets.\nNote 5. Leases\nOperating Leases\nThe Company’s principal executive office in Tampa Florida is under a month-to-month arrangement with a base rent of $250 per month. The Company also leases\noffice space in New York, New York under a similar month-to-month arrangement.\nThe Company has operating leases for corporate, business and technician offices. Leases with a probable term of 12 months or less, including month-to-month\nagreements, are not recorded on the unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets, unless the arrangement includes an option to purchase the underlying asset, or an option\nto renew the arrangement, that the Company is reasonably certain to exercise (short-term leases). The Company recognizes lease expense for these leases on a straight-line\nbases over the lease term. The Company’s only remaining lease is month-to-month. As a practical expedient, the Company elected, for all office and facility leases, not to\nseparate non-lease components (common-area maintenance costs) from lease components (fixed payments including rent) and instead to account for each separate lease\ncomponent and its associated non-lease components as a single lease component.\nFor the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the components of lease expense were as follows:\nFor the three months ended For the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nOperating lease cost $ 1,206 $ 392 $ 3,339 $ 1,262\nTotal lease cost $ 1,206 $ 392 $ 3,339 $ 1,262\nAs of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had no additional operating leases, other than those noted above, and no financing leases.\nNote 6. Commitments and Contingencies\nIn conducting its business, the Company may become involved in legal proceedings. The Company will accrue a liability for such matters when it is probable that a\nliability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. When only a range of possible loss can be established, the most probable amount in the range is\naccrued. If no amount within this range is a better estimate than any other amount within the range, the minimum amount in the range is accrued. The accrual for a litigation\nloss contingency might include, for example, estimates of potential damages, outside legal fees and other directly related costs expected to be incurred.\n16\nCorProminence d/b/a Core IR v. SCWorx\nAAA Arbitration Case 01-22-0001-5709\nAs previously disclosed in the Company’s periodic reports filed with the SEC, on April 25, 2022, the Company received a Demand for Arbitration along with a\nStatement of Claim filed by Core IR with the American Arbitration Association seeking damages in the amount of approximately $190,000 arising out of a marketing and\nconsulting agreement. The Company filed its answer, affirmative defenses and counterclaims on May 16, 2022. By order of the arbitrator dated November 1, 2022, Core IR\nreceived permission to amend its Statement of Claim to increase its request for damages to $257,546. The Company received the final decision of the Arbitrator on October 16,\n2023, awarding Core IR $461,856 including unpaid compensation, indemnification for legal fees and costs, prevailing party legal fees and interest (the “Award”). Core IR has\nsince obtained a judgement in the amount of approximately $502,000 (including interest) (“Judgement”) which is included in accounts payable and accrued liabilities on the\nCompany’s unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2023. The Company and Core IR entered into a settlement agreement dated July 12, 2024 under\nwhich the Company agreed to issue Core IR shares of its common stock with a value of $502,000 (determined based on sales proceeds realized by Core IR), in full and\ncomplete satisfaction of the Judgement. On July, 18, 2024, the Company issued the first tranche of common stock under this agreement valued at $218,094. The remaining\nbalance of $283,906 owed under the settlement agreement is included accounts payable and accrued liabilities in the Company’s unaudited condensed consolidated balance\nsheet at September 30, 2024.\nHadrian Equities Partners, LLC et ano. v. SCWorx Corp,\nCase No. 22-cv-07096 (JLR) (S.D.N.Y)\nOn August 19, 2022, Hadrian Equities Partners, LLC and the Phillip W. Caprio, Jr. 2007 Irrevocable Trust filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the\nSouthern District of New York alleging that SCWorx was dilatory and did not comply with its alleged contractual duties to remove the restrictions from Plaintiffs’ converted\nAMMA stock to SCWorx stock until August 10 and August 11, 2020. Plaintiffs allege that as a result, they were unable to sell their SCWorx stock when SCWorx was trading at\nits highest price on April 13, 2020. The Complaint sought $500,000 in damages. Plaintiffs filed an Amended Complaint on November 28, 2022. On February 6, 2023, SCWorx\nfiled its answer to the Amended Complaint interposing numerous defenses.

The Company has accrued for this liability which is included in accounts payable and accrued liabilities on the Company’s\nunaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2023. The cash payment was made in July 2024, and the shares were issued in May 2024.\nCarole R. Bernstein, Esq. v.

Net Loss per Share\nBasic net loss per share is computed by dividing net loss for the period by the weighted average shares of common stock outstanding during each period. Diluted net\nloss per share is computed by dividing net loss for the period by the weighted average shares of common stock, common stock equivalents and potentially dilutive securities\noutstanding during each period. The Company uses the treasury stock method to determine whether there is a dilutive effect of outstanding option grants.\nThe following securities were excluded from the computation of diluted net loss per share for the periods presented because including them would have been anti-\ndilutive:\nFor the three and nine months\nended September 30,\n2024 2023\nStock options 3,333 6,667\nWarrants 4,896,219 44,831\nRestricted stock units 122,274 166,439\nTotal common stock equivalents 5,021,826 217,937\nNote 9. Related Party Transactions\nAt September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had a payable due to an officer in the amount of $149,838 for contract work performed prior to\nbecoming an officer.\nDuring September 2021, the Company’s former CEO and shareholder advanced $100,000 in cash to the Company for short term capital requirements. This amount is\nnon-interest bearing and payable upon demand. The Company had a balance of $67,622 included in shareholder advance on the Company’s unaudited condensed consolidated\nbalance sheets as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.\nBetween January 18, 2024 and July 11, 2024, the Company’s CFO advanced an aggregate $128,479 in cash to the Company for short term capital requirements. As of\nSeptember 30, 2024, all advanced amounts have been repaid.\nThe above amounts and terms are not necessarily indicative of what third parties would agree to.\n20\nNote 10. Income Tax Provision\nThe Company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes in accordance with ASC Topic 740, “Income Taxes.” Under this method, income tax\nexpense is recognized for the amount of: (i) taxes payable or refundable for the current year and (ii) deferred tax consequences of temporary differences resulting from matters\nthat have been recognized in an entity’s financial statements or tax returns. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable\nincome in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is\nrecognized in the results of operations in the period that includes the enactment date.\nValuation allowances are provided if, based upon the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be\nrealized. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company has evaluated available evidence and concluded that the Company may not realize all the benefits of\nits deferred tax assets; therefore, a valuation allowance has been established for its deferred tax assets.\nAs of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $39.7 million and $38.8 million,\nrespectively, available to offset future taxable income. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had state loss carry-forwards of approximately $19.1\nmillion and $18.2, respectively. Future utilization of net operating losses may be limited due to potential ownership changes under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of\n1986, as amended (the “Code”). The federal net operating loss carryforwards can be carried forward indefinitely and state loss carryforwards begin to expire in 2039.\nThe valuation allowance as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was approximately $12,290,000 and $12,126,000, respectively. The net change in valuation\nallowance for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was an increase of approximately $164,000. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management\nconsiders whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred income tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred income tax assets\nis dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the scheduled\nreversal of deferred income tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. Based on consideration of these items,\nmanagement has determined that enough uncertainty exists relative to the realization of the deferred income tax asset balances to warrant the application of a full valuation\nallowance as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.\nAs of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the difference between the tax provision at the statutory federal income tax rate and the tax provision attributable to\nloss before income tax is as follows (in percentages):\nStatutory federal income tax rate 21.00%\nState tax rate 1.65%\nValuation Allowance (22.65)%\n0.00%\nNote 11. Subsequent Events\nWe have evaluated all events that occurred after the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements were issued to determine if they must be reported.\nManagement has determined that other than those disclosed below, there were no additional reportable subsequent events to be disclosed.\nIssuance of Shares as Settlement of Accounts Payable\nOn October 24, 2024, the Company issued 27,600 shares of common stock in full settlement of $32,016 of accounts payable. The shares had a fair value of $1.16 per\nshare.\n21\nItem 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nYou should read the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with our unaudited condensed consolidated financial\nstatements and the related notes included in Item 1, “Financial Statements” of this Form 10-Q. In addition to our historical unaudited condensed consolidated financial\ninformation, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates, and beliefs which involves risk, uncertainty and assumptions. Our\nactual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed\nbelow and elsewhere in this Form 10-Q.\nCorporate Information\nSCWorx, LLC (n/k/a SCW FL Corp.) (“SCW LLC”) was a privately held limited liability company which was organized in Florida on November 17, 2016. On\nDecember 31, 2017, SCW LLC acquired Primrose Solutions, LLC (“Primrose”), a Delaware limited liability company, which became its wholly-owned subsidiary and focused\non developing functionality for the software now used and sold by SCWorx Corp. (the “Company” or “SCWorx”). The majority interest holders of Primrose were interest\nholders of SCW LLC and based upon Staff Accounting Bulletin Topic 5G, the technology acquired has been accounted for at predecessor cost of $0. To facilitate the planned\nacquisition by Alliance MMA, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Alliance”), on June 27, 2018, SCW LLC merged with and into a newly-formed entity, SCWorx Acquisition Corp.,\na Delaware corporation (“SCW Acquisition”), with SCW Acquisition being the surviving entity. Subsequently, on August 17, 2018, SCW Acquisition changed its name to\nSCWorx Corp. On November 30, 2018, the Company and certain of its stockholders agreed to cancel 6,510 shares of common stock. In June 2018, the Company began to\ncollect subscriptions for common stock. From June to November 2018, the Company collected $1,250,000 in subscriptions and issued 3,125 shares of common stock to new\nthird-party investors. In addition, on February 1, 2019, (i) SCWorx Corp. (f/k/a SCWorx Acquisition Corp.) changed its name to SCW FL Corp. (to allow Alliance to change its\nname to SCWorx Corp.) and (ii) Alliance acquired SCWorx Corp. (n/k/a SCW FL Corp.) in a stock-for-stock exchange transaction and changed Alliance’s name to SCWorx\nCorp., which is the Company’s current name, with SCW FL Corp. becoming the Company’s subsidiary. On March 16, 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, SCWorx\nestablished a wholly-owned subsidiary, Direct-Worx, LLC to endeavor to source and provide critical, difficult-to-find items for the healthcare industry which it has since\nceased.\nOn October 6, 2023, following stockholder approval at the Company’s annual meeting, the Company amended its certificate of incorporation to implement a 1 for 15\nreverse split of its common stock. The effect of the reverse stock split was to combine every 15 shares of outstanding common stock into one share of common stock. The\nreverse stock split was effective at the opening of the trading day on October 11, 2023.\nThe effects of the reverse stock split have been reflected in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for all periods presented.\nOur Business\nSCWorx is a provider of data content and services related to the repair, normalization and interoperability of information for healthcare providers and big data analytics\nfor the healthcare industry.\nSCWorx has developed and markets health information technology solutions and associated services that improve healthcare processes and information flow within\nhospitals.

SCWorx’s software modules perform separate functions as follows:\n● virtualized Item Master File repair, expansion and automation;\n● CDM management;\n● contract management;\n● request for proposal automation;\n● rebate management;\n● big data analytics modeling; and\n● data integration and warehousing.\nSCWorx continues to provide transformational data-driven solutions to some of the finest, most well-respected healthcare providers in the United States.

SCWorx\nprovides these solutions through a combination of direct sales and relationships with strategic partners.\nSCWorx’s software solutions are delivered to clients within a fixed term period, typically a three-to-five-year contracted term, where such software is hosted in\nSCWorx data centers (Amazon Web Service’s “AWS” or RackSpace) and accessed by the client through a secure connection in a software as a service (“SaaS”) delivery\nmethod.\nSCWorx currently sells its solutions and services in the United States to hospitals and health systems through its direct sales force and its distribution and reseller\npartnerships.\nImpact of the COVID-19 Pandemic\nThe Company’s operations and business have experienced disruption due to the unprecedented conditions surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic which spread\nthroughout the United States and the world. The outbreak adversely impacted new customer acquisition. The Company has followed the recommendations of local health\nauthorities to minimize exposure risk for its team members since the outbreak.\nIn addition, the Company’s customers (hospitals) also experienced extraordinary disruptions to their businesses and supply chains, while experiencing unprecedented\ndemand for health care services related to COVID-19. As a result of these extraordinary disruptions to the Company’s customers’ business, the Company’s customers were\nfocused on meeting the nation’s health care needs in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, the Company believes that its customers were not able to focus resources\non expanding the utilization of the Company’s services, which has adversely impacted the Company’s growth prospects, at least until the adverse effects of the pandemic\nsubside. In addition, the financial impact of COVID-19 on the Company’s hospital customers could cause the hospitals to delay payments due to the Company for services,\nwhich could negatively impact the Company’s cash flows.\n23\nResults of Operations – Three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023\nOur operating results for the three month period ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 are summarized as follows:\nThree Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 Difference\nRevenue $ 759,724 $ 906,099 $ (146,375)\nCost of revenues 627,148 666,808 (39,660)\nOperating expenses 526,074 1,097,273 (571,199)\nOther expense (31,465) (276) (31,189)\nProvision for income taxes - - -\nNet loss $ (424,963) $ (858,258) $ 433,295\nRevenues\nRevenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was $759,724 as compared to $906,099 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. This decrease was\nprimarily due to the expiration and non-renewal of certain customer contracts.\nCost of revenues\nCost of revenues was $627,148 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to $666,808 for the same period in 2023. The decrease was primarily the\nresult of staffing reductions.\nOperating expenses\nOperating expenses decreased $571,199 to $526,074 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to $1,097,273 in the same period of 2023. The\ndecrease is primarily attributable to decreases in legal and professional fees of approximately $50,000, a one time accrual for a legal settlement of approximately $470,000 and\nstock-based compensation of $41,000. We expect operating expenses to remain relatively flat during the rest of 2024.\nOther income (expense)\nWe had other expenses of $31,465 and $276 during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, comprised of interest expense. The increase\nwas due to the issuance of new interest-bearing convertible notes as well as the amortization of note discounts during the current year period.\nNet loss\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2024, we incurred a net loss of $424,963 compared to a net loss of $858,258 for the same period in 2023 due to the factors\ndetailed above.\nResults of Operations – Nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023\nOur operating results for the nine month period ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 are summarized as follows:\nNine months ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 Difference\nRevenue $ 2,313,850 $ 2,894,647 $ (580,797)\nCost of revenues 1,726,314 1,972,300 (245,986)\nOperating expenses 1,466,637 2,328,209 (861,572)\nOther expense (61,834) (6,208) (55,626)\nProvision for income taxes - - -\nNet loss $ (940,935) $ (1,412,070) $ 471,135\n24\nRevenues\nRevenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was $2,313,850 as compared to $2,894,647 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This decrease was\nprimarily due to the expiration and non-renewal of certain customer contracts.\nCost of revenues\nCost of revenues was $1,726,314 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to $1,972,300 for the same period in 2023. The decrease was primarily the\nresult of staffing reductions.\nOperating expenses\nOperating expenses decreased $861,572 to $1,466,637 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to $2,328,209 in the same period of 2023. The\ndecrease is primarily attributable to decreases in salaries and wages of approximately $48,000, a one-time accrual for a legal settlement of approximately $470,000 and stock-\nbased compensation of $336,000, partially offset by an increase in legal and professional fees of approximately $31,000. We expect operating expenses to remain relatively flat\nduring the rest of 2024.\nOther income (expense)\nWe had other expenses of $61,834 and $6,208 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, comprised of interest expense. The increase\nwas largely due to an original interest discount on a loan issued in the current year, the issuance of new interest-bearing convertible notes as well as the amortization of note\ndiscounts during the current year.\nNet loss\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we incurred a net loss of $940,935 compared to a net loss of $1,412,070 for the same period in 2023 due to the factors\ndetailed above.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nCash Flows\nNine months ended\nSeptember 30,\n2024 2023\nNet cash used in operating activities $ (949,860) $ (701,282)\nNet cash used in investing activities - -\nNet cash provided by financing activities 946,090 524,249\nChange in cash $ (3,770) $ (177,033)\nOperating Activities\nCash used in operating activities was approximately $950,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, mainly related to the net loss of approximately\n$940,000, a $267,000 increase in accounts receivable and a $219,000 decrease in deferred revenue, partially offset by amortization of discounts on debt agreements of $37,000,\ncommon stock issued for settlement of payables and legal settlements of $314,000 credit loss expense of $25,000, and a decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of\n$107,000.\nCash used in operating activities was approximately $701,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, mainly related to the net loss of approximately\n$1,412,000, a $51,000 increase in accounts receivable and a decrease in deferred revenue of $188,000, partially offset by non-cash stock-based compensation of $336,000, bad\ndebt expense of $64,000, an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $539,000 and decrease in prepaid expenses of $10,000.\n25\nInvesting Activities\nThe Company did not have any investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.\nFinancing Activities\nCash provided by financing activities was approximately $946,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, consisting of proceeds loans payable of $995,000\npartially offset by repayments of loans payable of $48,000.\nCash provided by financing activities was approximately $524,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, consisting of approximately $573,000 in proceeds\nfrom the sale of common stock and $23,000 in proceeds from advances from related party, offset by $48,000 in repayments of notes payable, and $24,000 in repayments of\nshareholder advances.\nLiquidity and Going Concern\nManagement has concluded that on our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 conditions\nexist that raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern since we may not have sufficient capital resources from operations and existing financing\narrangements to meet our operating expenses and working capital requirements. We have historically incurred operating losses and may continue to incur operating losses for\nthe foreseeable future. We believe that these conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. This may hinder our future ability to obtain\nfinancing or may force us to obtain financing on less favorable terms than would otherwise be available. If we are unable to develop sufficient revenues and additional\ncustomers for our products and services, we may not generate enough revenue to sustain our business, and we may fail, in which case our stockholders would suffer a total loss\nof their investment. There can be no assurance that we will be able to continue as a going concern.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K.\nItem 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nWe are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information under this item.\nItem 4. Controls and Procedures\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nManagement conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our “disclosure controls and procedures” (“Disclosure Controls”), as defined by Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-\n15(e) of the Exchange Act, as of September 30, 2024, the end of the period covered by this Form 10-Q, as required by Rules 13a-15(b) and 15d-15(b) of the Exchange Act. The\nDisclosure Controls evaluation was done under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer,\nbased on the 2013 framework and criteria established by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. There are inherent limitations to the\neffectiveness of any system of Disclosure Controls. Accordingly, even effective Disclosure Controls can only provide reasonable assurance of achieving their control objectives.\nBased upon this evaluation, our President and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, due to deficiencies in the design of internal controls and lack of segregation of\nduties, our Disclosure Controls were not effective as of September 30, 2024, such that the Disclosure Controls did not ensure that the information required to be disclosed by us\nin reports filed under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms and (ii) accumulated\nand communicated to our management, including our principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow\ntimely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting.\nDuring the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, there was no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rule 13a-\n15(f) under the Exchange Act) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\n26\nPART II - OTHER INFORMATION\nItem 1. Legal Proceedings\nIn conducting our business, we may become involved in legal proceedings. We will accrue a liability for such matters when it is probable that a liability has been\nincurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. When only a range of possible loss can be established, the most probable amount in the range is accrued. If no amount\nwithin this range is a better estimate than any other amount within the range, the minimum amount in the range is accrued. The accrual for a litigation loss contingency might\ninclude, for example, estimates of potential damages, outside legal fees and other directly related costs expected to be incurred.\nCorProminence d/b/a Core IR v. SCWorx\nAAA Arbitration Case 01-22-0001-5709\nAs previously disclosed in the Company’s periodic reports filed with the SEC, on April 25, 2022, the Company received a Demand for Arbitration along with a\nStatement of Claim filed by Core IR with the American Arbitration Association seeking damages in the amount of approximately $190,000 arising out of a marketing and\nconsulting agreement. The Company filed its answer, affirmative defenses and counterclaims on May 16, 2022. By order of the arbitrator dated November 1, 2022, Core IR\nreceived permission to amend its Statement of Claim to increase its request for damages to $257,546. The Company received the final decision of the Arbitrator on October 16,\n2023, awarding Core IR $461,856 including unpaid compensation, indemnification for legal fees and costs, prevailing party legal fees and interest (the “Award”). Core IR has\nsince obtained a judgement in the amount of approximately $502,000 (including interest) (“Judgement”) which is included in accounts payable and accrued liabilities on the\nCompany’s condensed consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2023. The Company and Core IR entered into a settlement agreement dated July 12, 2024 under which the\nCompany agreed to issue Core IR shares of its common stock with a value of $502,000 (determined based on sales proceeds realized by Core IR), in full and complete\nsatisfaction of the Judgement. On July, 18, 2024, the Company issued the first tranche of common stock under this agreement valued at $218,094. The remaining balance of\n$283,906 owed under the settlement agreement is included in the Company’s unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet at September 30, 2024.\nHadrian Equities Partners, LLC et ano. v. SCWorx Corp,\nCase No. 22-cv-07096 (JLR) (S.D.N.Y)\nOn August 19, 2022, Hadrian Equities Partners, LLC and the Phillip W. Caprio, Jr. 2007 Irrevocable Trust filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the\nSouthern District of New York alleging that SCWorx was dilatory and did not comply with its alleged contractual duties to remove the restrictions from Plaintiffs’ converted\nAMMA stock to SCWorx stock until August 10 and August 11, 2020. Plaintiffs allege that as a result, they were unable to sell their SCWorx stock when SCWorx was trading at\nits highest price on April 13, 2020. The Complaint sought $500,000 in damages. Plaintiffs filed an Amended Complaint on November 28, 2022. On February 6, 2023, SCWorx\nfiled its answer to the Amended Complaint interposing numerous defenses. Plaintiff has since entered into a settlement agreement dated December 1, 2023 (effective as of\nOctober 23, 2023) (as amended April 29, 2024), under which the Company agreed to pay Plaintiffs $20,000 and issue them 37,500 shares of common stock, all in full\nsettlement of the claims made in the lawsuit. The Company has accrued for this liability which is included in accounts payable and accrued liabilities on the Company’s\nunaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2023. The cash payment was made in July 2024, and the shares were issued in May 2024.\nCarole R. Bernstein, Esq. v.

Bernstein, Esq. filed a complaint in the United\nStates District Court for the Southern District of New York against the Company. The complaint alleged that the Company breached its engagement agreement with Ms.\nBernstein by failing to pay legal fees when due. Ms. Bernstein sought to recover $69,164 fees owing for services, plus interest, costs, including her attorney’s fees. The\nCompany has accrued for this liability which is included in accounts payable and accrued liabilities on the Company’s unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets at\nSeptember 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The Company and the Plaintiff have since entered into a settlement agreement dated July 12, 2024, under which the Company\nagreed to pay Plaintiffs $80,000 in two equal installments of $40,000, the first of which was paid August 9, 2024, and the second of which was paid October 8, 2024.\n27\nItem 1A.

All statements other than statements of historical fact contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are\nforward-looking statements. These statements, among other things, relate to our business strategy, goals and expectations concerning our services, future operations, prospects,\nplans and objectives of management. The words “anticipate”, “believe”, “continue”, “could”, “estimate”, “expect”, “intend”, “may”, “plan”, “predict”, “project”, “will”,\nand similar terms and phrases are used to identify forward-looking statements in this presentation.\nOur operations involve risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside our control, and any one of which, or a combination of which, could materially affect our\nresults of operations and whether the forward-looking statements ultimately prove to be correct. We have based these forward-looking statements largely on our current\nexpectations and projections about future events and trends that we believe may affect our financial condition, results of operations, business strategy, short-term and long-term\nbusiness operations and objectives, and financial needs. Forward-looking statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K include, without limitation, statements reflecting\nmanagement’s expectations for future financial performance and operating expenditures (including our ability to continue as a going concern, to raise additional capital and to\nsucceed in our future operations), expected growth, profitability and business outlook, and operating expenses.\nForward-looking statements are only current predictions and are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties, and other factors that may cause our actual\nresults, levels of activity, performance, or achievements to be materially different from those anticipated by such statements. These factors include, among other things, the\nunknown risks and uncertainties that we believe could cause actual results to differ from these forward looking statements as set forth under the heading, “Risk Factors” and\nelsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. New risks and uncertainties emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict all of the risks and uncertainties\nthat could have an impact on the forward-looking statements, including without limitation, risks and uncertainties relating to our ability to:\n● reverse the recent decline in our revenue and resume growing our revenue;\n● resolve the various litigation proceedings and investigations pending against us on favorable terms or at all;\n● obtain additional financing in sufficient amounts or on acceptable terms so that we can fund our business plan;\n● reduce our dependence on third-party subcontractors to perform some of the work on our contracts;\n● mitigate the impact of new or changed laws, regulations or other industry standards that could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business;\n● mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our revenues;\n● adopt and master new technologies and adjust certain fixed costs and expenses to adapt to our industry’s and customers’ evolving demands; and\n● mitigate the impact of changes in general market, economic and political conditions in the United States and global economies or financial markets, including\nthose resulting from natural or man-made disasters.\nAlthough we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are reasonable, we cannot\nguarantee future results, levels of activity, performance, or achievements. In light of inherent risks, uncertainties and assumptions, the future events and trends discussed in this\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K may not occur and actual results could differ materially and adversely from those anticipated or implied in the forward-looking statements.\nExcept as required by law, we are under no duty to update or revise any of such forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise,\nafter the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nYou should read this Annual Report on Form 10-K with the understanding that our actual future results, levels of activity, performance and events and circumstances\nmay be materially different from what we expect.\nAll references to “SCWorx,” “we,” “us,” “our” or the “Company” mean SCWorx Corp., a Delaware corporation, and where appropriate, its wholly owned\nsubsidiaries.\nii\nPART I\nItem 1. Business\nCorporate Information\nSCWorx, LLC (n/k/a SCW FL Corp.) (“SCW LLC”) was a privately held limited liability company which was organized in Florida on November 17, 2016. On\nDecember 31, 2017, SCW LLC acquired Primrose Solutions, LLC (“Primrose”), a Delaware limited liability company, which became its wholly-owned subsidiary and focused\non developing functionality for the software now used and sold by SCWorx Corp. (the “Company” or “SCWorx”). The majority interest holders of Primrose were interest\nholders of SCW LLC and based upon Staff Accounting Bulletin Topic 5G, the technology acquired has been accounted for at predecessor cost of $0. To facilitate the planned\nacquisition by Alliance MMA, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Alliance”), on June 27, 2018, SCW LLC merged with and into a newly-formed entity, SCWorx Acquisition Corp.,\na Delaware corporation (“SCW Acquisition”), with SCW Acquisition being the surviving entity. Subsequently, on August 17, 2018, SCW Acquisition changed its name to\nSCWorx Corp. On November 30, 2018, the Company and certain of its stockholders agreed to cancel 6,510 shares of common stock. In June 2018, the Company began to\ncollect subscriptions for common stock. From June to November 2018, the Company collected $1,250,000 in subscriptions and issued 3,125 shares of common stock to new\nthird-party investors. In addition, on February 1, 2019, (i) SCWorx Corp. (f/k/a SCWorx Acquisition Corp.) changed its name to SCW FL Corp. (to allow Alliance to change its\nname to SCWorx Corp.) and (ii) Alliance acquired SCWorx Corp. (n/k/a SCW FL Corp.) in a stock-for-stock exchange transaction and changed Alliance’s name to SCWorx\nCorp., which is the Company’s current name, with SCW FL Corp. becoming the Company’s subsidiary. On March 16, 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, SCWorx\nestablished a wholly-owned subsidiary, Direct-Worx, LLC to endeavor to source and provide critical, difficult-to-find items for the healthcare industry which it has since\nceased.\nOn October 6, 2023, following stockholder approval at the Company’s annual meeting, the Company amended its certificate of incorporation to implement a 1 for 15\nreverse split of its common stock. The effect of the reverse stock split was to combine every 15 shares of outstanding common stock into one share of common stock. The\nreverse stock split was effective at the opening of the trading day on October 11, 2023.\nThe effects of the reverse stock split have been reflected in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for all periods presented.\nOur principal executive offices are located at 100 S Ashley Dr, Suite 100 Tampa, FL 33602. Our telephone number is (844) 472-9679.\nIn this Annual Report, the terms “SCWorx”, “Alliance,” “Alliance MMA,” the “Company,” “we,” “us” and “our” refer to SCWorx, Corp. (f/k/a Alliance MMA, Inc.).\nUnless specified otherwise, the historical financial results in this Annual Report are those of SCWorx and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis.\nOur Business\nSCWorx is a provider of data content and services related to the repair, normalization and interoperability of information for healthcare providers, as well as big data\nanalytics for the healthcare industry.\nSCWorx has developed and markets health care information technology solutions and associated services that improve healthcare processes and information flow\nwithin hospitals and other healthcare facilities. SCWorx’s software enables a healthcare provider to simplify and organize its data (“data normalization”), allows the data to be\nutilized across multiple internal software applications (“interoperability”) and provides the basis for sophisticated data analytics (“big data”). Customers use our software to\nachieve multiple operational benefits, such as supply chain cost reductions, decreased accounts receivables aging, accelerated and completed patient billing in less than 72\nhours, contract optimization, increased supply chain management and total cost visibility via dynamic AI connections that automatically structures, repairs, synchronizes and\nmaintains purchasing (“MMIS”), Clinical (“EMR”) and finance (“CDM”) systems. SCWorx’s customers include some of the most prestigious healthcare organizations in the\nUnited States. SCWorx offers an advanced software solution for the management of health care providers’ foundational business applications, empowering its customers to\nsignificantly reduce costs, drive better clinical outcomes and enhance their revenue. SCWorx supports the interrelationship between the three core healthcare provider systems:\nSupply Chain, Financial and Clinical. This solution integrates common keys within distinct and variable databases that allows the repaired foundational data to move\nseamlessly from one application to another enabling our Customers to drive supply chain cost reductions, optimize contracts, increase supply chain management (“SCM”), cost\nvisibility, control rebates and contract administration fees.\n1\nCurrently, the business systems of hospitals are frequently deficient and often unconnected from each other. These deficiencies in part result from the vast amount of\nunstructured, manually created and managed data that proliferates within the hospital’s supply chain, clinical and billing systems. SCWorx’s solutions are designed to improve\nthe flow of information quickly and accurately between the buy-side (supply chain purchasing systems), the consumption-side (clinical documentation systems like the\nelectronic medical records (“EMR”)) and billing and collection systems (patient billing systems). The currently poor state of interoperability limits the potential value of each\nindependent system and requires significant expense and extensive human resource commitments from senior personnel to stay ahead of problems and complete basic\nadministrative tasks. SCWorx provides an information service that ultimately leads to safer, more cost effective and financially efficient patient care.\nSCWorx has demonstrated that in order for the core hospital systems to function properly there must be a Single Source of Truth (“SSOT”) for all products utilized and\nultimately billed for. The Item Master File (“IMF”), which is a database of all known products used in hospital and health care settings, must be accurate at all times and\nexpanded upon to hold both clinical and financial attributes. An accurate and expanded Item Master File supports interoperability between the supply chain, clinical and\nfinancial systems by delivering, on demand, reports detailing the purchasing, utilization and revenue associated with each and every item used, allowing hospitals to better\nmanage their business. The Single Source of Truth establishes a common vernacular and syntax, while assigning a consistent meaning across the healthcare provider’s core\nsystems and accurately migrating data from one application to another and removing disconnects between critical business systems.\nSCWorx’s Software Solutions/Services\nSCWorx empowers healthcare providers to maintain comprehensive access and visibility to an advanced business intelligence that enables better decision-making and\nreductions in product costs and utilization, ultimately leading to accelerated and accurate patient billing. SCWorx’s software modules perform separate functions as follows:\n● Virtualized Item Master File repair, expansion and automation — The process begins with data normalization — data is put into a simplified and normalized\nstructure and location for use throughout the enterprise. The SCWorx software normalizes, automates and builds interoperability via advanced attribution, vendor\nand contract mapping, product categorization, repairing the unit of measure and establishing revenue codes and flags. SCWorx improves the healthcare providers’\nbusiness processes through the establishment of a clean and normalized Item Master File that improves efficiencies, eliminates cumbersome and error-prone\nmanual processes, and provides an integrated cloud-based suite of services that enhances the productivity of operating room staff, supply chain margins and\nbilling revenue through the seamless sharing and accuracy of critical business data.\n● Electronic Medical Record Management — The Electronic Medical Record (EMR) module integrates the advanced data attributes created by SCWorx in the Item\nMaster into the EMR. The EMR serves as the database that hospitals use to document all clinical procedures in terms of the products used and the costs that\nshould be charged. What makes this module special is that prior to its creation there was no mechanism that tied product purchases to actual utilization. Hospitals,\nbeing mass consumption businesses, had no way to identify excess ordering that always accompanies mass consumption organizations. In addition, the automation\nand consistency of delivered attributes dramatically reduces the administrative burden as today these additional attributes are being created by expensive clinical\nresources manually — over and over again by each hospital. The SCWorx EMR management system creates one vernacular for each hospital so they see the data\nin a manner that suits them — and then creates a universal vernacular so they can see their performance against other like institutions.\n● Charge Description Master Management — The Charge Description Master (CDM) Management module assists healthcare providers by integrating the CDM\ndata into the workflow of the hospitals purchasing systems so that the latest costs can be automatically updated against the hospitals charging systems. The CDM\ndata provided by SCWorx is made more accurate, and the resulting data is integrated to the Item Master for real-time delivery to the EMR — this data is the last\nremaining piece of information that is consumed by the EMR and passed ultimately to the patient billing systems. SCWorx provides real-time integration,\nautomation and management of Item Master File, Clinical Information Systems and the Charge Description Master.\n2\n● Contract Management — SCWorx’s Contract Management Module assists healthcare providers to establish an efficient contract management system and to\nprovide first class care to patients, while reducing operating costs, assuring adherence to compliance requirements, and mitigating risk. By linking the Item Master\nFile to the healthcare providers contract management system and procedures, SCWorx simplifies the way contracts are managed from start to finish by\nstreamlining the processes of creating, routing, reviewing and approving contracts. SCWorx delivers a data warehouse platform which integrates item master\nmanagement, spend analysis, and contract management. These solutions enable financial staff across the healthcare provider to drill down quickly and deeply into\nactionable and real-time financial data and key performance indicators to improve revenue realization and staff efficiency. This suite of solutions includes the\nability to automatically push price changes to a contract, compliance for standard and non-standard products, contract compliance and optimization reporting,\nreliable cost data for current and alternate products, cost performance metrics, matching purchase order price to contract and contract repository.\n● Request for Proposal (“RFP”) Automation — With the reality of shrinking operating margins, increasing operating expenses and decreasing insurance\nreimbursements, hospitals must evaluate all major expenditures. In addition, requirements for provable quality of service supported by trackable metrics now\nfrequently necessitate the search for better options available in the marketplace. Since hospital-based provider subsidies are often a major expense item and since\nthere are often perceived opportunities for quality improvement, it is a reasonable practice for hospital leadership to carefully evaluate all of their current hospital-\nbased services and associated financial support before each contract renegotiation. The proliferation of large regional and national providers, with their ability to\nderive benefits from economies of scale, have made RFPs much more of a competitive process. Hospital administrators, however, often rely on poor or conflicting\ndata when creating an RFP. Through the integration and utilization of the SSOT SCWorx automates the RFP process and makes it more accurate. SCWorx\nautomates the core sourcing processes with the intention to accelerate cycle times, surveys and confirms business preferred processes, designs and builds a flow\nchart for the current and desired workflows, cross references bid analysis, implements bid scoring, customizes software to support automation and customizes the\nreport writer and output documents.\n● Integration of Acquired Businesses — The agnostic design of the SCWorx solution enables rapid deployment of a virtual Item Master File to quickly and easily\nallow combining healthcare providers to share information and achieve cost synergies and interoperability without large and cumbersome upgrades or\nimplementations. During the consolidation of healthcare providers, SCWorx cleans the data and makes the data available to the disparate systems. In addition,\nM&A activity requires in-depth reporting for comparison of Group Purchasing Organization (“GPO”) contract overlap. When healthcare providers that use\ndifferent GPOs merge, or are acquired, there is a lack of information to compare contracts. SCWorx provides information for comparative purposes to solve these\nissues rapidly.\n● Rebate Management — Frequently, vendors use rebates and incentives as a key part of their pricing strategy and structure when selling to hospitals. This tactic\nmakes pricing more attractive to healthcare providers. When tracked through Accounts Payable, and issued correctly, rebates can help healthcare organizations\nsave money. At any large healthcare provider, vendor rebates can be difficult to manage since they require a multi-step process to track dollars earned, credits\nissued, and monies paid. Rebates frequently cause tracking challenges for Accounts Payable departments. Inconsistent tracking is the primary problem for loss of\nsavings with vendor rebate programs. SCWorx’s Rebate Management Module enables healthcare providers to correctly calculate and track rebates provided by\nhealthcare provider vendors. Purchasing or Contracting departments monitor rebates by creating and maintaining a Rebates Master List which is provided to the\nAccounts Payable department. To assist in this cumbersome process, SCWorx provides information from the SSOT, such as historical data, frequent updates,\nadvanced administrative fee reporting, purchase rebate tracking, early payment/discount management and Vendor Master Data alignment.\n3\n● Big Data Analytics Model — SCWorx provides an in-depth, easy-to-use web portal for display, reporting and analysis of the information contained within the\nSCWorx data warehouse. SCWorx’s analytics solution enables healthcare providers to view benchmarking information, quickly add new items to the SSOT and\nidentify cost savings through this real-time and on-demand solution. In addition to simplifying the item add process, SCWorx provides peer comparison reporting\nagainst similar healthcare providers and a list of informative reports for business measurement, such as spend trend analysis, contract gap analysis, market price\ncomparison, etc. The SCWorx product line is a simplified user experience and visual display for the hospital employee which does not require access to the\nSCWorx application.\n● Data Integration and Warehousing — Healthcare providers maintain a significant amount of data. In many cases the data is not useful for analytics since the data\nis held within an individual “silo.” SCWorx establishes an expandable, data warehouse of items that have been normalized, repaired and enriched as the SSOT for\nuseful benchmarking, interoperability and analytics. SCWorx’s data warehouse allows healthcare providers to effectively use the data contained in their\nenvironment and efficiently establish the supply chain as a leading driver of revenue cycle management. The data warehouse is updated as frequently as every five\nminutes without intervention.\n● ScanWorx — Our mobile perioperative closed loop scanning solution is driven by the SCWorx foundational data structure, and utilizes interoperable data\nexchanges to push and secure the customer’s enriched item master, all built around the customer’s internal business rules and chart of account requirements\noffering the following:\n■ Cloud hosted mobile scanning solution, which automates the consumption of known and unknown implant device utilization during surgical procedures via\nintuitive Scanning or smart searching features.\n■ All scanned device utilization will capture all available attributes, such as Global Trade Item Number, Lot, Serial numbers, expiration dates.\n■ ScanWorx will establish the following connections with existing Enterprise Resource Planning (“ERP”) and Electronic Medical Record (“EMR”) enterprise\nsystems for the following:\n○ EMR — Daily scheduling feeds with case information\n○ ERP — Bill-Only electronic purchase orders\n○ EMR — Case closure with device utilization integration\n■ ScanWorx has the ability to consume additional product utilization per case when provided by the EMR for surgical preference cards, central sterile\nprocessing products, and anesthesia gas.\n■ ScanWorx will identify and automate the Item-Add process for unknown items introduced during surgical procedures based on customer’s existing business\nrules.\nSCWorx continues to provide transformational data-driven solutions to some of the finest, most well-respected healthcare providers in the United States. Clients are\ngeographically dispersed throughout the country. The Company’s focus is to assist healthcare providers with issues they have pertaining to data interoperability. SCWorx\nprovides these solutions through a combination of direct sales and relationships with strategic partners.\nSCWorx’s software solutions are delivered to clients within a fixed term period, typically a three-to-five-year contracted term, where such software is hosted in\nSCWorx data centers (Amazon Web Service’s “AWS” or RackSpace) and accessed by the client through a secure connection in a software as a service (“SaaS”) delivery\nmethod.\n4\nSCWorx currently sells its solutions and services in the United States to hospitals and health systems through its direct sales force and its distribution and reseller\npartnerships.\nImpact of the COVID-19 Pandemic\nThe Company’s operations and business have experienced disruption due to the unprecedented conditions surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic which spread\nthroughout the United States and the world. The outbreak adversely impacted new customer acquisition. The Company has followed the recommendations of local health\nauthorities to minimize exposure risk for its team members since the outbreak.\nIn addition, the Company’s customers (hospitals) also experienced extraordinary disruptions to their businesses and supply chains, while experiencing unprecedented\ndemand for health care services related to COVID-19. As a result of these extraordinary disruptions to the Company’s customers’ business, the Company’s customers were\nfocused on meeting the nation’s health care needs in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Thus, the Company believes that its customers were not able to focus resources on\nexpanding the utilization of the Company’s services, which has adversely impacted the Company’s growth prospects, at least until the adverse effects of the pandemic subside.\nIn addition, the financial impact of COVID-19 on the Company’s hospital customers could cause the hospitals to delay payments due to the Company for services, which could\nnegatively impact the Company’s cash flows.\nClients and Strategic Partners\nSCWorx continues to provide transformational data-driven solutions to some of the finest, most well-respected healthcare providers in the United States. Clients are\ngeographically dispersed throughout the country and the continued focus is to assist healthcare providers with issues they have pertaining to data interoperability. SCWorx\nprovides these solutions through a combination of direct sales and relationships with strategic partners.\nCompetition\nSCWorx competes against a variety of vendors and smaller companies which provide solutions in the specific markets we address. Our principal competitors include:\n● purchasing departments that have limited budgets and may be attempting to manually repair the item master file;\n● large companies with a long list of products and services and small companies which may provide item master normalization and data cleanse services; and\n● software companies or service providers, as well as small, specialized vendors, that provide complementary or competitive solutions in benchmarking or data\nanalytics and data warehousing that may compete with our offerings.\nSome of our actual and perceived competitors have advantages over us, such as longer operating histories, greater financial, technical, marketing or other resources,\nstronger brand and business user recognition, larger intellectual property portfolios, broader distribution and presence, and competitive pricing. In addition, our industry is\nevolving rapidly and is becoming increasingly competitive.\nBarriers to entry to the data management market include technological and application sophistication, the ability to offer a proven product, creating and utilizing a\nwell-established client base and distribution channels, brand recognition, the ability to provide agnostic interoperability and to operate on a variety of MMIS, EMR and\nfinancial platforms, the ability to integrate with pre-existing systems and capital for sustained development and marketing activities.\nSCWorx believes that these obstacles taken together represent a moderate to high-level barrier to entry on the data management side of our business. The principal\ncompetitive factors in our markets are product features, functionality and support, product depth and breadth (number of items in the central data warehouse), flexibility, ease of\ndeployment and use, total cost of ownership and time to value. We believe that we generally compete favorably on the basis of these factors. For example, besides our agnostic\ninteroperability, additional key strengths include the SCWorx data warehouse, which exceeds 12 million items, SCWorx Big Data analytics and benchmarking.\n5\nContracts, License and Service Fees\nSCWorx enters into agreements with its clients that specify the scope of the solution to be installed and/or services to be provided by SCWorx, as well as the agreed-\nupon aggregate price, applicable duration and the timetable for the associated licenses and services.\nFor clients purchasing software to be installed locally or provided on a SaaS model, these are multi-element arrangements that include a term license granting the right\nto access the applicable software functionality (whether installed locally at the client site or the right to use our company’s solutions as a part of SaaS services), terms regarding\nmaintenance and support services, terms for any third-party components such as infrastructure and software, and professional services for implementation, integration, process\nengineering, optimization and training, as well as fees and payment terms for each of the foregoing. If the client purchases solutions on a long-term license model, the client\nmay be billed the license fee up front or on a monthly or quarterly basis. Maintenance and support are provided on a term basis for separate fees, with an initial term of typically\nthree to five years. The license, maintenance and support fee is charged annually in advance, commencing either upon contract execution or deployment of the solution in live\nproduction. If the client purchases solutions on a term-based model, the client is billed periodically a combined access fee for a specified term, typically three to five years in\nlength.\nSCWorx also generally provides software and SaaS client’s professional services for implementation, integration, process engineering, and optimization and training.\nThese services and the associated fees are separate from the license, maintenance and access fees. Professional services are provided on either a fixed-fee or hourly\narrangements billable to clients based on agreed-to payment milestones (fixed fee) or monthly payment structure on hours incurred (hourly). These services can either be\nincluded at the time the related SaaS solution is licensed as part of the initial purchase agreement or added on afterward as an addendum to the existing agreement for services\nrequired after the initial implementation.\nFor one-time data normalization services clients, these normalization services are provided either through a stand-alone services agreement or services addendum to an\nexisting master agreement with the client. These normalization services are available as either a one-time service or recurring monthly, quarterly or annual review structure.\nThese services are typically provided on a per item basis. Payment typically occurs upon completion of the applicable normalization project. The commencement of revenue\nrecognition varies depending on the size and complexity of the system and/or services involved, the implementation or performance schedule requested by the client and usage\nby clients of SaaS for software-based components. SCWorx’s agreements are generally non-cancellable but provide that the client may terminate its agreement upon a material\nbreach by SCWorx and/or may delay certain aspects of the installation or associated payments in such events. SCWorx does allow for termination for convenience in certain\nsituations. SCWorx also includes trial or evaluation periods for certain clients, especially for new or modified solutions. Therefore, it is difficult for SCWorx to accurately\npredict the revenue it expects to achieve in any particular period, and a termination or installation delay of one or more phases of an agreement, or the failure of SCWorx to\nprocure additional agreements, could have a material adverse effect on SCWorx’s business, financial condition, and results of operations. Historically, SCWorx has not\nexperienced a material amount of contract cancellations; however, SCWorx sometimes experiences delays during contract implementation, and SCWorx accounts for them\naccordingly.\nThird Party License Fees\nSCWorx incorporates software licensed from various third-party vendors into its proprietary software. Stand-alone third-party software is also required to operate\ncertain of SCWorx’s proprietary software and/or SaaS services. SCWorx licenses these software products and pays the required license fees when such software is delivered to\nclients.\nGovernment Regulation\nManagement believes that governmental regulation is not material to our current core data management business.\n6\nIntellectual Property\nWe protect our intellectual property rights by relying on federal, state and common law rights, as well as contractual restrictions. We control access to our proprietary\ntechnology by entering into confidentiality agreements, invention assignment agreements and work for hire agreements with our employees and contractors, and confidentiality\nagreements with third parties. We further control the use of our proprietary technology and intellectual property through provisions in our websites’ terms of use. Agreements\nbetween the Company and end-users includes a license agreement in which a non-transferable non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, limited use license to use the licensed products\nfor the duration of the service order. Customers may not modify, copy, translate, decompile, disassemble, reverse engineer, loan, rent, lease, sublicense, or create derivative\nworks of the licensed products, in whole or in part. Customer agrees to maintain software and data as Confidential Information.\nThe Company currently hosts our solution, serves our customers, and supports our operations in the United States through an agreement with a third-party hosting and\ninfrastructure provider, Rackspace. The Company incorporates standard IT security measures, including but not limited to; firewalls, disaster recovery, backup, etc.\nCircumstances outside our control could pose a threat to our intellectual property rights. For example, effective intellectual property protection may not be available in\nthe United States or other countries in which we seek protection of our marks or our copyrighted works. Also, the efforts we have taken to protect our proprietary rights may not\nbe sufficient or effective. Any significant impairment of our intellectual property rights may harm our business or our ability to compete.\nSeasonality\nWe do not believe that SCWorx’s revenues are impacted by seasonality.\nEmployees\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had 7 employees, of which 2 were management and finance and the rest in operations. We primarily utilize independent contractors and\nthird-party vendors for software, maintenance of our database and customer software installation.\nAvailable Information\nOur website address is www.SCWorx.com.

Risk Factors\nCertain factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. You should carefully consider the risks\nand uncertainties described below, in addition to other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including our consolidated financial statements and related\nnotes. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties of which we are unaware, or that we currently believe are\nnot material, may also become important factors that adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. If any of the following risks occurs,\nour business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be materially and adversely affected. In that event, the trading price of our common stock could\ndecline, and you could lose part or all of your investment.\n7\nRisks Related to Our Financial Results and Financing Plans\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted our business and the business of our hospital customers.\nThe Company’s operations and business have experienced disruption due to the unprecedented conditions surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic which spread\nthroughout the United States and the world. The outbreak adversely impacted new customer acquisition. The Company has followed the recommendations of local health\nauthorities to minimize exposure risk for its team members since the outbreak.\nIn addition, the Company’s customers (hospitals) also experienced extraordinary disruptions to their businesses and supply chains, while experiencing unprecedented\ndemand for health care services related to COVID-19. As a result of these extraordinary disruptions to the Company’s customers’ business, the Company’s customers were\nfocused on meeting the nation’s health care needs in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Thus, the Company believes that its customers were not able to focus resources on\nexpanding the utilization of the Company’s services, which has adversely impacted the Company’s growth prospects, at least until the adverse effects of the pandemic subside.\nIn addition, the financial impact of COVID-19 on the Company’s hospital customers could cause the hospitals to delay payments due to the Company for services, which could\nnegatively impact the Company’s cash flows.\nWe have a history of losses and may continue to incur losses in the future.\nWe have a history of losses and may continue to incur losses in the future, which could negatively impact the trading value of our common stock. For the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023, our revenues were $3,804,943, and we had a net loss of $3,981,144. For the year ended December 31, 2022, our revenues were $4,038,188, and we had a\nnet loss of $1,847,406. At December 31, 2023, we had an accumulated deficit of $29,839,841.\nWe incurred losses from operations of $1,450,662 for the year ended December 31, 2023 and $2,126,597 for the year ended December 31, 2022. We may continue to\nincur operating and net losses in future periods. These losses may increase, and we may never achieve profitability for a variety of reasons, including increased competition,\ndecreased growth in our target market and other factors described elsewhere in this “Risk Factors” section. If we cannot achieve sustained profitability, our stockholders may\nlose all or a portion of their investment in our company.\nIf we are unable to grow our revenue, we may never achieve or sustain profitability.\nTo become profitable, we must, among other things, increase our revenues. Our total revenues declined approximately $233,000 (5.7%) to $3,804,943 in the year\nended December 31, 2023 as compared to $4,038,188 in the year ended December 31, 2022. This decline in revenue may continue if we are unable to develop and market new\nproducts, which could help us increase our sales to existing customers or develop new customers. Even if we are able to grow our revenues, they may not be sufficient to\nexceed increases in our operating expenses or to enable us to achieve or sustain profitability.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nThere is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nOur auditors have indicated in their report on our financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023 that conditions exist that raise substantial doubt about our\nability to continue as a going concern since we may not have sufficient capital resources from operations and existing financing arrangements to meet our operating expenses\nand working capital requirements.\n8\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had only limited cash on hand, a working capital deficit of $1,898,625 and accumulated deficit of $29,839,841. During the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023, we had a net loss of $3,981,144 and used $806,164 of cash in operations. We have historically incurred operating losses and may continue to incur\noperating losses for the foreseeable future. We believe that these conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. This may hinder our ability\nto obtain financing or may force us to obtain financing on less favorable terms than would otherwise be available. If we are unable to develop sufficient revenues and additional\ncustomers for our products and services, we may not generate enough revenue to sustain our business, and we may fail, in which case our stockholders would suffer a total loss\nof their investment. There can be no assurance that we will be able to continue as a going concern.\nWe currently have an immediate need for additional capital. If we are unable to obtain additional capital, we will not be able to implement our business strategy or\nsuccessfully operate our business; however, additional financings will subject our existing stockholders to dilution.\nTo continue our growth path, we expect to finance our future expansion plans through public or private equity offerings or debt financing. Additional funds may not be\navailable when we need them on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all. We have recently encountered some difficulty in raising funds from external sources. If adequate\nfunds are not available, we may be required to further delay or reduce the scope of our business plans. To the extent that we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities,\nour stockholders will experience dilution. In addition, debt financing, if available, may involve restrictive covenants. We may seek to access the public or private capital\nmarkets whenever conditions are favorable, even if we do not have an immediate need for additional capital at that time. Our access to the financial markets and the pricing and\nterms we receive in the financial markets could be adversely impacted by various factors, including changes in financial markets and interest rates.\nOur future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to, the costs and timing of our future acquisitions.\nA failure to successfully execute our growth strategy could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nSubject to the receipt of sufficient funding, which we currently do not have, we intend to pursue growth through expanding our sales force, product offerings and\nproject skill-sets and capabilities, as well as increasing critical mass to enable us to bid on larger contracts.\nWe may also consider potential acquisitions if conditions permit. However, we may be unable to find suitable acquisition candidates or to complete acquisitions on\nfavorable terms, if at all. Moreover, any completed acquisition may not result in the intended benefits. For example, while the historical financial and operating performance of\nan acquisition target are among the criteria we evaluate in determining which acquisition targets we will pursue, there can be no assurance that any business or assets we\nacquire will continue to perform in accordance with past practices or will achieve financial or operating results that are consistent with or exceed past results. Any such failure\ncould adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, any completed acquisition may not result in the intended benefits for other reasons\nand our acquisitions will involve a number of other risks, including:\n● We may have difficulty integrating the acquired companies;\n● Our ongoing business and management’s attention may be disrupted or diverted by transition or integration issues and the complexity of managing geographically\nor culturally diverse enterprises;\n● We may not realize the anticipated cost savings or other financial benefits we anticipated;\n● We may have difficulty retaining or hiring key personnel, customers and suppliers to maintain expanded operations;\n● Our internal resources may not be adequate to support our operations as we expand, particularly if we are awarded a significant number of contracts in a short time\nperiod;\n9\n● We may have difficulty retaining and obtaining any required regulatory approvals, licenses and permits;\n● We may not be able to obtain additional equity or debt financing on terms acceptable to us or at all, and any such financing could result in dilution to our\nstockholders, impact our ability to service our debt within the scheduled repayment terms and include covenants or other restrictions that would impede our ability\nto manage our operations;\n● We may have failed to, or be unable to, discover liabilities of the acquired companies during the course of performing our due diligence; and\n● We may be required to record additional goodwill as a result of an acquisition, which will reduce our tangible net worth.\nAny of these risks could prevent us from executing on any acquisition we might complete, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of\noperations and prospects. At this time, we are not considering any acquisition.\nOur contracts may require us to perform extra or change order work, which can result in disputes and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of\noperations and prospects.\nOur contracts generally require us to perform extra or change order work as directed by the customer, even if the customer has not agreed in advance on the scope or\nprice of the extra work to be performed. This process may result in disputes over whether the work performed is beyond the scope of the work included in the original project\nplans and specifications or, if the customer agrees that the work performed qualifies as extra work, the price that the customer is willing to pay for the extra work. Even when\nthe customer agrees to pay for the extra work, we may be required to fund the cost of such work for a lengthy period of time until the change order is approved by the customer\nand we are paid by the customer.\nTo the extent that actual recoveries with respect to change orders or amounts subject to contract disputes or claims are less than the estimates used in our financial\nstatements, the amount of any shortfall will reduce our future revenues and profits, and this could adversely affect our reported working capital and results of operations. In\naddition, any delay caused by the extra work may adversely impact the timely scheduling of other project work and our ability to meet specified contract milestone dates.\nWe derive a significant portion of our revenue from a few customers and the loss of one of these customers, or a reduction in their demand for our services, could adversely\naffect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nOur customer base is highly concentrated. Due to the size and nature of our contracts, one or a few customers have during any given year, as well as over a period of\nconsecutive years, represented a substantial portion of our consolidated revenues and gross profits, see Note 3, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies for further detail.\nRevenues under our contracts with significant customers may continue to vary from period to period depending on the timing or volume of work that those customers contract\nfrom us. A limited number of customers may continue to comprise a substantial portion of our revenue for the foreseeable future.\nA default or delay in payment on a significant scale could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. We could lose business\nfrom a significant customer for a variety of reasons, including:\n● the consolidation, merger or acquisition of an existing customer, resulting in a change in procurement strategies employed by the surviving entity that could\nreduce the amount of work we receive;\n● our performance on individual contracts or relationships with one or more significant customers could become impaired due to another reason, which may cause\nus to lose future business with such customers and, as a result, our ability to generate income would be adversely impacted;\n● key customers could slow or stop spending on initiatives related to projects we are performing for them due to increased difficulty in the markets as a result of\neconomic downturns or other reasons.\n10\nSince many of our customer contracts allow our customers to terminate the contract without cause, our customers may terminate their contracts with us at will, which\ncould impair our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nOur failure to adequately expand our direct sales force will impede our growth.\nWe will need to expand and optimize our sales infrastructure in order to grow our customer base and our business. We plan to expand our account management/sales\nforce when and if we have sufficient capital to do so. Identifying and recruiting qualified personnel and training them requires significant time, expense and attention. If we are\nunable to hire, develop and retain talented account management/sales personnel or if the personnel are unable to achieve desired productivity levels in a reasonable period of\ntime, we may not be able to realize the intended benefits of this investment or increase our revenue.\nIf we are unable to attract and retain qualified executive officers and managers and consultants, we will be unable to operate efficiently, which could adversely affect our\nbusiness, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nWe depend on the continued efforts and abilities of our management and consultants, to establish and maintain our customer relationships and identify strategic\nopportunities. The loss of any one of them could negatively affect our ability to execute our business strategy and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of\noperations and prospects. Competition for managerial talent with significant industry experience is high, and we may lose access to executive officers/consultants for a variety\nof reasons, including more attractive compensation packages offered by our competitors. Although we have entered into employment agreements with certain of our senior\nlevel management, we cannot guarantee that any of them or other key management/consulting personnel will remain employed by us for any length of time.\nFines, judgments and other consequences resulting from our failure to comply with regulations or adverse outcomes in litigation proceedings could adversely affect our\nbusiness, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nFrom time to time, we may be involved in lawsuits and regulatory actions, including class action lawsuits that are brought or threatened against us in the ordinary\ncourse of business. These actions may seek, among other things, compensation for alleged personal injury, workers’ compensation, violations of the Fair Labor Standards Act\nand state wage and hour laws, employment discrimination, breach of contract, property damage, punitive damages, civil penalties, and consequential damages or other losses,\nor injunctive or declaratory relief.\nPlease refer to Item 3. Legal Proceedings of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a detailed description of the pending legal actions and investigations.\nAny defects or errors, or failures to meet our customers’ expectations could result in large damage claims against us. Claimants may seek large damage awards and,\ndue to the inherent uncertainties of litigation, we cannot accurately predict the ultimate outcome of any such proceedings. Any failure to properly estimate or manage cost, or\ndelay in the completion of projects, could subject us to penalties.\nThe ultimate resolution of these matters through settlement, mediation or court judgment could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of\noperations and cash flows. Regardless of the outcome of any litigation, these proceedings could result in substantial cost and may require us to devote substantial resources to\ndefend ourselves. When appropriate, we establish reserves for litigation and claims that we believe to be adequate in light of current information, legal advice and professional\nindemnity insurance coverage, and we adjust such reserves from time to time according to developments. If our reserves are inadequate or insurance coverage proves to be\ninadequate or unavailable, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects may suffer.\n11\nIf we are required to reclassify independent contractors as employees, we may incur additional costs and taxes which could adversely affect our business, financial\ncondition, results of operations and prospects.\nWe use a significant number of independent contractors in our operations for whom we do not pay or withhold any federal or state employment tax. There are a\nnumber of different tests used in determining whether an individual is an employee or an independent contractor and such tests generally take into account multiple factors.\nThere can be no assurance that legislative, judicial or regulatory (including tax) authorities will not introduce proposals or assert interpretations of existing rules and regulations\nthat would change, or at least challenge, the classification of our independent contractors. Although we believe we have properly classified our independent contractors, the\nU.S. Internal Revenue Service or other U.S. federal or state authorities or similar authorities of a foreign government may determine that we have misclassified our independent\ncontractors for employment tax or other purposes and, as a result, seek additional taxes from us or attempt to impose fines and penalties. If we are required to pay employer\ntaxes or pay backup withholding with respect to prior periods with respect to or on behalf of our independent contractors, our operating costs will increase, which could\nadversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nOur dependence on subcontractors and suppliers could increase our cost and impair our ability to complete contracts on a timely basis or at all.\nWe rely on third-party subcontractors to perform some of the work on our contracts. We also rely on third-party suppliers to provide materials needed to perform our\nobligations under those contracts. We generally do not bid on contracts unless we have the necessary subcontractors and suppliers committed for the anticipated scope of the\ncontract and at prices that we have included in our bid. Therefore, to the extent that we cannot engage subcontractors or suppliers, our ability to bid for contracts may be\nimpaired. In addition, if a subcontractor or third-party supplier is unable to deliver its goods or services according to the negotiated terms for any reason, we may suffer delays\nand be required to purchase the services from another source at a higher price. We sometimes pay our subcontractors and suppliers before our customers pay us for the related\nservices. If customers fail to pay us and we choose, or are required, to pay our subcontractors for work performed or pay our suppliers for goods received, we could suffer an\nadverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nOur insurance coverage may be inadequate to cover all significant risk exposures.\nWe will be exposed to liabilities that are unique to the services we provide. While we intend to maintain insurance for certain risks, the amount of our insurance\ncoverage may not be adequate to cover all claims or liabilities, and we may be forced to bear substantial costs resulting from risks and uncertainties of our business. It is also\nnot possible to obtain insurance to protect against all operational risks and liabilities. The failure to obtain adequate insurance coverage on terms favorable to us, or at all, could\nhave a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nRisks Related to Our Industry\nOur industry is highly competitive, with a variety of larger companies with greater resources competing with us, and our failure to compete effectively could reduce the\nnumber of new contracts awarded to us or adversely affect our market share and harm our financial performance.\nThe contracts on which we bid are generally awarded through a competitive bid process, with awards generally being made to the lowest bidder, but sometimes based\non other factors, such as shorter contract schedules, larger scale to complete projects or prior experience with the customer. Within our markets, we compete with many other\nservice providers. Price is often the principal factor in determining which service provider is selected by our customers, especially on smaller, less complex projects. As a result,\nany organization with adequate financial resources and access to technical expertise may become a competitor. Smaller competitors are sometimes able to win bids for these\nprojects based on price alone because of their lower costs and financial return requirements. Additionally, our competitors may develop the expertise, experience and resources\nto provide services that are equal or superior in price to our services, and we may not be able to maintain or enhance our competitive position.\n12\nSome of our competitors have already achieved greater market penetration than we have in the markets in which we compete, and some have greater financial and\nother resources than we do. A number of national companies in our industry are larger than we are and, if they so desire, could establish a presence in our markets and compete\nwith us for contracts. As a result of this competition, we may need to accept lower contract margins in order to compete against competitors that have the ability to accept\nawards at lower prices or have a pre-existing relationship with a customer. If we are unable to compete successfully in our markets, our business, financial condition, results of\noperations and prospects could be adversely affected.\nMany of the customers we serve are subject to consolidation and rapid technological and regulatory change, and our inability or failure to adjust to our customers’\nchanging needs could reduce demand for our services.\nWe derive, and anticipate that we will continue to derive, a substantial portion of our revenue from customers in the medical industry. This industry is subject to rapid\nchanges in technology and governmental regulation. Changes in technology may reduce the demand for the services we provide. Additionally, the medical industry has been\ncharacterized by a high level of consolidation that may result in the loss of one or more of our customers. Our failure to rapidly adopt and master new technologies as they are\ndeveloped in any of the industries we serve or the consolidation of one or more of our significant customers could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of\noperations and prospects.\nFurther, our customers are regulated by the Department of Health and Human Services and other regulators. These regulators may interpret the application of their\nregulations in a manner that is different than the way such regulations are currently interpreted and may impose additional regulations, either of which could reduce demand for\nour services and adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nEconomic downturns could cause capital expenditures in the industries we serve to decrease, which may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of\noperations and prospects.\nThe demand for our services has been and may be vulnerable to general downturns in the United States economy. Our customers are affected by economic changes\nthat decrease the need for or the profitability of their services. This can result in a decrease in the demand for our services and potentially result in the delay or cancellation of\nprojects by our customers. As a result, some of our customers may opt to defer or cancel pending projects. A downturn in overall economic conditions also affects the priorities\nplaced on various projects funded by governmental entities and federal, state and local spending levels.\nIn general, economic uncertainty makes it difficult to estimate our customers’ requirements for our services. Subject to receipt of sufficient funding, which we\ncurrently do not have, we plan to expand our sales force to enable us to grow our revenues. If economic factors in any of the regions in which we plan to expand are not\nfavorable to the growth and development of the medical industry, we may not be able to carry out our growth strategy, which could adversely affect our business, financial\ncondition, results of operations and prospects.\nOther Risks Relating to Our Company and Results of Operations\nOur operating results may fluctuate due to factors that are difficult to forecast and not within our control.\nOur past operating results may not be accurate indicators of future performance, and you should not rely on such results to predict our future performance.\nOur operating results have fluctuated and could fluctuate in the future. Factors that may contribute to fluctuations include:\n● our ability to effectively manage our working capital;\n● our ability to satisfy customer demands in a timely and cost-effective manner; and\n● pricing and availability of labor.\n13\nActual results could differ from the estimates and assumptions that we use to prepare our financial statements.\nTo prepare financial statements in conformity with GAAP, management is required to make estimates and assumptions as of the date of the financial statements that\naffect the reported values of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. Areas requiring significant estimates by our\nmanagement include:\n● contract costs and profits and revenue recognition of contract change order claims;\n● provisions for uncollectible receivables and customer claims;\n● recoveries of costs from subcontractors, suppliers and others;\n● valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with business combinations;\n● accruals for estimated liabilities, including litigation and insurance reserves; and\n● goodwill and intangible asset impairment assessment.\nAt the time the estimates and assumptions are made, we believe they are accurate based on the information available. However, our actual results could differ from,\nand could require adjustments to, those estimates.\nWe exercise judgment in determining our provision for taxes in the United States that are subject to tax authority audit review that could result in additional tax liability\nand potential penalties that would negatively affect our net income.\nThe amounts we record in intercompany transactions for services, licenses, funding and other items affects our potential tax liabilities. Our tax filings are subject to\nreview or audit by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and state, local and foreign taxing authorities. We exercise judgment in determining our worldwide provision for income\nand other taxes and, in the ordinary course of our business, there may be transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Examinations of our\ntax returns could result in significant proposed adjustments and assessment of additional taxes that could adversely affect our tax provision and net income in the period or\nperiods for which that determination is made.\nRisks Related to our Common Stock\nOur common stock price has fluctuated substantially, and the trading price of our common stock is likely to continue to be volatile, which could result in losses to investors\nand litigation.\nIn addition to changes to market prices based on our results of operations and the factors discussed elsewhere in this “Risk Factors” section, the market price of and\ntrading volume for our common stock may change for a variety of other reasons, not necessarily related to our actual operating performance. The capital markets have\nexperienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the\ntrading price of our common stock. In addition, the average daily trading volume of the securities of small companies can be very low, which may contribute to future volatility.\nRecently, the average daily trading volume of our common stock has decreased. Factors that could cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate significantly\ninclude:\n● the results of operating and financial performance and prospects of other companies in our industry;\n● strategic actions by us or our competitors, such as acquisitions or restructurings;\n● announcements of innovations, increased service capabilities, new or terminated customers or new, amended or terminated contracts by our competitors;\n14\n● the public’s reaction to our press releases, media coverage and other public announcements, and filings with the SEC;\n● market conditions for providers of services to the medical industry;\n● lack of securities analyst coverage or speculation in the press or investment community about us or opportunities in the markets in which we compete;\n● changes in government policies in the United States;\n● changes in earnings estimates or recommendations by any securities or research analysts who track our common stock or failure of our actual results of operations\nto meet any such expectations;\n● dilution caused by the conversion into common stock of convertible securities or by the exercise of outstanding warrants or options;\n● market and industry perception of our success, or lack thereof, in pursuing our growth strategy;\n● changes in accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretations or principles;\n● any lawsuit involving us, our services or our products;\n● arrival and departure of key personnel;\n● government investigations of our business activities;\n● sales of common stock by us, our investors or members of our management team; and\n● changes in general market, economic and political conditions in the United States and global economies or financial markets, including those resulting from\nnatural or man-made disasters.\nAny of these factors, as well as broader market and industry factors, may result in large and sudden changes in the trading volume of our common stock and could\nseriously harm the market price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance. This may prevent stockholders from being able to sell their shares at or above\nthe price they paid for shares of our common stock, if at all. In addition, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company’s securities, stockholders often institute\nsecurities class action litigation against that company. Our involvement in any class action suit or other legal proceeding could divert our senior management’s attention and\ncould adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nThe sale or availability for sale of substantial amounts of our common stock could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nSales of substantial amounts of shares of our common stock, or the perception that these sales could occur, would likely adversely affect the market price of our\ncommon stock and could impair our future ability to raise capital through common stock offerings.\nAs of December 31, 2023, there were outstanding warrants to purchase an aggregate of 11,394 shares of our common stock at a weighted-average exercise price of\n$58.72 per share, all of which were exercisable as of such date. As of December 31, 2023, there were outstanding options to purchase an aggregate of 3,333 shares of our\ncommon stock at a weighted-average exercise price of $39.60 per share, all of which were exercisable as of such date. The market price of our common stock also may be\nadversely affected by our issuance of shares of our capital stock or convertible securities in connection with future acquisitions, or in connection with our financing efforts.\n15\nWe have never paid cash dividends on our common stock and do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock.\nWe have never paid cash dividends and do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. We currently intend to retain any\nearnings to finance our operations and growth. As a result, any short-term return on your investment will depend on the market price of our common stock, and only\nappreciation of the price of our common stock, which may never occur, will provide a return to stockholders. The decision whether to pay dividends will be made by our board\nof directors in light of conditions then existing, including, but not limited to, factors such as our financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, business\nconditions, and covenants under any applicable contractual arrangements. Investors seeking cash dividends should not invest in our common stock.\nIf equity research analysts do not publish research or reports about our business, or if they issue unfavorable commentary or downgrade our common stock, the market\nprice of our common stock will likely decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock will rely in part on the research and reports that equity research analysts, over whom we have no control, publish about us\nand our business. We may never obtain research coverage by securities and industry analysts. If no securities or industry analysts commence coverage of our company, the\nmarket price for price of our common stock could decline. In the event we obtain securities or industry analyst coverage, the market analysts issue unfavorable commentary,\neven if it is inaccurate, or cease publishing reports about us or our business.\nA failure by us to establish and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results.\nMaintaining effective internal control over financial reporting is necessary for us to produce accurate and complete financial reports and to help prevent financial\nfraud. In addition, such control is required in order to maintain the listing of our common stock on the Nasdaq Capital Market. While we have undertaken remedial steps to\nimprove our financial reporting process, including the implementation of a firm-wide accounting information system that collects, stores and processes financial and accounting\ndata on a consolidated basis for use in meeting our reporting obligations, our internal control over financial reporting has not been effective. For the year ended December 31,\n2023, we did not have effective controls over financial reporting. Our management has identified material weaknesses in our internal controls related to deficiency in our ability\nto have proper segregation of duties.\nIf we are unable to maintain adequate internal controls or fail to correct material weaknesses in such controls noted by our management or our independent registered\npublic accounting firm, our business and operating results could be adversely affected, we could again fail to meet our obligations to report our operating results accurately and\ncompletely and our continued listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market could be jeopardized. We have implemented a policy whereby any external communications need to be\nreviewed and approved by a member of our Board of Directors, as well as our outside legal counsel.\nComplying with the laws and regulations affecting public companies will increase our costs and the demands on management and could harm our operating results.\nAs a public company and particularly after we cease to be an “emerging growth company,” we will incur significant additional legal, accounting, and other expenses.\nIn addition, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and rules subsequently implemented by the SEC and the Nasdaq Capital Market impose various requirements on public companies,\nincluding requiring changes in corporate governance practices. Our management and other personnel devote a substantial amount of time to these compliance initiatives.\nMoreover, these rules and regulations have increased and will continue to increase our legal, accounting, and financial compliance costs and have made and will continue to\nmake some activities more time-consuming and costly. For example, these rules and regulations make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer\nliability insurance, and we may be required to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or to incur substantial costs to maintain the same or similar coverage. These rules and\nregulations could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our board of directors or board committees or as executive officers.\n16\nIf we do not manage our planned growth effectively, our revenue, business and operating results may be harmed.\nOur future expansion strategy could include possible acquisitions of other SaaS companies. We may not be able to identify, secure and manage future acquisitions\nsuccessfully. The acquisition of any future businesses may require a greater than anticipated investment of operational and financial resources as we seek to institute uniform\nstandards and controls across acquired businesses. Acquisitions may also result in the diversion of management and resources, increases in administrative costs, including those\nrelating to the assimilation of new employees, and costs associated with any financings undertaken in connection with such acquisitions. We cannot assure you that any\nacquisition we undertake, including those we have already made, will be successful. Future growth will also place additional demands on our management, sales, and marketing\nresources, and may require us to hire and train additional employees. We will need to expand and upgrade our systems and infrastructure to accommodate our growth, and we\nmay not have the resources to do so in the time frames required. The failure to manage any future growth effectively will materially and adversely affect our business, financial\ncondition and results of operations.\nWe may explore acquiring additional companies and such acquisitions may subject us to additional unknown risks.\nWe may make future acquisitions of SaaS or other companies in markets that we do not serve now. We may not be able to reach agreements with such companies on\nfavorable terms or at all. In completing acquisitions, we will rely upon the representations and warranties and indemnities made by the sellers with respect to each acquisition as\nwell as our own due diligence investigation. We cannot assure you that such representations and warranties will be true and correct or that our due diligence will uncover all\nmaterially adverse facts relating to the operations and financial condition of the acquired companies or their businesses. To the extent that we are required to pay for\nundisclosed obligations of an acquired company, or if material misrepresentations exist, we may not realize the expected economic benefit from such acquisition and our ability\nto seek legal recourse from the seller may be limited.\nThe value of our goodwill and other intangible assets may decline.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company had goodwill of $5,842,433. We evaluate goodwill at least annually, and will do so more frequently if events or circumstances\nindicate that impairment may have occurred. Many of the assumptions and estimates that we make in order to estimate the fair value of our intangible assets directly impact the\nresults of impairment testing, including an estimate of future expected revenues, earnings and cash flows, and the discount rates applied to expected cash flows. We are able to\ninfluence the outcome and ultimate results based on the assumptions and estimates we choose for testing. To avoid undue influence, we have set criteria that are followed in\nmaking assumptions and estimates. The determination of whether goodwill or acquired intangible assets have become impaired involves a significant level of judgment in the\nassumptions underlying the approach used to determine the value of our reporting unit. Changes in our strategy or market conditions could significantly impact these judgments\nand require adjustments to recorded amounts of intangible assets.\nAny future acquisitions may result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities, the incurrence of indebtedness and increased amortization expense.\nAny future acquisitions are likely to result in issuances of equity securities, which will be dilutive to the equity interests of existing stockholders, and may involve the\nincurrence of debt, which will require us to maintain cash flows sufficient to make payments of principal and interest, the assumption of known and unknown liabilities, and the\namortization of expenses related to intangible assets, all of which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may become involved in litigation which could harm the value of our business.\nBecause of the nature of our business and the exit from lines of business, there is a risk of litigation. Any litigation could cause us to incur substantial expenses\nwhether or not we prevail, which would reduce the capital available for our operations.\nPlease refer to Item 3. Legal Proceedings of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a detailed description of the pending legal actions and investigations.\n17\nEconomic uncertainty impacts our business and financial results, and a renewed recession could materially affect us in the future.\nPeriods of economic slowdown or recession could lead to a reduction in demand for our software and services, which in turn would reduce our revenues and adversely\naffect our results of operations and our financial position. Our business will be dependent upon business discretionary spending and therefore is affected by business confidence\nas well as the future performance of the United States and global economies. As a result, our results of operations are susceptible to economic slowdowns and recessions.\nWe depend on the services of key executives and consultants, and the loss of these persons could materially harm our business and our strategic direction if we were unable\nto replace them with persons of equal experience and capabilities.\nOur future success significantly depends on the continued service and performance of our key management and other personnel. We cannot prevent members of senior\nmanagement/consultants from terminating their employment with us even if we have an employment or consulting agreement with them. Losing the services of members of\nsenior management/consultants could materially harm our business until a suitable replacement is found, and such replacement may not have equal experience and capabilities.\nWe have not purchased life insurance covering any members of our senior management.\nThe markets in which we operate are highly competitive, rapidly changing and increasingly fragmented, and we may not be able to compete effectively, especially against\ncompetitors with greater financial resources or marketplace presence.\nWe face competition from other SaaS companies. Many of the companies with which we will compete have greater financial and technical resources than are available\nto us. Our failure to compete effectively could result in a significant loss of customers, which would adversely affect our operating results.\nWe need additional capital to support our operations and the growth of our business, and we cannot be certain that this capital will be available on reasonable terms when\nrequired, or at all.\nIn order for us to grow and execute our business plan successfully, we require additional financing which may not be available on acceptable terms or at all. If such\nfinancing is available, it may be dilutive to the equity interests of existing stockholders. Failure to obtain financing will have a material adverse effect on our financial position.\nIf we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us when we require it, our ability to continue to support the operation or growth of our\nbusiness could be significantly impaired and our operating results may be harmed.\nOur common stock may be affected by limited trading volume and price fluctuations, which could adversely impact the value of our common stock and our ability to grow\nour business.\nThere has been limited trading in our common stock, and there can be no assurance that an active trading market in our common stock will either develop or be\nmaintained. Our common stock has experienced, and is likely to experience in the future, significant price and volume fluctuations, which could adversely affect the market\nprice of our common stock without regard to our operating performance. In addition, we believe that factors such as quarterly fluctuations in our financial results and changes\nin the overall economy or the condition of the financial markets could cause the price of our common stock to fluctuate substantially. These fluctuations may also cause short\nsellers to enter the market periodically in the belief that we will have poor results in the future. We cannot predict the actions of market participants and, therefore, can offer no\nassurances that the market for our common stock will be stable or that our share price will appreciate over time.\n18\nOur stock price has been volatile.\nThe market price of our common stock has been highly volatile and could fluctuate widely in price in response to various factors, many of which are beyond our\ncontrol, including the following:\n● our ability to obtain working capital financing;\n● additions or departures of key personnel;\n● sales of our common stock;\n● our ability to execute our business plan;\n● operating results that fall below expectations;\n● regulatory developments; and\n● economic and other external factors.\nIn addition, the securities markets from time to time experience significant price and volume fluctuations that are unrelated to the operating performance of particular\ncompanies. These market fluctuations may also materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nOffers or availability for sale of a substantial number of shares of our common stock may cause the price of our common stock to decline.\nThe periodic availability of shares for sale upon the expiration of any statutory holding period or lockup agreements, could create a circumstance commonly referred to\nas an “overhang”, in anticipation of which the market price of our common stock could fall. The existence of an overhang, whether or not sales have occurred or are occurring,\nalso could make more difficult our ability to raise additional financing through the sale of equity or equity-related securities in the future at a time and price that we deem\nreasonable or appropriate.\nWe may be unable to establish, protect or enforce our intellectual property rights adequately.\nOur success will depend in part on our ability to establish, protect and enforce our intellectual property and other proprietary rights. Our inability to protect our\ntradenames, service marks and other intellectual property rights from infringement, piracy, counterfeiting or other unauthorized use could negatively affect our business. If we\nfail to establish, protect or enforce our intellectual property rights, we may lose an important advantage in the market in which we compete. Our intellectual property rights may\nnot be sufficient to help us maintain our position in the market and our competitive advantages. Monitoring unauthorized uses of and enforcing our intellectual property rights\ncan be difficult and costly. Legal intellectual property actions are inherently uncertain and may not be successful, and may require a substantial resources and management\nattention.\nWe currently host our solution, serve our customers, and support our operations in the United States through an agreement with a third party hosting and infrastructure\nprovider, Rackspace. We incorporate standard IT security measures, including but not limited to; firewalls, disaster recovery, backup, etc.\nCircumstances outside our control could pose a threat to our intellectual property rights. For example, effective intellectual property protection may not be available in\nthe United States or other countries in which we seek protection of our marks or our copyrighted works. Also, the efforts we have taken to protect our proprietary rights may not\nbe sufficient or effective. Any significant impairment of our intellectual property rights may harm our business or our ability to compete.\nChanges in laws, regulations and other requirements could adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nWe are subject to the laws, regulations and other requirements of the jurisdictions in which we operate. Changes to these laws could have a material adverse impact on\nthe revenue, profit or the operation of our business.\n19\nDisruptions in our information technology systems or security breaches of confidential customer information or personal employee information could have an adverse\nimpact on our operations.\nOur operations are dependent upon the integrity, security and consistent operation of various information technology systems and data centers that process\ntransactions, communication systems and various other software applications used throughout our operations. Disruptions in these systems could have an adverse impact on our\noperations. We could encounter difficulties in developing new systems or maintaining and upgrading existing systems. Such difficulties could lead to significant expenses or to\nlosses due to disruption in our business operations.\nIn addition, our information technology systems are subject to the risk of infiltration or data theft. The techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or\ndegrade service, or sabotage information technology systems change frequently and may be difficult to detect or prevent over long periods of time. Moreover, the hardware,\nsoftware or applications we develop or procure from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture or other problems that could unexpectedly compromise the\nsecurity of our information systems. Unauthorized parties may also attempt to gain access to our systems or facilities through fraud or deception aimed at our employees,\ncontractors or temporary staff. In the event that the security of our information systems is compromised, confidential information could be misappropriated, and system\ndisruptions could occur. Any such misappropriation or disruption could cause significant harm to our reputation, lead to a loss of sales or profits or cause us to incur significant\ncosts to reimburse third parties for damages.\nOur current insurance policies may not provide adequate levels of coverage against all claims, and we may incur losses that are not covered by our insurance.\nWe believe we maintain insurance coverage that is customary for businesses of our size and type; however, we may be unable to insure against certain types of losses\nor claims, or the cost of such insurance may be prohibitive. For example, although we carry insurance for breaches of our computer network security, there can be no assurance\nthat such insurance will cover all potential losses or claims or that the dollar limits of such insurance will be sufficient to provide full coverage against all losses or claims.\nUninsured losses or claims, if they occur, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, business and results of operations. Our insurance policies may also be\nsubject to substantial deductibles/retentions.\nWe may be required to pay for the defense of our clients, officers, or directors in accordance with certain indemnification provisions.\nOur company provides indemnification of varying scope to certain customers against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from\nthe use of our services. In accordance with authoritative guidance for accounting for guarantees, we evaluate estimated losses for such indemnification. Management considers\nsuch factors as the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. To date, no such claims have been filed\nagainst our company and, as a result, no liability has been recorded in our financial statements.\nAs permitted under Delaware law, our company has agreements whereby we indemnify our officers and directors for certain events or occurrences while the officer or\ndirector is, or was, serving at our company’s request in such capacity. The maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these\nindemnification agreements is unlimited; however, we have directors’ and officers’ liability insurance coverage that is intended to reduce our financial exposure and may enable\nus to recover a portion of any such payments.\nPlease refer to Item 3. Legal Proceedings of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a detailed description of the various actions and investigations for which we are\nobligated to indemnify our officers and directors.\nItem 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments\nNone.\n20\nItem 2. Properties\nThe Company does not own any real property. The principal executive offices are located at an office complex in Tampa, Florida, consisting of shared office space that\nwe are leasing. The lease is under a month-to-month lease agreement. The lease allows for the limited use of private offices, conference rooms, mail handling,\nvideoconferencing, and certain other business services.\nWe believe that our facilities are adequate for our current needs.\nItem 3. Legal Proceedings\nIn conducting our business, we may become involved in legal proceedings. We will accrue a liability for such matters when it is probable that a liability has been\nincurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. When only a range of possible loss can be established, the most probable amount in the range is accrued. If no amount\nwithin this range is a better estimate than any other amount within the range, the minimum amount in the range is accrued. The accrual for a litigation loss contingency might\ninclude, for example, estimates of potential damages, outside legal fees and other directly related costs expected to be incurred.\nCorProminence d/b/a Core IR v. SCWorx\nAAA Arbitration Case 01-22-0001-5709\nAs previously disclosed in the Company’s periodic reports filed with the SEC, on April 25, 2022, the Company received a Demand for Arbitration along with a\nStatement of Claim filed by Core IR with the American Arbitration Association seeking damages in the amount of approximately $190,000. arising out of a marketing and\nconsulting agreement. The Company filed its answer, affirmative defenses and counterclaims on May 16, 2022. By order of the arbitrator dated November 1, 2022, Core IR\nreceived permission to amend its Statement of Claim to increase its request for damages to $257,546. The Company received the final decision of the Arbitrator on October 16,\n2023, awarding Core IR $461,856 including unpaid compensation, indemnification for legal fees and costs, prevailing party legal fees and interest (the “Award”). Core IR has\nsince obtained a judgement in the amount of approximately $502,000 (including interest) (“Judgement”). The Company and Core IR entered into a settlement agreement dated\nJuly 12, 2024 under which the Company agreed to issue Core IR shares of its common stock with a value of $502,000 (determined based on sales proceeds realized by Core\nIR), in full and complete satisfaction of the Judgement. The settlement agreement is filed as exhibit 10.5 to this annual report on Form 10-K.\nHadrian Equities Partners, LLC et ano. v. SCWorx Corp,\nCase No. 22-cv-07096 (JLR) (S.D.N.Y)\nOn August 19, 2022, Hadrian Equities Partners, LLC and the Phillip W. Caprio, Jr. 2007 Irrevocable Trust filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the\nSouthern District of New York alleging that SCWorx was dilatory and did not comply with its alleged contractual duties to remove the restrictions from Plaintiffs’ converted\nAMMA stock to SCWorx stock until August 10 and August 11, 2020. Plaintiffs allege that as a result, they were unable to sell their SCWorx stock when SCWorx was trading at\nits highest price on April 13, 2020. The Complaint sought $500,000 in damages. Plaintiffs filed an Amended Complaint on November 28, 2022. On February 6, 2023, SCWorx\nfiled its answer to the Amended Complaint interposing numerous defenses. Plaintiff have since entered into a settlement agreement dated December 1, 2023 (effective as of\nOctober 23, 2023) (as amended April 29, 2024), under which the Company agreed to pay Plaintiffs $20,000 and issue them 37,500 shares of common stock, all in full\nsettlement of the claims made in the lawsuit. The cash payment was made in July 2024, and the shares were issued in May 2024.\nCarole R. Bernstein, Esq. v. SCWorx Corp.\nAs previously disclosed in the Company’s Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2023, on June 7, 2023, Carole R. Bernstein, Esq. filed a complaint in the United\nStates District Court for the Southern District of New York against the Company. The complaint alleged that the Company breached its engagement agreement with Ms.\nBernstein by failing to pay legal fees when due. Ms. Bernstein sought to recover $69,164 fees owing for services, plus interest, costs, including her attorney’s fees. The\nCompany and the Plaintiff have since entered into a settlement agreement dated July 12, 2024, under which the Company agreed to pay Plaintiffs $80,000 in two equal\ninstallments of $40,000, the first of which was paid August 9, 2024, and the second of which is payable on or about October 9, 2024.\nItem 4. Mine Safety Disclosures\nNot applicable.\n21\nPART II\nItem 5. Market for the Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities\nMarket Information for Common Stock\nOur common stock was listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol “AMMA” from October 6, 2016 through February 3, 2019. Our symbol was changed to\n“WORX” on February 4, 2019 in connection with the closing of the SCWorx acquisition. The following table sets forth for the indicated periods the high and low closing prices\nfor SCWorx’s common stock as reported on the NASDAQ Capital Market.\nOn October 6, 2023, following stockholder approval at the Company’s annual meeting, the Company amended its certificate of incorporation to implement a 1 for 15\nreverse split of its common stock. The effect of the reverse stock split was to combine every 15 shares of outstanding common stock into one share of common stock. The\nreverse stock split was effective at the opening of the trading day on October 11, 2023.\nThe effects of the reverse stock split have been reflected in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for all periods presented.\n2023 2022\nHigh Low High Low\nFirst Quarter $ 7.38 $ 4.80 $ 20.70 $ 10.50\nSecond Quarter $ 9.90 $ 3.18 $ 16.95 $ 9.75\nThird Quarter $ 5.70 $ 2.72 $ 12.92 $ 9.03\nFourth Quarter $ 3.23 $ 1.65 $ 10.95 $ 5.70\nHolders of Record\nAs of September 23, 2024, there were 1,599,367 outstanding shares of common stock held by 433 stockholders of record.\nDividends\nWe have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our shares of common stock, and we do not expect to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future. We anticipate\nthat we will retain any earnings to support operations and to finance the growth and development of our business. Any future determination relating to our dividend policy will\nbe made at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on a number of factors, including future earnings, capital requirements, financial conditions and future\nprospects and other factors the Board of Directors may deem relevant. Furthermore, our ability to pay dividends is limited by the Delaware General Corporation Law, which\nprovides that a corporation may pay dividends only out of existing “surplus,” which is defined as the amount by which a corporation’s net assets exceeds its stated capital.\nItem 6. [Reserved]\n22\nItem 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThis Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations includes a number of forward-looking statements that reflect\nManagement’s current views with respect to future events and financial performance. You can identify these statements by forward-looking words such as “may” “will,”\n“expect,” “anticipate,” “believe,” “estimate” and “continue,” or similar words. Those statements include statements regarding the intent, belief or current expectations of us\nand members of our management team as well as the assumptions on which such statements are based. Prospective investors are cautioned that any such forward-looking\nstatements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risk and uncertainties, and that actual results may differ materially from those contemplated by such forward-\nlooking statements.\nReaders are urged to carefully review and consider the various disclosures made by us in this report and in our other reports filed with the Securities and Exchange\nCommission. Important factors known to us could cause actual results to differ materially from those in forward-looking statements. We undertake no obligation to update or\nrevise forward-looking statements to reflect changed assumptions, the occurrence of unanticipated events or changes in the future operating results over time. We believe that\nits assumptions are based upon reasonable data derived from and known about our business and operations and the business and operations of our company. No assurances\nare made that actual results of operations or the results of our future activities will not differ materially from its assumptions. Factors that could cause differences include, but\nare not limited to, expected market demand for our services, fluctuations in pricing for materials, and competition.\nOur Business\nSCWorx is a provider of data content and services related to the repair, normalization and interoperability of information for healthcare providers and big data analytics\nfor the healthcare industry.\nSCWorx has developed and markets health information technology solutions and associated services that improve healthcare processes and information flow within\nhospitals. SCWorx’s software platform enables healthcare providers to simplify, repair, and organize its data (“data normalization”), allows the data to be utilized across\nmultiple internal software applications (“interoperability”) and provides the basis for sophisticated data analytics (“big data”). SCWorx’s solutions are designed to improve the\nflow of information quickly and accurately between the existing supply chain, electronic medical records, clinical systems, and patient billing functions. The software is\ndesigned to achieve multiple operational benefits such as supply chain cost reductions, decreased accounts receivables aging, accelerated and more accurate billing, contract\noptimization, increased supply chain management and cost visibility, synchronous Charge Description Master (“CDM”) and control of vendor rebates and contract\nadministration fees.\nSCWorx empowers healthcare providers to maintain comprehensive access and visibility to an advanced business intelligence that enables better decision-making and\nreductions in product costs and utilization, ultimately leading to accelerated and accurate patient billing. SCWorx’s software modules perform separate functions as follows:\n● virtualized Item Master File repair, expansion and automation;\n● CDM management;\n● contract management;\n● request for proposal automation;\n● rebate management;\n● big data analytics modeling; and\n● data integration and warehousing.\nSCWorx continues to provide transformational data-driven solutions to many healthcare providers in the United States. The Company’s clients are geographically\ndispersed throughout the country. The Company’s focus is to assist healthcare providers with issues that they have pertaining to data interoperability. SCWorx provides these\nsolutions through a combination of direct sales and relationships with strategic partners.\nSCWorx’s software solutions are delivered to its clients within a fixed term period, typically a three-to-five-year contracted term, where such software is hosted in\nSCWorx data centers (Amazon Web Service’s “AWS” or RackSpace) and accessed by such clients through a secure connection in a software as a service (“SaaS”) delivery\nmethod.\nSCWorx currently sells its solutions and services in the United States to hospitals and health systems through its direct sales force and its distribution and reseller\npartnerships.\n23\nWe currently host our solutions, serve our customers, and support our operations in the United States through an agreement with a third party hosting and infrastructure\nprovider, RackSpace. We incorporate standard IT security measures, including but not limited to; firewalls, disaster recovery, backup, etc. Our operations are dependent upon\nthe integrity, security and consistent operation of various information technology systems and data centers that process transactions, communication systems and various other\nsoftware applications used throughout our operations. Disruptions in these systems could have an adverse impact on our operations. We could encounter difficulties in\ndeveloping new systems or maintaining and upgrading existing systems. Such difficulties could lead to significant expenses or to losses due to disruption in our business\noperations.\nIn addition, our information technology systems are subject to the risk of infiltration or data theft. The techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or\ndegrade service, or sabotage information technology systems change frequently and may be difficult to detect or prevent over long periods of time. Moreover, the hardware,\nsoftware or applications we develop or procure from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture or other problems that could unexpectedly compromise the\nsecurity of our information systems. Unauthorized parties may also attempt to gain access to our systems or facilities through fraud or deception aimed at our employees,\ncontractors or temporary staff. In the event that the security of our information systems is compromised, confidential information could be misappropriated, and system\ndisruptions could occur. Any such misappropriation or disruption could cause significant harm to our reputation, lead to a loss of sales or profits or cause us to incur significant\ncosts to reimburse third parties for damages.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nManagement’s discussion and analysis of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements. These\nconsolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) in the United States which requires us to make\nestimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. By their nature,\nthese estimates and judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. We evaluate our estimates based on our historical experience and various other assumptions that\nare believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. These estimates relate to revenue recognition, the assessment of recoverability of goodwill and intangible assets, the\nassessment of useful lives and the recoverability of property, plant and equipment, the valuation and recognition of stock-based compensation expense, recognition and\nmeasurement of deferred income tax assets and liabilities, the assessment of unrecognized tax benefits, and others. Actual results could differ from those estimates, and material\neffects on our consolidated operating results and consolidated financial position may result. Refer to Note 3, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, in the accompanying\nconsolidated financial statements, for a full description of our accounting policies.\nBasis of Presentation\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America\n(“U.S. GAAP”) and the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the\naccounts of SCWorx and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All material intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All material intercompany balances and\ntransactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nCash\nCash is maintained with various financial institutions. Financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash\ndeposits. Accounts at each institution are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation up to $250,000.\n24\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nManagement applies fair value accounting for significant financial assets and liabilities and non-financial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair\nvalue in the consolidated financial statements. Management defines fair value as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly\ntransaction between market participants at the measurement date. When determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities, which are required to be recorded at\nfair value, management considers the principal or most advantageous market in which we would transact and the market-based risk measurements or assumptions that market\nparticipants would use in pricing the asset or liability, such as risks inherent in valuation techniques, transfer restrictions and credit risk. Fair value is estimated by applying the\nfollowing hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value into three levels and bases the categorization within the hierarchy upon the lowest level of input that\nis available and significant to the fair value measurement: Level 1 - Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 - Observable inputs other than\nquoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets, or other inputs that are observable\nor can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. Level 3 - Inputs that are generally unobservable and typically reflect\nmanagement’s estimate of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.\nConcentration of Credit and Other Risks\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject our company to significant concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash, accounts receivable and warrants. We\nbelieve that any concentration of credit risk in its accounts receivable is substantially mitigated by our evaluation process, relatively short collection terms and the high level of\ncredit worthiness of its customers. We perform ongoing internal credit evaluations of its customers’ financial condition, obtain deposits and limit the amount of credit extended\nwhen deemed necessary but generally require no collateral.\nSignificant customers are those which represent more than 10% of the Company’s revenue for each period presented, or the Company’s accounts receivable balance as\nof each respective balance sheet date. For each significant customer, revenue as a percentage of total revenue and accounts receivable as a percentage of total net accounts\nreceivable are as follows:\nRevenue\nFor the years ended Accounts Receivable\nDecember 31, December 31,\nCustomers 2023 2022 2023 2022\nCustomer A 12% 12% 7% 12%\nCustomer B 11% 10% 22% 10%\nCustomer C 15% 14% 12% 15%\nCustomer D 12% 12% 7% 6%\nCustomer E 1% -% 15% -%\nCustomer F 5% 5% -% 30%\nAllowance for Credit Losses\nAccounts receivable are comprised of amounts billed and currently due from customers. Accounts receivable are amounts related to any unconditional right the\nCompany has for receiving consideration and are presented as accounts receivable in the consolidated balance sheets. The Company maintains an allowance for credit losses for\nestimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. The Company employs an expected credit loss model utilizing historical loss rates\nand historical trends in credit quality indicators (e.g., delinquency, risk ratings), adjusted to reflect current economic conditions and knowledge or customer relationships.\nManagement considers the following factors when determining the collectability of specific customer accounts: customer creditworthiness, past transaction history\nwith the customer, current industry trends, changes in customer payment terms, and specific customer situations. The Company’s normal collection cycle ranges between thirty\nand 60 days. Estimated uncollectible amounts are charged to earnings and a credit to a valuation allowance. Balances which remain outstanding after reasonable collection\nefforts are written off through a charge to the valuation allowance and a credit to accounts receivable The Company has assessed all receivables are collectable and did not\nrecord an allowance for credit losses as of December 31, 2023 and 2022.\n25\nLeases\nWe determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception. The current portion of lease obligations are included in accounts payable and accrued liabilities on the\nconsolidated balance sheets. Right-of-use (“ROU”) assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term, and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make\nlease payments arising from the lease. Operating lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the\nlease term. As most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate, we use our incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date in\ndetermining the present value of lease payments. Our lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease, which are included in the lease ROU asset when it is\nreasonably certain that we will exercise that option. Lease expense for lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. We have lease agreements with\nlease components only, none with non-lease components, which are generally accounted for separately.\nGoodwill and Identified Intangible Assets\nGoodwill\nGoodwill is recorded as the difference between the aggregate consideration paid for an acquisition and the fair value of the net tangible and identified intangible assets\nacquired under a business combination. Goodwill also includes acquired assembled workforce, which does not qualify as an identifiable intangible asset. Management reviews\nimpairment of goodwill annually in the fourth quarter, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that the goodwill might be impaired. We first assess qualitative\nfactors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test. If, after assessing the totality of events or circumstances, we determine that it\nis not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then the quantitative goodwill impairment test is unnecessary.\nFor further discussion of goodwill, refer to Note 5, Goodwill.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe recognize revenue in accordance with Topic 606 to depict the transfer of promised goods or services in an amount that reflects the consideration to which an entity\nexpects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. To determine revenue recognition for arrangements within the scope of Topic 606 we perform the following\nsteps:\n● Step 1: Identify the contract(s) with a customer\n● Step 2: Identify the performance obligations in the contract\n● Step 3: Determine the transaction price\n● Step 4: Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract\n● Step 5: Recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation\n26\nWe follow the accounting revenue guidance under Topic 606 to determine whether contracts contain more than one performance obligation. Performance obligations\nare the unit of accounting for revenue recognition and generally represent the distinct goods or services that are promised to the customer.\nManagement has identified the following performance obligations in our contracts with customers:\n1. Data Normalization: which includes data preparation, product and vendor mapping, product categorization, data enrichment and other data related services,\n2. Software-as-a-service (“SaaS”): which is generated from clients’ access of and usage of our hosted software solutions on a subscription basis for a specified\ncontract term, which is usually annually. In SaaS arrangements, the client cannot take possession of the software during the term of the contract and generally has\nthe right to access and use the software and receive any software upgrades published during the subscription period,\n3. Maintenance: which includes ongoing data cleansing and normalization, content enrichment, and optimization, and\n4. Professional Services: mainly related to specific customer projects to manage and/or analyze data and review for cost reduction opportunities.\nA contract will typically include Data Normalization, SaaS and Maintenance, which are distinct performance obligations and are accounted for separately. The\ntransaction price is allocated to each separate performance obligation on a relative stand-alone selling price basis. Significant judgement is required to determine the stand-alone\nselling price for each distinct performance obligation and is typically estimated based on observable transactions when these services are sold on a stand-alone basis. At contract\ninception, an assessment of the goods and services promised in the contracts with customers is performed and a performance obligation is identified for each distinct promise to\ntransfer to the customer a good or service (or bundle of goods or services). To identify the performance obligations, management considers all the goods or services promised in\nthe contract regardless of whether they are explicitly stated or are implied by customary business practices. Revenue is recognized when the performance obligation has been\nmet. We consider control to have transferred upon delivery because we have a present right to payment at that time, we have transferred use of the good or service, and the\ncustomer is able to direct the use of, and obtain substantially all the remaining benefits from, the good or service.\nOur SaaS and Maintenance contracts typically have termination for convenience without penalty clauses and accordingly, are generally accounted for as month-to-\nmonth agreements. If it is determined that we have not satisfied a performance obligation, revenue recognition will be deferred until the performance obligation is deemed to be\nsatisfied.\nRevenue recognition for our performance obligations are as follows:\nData Normalization and Professional Services\nOur Data Normalization and Professional Services are typically fixed fee. When these services are not combined with SaaS or Maintenance revenues as a single unit of\naccounting, these revenues are recognized as the services are rendered and when contractual milestones are achieved and accepted by the customer.\n27\nSaaS and Maintenance\nSaaS and Maintenance revenues are recognized ratably over the contract terms beginning on the commencement date of each contract, which is the date on which our\nservice is made available to customers.\nSome contracts have payment terms that differ from the timing of revenue recognition, which requires us to assess whether the transaction price for those contracts\ninclude a significant financing component. We have elected the practical expedient that permits an entity to not adjust for the effects of a significant financing component if it\nexpects that at the contract inception, the period between when the entity transfers a promised good or service to a customer and when the customer pays for that good or\nservice will be one year or less. We do not maintain contracts in which the period between when the entity transfers a promised good or service to a customer and when the\ncustomer pays for that good or service exceeds the one-year threshold.\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had $378,583 of remaining performance obligations recorded as deferred revenue. We expect to recognize sales relating to these existing\nperformance obligations of during 2024.\nCosts to Fulfill a Contract\nCosts to fulfill a contract typically include costs related to satisfying performance obligations as well as general and administrative costs that are not explicitly\nchargeable to customer contracts. These expenses are recognized and expensed when incurred in accordance with Accounting Standard Codification (“ASC”) 340-40.\nCost of Revenue\nCost of revenues primarily represent data center hosting costs, consulting services and maintenance of our large data array that were incurred in delivering professional\nservices and maintenance of our large data array during the periods presented.\nContract Balances\nContract assets arise when the revenue associated prior to our unconditional right to receive a payment under a contract with a customer (i.e., unbilled revenue) and are\nderecognized when either it becomes a receivable or the cash is received. There were no contract assets as of December 31, 2023 and 2022.\nContract liabilities arise when customers remit contractual cash payments in advance of our company satisfying our performance obligations under the contract and are\nderecognized when the revenue associated with the contract is recognized when the performance obligation is satisfied. Deferred revenue for contract liabilities were $378,583\nand $579,833 as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nIncome Taxes\nOur company converted to a corporation from a limited liability company during 2018.\nWe use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes in accordance with ASC Topic 740, “Income Taxes.” Under this method, income tax expense is\nrecognized for the amount of: (i) taxes payable or refundable for the current year and (ii) deferred tax consequences of temporary differences resulting from matters that have\nbeen recognized in an entity’s financial statements or tax returns. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in\nthe years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in\nthe results of operations in the period that includes the enactment date.\nValuation allowances are provided if, based upon the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be\nrealized. During the year ended December 31, 2023, we evaluated available evidence and concluded that we may not realize all the benefits of our deferred tax assets; therefore,\na valuation allowance was established for our deferred tax assets.\n28\nASC Topic 740-10-30 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise’s financial statements and prescribes a recognition threshold\nand measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. ASC Topic 740-10-40\nprovides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure, and transition. We have no material uncertain tax positions\nfor any of the reporting periods presented.\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, (the “Tax Act”) was enacted. The Tax Act significantly revised the U.S. corporate income tax regime by,\nincluding but not limited to, lowering the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 34% to 21% effective January 1, 2018, implementing a territorial tax system, imposing a one-\ntime transition tax on previously untaxed accumulated earnings and profits of foreign subsidiaries, and creating new taxes on foreign sourced earnings. During the years ended\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022, we completed the accounting for tax effects of the Tax Act under ASC 740. There were no impacts to the years ended December 31, 2023 and\n2022.\nStock-based Compensation Expense\nThe Company accounts for stock-based compensation expense in accordance with the authoritative guidance on share-based payments. Under the provisions of the\nguidance, stock-based compensation expense is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the option or warrant using a Black-Scholes option pricing model and is\nrecognized as expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period.\nThe authoritative guidance also requires that the Company measure and recognize stock-based compensation expense upon modification of the term of stock award.\nThe stock-based compensation expense for such modification is accounted for as a repurchase of the original award and the issuance of a new award.\nCalculating stock-based compensation expense requires the input of highly subjective assumptions, including the expected term of the stock-based awards, stock price\nvolatility, and the pre-vesting option forfeiture rate. The Company estimates the expected life of options granted based on historical exercise patterns, which are believed to be\nrepresentative of future behavior. The Company estimates the volatility of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant based on historical volatility. The assumptions\nused in calculating the fair value of stock-based awards represent the Company’s best estimates, but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of\nmanagement’s judgment. As a result, if factors change and the Company uses different assumptions, its stock-based compensation expense could be materially different in the\nfuture. In addition, the Company is required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and only recognize expense for those shares expected to vest. The Company estimates the\nforfeiture rate based on historical experience of its stock-based awards that are granted, exercised and cancelled. If the actual forfeiture rate is materially different from the\nestimate, stock-based compensation expense could be significantly different from what was recorded in the current period. The Company also grants performance based\nrestricted stock awards to employees and consultants. These awards will vest if certain employee\\consultant-specific or company-designated performance targets are achieved.\nIf minimum performance thresholds are achieved, each award will convert into a designated number of the Company’s common stock. If minimum performance thresholds are\nnot achieved, then no shares will be issued. Based upon the expected levels of achievement, stock-based compensation is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite\nservice period. The expected levels of achievement are reassessed over the requisite service periods and, to the extent that the expected levels of achievement change, stock-\nbased compensation is adjusted in the period of change and recorded on the statements of operations and the remaining unrecognized stock-based compensation is recorded\nover the remaining requisite service period. Refer to Note 9, Stockholders’ Equity, for additional detail.\nLoss Per Share\nWe compute earnings (loss) per share in accordance with ASC 260, “Earnings per Share” which requires presentation of both basic and diluted earnings (loss) per\nshare (“EPS”) on the face of the income statement. Basic EPS is computed by dividing the loss available to common shareholders (numerator) by the weighted average number\nof shares outstanding (denominator) during the period. Diluted EPS gives effect to all dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period using the treasury stock\nmethod and convertible preferred stock using the if-converted method. In computing diluted EPS, the average stock price for the period is used in determining the number of\nshares assumed to be purchased from the exercise of stock options and warrants and the exercise of fully vested restricted stock units. Diluted EPS excludes all dilutive\npotential shares if their effect is anti-dilutive. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, we had 273,059 and 180,390, respectively, common stock equivalents outstanding.\n29\nIndemnification\nWe provide indemnification of varying scope to certain customers against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our\nsoftware. In accordance with authoritative guidance for accounting for guarantees, we evaluate estimated losses for such indemnification. We consider such factors as the\ndegree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. To date, no such claims have been filed against our\ncompany and no liability has been recorded in our financial statements.\nAs permitted under Delaware law, we have agreements whereby we indemnify our officers and directors for certain events or occurrences while the officer or director\nis, or was, serving at our company’s request in such capacity. The maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification\nagreements is unlimited. In addition, we have directors’ and officers’ liability insurance coverage that is intended to reduce our financial exposure and may enable us to recover\nany payments above the applicable policy retention.\nIn connection with the Class Action claims and investigations described in Item 3. Legal Proceedings of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the Company is obligated\nto indemnify its officers and directors for costs incurred in defending against these claims and investigations.\nContingencies\nFrom time to time, we may be involved in legal and administrative proceedings and claims of various types. We record a liability in our consolidated financial\nstatements for these matters when a loss is known or considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Management reviews these estimates in each accounting\nperiod as additional information becomes known and adjusts the loss provision when appropriate. If the loss is not probable or cannot be reasonably estimated, a liability is not\nrecorded in the consolidated financial statements. If a loss is probable but the amount of loss cannot be reasonably estimated, we disclose the loss contingency and an estimate\nof possible loss or range of loss (unless such an estimate cannot be made). We do not recognize gain contingencies until they are realized. Legal costs incurred in connection\nwith loss contingencies are expensed as incurred. Refer to Note 8, Commitments and Contingencies, for further information.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts\nreported and disclosed in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. The Company regularly evaluates estimates and assumptions related to allowance for\ncredit losses, the estimated useful lives and recoverability of long-lived assets, equity component of convertible debt, stock-based compensation, and deferred income tax asset\nvaluation allowances. The Company bases its estimates and assumptions on current facts, historical experience and various other factors that it believes to be reasonable under\nthe circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the accrual of costs and expenses that are not\nreadily apparent from other sources. The actual results experienced by the Company may differ materially and adversely from the Company’s estimates. To the extent there are\nmaterial differences between the estimates and the actual results, future results of operations will be affected.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nFrom time to time, new accounting pronouncements are issued by FASB that are adopted by the Company as of the specified effective date. If not discussed,\nmanagement believes that the impact of recently issued standards, which are not yet effective, will not have a material impact on the Company’s financial statements upon\nadoption.\n30\nResults of Operations\nThe COVID-19 Pandemic has disrupted our business and the business of our hospital customers.\nOur operations and business have experienced disruption due to the unprecedented conditions surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic which spread throughout the\nUnited States and the world. The Company has followed the recommendations of local health authorities to minimize exposure risk for its team members since the outbreak.\nIn addition, the Company’s customers (hospitals) also experienced extraordinary disruptions to their businesses and supply chains, while experiencing unprecedented\ndemand for health care services related to COVID-19. As a result of these extraordinary disruptions to the Company’s customers’ business, the Company’s customers were\nfocused on meeting the nation’s health care needs in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, the Company believes that its customers were not able to focus resources\non expanding the utilization of the Company’s services, which has adversely impacted the Company’s growth prospects, at least until the adverse effects of the pandemic\nsubside. In addition, the financial impact of COVID-19 on the Company’s hospital customers could cause the hospitals to delay payments due to the Company for services,\nwhich could negatively impact the Company’s cash flows.\nYear Ended December 31, 2023 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2022\nThe following summary of our results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2023\nand 2022.\nOur operating results for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 are summarized as follows:\nYears ended\nDecember 31, December 31,\n2023 2022 Difference\nRevenue $ 3,804,943 $ 4,038,188 $ (233,245)\nCost of revenues 2,535,865 2,624,553 (88,688)\nGeneral and administrative 2,719,740 3,537,077 (817,337)\nOther income (expense) (2,530,482) 276,036 (2,806,518)\nProvision for income taxes - - -\nNet loss $ (3,981,144) $ (1,847,406) $ (2,133,738)\nRevenues\nRevenue for the year ended December 31, 2023 was $3,804,943, compared to $4,038,188 in revenue for the year ended December 31, 2022. The decline in revenue is\nprimarily related to a slight decrease in overall revenues from SaaS customer sales during the period due to fluctuations in our customer base.\nCost of Revenues\nCost of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2023 was $2,535,865, compared to $2,624,553 for the year ended December 31, 2022. The $88,688 decrease is\nprimarily related to a decrease in labor costs during the current year.\nExpenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses decreased $817,337 to $2,719,740 for the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared to $3,537,077 in the same period of 2022.\nThis decrease was primarily due decreases in non-cash stock compensation expense of approximately $780,000, legal and professional fees of approximately $87,000,\ninventory write-downs of approximately $157,000 and bad debt expense of approximately $30,000, partially offset by to an increase in accruals for legal settlement of\napproximately $462,000. We expect general and administrative expenses (excluding non-cash compensation expenses) to remain relatively flat during 2024 with the exception\nof increases in our sales force.\nWe had other losses of $2,530,482 During the year ended December 31, 2023 consisting of write-down of goodwill of $2,524,034 and interest expense of $6,448.\nWe had other income of $276,036 during the year ended December 31, 2022 related primarily to the forgiveness of PPP loans.\n31\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nGoing Concern\nManagement has concluded on our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023 that conditions exist that raise substantial doubt about our\nability to continue as a going concern since we may not have sufficient capital resources from operations and existing financing arrangements to meet our operating expenses\nand working capital requirements. As of December 31, 2023, we had a working capital deficit of $1,898,625 and accumulated deficit of $29,839,841. During the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023, we had a net loss of $3,981,144 and used $806,164 of cash in operations. We have historically incurred operating losses and may continue to incur\noperating losses for the foreseeable future. We believe that these conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. This may hinder our future\nability to obtain financing or may force us to obtain financing on less favorable terms than would otherwise be available. If we are unable to develop sufficient revenues and\nadditional customers for our products and services, we may not generate enough revenue to sustain our business, and we may fail, in which case our stockholders would suffer a\ntotal loss of their investment. There can be no assurance that we will be able to continue as a going concern.\nRecent Fundraising\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company issued an aggregate 134,056 shares of common stock for aggregate gross proceeds of $572,906 as under its\nexisting equity line of credit.\nLiquidity\nWe are currently experiencing a working capital deficiency, have limited cash on hand, and we are experiencing negative cash flows from operations. Consequently,\nwe have an immediate need for additional capital to fund our operations and the implementation of our business plan.\nBased on our current business plan, if we had sufficient capital resources, we anticipate that our operating activities would use a net of approximately $70,000 in cash\nper month over the next twelve months, or approximately $800,000. Currently we have only limited cash on hand, and consequently, we are unable to implement our current\nbusiness plan. Accordingly, we have an immediate need for additional capital to fund our operating activities.\nIn order to remedy this liquidity deficiency, we have cut spending and are actively seeking to raise additional funds through the sale of equity and debt securities.\nUltimately, we will need to generate substantial positive operating cash flows. Our internal sources of funds will consist of cash flows from operations, but not until we begin to\nrealize substantial additional revenues from the sale of our products and services. As previously stated, our operations are generating negative cash flows, and thus adversely\naffecting our liquidity. If we are able to secure sufficient funding in the first half of 2024 to fully implement our business plan, we expect that our operations could begin to\ngenerate positive cash flows by the end of 2024, which should ameliorate our liquidity deficiency. If we are unable to raise additional funds in the near term, we will not be able\nto fully implement our business plan, in which case there could be a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nIn the event we do not generate sufficient funds from revenues or financing through the issuance of common stock or from debt financing, we will be unable to fully\nimplement our business plan and pay our obligations as they become due, any of which circumstances would have a material adverse effect on our business prospects, financial\ncondition, and results of operations. The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be required should the Company be unable to recover the\nvalue of its assets or satisfy its liabilities (see Note 2 to the Financial Statements – Liquidity and Going Concern).\nBased on our current limited availability of funds, we expect to spend minimal amounts on expansion of our sales organization, software development and capital\nexpenditures. We expect to fund any future software development expenditures through a combination of cash flows from operations and proceeds from equity and/or debt\nfinancing. If we are unable to generate positive cash flows from operations, and/or raise additional funds (either through debt or equity), we will be unable to fund our software\ndevelopment expenditures, in which case, there could be an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\n32\nCash Flows\nYears ended\nDecember 31,\n2023 2022\nNet cash used in operating activities $ (806,164) $ (540,036)\nNet cash provided by investing activities 165,000 -\nNet cash provided by financing activities 483,138 718,423\nChange in cash $ (158,026) $ 178,387\nOur operations through December 31, 2023 have resulted in negative cash flows from operations of $806,164. If we are able to raise additional capital during first half\nof 2024 and generate additional revenue through the acquisition of new customers, we believe we may begin to generate positive operating cash flows by the end of 2024.\nHowever, there is no assurance we will be able to increase our revenue sufficiently so as to generate positive operating cash flows within this time frame.\nOperating Activities\nNet cash used in operating activities was $806,164 for the year ended December 31, 2023, mainly related to the net loss of $3,981,144, a decrease in deferred revenue\nobligations of $201,250 and an increase in net accounts receivable of $16,780, partially offset by non-cash stock-based compensation of $361,363 related to various equity\nawards to employees and non-employees, $48,000 in bad debt expense, a $25,647 decrease in prepaid expenses and an increase of $433,966 in accounts payable and accrued\nliabilities.\nNet cash used in operating activities was $540,036 for the year ended December 31, 2022, mainly related to the net loss of $1,847,406 and a gain on forgiveness of\nPPP Loans of $279,191, partially offset by non-cash stock-based compensation of $1,141,932 related to various equity awards to employees and non-employees, $78,125 in bad\ndebt expense, and a $156,600 decrease in inventory valuation.\nInvesting Activities\nThe Company received $165,000 in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2023 related to a potential reverse acquisition. Under the terms of the\nagreement, all funds received by the Company were contributed upon the termination of the acquisition agreement.\nThe Company did not have any investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2022.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $483,138 for the year ended December 31, 2023. This consisted of $572,906 in proceeds from a common stock\nplacement and $193,558 in proceeds from advances, partially offset by repayments of $193,558 in proceeds from advances, $57,390 in repayments on notes payable and\n$32,378 in payments on shareholder advance.\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $718,423 for the year ended December 31, 2022. This consisted of proceeds of $725,050 from a common stock\nplacement partially offset by loan repayments of $6,627.\nContractual Cash Obligations\nRefer to Note 8, Commitments and Contingencies, in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional detail.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2022, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K.\n33\nItem 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nWe are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information under this item.\nItem 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\nThe consolidated financial statements are included in Part IV, Item 15 (a) (1) of this Report.\nItem 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure\nOn May 3, 2024, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission”) entered an Order denying BF Borgers CPA PC (“BF Borgers”) the privilege of\nappearing or practicing before the Commission as an accountant. As a result, BF Borgers may not participate in or perform the audit or review of financial information included\nin Commission filings, issue audit reports included in Commission filings, provide consents with respect to audit reports, or otherwise appear or practice before the\nCommission. practicing before the SEC. As a result of the foregoing, On May 7, 2024, the board of directors of the Company terminated BF Borgers as the Registrant’s\nindependent registered public accounting firm. BF Borgers had audited the Company’s financial statements since 2021.\nBF Borger’s report on the Company’s financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022 did not contain an adverse opinion or disclaimer of opinion,\nnor was such report qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope or accounting principle, except for an explanatory paragraph relating to a substantial doubt regarding the\nCompany’s ability to continue as a going concern. During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, and through May 7, 2024, there were no disagreements with BF Borgers on\nany matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope or procedure which, if not resolved to BF Borgers’s satisfaction, would have\ncaused BF Borgers to make reference to the subject matter of the disagreement in connection with its report.\nDuring the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, and through May 7, 2024, there were no “reportable events” as defined under Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K,\nexcept for material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting.\nOn May 16, 2024, the Company appointed Astra Audit and Advisory, LLC (“Astra”) as its new independent registered public accounting firm, effective immediately,\nfor the fiscal years ending December 31, 2023, and 2022. This appointment was authorized and approved by the Audit Committee of the Company’s Board of Directors.\nItem 9A. Controls and Procedures\nManagement’s Conclusions Regarding Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nManagement conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our “disclosure controls and procedures” (“Disclosure Controls”), as defined by Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-\n15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), as of December 31, 2023, the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K,\nas required by Rules 13a-15(b) and 15d-15(b) of the Exchange Act. The Disclosure Controls evaluation was done under the supervision and with the participation of\nmanagement, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, based on the 2013 framework and criteria established by the Committee of Sponsoring\nOrganizations of the Treadway Commission. There are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any system of disclosure controls and procedures. Accordingly, even effective\ndisclosure controls and procedures can only provide reasonable assurance of achieving their control objectives. Based upon this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and\nChief Financial Officer concluded that, due to deficiencies caused by a lack of segregation of duties, our Disclosure Controls were not effective as of December 31, 2023, such\nthat the information required to be disclosed by us in reports filed under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified\nin the SEC’s rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons\nperforming similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding disclosure.\nManagement Report on Internal Controls over Financial Reporting\nOur management has identified material weaknesses in our internal controls related to a lack of segregation of duties. Management continues to work with the Audit\nCommittee to discuss remediation efforts. Our management is currently considering looking for additional accounting and finance personnel to assist in the remediation efforts.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, have concluded that the consolidated financial\nstatements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K present fairly, in all material respects, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the periods\npresented in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.\nWe may in the future identify other material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in connection with our internal control over financial reporting. Material\nweaknesses and significant deficiencies that may be identified in the future will need to be addressed as part of our quarterly and annual evaluations of our internal controls\nover financial reporting under Sections 302 and 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Any future disclosures of a material weakness, or errors as a result of a material weakness,\ncould result in a negative reaction in the financial markets and a decrease in the price of our common stock.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting.\nNone\nItem 9B. Other Information\nNone.\nItem 9C. Disclosure Regarding Foreign Jurisdictions that Prevent Inspections.\nNot applicable.\n34\nPART III\nItem 10.

In addition, the Nasdaq Rules require that, subject to specified exceptions, each member of a listed company’s audit, compensation and nominating\nand governance committees be independent. Under the Nasdaq Rules, a director will qualify as an independent director only if, in the opinion of our Board of Directors, that\nperson does not have a relationship that would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director. The Nasdaq Rules also\nrequire that audit committee members satisfy independence criteria set forth in Rule 10A-3 under the Exchange Act, as amended. In order to be considered independent for\npurposes of Rule 10A-3, a member of an audit committee of a listed company may not, other than in his or her capacity as a member of the audit committee, the board of\ndirectors, or any other board committee, accept, directly or indirectly, any consulting, advisory, or other compensatory fee from the listed company or any of its subsidiaries or\notherwise be an affiliated person of the listed company or any of its subsidiaries. In considering the independence of compensation committee members, the Nasdaq Rules\nrequire that our Board of Directors must consider additional factors relevant to the duties of a compensation committee member, including the source of any compensation we\npay to the director and any affiliations with our company.\nOur Board of Directors undertook a review of the composition of our Board of Directors and its committees and the independence of each director. Based upon\ninformation requested from and provided by each director concerning his background, employment and affiliations, including family relationships, our Board of Directors has\ndetermined that each of our directors other than Tim Hannibal, is independent based on the definition of independence in the Nasdaq listing standards.\nItem 14.

(the Company) as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the related consolidated statements of\noperations, changes in stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period ended December 31, 2023, and the related notes (collectively referred to\nas the financial statements). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and\n2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period ended December 31, 2023, in conformity with accounting principles\ngenerally accepted in the United States of America.\nSubstantial Doubt about the Company’s ability to Continue as a Going Concern\nThe accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 2, the Company has incurred net\nlosses and working capital deficits. These factors, and the need for additional financing in order for the Company to meet its business plans raises substantial doubt about the\nCompany’s ability to continue as a going concern. Our opinion is not modified with respect to that matter.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our\naudits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with\nrespect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the\nPCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about\nwhether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an\naudit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the\npurpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures\nthat respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also\nincluded evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We\nbelieve that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nAstra Audit & Advisory, LLC\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2024.\nTampa, Florida\nSeptember 23, 2024\n3702 West Spruce Street #1430 i Tampa, Florida 33607 i +1.813.441.9707\nF-2\nSCWorx Corp.\nConsolidated Balance Sheets\nDecember 31, December 31,\n2023 2022\nASSETS\nCurrent assets:\nCash $ 91,436 $ 249,462\nAccounts receivable 304,813 336,033\nPrepaid expenses and other assets 39,533 295,180\nTotal current assets 435,782 880,675\nGoodwill 5,842,433 8,366,467\nTotal assets $ 6,278,215 $ 9,247,142\nLIABILITIES AND STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY\nCurrent liabilities:\nAccounts payable and accrued liabilities $ 1,613,364 $ 1,364,202\nAccounts payable and accrued liabilities -

Description of Business\nNature of Business\nSCWorx, LLC (n/k/a SCW FL Corp.) (“SCW LLC”) was a privately held limited liability company which was organized in Florida on November 17, 2016. On\nDecember 31, 2017, SCW LLC acquired Primrose Solutions, LLC (“Primrose”), a Delaware limited liability company, which became its wholly-owned subsidiary and focused\non developing functionality for the software now used and sold by SCWorx Corp. (the “Company” or “SCWorx”). The majority interest holders of Primrose were interest\nholders of SCW LLC and based upon Staff Accounting Bulletin Topic 5G, the technology acquired has been accounted for at predecessor cost of $0. To facilitate the planned\nacquisition by Alliance MMA, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Alliance”), on June 27, 2018, SCW LLC merged with and into a newly-formed entity, SCWorx Acquisition Corp.,\na Delaware corporation (“SCW Acquisition”), with SCW Acquisition being the surviving entity. Subsequently, on August 17, 2018, SCW Acquisition changed its name to\nSCWorx Corp. On November 30, 2018, the Company and certain of its stockholders agreed to cancel 6,510 shares of common stock. In June 2018, the Company began to\ncollect subscriptions for common stock. From June to November 2018, the Company collected $1,250,000 in subscriptions and issued 3,125 shares of common stock to new\nthird-party investors. In addition, on February 1, 2019, (i) SCWorx Corp. (f/k/a SCWorx Acquisition Corp.) changed its name to SCW FL Corp. (to allow Alliance to change its\nname to SCWorx Corp.) and (ii) Alliance acquired SCWorx Corp. (n/k/a SCW FL Corp.) in a stock-for-stock exchange transaction and changed Alliance’s name to SCWorx\nCorp., which is the Company’s current name, with SCW FL Corp. becoming the Company’s subsidiary. On March 16, 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, SCWorx\nestablished a wholly-owned subsidiary, Direct-Worx, LLC to endeavor to source and provide critical, difficult-to-find items for the healthcare industry which it has since\nceased.\nOn October 6, 2023, following stockholder approval at the Company’s annual meeting, the Company amended its certificate of incorporation to implement a 1 for 15\nreverse split of its common stock. The effect of the reverse stock split was to combine every 15 shares of outstanding common stock into one share of common stock. The\nreverse stock split was effective at the opening of the trading day on October 11, 2023.\nThe effects of the reverse stock split have been reflected in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for all periods presented.\nOn October 16, 2023, the Company entered into a letter of intent to merge with American Energy Partners, Inc. (“American Environmental”) and subsequently entered\ninto a definitive agreement and plan of merger (the “Merger Agreement”) on December 22, 2023. The Merger Agreement was mutually terminate on March 26, 2024. During\nthe year ended December 31, 2023, American Environmental contributed an aggregate $165,000 to the Company to assist in covering its operating expenses.\nOperations of the Business\nSCWorx is a provider of data content and services related to the repair, normalization and interoperability of information for healthcare providers and big data analytics\nfor the healthcare industry.\nSCWorx has developed and markets health information technology solutions and associated services that improve healthcare processes and information flow within\nhospitals.

The software is\ndesigned to achieve multiple operational benefits such as supply chain cost reductions, decreased accounts receivables aging, accelerated and more accurate billing, contract\noptimization, increased supply chain management and cost visibility, synchronous Charge Description Master (“CDM”) and control of vendor rebates and contract\nadministration fees.\nSCWorx empowers healthcare providers to maintain comprehensive access and visibility to an advanced business intelligence that enables better decision-making and\nreductions in product costs and utilization, ultimately leading to accelerated and accurate patient billing. SCWorx’s software modules perform separate functions as follows:\n● virtualized Item Master File repair, expansion and automation;\n● CDM management;\n● contract management;\n● request for proposal automation;\n● rebate management;\n● big data analytics modeling; and\n● data integration and warehousing.\nF-7\nSCWorx continues to provide transformational data-driven solutions to some of the finest, most well-respected healthcare providers in the United States.

The outbreak adversely impacted new customer acquisition. The Company has followed the recommendations of local health\nauthorities to minimize exposure risk for its team members since the outbreak.\nIn addition, the Company’s customers (hospitals) also experienced extraordinary disruptions to their businesses and supply chains, while experiencing unprecedented\ndemand for health care services related to COVID-19. As a result of these extraordinary disruptions to the Company’s customers’ business, the Company’s customers were\nfocused on meeting the nation’s health care needs in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, the Company believes that its customers were not able to focus resources\non expanding the utilization of the Company’s services, which has adversely impacted the Company’s growth prospects, at least until the adverse effects of the pandemic\nsubside. In addition, the financial impact of COVID-19 on the Company’s hospital customers could cause the hospitals to delay payments due to the Company for services,\nwhich could negatively impact the Company’s cash flows.\nNote 2 – Liquidity and Going Concern\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”), which\ncontemplates continuation of the Company as a going concern and the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The consolidated\nfinancial statements do not include any adjustment that might become necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.\nThe Company has suffered recurring losses from operations and incurred a net loss of $3,981,144 for the year ended December 31, 2023 and $1,847,406 for the year\nended December 31, 2022. The accumulated deficit as of December 31, 2023 was $29,839,841. The Company has not yet achieved profitability and expects to continue to incur\ncash outflows from operations. It is expected that its operating losses will continue and, as a result, the Company will eventually need to generate significant increases in\nproduct revenues to achieve profitability. These conditions indicate that there is substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern within one year\nafter the financial statement issuance date.\nAs of the filing date of this Report, the Company has only limited cash on hand, and management believes that there may not be sufficient capital resources from\noperations and existing financing arrangements in order to meet operating expenses and working capital requirements for the next twelve months.\nAccordingly, we are evaluating various alternatives, including reducing operating expenses, securing additional financing through debt or equity securities to fund\nfuture business activities and other strategic alternatives. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to generate the level of operating revenues in its business\nplan, or if additional sources of financing will be available on acceptable terms, if at all. If no additional sources of financing are available, our future operating prospects may\nbe adversely affected. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\nNote 3. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nBasis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and\nExchange Commission (“SEC”).\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of SCWorx and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All material intercompany balances and\ntransactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nF-8\nCash\nCash is maintained with various financial institutions. Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of\ncash deposits. Accounts at each institution are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) up to $250,000. The Company did not have any amounts in\nexcess of the FDIC insured limit for as of December 31, 2023 and 2022.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nManagement applies fair value accounting for significant financial assets and liabilities and non-financial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair\nvalue in the consolidated financial statements. Management defines fair value as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly\ntransaction between market participants at the measurement date. When determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities, which are required to be recorded at\nfair value, management considers the principal or most advantageous market in which we would transact and the market-based risk measurements or assumptions that market\nparticipants would use in pricing the asset or liability, such as risks inherent in valuation techniques, transfer restrictions and credit risk. Fair value is estimated by applying the\nfollowing hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value into three levels and bases the categorization within the hierarchy upon the lowest level of input that\nis available and significant to the fair value measurement: Level 1 - Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 - Observable inputs other than\nquoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets, or other inputs that are observable\nor can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. Level 3 - Inputs that are generally unobservable and typically reflect\nmanagement’s estimate of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.\nConcentration of Credit and Other Risks\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject the Company to significant concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash and accounts receivable. The\nCompany believes that any concentration of credit risk in its accounts receivable is substantially mitigated by the Company’s evaluation process, relatively short collection\nterms and the high level of credit worthiness of its customers. The Company performs ongoing internal credit evaluations of its customers’ financial condition, obtains deposits\nand limits the amount of credit extended when deemed necessary but generally requires no collateral.\nSignificant customers are those which represent more than 10% of the Company’s revenue for each period presented, or the Company’s accounts receivable balance as\nof each respective balance sheet date. For each significant customer, revenue as a percentage of total revenue and accounts receivable as a percentage of total net accounts\nreceivable are as follows:\nRevenue\nFor the years ended Accounts Receivable\nDecember 31, December 31,\nCustomers 2023 2022 2023 2022\nCustomer A 12% 12% 7% 12%\nCustomer B 11% 10% 22% 10%\nCustomer C 15% 14% 12% 15%\nCustomer D 12% 12% 7% 6%\nCustomer E 1% -% 15% -%\nCustomer F 5% 5% -% 30%\nAllowance for Credit Losses\nAccounts receivable are comprised of amounts billed and currently due from customers. Accounts receivable are amounts related to any unconditional right the\nCompany has for receiving consideration and are presented as accounts receivable in the consolidated balance sheets. The Company maintains an allowance for credit losses for\nestimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. The Company employs an expected credit loss model utilizing historical loss rates\nand historical trends in credit quality indicators (e.g., delinquency, risk ratings), adjusted to reflect current economic conditions and knowledge or customer relationships.\nManagement considers the following factors when determining the collectability of specific customer accounts: customer creditworthiness, past transaction history\nwith the customer, current industry trends, changes in customer payment terms, and specific customer situations. The Company’s normal collection cycle ranges between thirty\nand 60 days. Estimated uncollectible amounts are charged to earnings and a credit to a valuation allowance. Balances which remain outstanding after reasonable collection\nefforts are written off through a charge to the valuation allowance and a credit to accounts receivable The Company has assessed all receivables are collectable and did not\nrecord an allowance for credit losses as of December 31, 2023 and 2022.\nF-9\nInventory\nThe inventory balance at December 31, 2022 is related to the Company’s Direct-Worx, LLC subsidiary and consisted of approximately 87,000 gowns. These items are\ntracked based on average cost and carried on the consolidated balance sheet at the lower of cost or market.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company wrote off all remaining $156,000 in the value of this inventory as unsellable. During the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023, the Company disposed of all remaining inventory previously written off.\nLeases\nThe Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception. The current portion of lease obligations are included in accounts payable and accrued liabilities on\nthe consolidated balance sheets. Right-of-use (“ROU”) assets represent the Company’s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the\nCompany’s obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Operating lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present\nvalue of lease payments over the lease term. As most of the Company’s leases do not provide an implicit rate, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate based on the\ninformation available at commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. The Company’s lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the\nlease, which are included in the lease ROU asset when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise that option. Lease expense for lease payments is recognized on a\nstraight-line basis over the lease term. The Company has lease agreements with lease components only, none with non-lease components, which are generally accounted for\nseparately (refer to Note 7, Leases, for additional detail).\nGoodwill and Purchased Identified Intangible Assets\nGoodwill\nGoodwill is recorded as the difference, if any, between the aggregate consideration paid for an acquisition and the fair value of the net tangible and identified\nintangible assets acquired under a business combination. Goodwill also includes acquired assembled workforce, which does not qualify as an identifiable intangible asset. The\nCompany reviews impairment of goodwill annually in the fourth quarter, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that the goodwill might be impaired. The\nCompany first assesses qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test. If, after assessing the totality of events or\ncircumstances, the Company determines that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then the quantitative goodwill\nimpairment test is unnecessary.\nFor further discussion of goodwill, refer to Note 5, Goodwill.\nF-10\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company recognizes revenue in accordance with Topic 606 to depict the transfer of promised goods or services in an amount that reflects the consideration to\nwhich an entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. To determine revenue recognition for arrangements within the scope of Topic 606 the Company\nperforms the following steps:\n● Step 1: Identify the contract(s) with a customer\n● Step 2: Identify the performance obligations in the contract\n● Step 3: Determine the transaction price\n● Step 4: Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract\n● Step 5: Recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation\nThe Company follows the accounting revenue guidance under Topic 606 to determine whether contracts contain more than one performance obligation. Performance\nobligations are the unit of accounting for revenue recognition and generally represent the distinct goods or services that are promised to the customer.\nThe Company has identified the following performance obligations in its SaaS contracts with customers:\n1) Data Normalization: which includes data preparation, product and vendor mapping, product categorization, data enrichment and other data related services,\n2) Software-as-a-service (“SaaS”): which is generated from clients’ access of and usage of the Company’s hosted software solutions on a subscription basis for a\nspecified contract term, which is usually annually. In SaaS arrangements, the client cannot take possession of the software during the term of the contract and\ngenerally has the right to access and use the software and receive any software upgrades published during the subscription period,\n3) Maintenance: which includes ongoing data cleansing and normalization, content enrichment, and optimization, and\n4) Professional Services: mainly related to specific customer projects to manage and/or analyze data and review for cost reduction opportunities.\nA contract will typically include Data Normalization, SaaS and Maintenance, which are distinct performance obligations and are accounted for separately. The\ntransaction price is allocated to each separate performance obligation on a relative stand-alone selling price basis. Significant judgement is required to determine the stand-alone\nselling price for each distinct performance obligation and is typically estimated based on observable transactions when these services are sold on a stand-alone basis. At contract\ninception, an assessment of the goods and services promised in the contracts with customers is performed and a performance obligation is identified for each distinct promise to\ntransfer to the customer a good or service (or bundle of goods or services). To identify the performance obligations, the Company considers all the goods or services promised\nin the contract regardless of whether they are explicitly stated or are implied by customary business practices. Revenue is recognized when the performance obligation has been\nmet. The Company considers control to have transferred upon delivery because the Company has a present right to payment at that time, the Company has transferred use of the\ngood or service, and the customer is able to direct the use of, and obtain substantially all the remaining benefits from, the good or service.\nThe Company’s SaaS and Maintenance contracts typically have termination for convenience without penalty clauses and accordingly, are generally accounted for as\nmonth-to-month agreements. If it is determined that the Company has not satisfied a performance obligation, revenue recognition will be deferred until the performance\nobligation is deemed to be satisfied.\nF-11\nRevenue recognition for the Company’s performance obligations are as follows:\nData Normalization and Professional Services\nThe Company’s Data Normalization and Professional Services are typically fixed fee. When these services are not combined with SaaS or Maintenance revenues as a\nsingle unit of accounting, these revenues are recognized as the services are rendered and when contractual milestones are achieved and accepted by the customer. When these\nservices are combined with SaaS or Maintenance revenues, revenues recognized ratably over the period of the contract.\nSaaS and Maintenance\nSaaS and Maintenance revenues are recognized ratably over the contract terms beginning on the commencement date of each contract, which is the date on which the\nCompany’s service is made available to customers.\nThe Company does have some contracts that have payment terms that differ from the timing of revenue recognition, which requires the Company to assess whether the\ntransaction price for those contracts include a significant financing component. The Company has elected the practical expedient that permits an entity to not adjust for the\neffects of a significant financing component if it expects that at the contract inception, the period between when the entity transfers a promised good or service to a customer\nand when the customer pays for that good or service will be one year or less. The Company does not maintain contracts in which the period between when the entity transfers a\npromised good or service to a customer and when the customer pays for that good or service exceeds the one-year threshold.\nThe Company has one revenue stream, from the SaaS business, and believes it has presented all varying factors that affect the nature, timing and uncertainty of\nrevenues and cash flows.\nRemaining Performance Obligations\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company had $378,583 of remaining performance obligations recorded as deferred revenue. The Company expects to recognize sales\nrelating to these existing performance obligations of during 2024.\nAs of December 31, 2022, the Company had $579,833 of remaining performance obligations recorded as deferred revenue. The Company recognized sales relating to\nthose existing performance obligations of during 2023.\nCosts to Fulfill a Contract\nCosts to fulfill a contract typically include costs related to satisfying performance obligations as well as general and administrative costs that are not explicitly\nchargeable to customer contracts. These expenses are recognized and expensed when incurred in accordance with ASC 340-40.\nCost of Revenue\nCost of revenues primarily represent data center hosting costs, consulting services and maintenance of the Company’s large data array that were incurred in delivering\nprofessional services and maintenance of the Company’s large data array during the periods presented.\nContract Balances\nContract assets arise when the revenue associated prior to the Company’s unconditional right to receive a payment under a contract with a customer (i.e., unbilled\nrevenue) and are derecognized when either it becomes a receivable or the cash is received. There were no contract assets as of December 31, 2023 and 2022.\nContract liabilities arise when customers remit contractual cash payments in advance of our company satisfying our performance obligations under the contract and are\nderecognized when the revenue associated with the contract is recognized when the performance obligation is satisfied. Contract liabilities were $378,583 and $579,833 as of\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nF-12\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes in accordance with ASC Topic 740, “Income Taxes.” Under this method, income tax\nexpense is recognized for the amount of: (i) taxes payable or refundable for the current year and (ii) deferred tax consequences of temporary differences resulting from matters\nthat have been recognized in an entity’s financial statements or tax returns. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable\nincome in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is\nrecognized in the results of operations in the period that includes the enactment date.\nValuation allowances are provided if, based upon the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be\nrealized. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company has evaluated available evidence and concluded that the Company may not realize all the benefits of its deferred tax\nassets; therefore, a valuation allowance has been established for its deferred tax assets.\nASC Topic 740-10-30 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise’s financial statements and prescribes a recognition threshold\nand measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. ASC Topic 740-10-40\nprovides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure, and transition. The Company has no material uncertain tax\npositions for any of the reporting periods presented.\nStock-Based Compensation\nThe Company accounts for stock-based compensation expense in accordance with the authoritative guidance on share-based payments. Under the provisions of the\nguidance, stock-based compensation expense is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the option or warrant using a Black-Scholes option pricing model and is\nrecognized as expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period.\nThe authoritative guidance also requires that the Company measures and recognizes stock-based compensation expense upon modification of the term of stock award.\nThe stock-based compensation expense for such modification is accounted for as a repurchase of the original award and the issuance of a new award.\nCalculating stock-based compensation expense requires the input of highly subjective assumptions, including the expected term of the stock-based awards, stock price\nvolatility, and the pre-vesting option forfeiture rate. The Company estimates the expected life of options granted based on historical exercise patterns, which are believed to be\nrepresentative of future behavior. The Company estimates the volatility of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant based on historical volatility. The assumptions\nused in calculating the fair value of stock-based awards represent the Company’s best estimates, but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of\nmanagement’s judgment. As a result, if factors change and the Company uses different assumptions, its stock-based compensation expense could be materially different in the\nfuture. In addition, the Company is required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and only recognize expense for those shares expected to vest. The Company estimates the\nforfeiture rate based on historical experience of its stock-based awards that are granted, exercised and cancelled. If the actual forfeiture rate is materially different from the\nestimate, stock-based compensation expense could be significantly different from what was recorded in the current period. The Company also grants performance based\nrestricted stock awards to employees and consultants. These awards will vest if certain employee\\consultant-specific or company-designated performance targets are achieved.\nIf minimum performance thresholds are achieved, each award will convert into a designated number of the Company’s common stock. If minimum performance thresholds are\nnot achieved, then no shares will be issued. Based upon the expected levels of achievement, stock-based compensation is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite\nservice period. The expected levels of achievement are reassessed over the requisite service periods and, to the extent that the expected levels of achievement change, stock-\nbased compensation is adjusted in the period of change and recorded on the consolidated statements of operations and the remaining unrecognized stock-based compensation is\nrecorded over the remaining requisite service period. Refer to Note 9, Stockholders’ Equity, for additional detail.\nF-13\nLoss Per Share\nThe Company computes earnings (loss) per share in accordance with ASC 260, “Earnings per Share” which requires presentation of both basic and diluted earnings\n(loss) per share (“EPS”) on the face of the income statement. Basic EPS is computed by dividing the loss available to common shareholders (numerator) by the weighted\naverage number of shares outstanding (denominator) during the period. Diluted EPS gives effect to all dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period using the\ntreasury stock method and convertible preferred stock using the if-converted method. In computing diluted EPS, the average stock price for the period is used in determining\nthe number of shares assumed to be purchased from the exercise of stock options or warrants and the exercise of fully vested restricted stock units. Diluted EPS excludes all\ndilutive potential shares if their effect is anti-dilutive. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company had 180,390 and 273,059, respectively, common stock equivalents\noutstanding.\nIndemnification\nThe Company provides indemnification of varying scope to certain customers against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from\nthe use of the Company’s software. In accordance with authoritative guidance for accounting for guarantees, the Company evaluates estimated losses for such indemnification.\nThe Company considers such factors as the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. To date, no\nsuch claims have been filed against the Company and no liability has been recorded in its consolidated financial statements.\nAs permitted under Delaware law, the Company has agreements whereby it indemnifies its officers and directors for certain events or occurrences while the officer or\ndirector is, or was, serving at the Company’s request in such capacity. The maximum potential amount of future payments the Company could be required to make under these\nindemnification agreements is unlimited. In addition, the Company has directors’ and officers’ liability insurance coverage that is intended to reduce its financial exposure and\nmay enable it to recover any payments above the applicable policy retention.\nIn connection with the Class Action and derivative claims and investigations described in Note 8, Commitments and Contingencies, the Company is obligated to\nindemnify its officers and directors for costs incurred in defending against these claims and investigations.\nContingencies\nThe Company records a liability when the Company believes that it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If the\nCompany determines that a loss is reasonably possible, and the loss or range of loss can be estimated, the Company discloses the possible loss in the notes to the consolidated\nfinancial statements. The Company reviews the developments in its contingencies that could affect the amount of the provisions that has been previously recorded, and the\nmatters and related possible losses disclosed. The Company adjusts provisions and changes to its disclosures accordingly to reflect the impact of negotiations, settlements,\nrulings, advice of legal counsel, and updated information. Significant judgment is required to determine both the probability and the estimated amount.\nLegal costs associated with loss contingencies are accrued based upon legal expenses incurred by the end of the reporting period.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts\nreported and disclosed in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. The Company regularly evaluates estimates and assumptions related to the allowance\nfor credit losses, the estimated useful lives and recoverability of long-lived assets, equity component of convertible debt, stock-based compensation, and deferred income tax\nasset valuation allowances. The Company bases its estimates and assumptions on current facts, historical experience and various other factors that it believes to be reasonable\nunder the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the accrual of costs and expenses that\nare not readily apparent from other sources. The actual results experienced by the Company may differ materially and adversely from the Company’s estimates. To the extent\nthere are material differences between the estimates and the actual results, future results of operations will be affected. Actual results could differ materially from those\nestimates.\nF-14\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nFrom time to time, new accounting pronouncements are issued by FASB that are adopted by the Company as of the specified effective date. If not discussed,\nmanagement believes that the impact of recently issued standards, which are not yet effective, will not have a material impact on the Company’s financial statements upon\nadoption.\nNote 4. Related Party Transactions\nAt December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company had amounts due to officers in the amount of $149,838 and $153,838, respectively.\nDuring September 2021, the Company’s former CEO (also a significant shareholder) advanced $100,000 in cash to the Company for short term capital requirements.\nThis amount is non-interest bearing and payable upon demand. The Company had balances of $67,622 and $100,000 included in stockholder advance on the Company’s\nconsolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nBetween May 24, 2023 and November 29, 2023, the Company’s CFO advanced an aggregate $193,558 in cash to the Company for short term capital requirements. As\nof December 31, 2023, all advanced amounts have been repaid.\nThe above amounts and terms are not necessarily what third parties would agree to.\nNote 5. Goodwill\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company determined that the fair value of its goodwill was less than its carrying value. The Company determined the\ncarrying value to be $5,842,433 as of December 31, 2023 and recognized impairment expense $2,524,034.\nThere were no changes to the carrying value of goodwill for the year ended December 31, 2022.\nF-15\nNote 6. Loans Payable\nReceipt of CARES funding\nOn May 5, 2020, the Company obtained a $293,972 unsecured loan payable through the Paycheck Protection Program (“PPP”), which was enacted as part of the\nCoronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (the “CARES ACT”). The funds were received from Bank of America through a loan agreement pursuant to the CARES\nAct. The CARES Act was established in order to enable small businesses to pay employees during the economic slowdown caused by COVID-19 by providing forgivable loans\nto qualifying businesses for up to 2.5 times their average monthly payroll costs. The amount borrowed under the CARES Act and used for payroll costs, rent, mortgage interest,\nand utility costs during the 24 week period after the date of loan disbursement is eligible to be forgiven provided that (a) the Company uses the PPP Funds during the eight\nweek period after receipt thereof, and (b) the PPP Funds are only used to cover payroll costs (including benefits), rent, mortgage interest, and utility costs. While the full loan\namount may be forgiven, the amount of loan forgiveness will be reduced if, among other reasons, the Company does not maintain staffing or payroll levels or less than 60% of\nthe loan proceeds are used for payroll costs. Principal and interest payments on any unforgiven portion of the PPP Funds (the “PPP Loan”) will be deferred to the date the SBA\nremits the borrower’s loan forgiveness amount to the lender or, if the borrower does not apply for loan forgiveness, 10 months after the end of the borrower’s loan forgiveness\nperiod for six months and will accrue interest at a fixed annual rate of 1.0% and carry a two year maturity date. There is no prepayment penalty on the CARES Act Loan. In\nMay 2022, the Company was granted an extension on the maturity date of this note until March 5, 2025. The loan was partially forgiven in the amount of $139,596 in\nSeptember 2022 with the balance remaining due.\nOn March 17, 2021, the Company received $139,595 in financing from the U.S. government’s Payroll Protection Program (“PPP”). We entered into a loan agreement\nwith Bank of America. This loan agreement was pursuant to the CARES Act. The CARES Act was established in order to enable small businesses to pay employees during the\neconomic slowdown caused by COVID-19 by providing forgivable loans to qualifying businesses for up to 2.5 times their average monthly payroll costs. The amount borrowed\nunder the CARES Act is eligible to be forgiven provided that (a) the Company uses the PPP Funds during the eight week period after receipt thereof, and (b) the PPP Funds are\nonly used to cover payroll costs (including benefits), rent, mortgage interest, and utility costs. The amount of loan forgiveness will be reduced if, among other reasons, the\nCompany does not maintain staffing or payroll levels. Principal and interest payments on any unforgiven portion of the PPP Funds (the “PPP Loan”) will be deferred for six\nmonths and will accrue interest at a fixed annual rate of 1.0% and carry a two year maturity date. There is no prepayment penalty on the CARES Act Loan. This note was fully\nforgiven on March 12, 2022.\nNote 7. Leases\nOperating Leases\nThe Company’s principal executive office in Tampa Florida is under a month-to-month arrangement with a base rent of $250 per month.\nThe Company has operating leases for corporate, business and technician offices. Leases with a probable term of 12 months or less, including month-to-month\nagreements, are not recorded on the consolidated balance sheets, unless the arrangement includes an option to purchase the underlying asset, or an option to renew the\narrangement, that the Company is reasonably certain to exercise (short-term leases). The Company recognizes lease expense for these leases on a straight-line bases over the\nlease term. The Company’s only remaining lease is month-to-month. As a practical expedient, the Company elected, for all office and facility leases, not to separate non-lease\ncomponents (common-area maintenance costs) from lease components (fixed payments including rent) and instead to account for each separate lease component and its\nassociated non-lease components as a single lease component.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, the components of lease expense were as follows:\nFor the years ended\nDecember 31,\n2023 2022\nOperating lease cost $ 3,523 $ 1,043\nTotal lease cost $ 3,523 $ 1,043\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company has no additional operating leases, and no financing leases.\nF-16\nNote 8. Commitments and Contingencies\nIn conducting our business, the Company may become involved in legal proceedings. The Company will accrue a liability for such matters when it is probable that a\nliability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. When only a range of possible loss can be established, the most probable amount in the range is\naccrued. If no amount within this range is a better estimate than any other amount within the range, the minimum amount in the range is accrued. The accrual for a litigation\nloss contingency might include, for example, estimates of potential damages, outside legal fees and other directly related costs expected to be incurred.\nCorProminence d/b/a Core IR v. SCWorx\nAAA Arbitration Case 01-22-0001-5709\nAs previously disclosed in the Company’s periodic reports filed with the SEC, on April 25, 2022, the Company received a Demand for Arbitration along with a\nStatement of Claim filed by Core IR with the American Arbitration Association seeking damages in the amount of approximately $190,000. arising out of a marketing and\nconsulting agreement. The Company filed its answer, affirmative defenses and counterclaims on May 16, 2022. By order of the arbitrator dated November 1, 2022, Core IR\nreceived permission to amend its Statement of Claim to increase its request for damages to $257,546. The Company received the final decision of the Arbitrator on October 16,\n2023, awarding Core IR $461,856 including unpaid compensation, indemnification for legal fees and costs, prevailing party legal fees and interest (the “Award”). Core IR has\nsince obtained a judgement in the amount of approximately $502,000 (including interest) (“Judgement”) which is included in accounts payable and accrued liabilities on the\nCompany’s consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2023. The Company and Core IR entered into a settlement agreement dated July 12, 2024 under which the Company\nagreed to issue Core IR shares of its common stock with a value of $502,000 (determined based on sales proceeds realized by Core IR), in full and complete satisfaction of the\nJudgement. The settlement agreement is filed as exhibit 10.5 to this annual report on Form 10-K\nHadrian Equities Partners, LLC et ano. v. SCWorx Corp,\nCase No. 22-cv-07096 (JLR) (S.D.N.Y)\nOn August 19, 2022, Hadrian Equities Partners, LLC and the Phillip W. Caprio, Jr. 2007 Irrevocable Trust filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the\nSouthern District of New York alleging that SCWorx was dilatory and did not comply with its alleged contractual duties to remove the restrictions from Plaintiffs’ converted\nAMMA stock to SCWorx stock until August 10 and August 11, 2020. Plaintiffs allege that as a result, they were unable to sell their SCWorx stock when SCWorx was trading at\nits highest price on April 13, 2020. The Complaint sought $500,000 in damages.

Net Loss Per Share\nBasic net loss per share is computed by dividing net loss for the period by the weighted average shares of common stock outstanding during each period. Diluted net\nloss per share is computed by dividing net loss for the period by the weighted average shares of common stock, common stock equivalents and potentially dilutive securities\noutstanding during each period. The Company uses the treasury stock method to determine whether there is a dilutive effect of outstanding option grants.\nThe following securities were excluded from the computation of diluted net loss per share for the periods presented because including them would have been anti-\ndilutive:\nFor the years ended\nDecember 31,\n2023 2022\nStock options 3,333 7,891\nWarrants 11,394 104,515\nRestricted stock units 165,663 160,653\nTotal common stock equivalents 180,390 273,059\nNote 11. Income Taxes\nBy virtue of a merger of the limited liability company into a corporation, the Company became a corporation during 2018.\nThe significant items comprising the Company’s net deferred taxes as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 are as follows:\nAs of December 31,\n2023 2022\nNet operating loss $ 8,790,076 $ 8,541,890\nStock options and compensation 2,440,539 2,358,690\nDeferred revenue 324,159 238,410\nOther 571,694 -\nValuation allowance (12,126,468) (11,138,990)\nTotal deferred tax asset - -\nBasis difference fixed assets - -\nTotal deferred tax liability - -\nNet deferred tax asset (liability) $ - $ -\nF-21\nThe components of the provision for (benefit from) income taxes consist of the following:\nAs of December 31,\n2023 2022\nCurrent tax:\nFederal $ - $ -\nState - -\nTotal $ - $ -\nDeferred tax:\nFederal $ (915,543) $ (509,721)\nState (71,935) (40,049)\nLess: change in valuation allowance 987,478 549,770\n- -\nTotal $ - $ -\nThe provision for (benefit from) income taxes varies from the amount computed by applying the statutory rate for reasons summarized below:\nAs of December 31, 2023 As of December 31, 2022\nNet loss before tax per financial statements $ (3,981,144) $ (1,847,406)\nStatutory rate (836,040) 21.00% (387,955) 21.00%\nState tax rate (65,689) 1.65 % (30,482) 1.65%\nPermanent items (85,749) 2.15 % (131,330) 7.11%\nRate change 0.00 % - 0.00%\nChange in valuation allowance 987,478 (24.80)% 549,770 (29.73)%\n$ - 0.00% $ - 0.00%\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company had federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $38.8 million and $37.7 million, respectively,\navailable to offset future taxable income. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company had state loss carry-forwards of approximately $18.2 million and $17.1,\nrespectively. Future utilization of net operating losses may be limited due to potential ownership changes under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended\n(the “Code”). The federal net operating loss carryforwards can be carried forward indefinitely and state loss carryforwards begin to expire in 2039.\nThe valuation allowance as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 was $12,126,468 and $11,138,990, respectively. The net change in valuation allowance for the years\nended December 31, 2023 and 2022 was an increase of $987,478 and $549,770, respectively. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers\nwhether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred income tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred income tax assets is\ndependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the scheduled\nreversal of deferred income tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. Based on consideration of these items,\nmanagement has determined that enough uncertainty exists relative to the realization of the deferred income tax asset balances to warrant the application of a full valuation\nallowance as of December 31, 2023 and 2022.\nThe Company had no unrecognized tax benefits during 2023 or 2022. By statute, all tax years are open to examination by the major taxing jurisdictions to which the\nCompany is subject.\nF-22\nNote 12.
