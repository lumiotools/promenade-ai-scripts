Net income was $20.2 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared with $15.4 million for the third quarter of 2023, while net income per diluted share was $1.10 compared with $0.95 for the same period a year ago. Adjusted EBITDA increased 11.1% to $34.3 million for the third quarter of 2024 from $30.9 million for the third quarter of 2023. Adjusted net income was $23.8 million for the third quarter of 2024 compared with $18.8 million for the prior-year period, while adjusted net income per diluted share was $1.30 compared with $1.15 for the third quarter of 2023. Adjusted net income per diluted share for the third quarter of 2024 excludes acquisition expenses of $0.08 and stock-based compensation expense of $0.12. The weighted average number of shares outstanding increased to approximately 18.3 million from approximately 16.5 million in the second quarter primarily as a result of the completed public offering of 1,725,000 shares on June 28, 2024 (See the end of press release for a reconciliation of all non-GAAP and GAAP financial measures.) \n\nFor the first nine months of 2024, net service revenues increased 9.6% to $857.5 million from $782.3 million for the prior-year period. Net income was $54.1 million for the first nine months of 2024 compared with $42.9 million for the same period in 2023, and net income per diluted share was $3.17 compared with $2.63 per diluted share. Adjusted EBITDA increased 19.4% to $102.0 million for the first nine months of 2024 from $85.4 million for the first nine months of 2023. Adjusted net income was $65.9 million for the first nine months of 2024 compared with $52.1 million for the first nine months of 2023, while adjusted net income per diluted share was $3.86 compared with $3.20 for the prior-year period. \n\nCommenting on the results, Dirk Allison, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, said, “Addus delivered another strong financial and operating performance for the third quarter of 2024, highlighted by 7.0% top line growth and 11.1% growth in Adjusted EBITDA compared to the third quarter of 2023. These results reflect the consistent favorable growth trends we have delivered to date in 2024, driven by solid organic growth and the contribution from recent acquisitions. Demand for our services continues to fuel our growth, reflecting a greater awareness of the value of home-based care as the preferred and most cost-effective option for many individuals. With our expanding scale and market coverage, Addus is well positioned to meet this demand with our ability to offer home-based services across the care continuum. \n\n“Our personal care business continued to perform well, accounting for 74.3% of our overall revenues for the third quarter of 2024, with higher patient volumes supported by favorable hiring trends. Personal care has been the key growth driver for Addus this year with consistent year-over-year improvement. For the third quarter of 2024, we delivered 6.8% organic growth in revenue on a same-store basis over the corresponding period last year, reflecting robust demand and favorable reimbursement support across the markets where we operate. \n\n“On the clinical side, our results included the operations of Tennessee Quality Care, a provider of home health, hospice, and private duty nursing services, acquired by Addus on August 1, 2023. We continued to see steady improvement in our hospice business with revenues up 3.5% on a same-store basis and a modest increase in average daily census compared with the third quarter last year. Our home health business, which is our smallest segment, accounted for 5.9% of total revenue for the third quarter of 2024,” said Allison. \n\n**Cash and Liquidity**\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company had cash of $222.9 million with capacity and availability under its revolving credit facility of $511.5 million and $503.5 million, respectively. Net cash provided by operating activities was $48.5 million for the third quarter of 2024, inclusive of a one-time working capital benefit of $9.7 million expected to revert in the fourth quarter. As previously disclosed, subsequent to the end of the quarter, Addus entered into an Amended and Restated Credit Agreement to increase the Company’s revolving credit facility from $600 million to $650 million and extend the maturity date through July 2028. \n\n**Looking Ahead**\n\nAllison added, “We will continue to maintain a conservative balance sheet and pursue a capital allocation strategy that brings additional value to our shareholders. Acquisitions represent a significant use of capital for Addus, and we will continue to target operations that are aligned with our overall growth strategy to add clinical services where we have a strong personal care presence. We will also seek opportunities to add operations in select personal care markets where we can enter at scale. In line with this strategy, during the second quarter, we announced a definitive agreement to acquire the personal care operations of Gentiva. These operations deliver personal care services to over 16,000 patients per day in a seven-state service area, including Texas and Missouri, which are new states for Addus. We are excited about the opportunity to expand our market reach, especially in Texas where we will become the largest provider of personal care services. Having broader market coverage supports our ability to hire and retain caregivers and also provides Addus with an advantage in developing value-based contract arrangements. We expect to close the Gentiva acquisition in the fourth quarter of 2024, and our team has been diligently working on transition planning to integrate these operations. \n\n“As we continue to expand our operations, we are proud of the leadership role we are playing in meeting the critical need for home-based care. We commend the work of our dedicated caregivers across our operations who make this possible for more patients and their families. We are excited about the opportunities ahead to build on our momentum, and we look forward to another successful year for Addus in 2024,” added Allison. \n\n**Non-GAAP Financial Measures**\n\nThe information provided in this release includes adjusted net income, adjusted EBITDA, and adjusted net income per diluted share, which are non-GAAP financial measures. The Company defines adjusted net income as net income before gain or loss on sale of assets, impact of retroactive New York rate increases, acquisition expenses, stock-based compensation expenses, and restructure and other non-recurring costs. The Company defines adjusted EBITDA as earnings before interest expense, gain or loss on sale of assets, taxes, depreciation, amortization, impact of retroactive New York rate increases, acquisition expense, stock-based compensation expense, and restructure and other non-recurring costs. The Company defines adjusted net income per diluted share as net income per share, adjusted for the impact of retroactive New York rate increases, acquisition expenses, stock-based compensation expense, and restructure and other non-recurring costs. The Company defines adjusted net service revenues as revenue adjusted for the closure of certain sites. The Company has provided, in the financial statement tables included in this press release, a reconciliation of adjusted net income to net income, a reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA to net income, a reconciliation of adjusted diluted net income per share to net income per share, and a reconciliation of adjusted net service revenues to net service revenues, in each case, the most directly comparable GAAP measure. Management believes that adjusted net income, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted diluted net income per share, and adjusted net service revenues are useful to investors, management and others in evaluating the Company’s operating performance, to provide investors with insight and consistency in the Company’s financial reporting and to present a basis for comparison of the Company’s business operations among periods, and to facilitate comparison with the results of the Company’s peers. \n\n**Conference Call**\n\nAddus will host a conference call on Tuesday, November 5, 2024, at 9:00 a.m. Eastern time.
