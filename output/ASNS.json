Dean\")\n\n### Actelis continues on the footsteps of the recently announced project in critical infrastructure modernization with new orders, reinforcing its position as a trusted partner in the nation’s capital; Collaborating with key DDOT integrator M.C. Dean\n\nFREMONT, Calif., Nov. 25, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Actelis Networks, Inc. **(NASDAQ:ASNS)** (“Actelis” or the “Company”), a market leader in cyber-hardened, rapid deployment networking solutions for IoT applications, today announced that it has received new orders for the Washington DC Department of Transportation (“DDOT”). These orders follow the approximately $2.3 million order [announced in May 2024](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=Tig3a09odmkD4cAdJXnOKHXYjNxllEYWVmmLHps5CvrZuqXdgho4T03-Xlo0JKxmrFK6htLX2gLUa0X0BwGotG3hY2Makrdf1e1ypEF_1efewjuwdeO04yyZ8pNwwxPnQu-hZ-tT64YQCdSPbA4hjTbPmvLYIRTzJxR_6ehFD-lLIPVLfooZ6K3htlaqXFR0eMSqxbgx6oo3YS_UDyEOz6BfJqkg3OI9jGHL0BM3w1dBqiNOJvX7z5dBN4SQ2NOP \"Opens in a new window\") which played a crucial role in modernizing and standardizing DDOT’s network connectivity infrastructure along its roadways and intersections.\n\nActelis is collaborating with M.C. Dean, a key integrator for DDOT and the leading “Building Intelligence®” solutions provider, specializing in the design, construction, and maintenance of advanced cyber-physical systems for mission-critical facilities and complex infrastructure.\n\nAccording to a [recent report](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=hZI42aXDys6Lk4L6VnNeTq7Vek9HAQVDEc6oeuYxdq4v3dic_kBAbrJmDkdD38x6aL5g0p8FcaAD6nc5lLImuVnIjEOyydyRm6hGaE5u7vUGl1jOi7c--d0nbRKs7hQhn56X1JQpX93Oi92SAcAHrg== \"Opens in a new window\") by the Texas A&M Transportation Institute, Washington DC ranks as one of the United States’ most congested cities. A variety of factors contribute to this high level of traffic congestion including high population density, an influx of visitors commuting from surrounding areas, and tourists visiting from around the globe utilizing rental cars and ride share services.\n\n“Washington, DC’s complex traffic environment necessitates innovative solutions for managing roadways,” said Tuvia Barlev, Chairman and CEO of Actelis. “The backbone of effective traffic management systems is reliable, far-reaching network connectivity. Actelis enables DDOT to optimize traffic flow, improve safety, and enhance data collection using tools such as signal timing and traffic cameras.”\n\nActelis’ cyber-hardened hybrid-fiber networking solutions are especially valuable to cities like Washington, DC because they provide fiber-grade performance using existing wiring, avoiding the time and expense of laying new cabling along roadways. Actelis’ technology transforms legacy copper or other traditionally low-bandwidth wiring into Gigabit-capable infrastructure, capable of supporting high-demand applications like data-intensive traffic monitoring systems and advanced cameras.\n\n**“** Washington, DC has now become a showcase for Actelis’ hybrid fiber-copper technology and a model for how other cities can efficiently modernize their traffic management infrastructure,” added Barlev. “Our collaboration with M.C. Dean has proven that cities can save hundreds of thousands of dollars—or more—on construction costs while achieving the performance required to manage dense roadway systems.”\n\n**About Actelis Networks, Inc.**\n\nActelis Networks, Inc.

Q3 2024 EBITDA loss narrowed to $0.2 million, reflecting ongoing momentum and successful cost reduction efforts\n\nFREMONT, Calif., Nov. 14, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- **Actelis Networks, Inc. (NASDAQ: ASNS)**(“Actelis” or the “Company”), a market leader in cyber-hardened, rapid deployment networking solutions for wide area IoT applications, today reported financial results for the fiscal third quarter ended September 30, 2024.\n\n**Financial Highlights for the Third Quarter and nine months ending September 30:**\n\n  * **Robust Revenue Growth, Surpassing Full-Year 2023 in Nine Months:** Revenue reached $2.54 million in Q3 2024, a 200% year-over-year increase from $0.85 million in Q3 2023. For the nine months ending September 30, 2024, revenue grew to $6.7 million—up 46% from the prior-year period—driven by accelerated execution of large contracts, including $1.1 million of software and support revenues out of a two-year software and services renewal with one of our largest customers.\n  * **Significant Improvement in Gross Margin:** Gross margin soared to $1.74 million, or 69%, in Q3 2024, a substantial increase from $0.2 million, or 27%, in the same quarter last year. This boost was driven by an increase in revenues driving lower indirect costs as a percentage of revenues, and the significant software component of revenue. For the nine months ending September 30, 2024, gross margin increased to $3.9 million, or 58%, up from $1.55 million, or 34%, in the prior-year period. This substantial improvement is driven by higher software and services revenue and other high margin sales, along with stable, low indirect costs.\n  * **Continued Reduction in Operating Expenses:** Operating expenses continued their downward trend, totaling $2.0 million in Q3-2024, a 12% reduction compared to the same quarter last year. For the nine months ending September 30, 2024, operating expenses reached $6.0 million, down 17%, or $1.22 million, from the prior-year period, aligning with the company’s cost reduction commitment made last year.\n  * **Significant Reduction in Net Loss and Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA:** Net loss narrowed substantially to $511,000 in Q3 2024, a 41% decrease compared to the prior-year quarter, and by 41% to $2.57 million for the nine months ending September 30, 2024. Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA improved sharply, down 87% to $233,000 in Q3 2024, and down 56% to $2.0 million for the nine-month period. These improvements reflect the successful impact of increased revenue, gross margin growth, and ongoing operating cost reductions.\n  * **Liquidity and Nasdaq Compliance Secured:** With nearly $5 million raised in June 2024 and a significant reduction in net loss, shareholders’ equity reached $2.8 million as of September 30, 2024. In September, the Company also filed a shelf prospectus and now has an effective At-The-Market (ATM) facility in place. \n\n\n\n“Our third-quarter results underscore Actelis’ strong financial performance and continued growth trajectory,” said Tuvia Barlev, Chairman and CEO of Actelis. “With robust revenue growth, a dramatic increase in gross margins, and disciplined cost management, we are achieving the financial resilience needed to support our expanding role in critical sectors. This progress reflects the value of our cyber-hardened, rapid-deployment networking solutions and our commitment to driving sustainable long-term growth for our shareholders.”\n\n**Recent Company Highlights**\n\n  * Actelis continues to gain strong traction with significant contract renewals and new orders across strategic markets. In Q3 2024, Actelis secured the 1.4 million renewal of a two-year software and services contract with one of its largest North American customers out of which recognized 1.1 million in Q3, underscoring the long-standing trust and value Actelis provides while further enhancing our recurring revenue base.\n  * The Company also received substantial new orders across diverse sectors, solidifying Actelis' position as a leading provider of cyber-hardened, rapid-deployment networking solutions. Key projects include modernization initiatives for Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) in major U.S. cities and counties, deployments for U.S. military bases, and expansion into European markets like Italy’s national highway infrastructure and German utilities.\n  * Recent follow-on orders with the U.S. Department of Transportation and municipalities in Germany demonstrate Actelis’ capability to serve critical infrastructure, transportation, and government applications with its secure, hybrid-fiber technology.\n  * Actelis’ expense reduction program continues to yield positive results, with operating expenses for the nine months ending June 30, 2024, reduced by 17% year-over-year, aligning with our strategic cost structure optimization plan, and preparing the Company for a strong trajectory towards 2025.\n  * Actelis continues to advance its ‘Cyber Aware Networking’ initiative, an AI-powered SaaS layer designed to enhance the security of IoT networks by providing comprehensive threat monitoring and automated response capabilities directly at the network edge. As part of this initiative, and as reported on August 19, 2024, the Company is collaborating with an advanced cybersecurity provider to further develop and deliver these capabilities.\n  * Following extensive due diligence, Actelis issued a termination notice on October 12, 2024, for its agreement with Quality Industrial Corp., concluding that the deal did not align with our objective to maximize shareholder value.\n  * Despite ongoing tensions and conflicts in the Middle East, Actelis’ operations remain unaffected. We are closely monitoring the situation and are prepared to make necessary adjustments as events unfold. \n\n\n\n“Our third quarter concluded positively, meeting and exceeding key expectations,” noted Tuvia Barlev, Chairman and CEO of Actelis. “Our unique ability to deliver fiber-grade hardware, software, and services across key verticals—such as Intelligent Transportation, Smart Cities, Federal and Military agencies, and Multi-Dwelling Units—positions us well to maximize revenue growth and advance towards profitability. Looking ahead, we remain focused on driving organic growth while also exploring strategic opportunities that align with our strengths and enhance the value we bring to our customers.”\n\n**Fiscal Third Quarter and First nine months 2024 Financial Results:**\n\n  * **Revenues:** Q3 2024 revenues were $2.54 million, reflecting a 200% year-over-year increase from $0.85 million in Q3 2023. The increase from the corresponding period was primarily attributable to an increase of $1.4 million of revenues generated from North America driven by volume increase and a renewal of a service and software contract and an increase of $0.3 million of revenues generated from Asia Pacific and Europe, the Middle East and Africa driven by volume increase.For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, revenues were $6.7 million, compared to $4.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase from the corresponding period was primarily attributable to an increase of $3.4 million in revenues generated from North America associated with volume increase and a renewal of a service and software contract offset by decrease of $1.3 million in revenues generated from Asia Pacific and Europe, the Middle East and Africa associated with completed projects in the prior year period.\n\n\n  * **Cost of Revenues:** Cost of revenues for Q3 2024 was $0.8 million, compared to $0.6 million in Q3 2023.

The decrease from the corresponding period was primarily attributable to the change in regional mix of revenue of an increase in North America revenues, which are more profitable, and a decrease in Europe, Middle East and Africa revenues which are less profitable\n\n\n  * **Gross Profit:** Gross profit for Q3 2024 was $1.7 million, up from $0.23 in Q3 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, gross profit reached $3.9 million, compared to $1.5 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\n  * **Research and Development Expenses:** R&D expenses for Q3 2024 were $0.5, down from $0.7 in Q3 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, R&D expenses were $1.8 million, compared to $2.1 million in the same period last year. The decrease is primarily attributable to cost reduction measures taken.\n  * **Sales and Marketing Expenses:** Sales and marketing expenses for Q3 2024 were $0.72, compared to $0.69 in Q3 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, these expenses totaled $2.0 million, down from $2.3 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023.The decrease was mainly due to cost reduction measures taken.\n  * **General and Administrative Expenses:** G&A expenses were $0.79 in Q3 2024, down from $0.97 in Q3 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, G&A expenses were $2.4 million, compared to $2.80 million for the same period last year. The decrease was mainly due to cost reduction measures taken.\n  * **Other Income:** Other Income was $0 in Q3 2024. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, Other Income was $163,000 driven by a government grant from the state of Israel associated with the Swords of Iron war.\n  * **Operating Profit/Loss:** Operating profit for Q3 2024 was $0.32 million, compared to an operating loss of $2.13 million in Q3 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the operating loss was reduced to $2.12 million, down from $5.70 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was mainly due to the increase in revenues, improved gross margin due to regional revenue mix, and cost reduction measures taken, reducing operating expenses.\n  * **Financial Income/(expense) and Interest Expenses:** Our financial income, net was $52,000 and our interest expense was $0.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to financial income, net of $1.4 million and $0.2 million interest expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase is mainly due to financial income in the prior year from bank deposits and exchange rate differences not repeated in current period.Our financial income, net was $138,000 and our interest expense was $0.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to financial income, net of $1.9 million and interest expense of $0.5 million interest expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase is mainly due to financial income in the prior year from bank deposits and exchange rate differences not repeated in current period.\n\n\n  * **Net Comprehensive Profit/(Loss):** Net comprehensive Loss for Q3 2024 was $0.51 million, a significant turnaround from a net loss of $0.87 million in Q3 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the net loss was $2.57 million, compared to a net loss of $4.35 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This decrease was primarily due to the increase in revenues, improved gross margin due to regional revenue mix, and cost reduction measures taken, reducing operating expenses, partially offset by financial income in the prior year not repeating itself. \n  * **Non-GAAP EBITDA** : Non-GAAP EBITDA loss was $233,000 in Q3-2024, compared to a non-GAAP EBITDA loss of $1.76 million in the year ago period, driven by increased revenue, better gross margin and reduced operating expenses. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, non-GAAP EBITDA loss was $2.0 million, from $4.6 million in the year ago period. This decrease was primarily due to the increase in revenues, improved gross margin due to regional revenue mix, and cost reduction measures taken, reducing operating expenses. \n\n\n\n**About Actelis Networks, Inc.**\n\nActelis Networks, Inc.

This attention has underscored the GL900’s potential as an ultra-low power, highly cost-effective solution designed to deliver symmetrical Gigabit services, within multi-dwelling units (MDUs), without the need to run new wires or Fiber in the walls, setting it apart with its unique sub-5W power consumption.\n\nThe GL900’s ultra-low power consumption, at less than 5W, enables broadband providers to meet the needs of millions of residents in MDUs efficiently and sustainably. With 23 million apartment buildings in the U.S. alone, this scalable solution is positioned to provide fiber-grade connectivity without the high costs and logistical challenges of rewiring—a critical feature in closing the digital divide for American families. By leveraging existing copper or coax wiring, the GL900 offers flexible, fiber-grade performance that can adapt to varying building sizes, providing service to numerous apartments per unit and reducing both deployment time and energy consumption.\n\n“We’re thrilled with the market’s reception to our GL900,” said Tuvia Barlev, Chairman and CEO of Actelis. “Visitors to our booths recognized the GL900’s ability to address the industry's need for scalable, low-cost, and sustainable broadband solutions for MDUs, a key market we are well-positioned to serve. We have already received initial customer orders and multiple trials are underway.”\n\nActelis’ unique technology allows wireless operators, such as those attending WISPAPALOOZA, to extend connectivity from rooftop access points directly into individual apartments, enhancing last-mile delivery in complex building infrastructures.

Q3 2024 EBITDA loss narrowed to $0.2 million, reflecting ongoing momentum and successful cost reduction efforts\n\nFREMONT, Calif., Nov. 14, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- **Actelis Networks, Inc. (NASDAQ: ASNS)**(“Actelis” or the “Company”), a market leader in cyber-hardened, rapid deployment networking solutions for wide area IoT applications, today reported financial results for the fiscal third quarter ended September 30, 2024.\n\n**Financial Highlights for the Third Quarter and nine months ending September 30:**\n\n  * **Robust Revenue Growth, Surpassing Full-Year 2023 in Nine Months:** Revenue reached $2.54 million in Q3 2024, a 200% year-over-year increase from $0.85 million in Q3 2023. For the nine months ending September 30, 2024, revenue grew to $6.7 million—up 46% from the prior-year period—driven by accelerated execution of large contracts, including $1.1 million of software and support revenues out of a two-year software and services renewal with one of our largest customers.\n  * **Significant Improvement in Gross Margin:** Gross margin soared to $1.74 million, or 69%, in Q3 2024, a substantial increase from $0.2 million, or 27%, in the same quarter last year. This boost was driven by an increase in revenues driving lower indirect costs as a percentage of revenues, and the significant software component of revenue. For the nine months ending September 30, 2024, gross margin increased to $3.9 million, or 58%, up from $1.55 million, or 34%, in the prior-year period. This substantial improvement is driven by higher software and services revenue and other high margin sales, along with stable, low indirect costs.\n  * **Continued Reduction in Operating Expenses:** Operating expenses continued their downward trend, totaling $2.0 million in Q3-2024, a 12% reduction compared to the same quarter last year. For the nine months ending September 30, 2024, operating expenses reached $6.0 million, down 17%, or $1.22 million, from the prior-year period, aligning with the company’s cost reduction commitment made last year.\n  * **Significant Reduction in Net Loss and Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA:** Net loss narrowed substantially to $511,000 in Q3 2024, a 41% decrease compared to the prior-year quarter, and by 41% to $2.57 million for the nine months ending September 30, 2024. Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA improved sharply, down 87% to $233,000 in Q3 2024, and down 56% to $2.0 million for the nine-month period. These improvements reflect the successful impact of increased revenue, gross margin growth, and ongoing operating cost reductions.\n  * **Liquidity and Nasdaq Compliance Secured:** With nearly $5 million raised in June 2024 and a significant reduction in net loss, shareholders’ equity reached $2.8 million as of September 30, 2024. In September, the Company also filed a shelf prospectus and now has an effective At-The-Market (ATM) facility in place. \n\n\n\n“Our third-quarter results underscore Actelis’ strong financial performance and continued growth trajectory,” said Tuvia Barlev, Chairman and CEO of Actelis. “With robust revenue growth, a dramatic increase in gross margins, and disciplined cost management, we are achieving the financial resilience needed to support our expanding role in critical sectors. This progress reflects the value of our cyber-hardened, rapid-deployment networking solutions and our commitment to driving sustainable long-term growth for our shareholders.”\n\n**Recent Company Highlights**\n\n  * Actelis continues to gain strong traction with significant contract renewals and new orders across strategic markets. In Q3 2024, Actelis secured the 1.4 million renewal of a two-year software and services contract with one of its largest North American customers out of which recognized 1.1 million in Q3, underscoring the long-standing trust and value Actelis provides while further enhancing our recurring revenue base.\n  * The Company also received substantial new orders across diverse sectors, solidifying Actelis' position as a leading provider of cyber-hardened, rapid-deployment networking solutions. Key projects include modernization initiatives for Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) in major U.S. cities and counties, deployments for U.S. military bases, and expansion into European markets like Italy’s national highway infrastructure and German utilities.\n  * Recent follow-on orders with the U.S. Department of Transportation and municipalities in Germany demonstrate Actelis’ capability to serve critical infrastructure, transportation, and government applications with its secure, hybrid-fiber technology.\n  * Actelis’ expense reduction program continues to yield positive results, with operating expenses for the nine months ending June 30, 2024, reduced by 17% year-over-year, aligning with our strategic cost structure optimization plan, and preparing the Company for a strong trajectory towards 2025.\n  * Actelis continues to advance its ‘Cyber Aware Networking’ initiative, an AI-powered SaaS layer designed to enhance the security of IoT networks by providing comprehensive threat monitoring and automated response capabilities directly at the network edge. As part of this initiative, and as reported on August 19, 2024, the Company is collaborating with an advanced cybersecurity provider to further develop and deliver these capabilities.\n  * Following extensive due diligence, Actelis issued a termination notice on October 12, 2024, for its agreement with Quality Industrial Corp., concluding that the deal did not align with our objective to maximize shareholder value.\n  * Despite ongoing tensions and conflicts in the Middle East, Actelis’ operations remain unaffected. We are closely monitoring the situation and are prepared to make necessary adjustments as events unfold. \n\n\n\n“Our third quarter concluded positively, meeting and exceeding key expectations,” noted Tuvia Barlev, Chairman and CEO of Actelis. “Our unique ability to deliver fiber-grade hardware, software, and services across key verticals—such as Intelligent Transportation, Smart Cities, Federal and Military agencies, and Multi-Dwelling Units—positions us well to maximize revenue growth and advance towards profitability. Looking ahead, we remain focused on driving organic growth while also exploring strategic opportunities that align with our strengths and enhance the value we bring to our customers.”\n\n**Fiscal Third Quarter and First nine months 2024 Financial Results:**\n\n  * **Revenues:** Q3 2024 revenues were $2.54 million, reflecting a 200% year-over-year increase from $0.85 million in Q3 2023. The increase from the corresponding period was primarily attributable to an increase of $1.4 million of revenues generated from North America driven by volume increase and a renewal of a service and software contract and an increase of $0.3 million of revenues generated from Asia Pacific and Europe, the Middle East and Africa driven by volume increase.For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, revenues were $6.7 million, compared to $4.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase from the corresponding period was primarily attributable to an increase of $3.4 million in revenues generated from North America associated with volume increase and a renewal of a service and software contract offset by decrease of $1.3 million in revenues generated from Asia Pacific and Europe, the Middle East and Africa associated with completed projects in the prior year period.\n\n\n  * **Cost of Revenues:** Cost of revenues for Q3 2024 was $0.8 million, compared to $0.6 million in Q3 2023.

The decrease from the corresponding period was primarily attributable to the change in regional mix of revenue of an increase in North America revenues, which are more profitable, and a decrease in Europe, Middle East and Africa revenues which are less profitable\n\n\n  * **Gross Profit:** Gross profit for Q3 2024 was $1.7 million, up from $0.23 in Q3 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, gross profit reached $3.9 million, compared to $1.5 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\n  * **Research and Development Expenses:** R&D expenses for Q3 2024 were $0.5, down from $0.7 in Q3 2023.

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, these expenses totaled $2.0 million, down from $2.3 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023.The decrease was mainly due to cost reduction measures taken.\n  * **General and Administrative Expenses:** G&A expenses were $0.79 in Q3 2024, down from $0.97 in Q3 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, G&A expenses were $2.4 million, compared to $2.80 million for the same period last year. The decrease was mainly due to cost reduction measures taken.\n  * **Other Income:** Other Income was $0 in Q3 2024. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, Other Income was $163,000 driven by a government grant from the state of Israel associated with the Swords of Iron war.\n  * **Operating Profit/Loss:** Operating profit for Q3 2024 was $0.32 million, compared to an operating loss of $2.13 million in Q3 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the operating loss was reduced to $2.12 million, down from $5.70 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was mainly due to the increase in revenues, improved gross margin due to regional revenue mix, and cost reduction measures taken, reducing operating expenses.\n  * **Financial Income/(expense) and Interest Expenses:** Our financial income, net was $52,000 and our interest expense was $0.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to financial income, net of $1.4 million and $0.2 million interest expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase is mainly due to financial income in the prior year from bank deposits and exchange rate differences not repeated in current period.Our financial income, net was $138,000 and our interest expense was $0.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to financial income, net of $1.9 million and interest expense of $0.5 million interest expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase is mainly due to financial income in the prior year from bank deposits and exchange rate differences not repeated in current period.\n\n\n  * **Net Comprehensive Profit/(Loss):** Net comprehensive Loss for Q3 2024 was $0.51 million, a significant turnaround from a net loss of $0.87 million in Q3 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the net loss was $2.57 million, compared to a net loss of $4.35 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This decrease was primarily due to the increase in revenues, improved gross margin due to regional revenue mix, and cost reduction measures taken, reducing operating expenses, partially offset by financial income in the prior year not repeating itself. \n  * **Non-GAAP EBITDA** : Non-GAAP EBITDA loss was $233,000 in Q3-2024, compared to a non-GAAP EBITDA loss of $1.76 million in the year ago period, driven by increased revenue, better gross margin and reduced operating expenses. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, non-GAAP EBITDA loss was $2.0 million, from $4.6 million in the year ago period. This decrease was primarily due to the increase in revenues, improved gross margin due to regional revenue mix, and cost reduction measures taken, reducing operating expenses. \n\n\n\n**About Actelis Networks, Inc.**\n\nActelis Networks, Inc.

Q3 2024 EBITDA loss\nnarrowed to $0.2 million, reflecting ongoing momentum and successful\ncost reduction efforts\nFREMONT, Calif., Nov. 14, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Actelis Networks, Inc.\n(NASDAQ: ASNS) (“Actelis” or the “Company”), a market leader in cyber-hardened, rapid\ndeployment networking solutions for wide area IoT applications, today reported financial\nresults for the fiscal third quarter ended September 30, 2024.\nFinancial Highlights for the Third Quarter and nine months ending September 30:\nRobust Revenue Growth, Surpassing Full-Year 2023 in Nine Months: Revenue\nreached $2.54 million in Q3 2024, a 200% year-over-year increase from $0.85 million\nin Q3 2023. For the nine months ending September 30, 2024, revenue grew to $6.7\nmillion—up 46% from the prior-year period—driven by accelerated execution of large\ncontracts, including $1.1 million of software and support revenues out of a two-year\nsoftware and services renewal with one of our largest customers.\nSignificant Improvement in Gross Margin: Gross margin soared to $1.74 million, or\n69%, in Q3 2024, a substantial increase from $0.2 million, or 27%, in the same quarter\nlast year. This boost was driven by an increase in revenues driving lower indirect costs\nas a percentage of revenues, and the significant software component of revenue. For\nthe nine months ending September 30, 2024, gross margin increased to $3.9 million,\nor 58%, up from $1.55 million, or 34%, in the prior-year period. This substantial\nimprovement is driven by higher software and services revenue and other high margin\nsales, along with stable, low indirect costs.\nContinued Reduction in Operating Expenses: Operating expenses continued their\ndownward trend, totaling $2.0 million in Q3-2024, a 12% reduction compared to the\nsame quarter last year. For the nine months ending September 30, 2024, operating\nexpenses reached $6.0 million, down 17%, or $1.22 million, from the prior-year period,\naligning with the company’s cost reduction commitment made last year.\nSignificant Reduction in Net Loss and Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA: Net loss\nnarrowed substantially to $511,000 in Q3 2024, a 41% decrease compared to the\nprior-year quarter, and by 41% to $2.57 million for the nine months ending September\n30, 2024. Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA improved sharply, down 87% to $233,000 in\nQ3 2024, and down 56% to $2.0 million for the nine-month period. These\nimprovements reflect the successful impact of increased revenue, gross margin\ngrowth, and ongoing operating cost reductions.\nLiquidity and Nasdaq Compliance Secured: With nearly $5 million raised in June\n2024 and a significant reduction in net loss, shareholders’ equity reached $2.8 million\nas of September 30, 2024. In September, the Company also filed a shelf prospectus\nand now has an effective At-The-Market (ATM) facility in place.\n“Our third-quarter results underscore Actelis’ strong financial performance and continued\ngrowth trajectory,” said Tuvia Barlev, Chairman and CEO of Actelis. “With robust revenue\ngrowth, a dramatic increase in gross margins, and disciplined cost management, we are\nachieving the financial resilience needed to support our expanding role in critical sectors.\nThis progress reflects the value of our cyber-hardened, rapid-deployment networking\nsolutions and our commitment to driving sustainable long-term growth for our shareholders.”\nRecent Company Highlights\nActelis continues to gain strong traction with significant contract renewals and new\norders across strategic markets. In Q3 2024, Actelis secured the 1.4 million renewal of\na two-year software and services contract with one of its largest North American\ncustomers out of which recognized 1.1 million in Q3, underscoring the long-standing\ntrust and value Actelis provides while further enhancing our recurring revenue base.\nThe Company also received substantial new orders across diverse sectors, solidifying\nActelis' position as a leading provider of cyber-hardened, rapid-deployment networking\nsolutions. Key projects include modernization initiatives for Intelligent Transportation\nSystems (ITS) in major U.S. cities and counties, deployments for U.S. military bases,\nand expansion into European markets like Italy’s national highway infrastructure and\nGerman utilities.\nRecent follow-on orders with the U.S. Department of Transportation and municipalities\nin Germany demonstrate Actelis’ capability to serve critical infrastructure,\ntransportation, and government applications with its secure, hybrid-fiber technology.\nActelis’ expense reduction program continues to yield positive results, with operating\nexpenses for the nine months ending June 30, 2024, reduced by 17% year-over-year,\naligning with our strategic cost structure optimization plan, and preparing the Company\nfor a strong trajectory towards 2025.\nActelis continues to advance its ‘Cyber Aware Networking’ initiative, an AI-powered\nSaaS layer designed to enhance the security of IoT networks by providing\ncomprehensive threat monitoring and automated response capabilities directly at the\nnetwork edge. As part of this initiative, and as reported on August 19, 2024, the\nCompany is collaborating with an advanced cybersecurity provider to further develop\nand deliver these capabilities.\nFollowing extensive due diligence, Actelis issued a termination notice on October 12,\n2024, for its agreement with Quality Industrial Corp., concluding that the deal did not\nalign with our objective to maximize shareholder value.\nDespite ongoing tensions and conflicts in the Middle East, Actelis’ operations remain\nunaffected. We are closely monitoring the situation and are prepared to make\nnecessary adjustments as events unfold.\n“Our third quarter concluded positively, meeting and exceeding key expectations,” noted\nTuvia Barlev, Chairman and CEO of Actelis. “Our unique ability to deliver fiber-grade\nhardware, software, and services across key verticals—such as Intelligent Transportation,\nSmart Cities, Federal and Military agencies, and Multi-Dwelling Units—positions us well to\nmaximize revenue growth and advance towards profitability. Looking ahead, we remain\nfocused on driving organic growth while also exploring strategic opportunities that align with\nour strengths and enhance the value we bring to our customers.”\nFiscal Third Quarter and First nine months 2024 Financial Results:\nRevenues: Q3 2024 revenues were $2.54 million, reflecting a 200% year-over-year\nincrease from $0.85 million in Q3 2023. The increase from the corresponding period\nwas primarily attributable to an increase of $1.4 million of revenues generated from\nNorth America driven by volume increase and a renewal of a service and software\ncontract and an increase of $0.3 million of revenues generated from Asia Pacific and\nEurope, the Middle East and Africa driven by volume increase.\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, revenues were $6.7 million,\ncompared to $4.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The\nincrease from the corresponding period was primarily attributable to an increase of\n$3.4 million in revenues generated from North America associated with volume\nincrease and a renewal of a service and software contract offset by decrease of $1.3\nmillion in revenues generated from Asia Pacific and Europe, the Middle East and Africa\nassociated with completed projects in the prior year period.\nCost of Revenues: Cost of revenues for Q3 2024 was $0.8 million, compared to $0.6\nmillion in Q3 2023.

The\ndecrease from the corresponding period was primarily attributable to the change in\nregional mix of revenue of an increase in North America revenues, which are more\nprofitable, and a decrease in Europe, Middle East and Africa revenues which are less\nprofitable\nGross Profit: Gross profit for Q3 2024 was $1.7 million, up from $0.23 in Q3 2023. For\nthe nine months ended September 30, 2024, gross profit reached $3.9 million,\ncompared to $1.5 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\nResearch and Development Expenses: R&D expenses for Q3 2024 were $0.5, down\nfrom $0.7 in Q3 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, R&D expenses\nwere $1.8 million, compared to $2.1 million in the same period last year.

For the nine months ended September 30,\n2024, these expenses totaled $2.0 million, down from $2.3 million in the nine months\nended September 30, 2023.The decrease was mainly due to cost reduction measures\ntaken.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses: G&A expenses were $0.79 in Q3 2024, down\nfrom $0.97 in Q3 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, G&A\nexpenses were $2.4 million, compared to $2.80 million for the same period last year.\nThe decrease was mainly due to cost reduction measures taken.\nOther Income: Other Income was $0 in Q3 2024. For the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024, Other Income was $163,000 driven by a government grant from\nthe state of Israel associated with the Swords of Iron war.\nOperating Profit/Loss: Operating profit for Q3 2024 was $0.32 million, compared to\nan operating loss of $2.13 million in Q3 2023. For the nine months ended September\n30, 2024, the operating loss was reduced to $2.12 million, down from $5.70 million in\nthe nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was mainly due to the\nincrease in revenues, improved gross margin due to regional revenue mix, and cost\nreduction measures taken, reducing operating expenses.\nFinancial Income/(expense) and Interest Expenses: Our financial income, net was\n$52,000 and our interest expense was $0.2 million for the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 compared to financial income, net of $1.4 million and $0.2 million\ninterest expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase is\nmainly due to financial income in the prior year from bank deposits and exchange rate\ndifferences not repeated in current period.\nOur financial income, net was $138,000 and our interest expense was $0.6 million for\nthe nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to financial income, net of $1.9\nmillion and interest expense of $0.5 million interest expenses for the nine months\nended September 30, 2023. The increase is mainly due to financial income in the prior\nyear from bank deposits and exchange rate differences not repeated in current period.\nNet Comprehensive Profit/(Loss): Net comprehensive Loss for Q3 2024 was $0.51\nmillion, a significant turnaround from a net loss of $0.87 million in Q3 2023. For the\nnine months ended September 30, 2024, the net loss was $2.57 million, compared to a\nnet loss of $4.35 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This decrease\nwas primarily due to the increase in revenues, improved gross margin due to regional\nrevenue mix, and cost reduction measures taken, reducing operating expenses,\npartially offset by financial income in the prior year not repeating itself.\nNon-GAAP EBITDA: Non-GAAP EBITDA loss was $233,000 in Q3-2024, compared to\na non-GAAP EBITDA loss of $1.76 million in the year ago period, driven by increased\nrevenue, better gross margin and reduced operating expenses. For the nine months\nended September 30, 2024, non-GAAP EBITDA loss was $2.0 million, from $4.6\nmillion in the year ago period. This decrease was primarily due to the increase in\nrevenues, improved gross margin due to regional revenue mix, and cost reduction\nmeasures taken, reducing operating expenses.\nAbout Actelis Networks, Inc.\nActelis Networks, Inc.

(hereafter -the Company) was established in 1998, under the laws of the state of Delaware. The Company has a wholly-owned subsidiary in Israel, Actelis Networks Israel Ltd. (hereafter – the Subsidiary). The Company is engaged in the design, development, manufacturing, and marketing of cyber hardened, hybrid fiber, networking solutions for IoT and Telecommunication governmental agencies and companies. The Company’s customers include governmental agencies, providers of telecommunication services, enterprises as well as resellers of the Company’s products. On May 12, 2022, the Company accepted a notification of effectiveness from the SEC, and on May 17, 2022, completed its IPO. The Company’s Common Stock is listed on the NASDAQ.  \n---|---  \n**b.**|  The Company has incurred significant losses and negative cash flows from operations. Net loss was $2,575 and $4,355 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and September 30, 2023, respectively. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and September 30, 2023, the Company had negative cash flows from operations of $4,781 and $5,194, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, the Company’s accumulated deficit was $42,263. The Company has funded its operations to date through equity and debt financing and has cash on hand (including restricted cash equivalents) of $2,541 restricted bank deposits of $91 as of September 30, 2024. The Company monitors its cash flow projections on a current basis and takes active measures to obtain the funding it requires to continue its operations. However, these cash flow projections are subject to various uncertainties concerning their fulfilment such as the ability to increase revenues by attracting and expanding its customer base or reducing cost structure. If the Company is not successful in generating sufficient cash flow or completing additional financing, including debt refinancing which shall release restricted cash, then it will need to execute a new cost reduction plan in addition to previous cost reduction plans that were executed so far. The Company’s transition to profitable operations is dependent on generating a level of revenue adequate to support its cost structure. The Company expects to fund operations using cash on hand, through operational cash flows and raising additional proceeds. There are no assurances, however, that the Company will be able to generate the revenue necessary to support its cost structure or that it will be successful in obtaining the level of financing necessary for its operations. Management has evaluated the significance of these conditions and has determined that the Company does not have sufficient resources to meet its operating obligations for at least one year from the issuance date of these condensed consolidated financial statements. These conditions raise substantial doubt as to the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. These consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern and do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.  \n---|---  \n**c.**|  On October 7, 2023, Hamas launched a series of attacks on civilian and military targets in Southern and Central Israel, to which the Israel Defense Forces have responded. In addition, both Hezbollah and the Houthi movement have attacked military and civilian targets in Northern Israel, to which Israel has responded, including through increased air and ground operations in Lebanon. In addition, the Houthi movement has attacked international shipping lanes in the red sea. Further, on April 2024, and on October 2024, Iran launched a series of drone and missile strikes against Israel, to which Israel has responded. To date our operations and financial results have not been materially affected. The Company continues to monitor its ongoing activities and will make adjustments in its business if needed, including updating any estimates or judgments impacting its financial statements as appropriate, while supporting the safety and well-being of its employees. It is currently not possible to predict the effects of such conflicts and its impact on the Company’s business, operations or financial conditions. We continue to monitor political and military developments closely and examine the consequences for our business, results of operations and financial condition.  \n---|---  \n  \nF-10\n\n**ACTELIS NETWORKS, INC.**\n\nNOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n**U.S. DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS**\n\n**NOTE 1 – GENERAL:**(continued):\n\nOn November 21, 2023 we applied for an Israeli government grant associated with the Swords of Iron war declared by the State of Israel following the October 7, 2023 attack by Hamas.\n\nThe Company was found eligible and received an amount of $163 which was recognized as other income during the second quarter in 2024. The grant is not repayable.\n\n**d.**|  On August 25, 2023, the Company received a notification letter from the Nasdaq Staff indicating that the company was not in compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(b)(1) due to the company's failure to meet the Minimum Shareholders’ Equity Requirement or any alternatives to such requirement. In order to maintain listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market, the company has submitted a plan of compliance addressing how we intended to regain compliance. The company had until February 21, 2024 to evidence compliance with the Minimum Shareholders’ Equity Requirement.  \n---|---  \n  \nOn March 27, 2024, the Company received a delist determination letter (the “Delist Letter”) from the Staff advising the Company that the Staff had determined to delist the Company’s securities from Nasdaq due to its non-compliance with the Equity Rule unless the Company timely requests a hearing before the Nasdaq Hearings Panel (the “Panel”). The Company timely requested a hearing before the Panel. Following the hearing, on June 10, 2024, the Panel granted the Company’s request for continued listing subject to the Company evidencing compliance with the Minimum Shareholders’ Equity Requirement by August 30, 2024.\n\nOn August 27, 2024, the Company received formal written notice from the Nasdaq Staff confirming that the Company has evidenced compliance with all applicable criteria for continued listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market as set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550. In accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5815(d)(4)(B), the Company will remain subject to Panel monitor for equity compliance through August 27, 2025.\n\n**NOTE 2 – SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES:**\n\n**a.**| **Basis of presentation**  \n---|---  \n  \nThe accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Article 10 of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”)’s Regulation S-X. As permitted under those rules, certain footnotes and other financial information that are normally required by generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“U.S. GAAP”) can be condensed or omitted. These financial statements reflect all adjustments, which include only normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair statement of its financial position as of and for the periods presented. These condensed consolidated financial statements and notes thereto are unaudited and should be read in conjunction with the Company’s audited financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023. The results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, are not necessarily indicative of results that could be expected for the 2024 fiscal year or any other interim period or for any other future year. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.\n\n**b.**| **Use of estimates in preparation of financial statements**  \n---|---  \n  \nThe preparation of the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. The Company evaluates on an ongoing basis its assumptions, including those related to contingencies, fair values of financial instruments, inventory write-offs, as well as in estimates used in applying the revenue recognition policy. The Company’s management believes that the estimates, judgments, and assumptions used are reasonable based upon information available at the time they are made. These estimates, judgments and assumptions can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\n\nF-11\n\n**ACTELIS NETWORKS, INC.**\n\nNOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n**U.S. DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS**\n\n**NOTE 2 – SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES:**(continued):\n\n**c.**| **Fair value of financial instruments**  \n---|---  \n  \nFair value measurements are classified and disclosed in one of the following three categories:\n\nLevel 1 – Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities.\n\nLevel 2 – Quoted prices in markets that are not active, or inputs which are observable, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the asset or liability.\n\nLevel 3 – Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.\n\nThe Company measured the fair value of the warrants it issued (see note 5) based on Level 3 inputs, and the warrants liability amounted to $8 as September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, are presented in the Other current liabilities in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets.\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, the fair values of the Company’s cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and cash equivalents, short and long-term deposits, trade receivables, trade payables, long-term loan, restricted bank deposits, Severance pay fund and other current assets approximated the carrying values of these instruments presented in the Company’s condensed consolidated balance sheets because of their nature.\n\n**d.**| **Concentration of risk**  \n---|---  \n  \nFinancial instruments that potentially subject the Company to significant concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, and trade receivables. Cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash are placed with banks and financial institutions in the United States and Israel.\n\nManagement believes that the financial institutions that hold the Company’s investments are financially sound and, accordingly, present minimal credit risk with respect to those investments.\n\nThe Company’s trade receivables are derived primarily from telecommunication operators, the Company’s reseller customers and enterprises located mainly in the United States, Europe, and Asia.\n\nCredit risk with respect to trade receivables exists to the full extent of the amounts presented in the condensed consolidated financial statements. Management makes judgments as to its ability to collect outstanding accounts receivable and provides allowances for the applicable portion of accounts receivable when collection becomes doubtful.\n\nManagement provides allowances based upon a specific review of all significant outstanding invoices, analysis of its historical collection experience, and current economic trends. If the historical data used to calculate the allowance for credit losses does not reflect the Company’s future ability to collect outstanding accounts receivable, additional provisions for credit losses may be needed, and the future results of operations could be materially affected.\n\nF-12\n\n**ACTELIS NETWORKS, INC.**\n\nNOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n**U.S. DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS**\n\n**NOTE 2 – SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES:**(continued):\n\nThe Company has customers balances representing 10% or more of Trade receivables as follows:\n\n1)  | Customer A represented 0% and 30% of the Company Trade receivables balance as of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, respectively.  \n---|---  \n2) | Customer B represented 4.5 % and 11% of the Company Trade receivables balance as of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, respectively.  \n---|---  \n3) | Customer C represented0 % and 11% of the Company Trade receivables balance as of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, respectively.  \n---|---  \n4)| Customer D represented 38% and 0% of the Company Trade receivables balance as of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, respectively.  \n---|---  \n5)| Customer E represented 21.4% and 0% of the Company Trade receivables balance as of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, respectively.  \n---|---  \n  \nThe Company does not see any credit risk regarding the major trade receivable balance.\n\n**New Accounting Pronouncements**\n\n**_Accounting Pronouncements effective in future periods_**\n\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-07 Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures. The ASU improves reportable segments disclosure requirements, primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. The ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is evaluating the potential impact of this guidance on its consolidated financial statements.\n\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09 Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures. The ASU improves the transparency of income tax disclosures by requiring (1) consistent categories and greater disaggregation of information in the rate reconciliation and (2) income taxes paid disaggregated by jurisdiction. It also includes certain other amendments to improve the effectiveness of income tax disclosures. For public business entities, the ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024.

The Company received $3,000 on December 2020, and additional $2,000 in January 2021. The loan bears interest of 9.6% per annum. The interest shall first be paid in 12 payments starting February 1, 2021. Starting February 1, 2022, the loan principal and interest shall be repaid in 72 equal payments, plus a one-time interest payment after the 36th month.  \n---|---  \n  \nAs part of the loan agreement, the Company issued the New Lender warrants to acquire common stock in the amount of $1,500.\n\nIn November 2021, the Company received additional funding in the amount of $1,000 from Migdalor. The loan bears interest of 9.6% per annum. Starting February 1, 2022, the loan principal and interest shall be repaid in 72 equal monthly payments, plus a onetime interest payment after the 24th month. The Company increased the value of the warrant issued to Migdalor to $1,800. Upon the consummation of the IPO, the Company converted all the above outstanding warrants issued to Migdalor into the Company’s common stock based on the contractual terms and conditions of the related warrant agreements.\n\nThe loan covenants (the “covenants”) include a debt to EBITDA minimum ratio or a coverage ratio of the loan by current assets.\n\nOn December 21, 2022, pursuant to the terms of the loan agreement, the Company deposited $2,000 to a Company-owned interest-bearing bank account, or the “designated account” (as defined in the agreement), to satisfy the required obligation associated with the loan agreement. An additional $2,000 was deposited in the designated account during the year ended December 31, 2023, which was classified in Restricted cash equivalents in the condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company was in compliance with the covenants of the Migdalor loan.\n\nIn February 2024, the Company performed a partial early repayment of Migdalor Loan in the amount of 2 million NIS (approximately $550). During April and May 2024, the Company made an additional partial early repayment of Migdalor loan in the amount of 10.9 million NIS approximately $2,933). In May 2024, the Company signed an amendment to the agreement with Migdalor, pursuant to which the remaining $470 of the one-time interest payment which was originally due in January 2024 to Migdalor will be paid in 12 equal monthly payments bearing 9.6% interest from February 2024 till February 2025. In addition, the Company is obligated to issue Migdalor warrants to acquire common stock for up to $150 subject to the agreed upon formula. The Company has a paid, during July 2024, a total amount of $196 (for the periods from February to June) of the one-time interest payment.\n\nIn July 2024, the company repaid the remaining loan balance to Migdalor, totaling 1.16 million ILS (approximately 0.3$ million )\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, the total outstanding of the one-time interest payment was 0.7 million NIS (approximately $0.2 million).\n\n**c.**|  On January 15, 2024, the Subsidiary entered into a credit agreement with Bank Mizrahi-Tefahot.

Under the New Credit Line, which will be secured by the Subsidiary’s customer receivables, the Subsidiary will pay an annual fixed interest at a Federal SOFR rate plus 5.5% on any amount withdrawn under the New Credit Line. The New Credit Line, at an annual fixed interest rate of 1.5% for unused credit amount, expires on December 27, 2024, subject to extension.  \n---|---  \n  \nUnder the Credit Agreement, the Company is permitted to draw upon the New Credit Line for customer invoices that meet the following conditions:\n\n(a)| Throughout the duration of the New Credit Line, the Company may present customer receivables and receive credit financing that does not exceed 80% of the aggregate amount of the open customer invoices securing the New Credit Facility; The credit financing is to be repaid within 90 days.  \n---|---  \n(b)| Customer invoices are payable within 90 days from the date of the Company’s monthly report to the Lender; and  \n---|---  \n(c)| No single customer of the Company may account for open customer invoices securing over 30% of the total borrowed amount under the New Credit Line.  \n---|---  \n  \nThe Credit Line balance drawn will be examined every month and adjusted up to every three months and Repayment of the Credit Line will be made up to every three months subject to the expiration of the financing period for the invoices that were financed. The Company may refinance newly issued invoices at any time up to the Credit Line limit and subject to the terms of the Credit Line.\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Subsidiary used $0.9 million of the credit line. \n\nF-14\n\n**ACTELIS NETWORKS, INC.**\n\nNOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n**U.S. DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS**\n\nNOTE 5 – WARRANTS:\n\nThe company has several types of warrants.

The Comerica Warrants are exercisable at any time during the contract period which ends on August 24, 2026.  \n---|---  \n  \nAdditionally, in connection with the consummation of the IPO which occurred in May 2022, and the change of the type of the stock from redeemable preferred stock to common stock at conversion, the Company reassessed the Comerica Warrants. As part of the contractual terms and conditions of Comerica’s Warrants, a portion of the warrants are exercisable, as of the IPO date, into the Company’s common stock.\n\nThe Company has evaluated whether the Comerica Warrants are still classified as liabilities and concluded that due to a change-of-control provision which may affect the exercise price or entitle Comerica to demand cash, instead of shares, to settle the warrants, Comerica’s Warrants will continue to be classified as liabilities and will be exercisable into the Company’s common shares. The Comerica Warrants are still outstanding as of September 30, 2024.\n\n**b.**|  On May 8, 2023, the Company completed a fund-raising round. Upon the consummation of the Offering and pursuant to an agreement entered into with the Holder and the underwriter, the Company issued warrants to purchase shares of Common Stock. Such warrants were classified as liabilities based on the terms of the underlying agreement. On September 30, 2023, these warrants were reclassified to equity due to an amendment to the warrants’ agreements (for further details see also Note 7b). On June 6, 2024, these warrants were exercised pursuant to the inducement agreement, as described in notes 7d below.  \n---|---  \n  \nNOTE 6 – COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES:\n\nThe Company is obligated to repay certain research and development grants received from the Government of Israel in the form of a royalty rate on future sales of products derived from the funded research and development activities.

Our unique portfolio of hybrid fiber, environmentally hardened aggregation switches, high density Ethernet devices, advanced management software and cyber-protection capabilities, unlocks the hidden value of essential networks, delivering safer connectivity for rapid, cost-effective deployment.\n\nOur networking solutions use a combination of newly deployed fiber infrastructure and existing copper and coaxial lines which our patented technology can upgrade to Fiber-grade to jointly create what we believe to be a highly cost-effective, secure and quick-to-deploy network. Our patent protected hybrid fiber networking solutions deliver excellent communication over fiber to locations that may be easy to reach with new fiber. However, for locations that are difficult, or too costly to reach with fiber, we can upgrade existing copper lines to deliver cyber-hardened, high-speed connectivity without needing to replace the existing copper infrastructure with new fiber. We believe that such hybrid fiber-copper networking solution has distinct advantages in most real-life installations, while providing significant budget savings and accelerating deployment of modern IoT networks, as based on our experience, most IoT projects have challenging, hard to reach with fiber locations which may explode such projects’ timeline and budgets. We believe that our solutions can provide connectivity over either fiber or copper with speeds of up to multi-Gigabit communication, while supporting Fiber-grade reliability and quality.\n\nA primary focus of ours is to provide our customers with a cyber-secure network solution. We currently offer Triple-Shield protection of data delivered with coding, scrambling and encryption of the network traffic. We also provide secure, encrypted access to our network management software, and are working to further enhance system-level and device-level software protection. We are also working to introduce additional capabilities for network-wide cyber protection software as an additional SW and license-based service.\n\nWhen high speed, long reach, reliable and secure connectivity is required, network operators usually resort to using wireline communication over physical communication lines such as fiber, coax and copper, rather than wireless communication that is more limited in performance, reliability, reach and security. However, new fiber wireline infrastructure is costly to deploy, involves lengthy civil works to install, and, based on our internal calculations, often accounts for more than 50% of total cost of ownership (ToC) and time to deploy wide-area IoT projects.\n\n2\n\nProviding new fiber connectivity to hard-to-reach locations is especially costly and time-consuming, often requiring permits for boring, trenching, and right-of-way, sometimes done over many miles. Connecting such hard-to-reach locations may cause significant delays and budget overruns in IoT projects. Our solutions aim to solve these challenges by instantly enhancing performance of such existing copper and coax infrastructure to fiber-grade performance, through the use of advanced signal processing an unique, patented network architecture, without the need to run new fiber to hard-to-reach locations; thus, effectively accelerating deployment of many IoT projects, as we estimate, sometimes from many months to only days. The result for the network owner isa hybrid network that optimizes the use of both new Fiber (where available) as well as upgraded, fiber-grade copper and coax that is now modernized, digitized and cyber-hardened. This unique hybrid network approach is making IoT projects often significantly more affordable, fast to deploy and predictable to plan and budget.\n\nIn addition, our solutions can also provide power over existing copper and coax lines to remotely power up network elements and IoT components connected to them (like cameras, small cell and Wi-Fi base stations sensors etc.). Connecting power lines to millions of IoT locations can be costly and very time consuming as well (similar to data connectivity, for the same reason-need for civil works). By offering the ability to combine power delivery over the same existing copper and coax lines that we use for high-speed data, we believe our solutions are solving yet another important challenge in connecting hard-to-reach locations. We believe that combining communication and power over the same existing lines is particularly important to help connect many fifth generation, or 5G, small cells and Wi-Fi base stations, as high cost of connectivity and power is often slowing their deployment.\n\nSince our inception, our business was focused on serving telecommunication service providers, also known as Telcos, to provide connectivity for enterprises and residential customers. Our products and solutions have been deployed with more than 100 telecommunication service providers worldwide, in enterprise, residential and mobile base station connectivity applications. In recent years, as we have further developed our technology and introduced additional products, we turned our focus on serving the wide-area IoT markets. Our operations are focused on our fast-growing IoT business, while maintaining our commitment to our existing Telco customers. In 2023, we introduced new product offering, some of which could serve both the IoT markets and our Telco customers.\n\n**_Recent Developments_**\n\n _Nasdaq Listing Compliance_\n\nOn August 25, 2023, we received a notification letter from the Listing Qualifications Staff (the “Staff”) of the Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”) indicating that we are not in compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(b)(1) due to our failure to maintain a minimum of $2,500,000 in shareholders’ equity (the “Minimum Shareholders’ Equity Requirement”) or any alternatives to such requirement. In order to maintain our listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market, we submitted a plan of compliance addressing how we intended to regain compliance. On March 27, 2024, we received a delist determination letter from Nasdaq advising us that the Staff had determined to delist our securities from Nasdaq due to non-compliance with the Minimum Shareholders’ Equity Requirement, unless we timely request a hearing before the Nasdaq Hearings Panel (the “Panel”). We timely requested a hearing before the Panel.\n\nOn August 27, 2024, we received formal written notice from Nasdaq confirming that we have evidenced compliance with all applicable criteria for continued listing on Nasdaq as set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550, including the Minimum Shareholders’ Equity Requirement. In accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5815(d)(4)(B), we will remain subject to a panel monitor for equity compliance through August 27, 2025.\n\n_Hamas-Israel War_\n\nIn October 2023, Hamas terrorists infiltrated Israel’s southern border from the Gaza Strip and conducted a series of attacks on civilian and military targets. Hamas also launched extensive rocket attacks on the Israeli population and industrial centers located along Israel’s border with the Gaza Strip and in other areas within the State of Israel. These attacks resulted in thousands of deaths and injuries, and Hamas additionally kidnapped many Israeli civilians and soldiers. Following the attack, Israel’s security cabinet declared war against Hamas and commenced a military campaign against Hamas and these terrorist organizations in parallel continued rocket and terror attacks. Nevertheless, our clinical and business development activities remain on track. See also Risk Factors – “We conduct our operations in Israel. Conditions in Israel, including the recent attack by Hamas and other terrorist organizations and Israel’s war against them, may affect our operations”.\n\n_QIND Term Sheet_\n\nOn May 23, 2024, we announced that we have entered into a binding term sheet (as amended, the “Term Sheet”) with Quality Industrial Corp, a Nevada corporation traded on the OTC under the symbol QIND (“Target”), and Ilustrato Pictures International Inc., a Nevada corporation, providing for the potential acquisition of between 61% to 75% of the issued and outstanding shares of the Target’s share capital.\n\nOn November 11, 2024, the Company notified the Target that the Term Sheet is terminated.\n\n3\n\n**Results of Operations**\n\nThe table below provides our results of operations for the periods indicated.\n\nThree months ended September 30 | Nine months ended September 30  \n---|---  \n2024 | 2023 | 2024 | 2023  \n(dollars in thousands) | (dollars in thousands)  \nRevenues | 2,541 | 845 | 6,698 | 4,589  \nCost of revenues | 798 | 619 | 2,792 | 3,043  \nGross profit | 1,743 | 226 | 3,906 | 1,546  \nResearch and development expenses, net | 543 | 691 | 1,793 | 2,117  \nSales and marketing, net | 727 | 691 | 2,001 | 2,332  \nGeneral and administrative, net | 790 | 971 | 2,398 | 2,805  \nOther income, net | - | - | (163| ) | -  \nOperating loss | (317| ) | (2,127| ) | (2,123| ) | (5,708| )  \nInterest expenses | (246| ) | (161| ) | (590| ) | (512| )  \nOther Financial income (expenses), net | 52 | 1,421 | 138 | 1,865  \nNet Comprehensive Loss for the period | (511| ) | (867| ) | (2,575| ) | (4,355| )  \n  \n**Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024, Compared to Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023**\n\n** _Revenues_**\n\nOur revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2024 amounted to $2.54 million compared to $0.85 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase from the corresponding period was primarily attributable to an increase of $1.4 million of revenues generated from North America driven by volume increase and a renewal of a service and software contract and an increase of $0.3 million of revenues generated from Asia Pacific and Europe, the Middle East and Africa driven by volume increase.\n\nOur revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 amounted to $6.7 compared to $4.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase from the corresponding period was primarily attributable to an increase of $3.4 million in revenues generated from North America associated with volume increase and a renewal of a service and software contract offset by decrease of $1.3 million in revenues generated from Asia Pacific and Europe, the Middle East and Africa associated with completed projects in the prior year period.\n\n**_Cost of Revenues_**\n\nOur cost of revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2024, amounted to $0.8 million compared to $0.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase from the corresponding period was primarily attributable to the increase in revenues as well as change in the product mix as well as indirect costs not increasing significantly with revenues growing.\n\nOur cost of revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, amounted to $2.8 million compared to $3.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease from the corresponding period was primarily attributable to the change in regional mix of revenue of an increase in North America revenues, which are more profitable, and a decrease in Europe, Middle East and Africa revenues which are less profitable as well as indirect costs not increasing significantly with revenues growing.\n\n**_Research and Development Expenses_**\n\nOur research and development expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024, amounted to $0.5 million compared to $0.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease is primarily attributable to cost reduction measures taken.\n\nOur research and development expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, amounted to $1.7 million compared to $2.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease is primarily attributable to cost reduction measures taken.\n\n4\n\n** _Sales and Marketing Expenses_**\n\nOur sales and marketing expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024, amounted to $0.7 million compared to $0.7 for the three months ended September 30, 2023.\n\nOur sales and marketing expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 amounted to $2.0 million compared to $2.3 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was mainly due to cost reduction measures taken.\n\n**_General and Administrative Expenses_**\n\nOur general and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024, amounted to $0.8 million compared to $1.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease is driven by cost reduction measures taken.\n\nOur general and administrative expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, amounted to $2.4 million compared to $2.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease is driven by cost reduction measures taken.\n\n**_Other Income_**\n\nOur Other Income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 amounted to $163,000 compared to none for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase is driven by a government grant from the State of Israel associated with the Iron Swords war received during the second quarter of 2024.\n\n**_Operating Loss_**\n\nOur operating loss for the three months ended September 30, 2024, was $0.3 million, compared to an operating loss of $2.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was mainly due to the increase in revenues, improved gross margin due to regional revenue mix, and cost reduction measures taken, reducing operating expenses.\n\nOur operating loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was $2.1 million, compared to an operating loss of $5.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was mainly due to the increase in revenues, improved gross margin due to regional revenue mix, and cost reduction measures taken, reducing operating expenses.\n\n**_Financial Expenses, Net and Interest Expenses_**\n\nOur financial income, net was $52,000 million and our interest expense was $0.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to financial income, net of $1.4 million and including $0.2 million interest expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase is mainly due to financial income in the prior year from bank deposits and exchange rate differences not repeated in current period.\n\nOur financial income, net was $138,000 and our interest expense was $0.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to financial income, net of $1.9 million and interest expense of $0.5 million interest expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase is mainly due to financial income in the prior year from bank deposits and exchange rate differences not repeated in current period.\n\n**_Net Loss_**\n\nOur net loss for the three months ended September 30, 2024, was $0.5 million, compared to net loss of $0.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. This decrease was primarily due to the increase in revenues, improved gross margin due to regional revenue mix, and cost reduction measures taken, reducing operating expenses, partially offset by financial income in the prior year not repeating itself.\n\nOur net loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was $2.6 million, compared to net loss of $4.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This decrease was primarily due to the increase in revenues, improved gross margin due to regional revenue mix, and cost reduction measures taken, reducing operating expenses, partially offset by financial income in the prior year not repeating itself.\n\n5\n\n** _Non-GAAP Financial Measures_**\n\n(U.S. dollars in thousands) | Three months Ended September 30, 2024 | Three months Ended September 30, 2023 | Nine months Ended September 30, 2024 | Nine months Ended September 30, 2023  \n---|---|---|---|---  \nRevenues | $| 2,541 | $| 845 | $| 6,698 | $| 4,589  \nGAAP net loss | (511| ) | (867| ) | (2,575| ) | (4,355| )  \nInterest Expense | 246 | 161 | 590 | 512  \nOther Financial expenses (income), net | (52| ) | (1,421| ) | (138| ) | (1,865| )  \nTax Expense | 1 | 18 | 33 | 58  \nFixed asset depreciation expense | 3 | 7 | 10 | 20  \nStock based compensation | 80 | 106 | 259 | 298  \nResearch and development, capitalization | - | 113 | - | 371  \nOther one-time costs and expenses (income) | - | 120 | (189| ) | 343  \nNon-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA | (233| ) | (1,763| ) | (2,010| ) | (4,618| )  \nGAAP net loss margin | (20.11| )% | (102.60| )% | (38.44| )% | (94.90| )%  \nAdjusted EBITDA margin | (9.17| )% | (208.64| )% | (30.00| )% | (100.63| )%  \n  \n**Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information**\n\nNon-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are Non-GAAP financial measures. In addition to reporting financial results in accordance with GAAP, we provide Non-GAAP supplemental operating results adjusted for certain items, including: financial expenses, which are interest, financial instrument fair value adjustments, exchange rate differences of assets and liabilities, stock based compensation expenses, depreciation and amortization expense, tax expense, and impact of development expenses ahead of product launch. We adjust for the items listed above and show non-GAAP financial measures in all periods presented, unless the impact is clearly immaterial to our financial statements. When we calculate the tax effect of the adjustments, we include all current and deferred income tax expense commensurate with the adjusted measure of pre-tax profitability.\n\nWe utilize the adjusted results to review our ongoing operations without the effect of these adjustments but not for comparison to budgeted operating results.. We believe the supplemental adjusted results are useful to investors because they help them compare our results to previous periods and provide important insights into underlying trends in the business and how management oversees and optimizes our business operations on a day-to-day basis. We exclude the costs in calculating adjusted results to allow us and investors to evaluate the performance of the business based upon its expected ongoing operating structure. We believe the adjusted measures, accompanied by the disclosure of the costs of these programs, provides valuable insight to our financial performance. Adjusted results should be considered only in conjunction with results reported according to GAAP.\n\nFor the three months ended September 30 | For the nine months ended September 30  \n---|---  \n(U.S. dollars in thousands) | 2024 | 2023 | 2024 | 2023  \nRevenues | $| 2,541 | $| 845 | $| 6,698 | $| 4,589  \nNon-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA | (233| ) | (1,763| ) | (2,010| ) | (4,618| )  \nAs a percentage of revenues | (9.17| )% | (208.64| )% | (30.00| )% | (100.63| )%  \n  \n**Liquidity and Capital Resources**\n\nSince our inception, we have financed our operations primarily through the sale of equity securities, debt financing, convertible loans and royalty-bearing grants that we received from the Israel Innovation Authority. Our primary requirements for liquidity and capital are to finance working capital, capital expenditures and general corporate purposes.\n\nOur future capital requirements will be affected by many factors, including our revenue growth, the timing and extent of investments to support such growth, the expansion of sales and marketing activities, increases in general and administrative costs, repayment of principal of our existing credit line, working capital to support securing raw material supply and many other factors as described under “Risk Factors.”\n\n6\n\nTo the extent additional funds are necessary to meet our long-term liquidity needs as we continue to execute our business strategy, we anticipate that they will be obtained through the incurrence of additional indebtedness, additional equity financings or a combination of these potential sources of funds; however, such financing may not be available on favorable terms, or at all. In particular, the repercussions from the COVID 19 pandemic, as well as the war in Israel and the war between Russia and the Ukraine, has resulted in, and may continue to result in, significant disruption of global financial markets, reducing our ability to access capital.\n\nOn June 5, 2024, we entered into an inducement agreement with a certain holder of certain of our existing warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 999,670 shares of our common stock originally issued on May 8, 2023, with a five and one-half year term, at an exercise price of $2.75 per share (the “May 2023 Warrants”). Pursuant to the inducement agreement, the holder agreed to exercise for cash its May 2023 Warrants to purchase an aggregate of 999,670 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $2.75 per share, in consideration of our agreement to issue new common stock purchase warrants (the “June 2024 Warrants”), as described below, to purchase up to an aggregate of 1,999,340 shares of our common stock, at an exercise price of $2.00 per share. The closing of the June 2024 Warrant Inducement occurred on June 6, 2024, and resulted in gross proceeds from the exercise of the existing warrants by the holder to the Company of $3.0 million, before deducting placement agent fees and other offering expenses payable by the Company.\n\nOn June 30, 2024, we entered into an inducement letter with a holder of our June 2024 Warrants, to purchase up to an aggregate of 999,670 shares of the June 2024 Warrants, originally issued on June 6, 2024, with a twenty-four month term, at an exercise price of $2.00 per share. Pursuant to the inducement letter, the holder agreed to exercise for cash its warrants to purchase an aggregate of 999,670 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $2.00 per share, in consideration of our agreement to issue new common stock purchase warrants (the “July 2024 Warrants”), as descried below, to purchase up to an aggregate of 1,999,340 shares of our common stock, at an exercise price of $1.75 per share. The closing of the July 2024 Warrant Inducement occurred on July 2, 2024, and resulted in gross proceeds from the exercise of the existing warrants by the holder to the Company of $2.25 million, before deducting placement agent fees and other offering expenses payable by the Company.\n\nOn September 18, 2024, we filed a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (the “Registration Statement”). Pursuant to the Registration Statement, we may offer and sell securities having an aggregate public offering price of up to $50.0 million. In connection with the filing of the Registration Statement, on September 25, 2024, we entered into a sales agreement with H.C. Wainwright & Co. (the “Sales Agent”), pursuant to which we may issue and sell shares of our common stock for an aggregate offering price of up to $3.4 million under an at-the-market offering program (the “ATM”), which is included in the $50.0 million of securities that may be offered pursuant to the Registration Statement. Pursuant to the ATM, we will pay the Sales Agent a commission rate of up to 3.0% of the gross proceeds from the sale of any shares of our common stock. We are not obligated to make any sales of shares under the ATM. As of September 30, 2024, we have sold 227,939 shares of our common stock and received approximately $317,000 in net proceeds under the ATM.\n\nAs discussed in Note 1(c) to the condensed consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Quarterly report on Form 10-Q, we have incurred significant losses and negative cash flows from operations and incurred losses of $2.5 million and $6.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and the year ended December 31, 2023, respectively. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and the year ended December 31, 2023, we had negative cash flows from operations of $4.7 million and $6.5 million, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, we had negative working capital and an accumulated deficit of $42.2 million.\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, we had cash on hand (including short term deposits and restricted bank deposits) of approximately $2.3 million and long-term deposits, restricted bank deposits and restricted cash of $300,000. We monitor our cash flow projections on a current basis and take active measures to obtain the funding we require to continue our operations, as well as make adjustments to our cost structure that were done year to date. However, these cash flow projections are subject to various uncertainties concerning their fulfilment, such as the ability to increase revenues by attracting and expanding our customer base or reducing cost structure. If we are not successful in generating sufficient cash flow or completing additional financing, then we will need to execute additional cost reduction actions that have been planned. Our transition to profitable operations is dependent on generating a level of revenue adequate to support our cost structure. We expect to fund operations using cash on hand, through operational cash flows and raising additional proceeds. There are no assurances, however, that we will be able to generate the revenue necessary to support our cost structure or that we will be successful in obtaining the level of financing necessary for our operations. Management has evaluated the significance of these conditions and has determined that we do not have sufficient resources to meet our operating obligations for at least one year from the issuance date of these condensed consolidated financial statements. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. These condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business, and do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\n\n7\n\n _Cash Flows_\n\nThe table below, for the periods indicated, provides selected cash flow information:\n\n(U.S. dollars in thousands) | Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 | Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023  \n---|---|---  \nNet cash used in operating activities | $| (4,781| ) | $| (5,194| )  \nNet cash provided by (used in) investing activities | 197 | 1,430  \nNet cash provided by financing activities | 1,624 | 2,586  \nNet change in cash | $| (2,974| ) | $| (1,190| )  \n  \nAs of September 30, 2024, we had cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash of $2.5 million compared to $3.1 million of cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash as of September 30, 2023.\n\nCash used in operating activities amounted to $4.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $5.2 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in cash used in operating activities was mainly due to cost reduction measures taken.\n\nNet cash provided by investing activities was $0.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to cash used in investing activities of $1.4 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease from the corresponding period was mainly due to the reduction in short-term bank deposits.\n\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $1.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $2.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease is related to the repayment of long-term loan, offset by funds raised from an investor warrant exercise. See notes 2 to the condensed consolidated financial statements\n\n**Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements**\n\nWe do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements or relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities.\n\n**Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates**\n\nOur condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the applicable periods. We evaluate our estimates, assumptions and judgments on an ongoing basis. Our estimates, assumptions and judgments are based on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different assumptions and judgments would change the estimates used in the preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements, which, in turn, could change the results from those reported.\n\nOur management’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements, which we have prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\n\nOur significant accounting policies include revenue from contracts with customers which is more fully described in the notes to our condensed consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Quarterly report on Form 10-Q and our annual financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023, including the footnotes, for a description of our significant accounting policies. We believe that these accounting policies discussed are critical to our financial results and to the understanding of our past and future performance, as these policies relate to the more significant areas involving management’s estimates and assumptions. We consider an accounting estimate to be critical if: (1) it requires us to make assumptions because information was not available at the time or it included matters that were highly uncertain at the time we were making our estimate; and (2) changes in the estimate could have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations.\n\n8\n\n**Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk.**\n\nNot required for a smaller reporting company.\n\n**Item 4. Controls and Procedures.**\n\n**Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures**\n\nWe continued to conduct ongoing evaluation of the effectiveness of our “disclosure controls and procedures”, as defined by Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of Exchange Act, as of September 30, 2024, the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report. This evaluation, which was performed under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”), is performed to determine whether our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including our CEO and CFO, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and are effective to provide reasonable assurance that such information is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the SEC’s rules and forms. There are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any system of disclosure controls and procedures. Disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and effectively operated, can only provide reasonable assurance of achieving their control objectives.\n\nBased upon that evaluation, our CEO and CFO concluded our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q due to the material weakness discussed below.\n\n**_Management’s report on internal control over financial reporting_**\n\nManagement is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the consolidated financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with GAAP.\n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, our internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect all misstatements, including the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of controls or fraud. Effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate over time.\n\nUnder the supervision and with the participation of the CEO and the CFO, management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2024. We performed an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework described in  _Internal Control - Integrated Framework_ (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”). Based on this evaluation, our management concluded that we did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2024 given the existence of the previously identified material weakness described below having not been remediated as of the last day of the period covered by this Quarterly Report. \n\n**Material Weakness**\n\nWe have identified one material weakness in our design and operation of our internal control over financial reporting in connection with the preparation of our financial remediated as of September 30, 2024.\n\nA material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of a company’s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. The Company’s management, including our CEO and CFO, concluded that, as of September 30, 2024:\n\n9\n\nWe lacked a sufficient complement of professionals with an appropriate level of accounting knowledge, training and experience to maintain appropriate segregation of duties in our finance and accounting functions.\n\nOur independent registered public accounting firm will not be required to opine on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act until we are no longer an “emerging growth company” as defined in the JOBS Act.\n\n**_Remediation Plan and Status_**\n\nWe have taken and intend to continue to take actions to remediate the material weakness described above. To remediate this material weakness, we continue to map, document and test our internal controls (recently, with the assistance of a third-party accounting firm with specific expertise in SOX compliance), and accordingly, we continued to make progress in our internal controls plan. Among other procedures, management has executed the following remedial actions:\n\n● | Hired new financial experts and increasing the number of financial personnel.  \n---|---  \n● | Continued to map, document and test our internal controls, with the assistance of a third-party accounting firm with specific expertise in SOX compliance.  \n---|---  \n● | Implemented new control procedures over certain areas identified as requiring enhancement in order to address the lack of a sufficient number of finance personnel to allow for adequate segregation of duties.  \n---|---  \n  \nIn addition to the actions underway, we continue to add enhancements to our internal controls over financial reporting in 2024. Additional remedial actions include:\n\n● | Maintain or increase the level and design of segregation of duties, including maintaining or growing the quality and number of finance personnel  \n---|---  \n● | Continue to document and test annually our internal control over financial reporting  \n---|---  \n● | Continue engagement with an outside accounting firm with specific SOX and Internal Control expertise  \n---|---  \n● | Continued hiring of additional accounting, information technology, and internal controls resources who possess public company accounting, auditing and reporting expertise  \n---|---  \n  \nThe actions we are taking are subject to ongoing senior management review, as well as oversight of the audit committee of our Board. We also may conclude that additional measures may be required to remediate the material weaknesses or determine to modify the remediation plans described above. We will not be able to fully remediate this material weakness until these steps have been completed and have been operating effectively. We will continue to monitor the design and effectiveness of these and other processes, procedures, and controls and make any further changes management deems appropriate.\n\nIn addition to the items noted above, as we continue to evaluate, remediate and improve our internal control over financial reporting, executive management may elect to implement additional measures to address control deficiencies or may determine that the remediation efforts described above require modification. Executive management, in consultation with and at the direction of our Audit Committee and an expert outside consultant, will continue to assess the control environment and the above-mentioned efforts to remediate the underlying causes of the identified material weakness.\n\nAlthough we plan to complete this remediation process as quickly as possible, we are unable, at this time to estimate how long it will take; and our efforts may not be successful in remediating the deficiencies or material weaknesses.\n\nNotwithstanding the material weakness set forth above, based on the performance of additional procedures by management designed to ensure reliability of financial reporting, the Company’s management has concluded that the consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, fairly present, in all material respects, the Company’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows as of the dates, and for the periods presented, in conformity with GAAP.\n\n**Changes in Internal Controls over Financial Reporting**\n\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\n\n10\n\n**Part II - Other Information**\n\n**Item 1. Legal Proceedings.**\n\nFrom time to time, we are involved in various claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business. To the knowledge of our management, there are no legal proceedings currently pending against us which we believe would have a material effect on our business, financial position or results of operations and, to the best of our knowledge, there are no such legal proceedings contemplated or threatened.\n\n**Item 1A. Risk Factors.**\n\nExcept as set forth below in this Item 1A and the Risk Factors included in our previous filings made with the SEC, there have been no material changes to our risk factors from those disclosed in “Part I. Item 1A. Risk Factors” in the Form 10-K filed with the SEC on March 26, 2024.\n\n**_Conditions in the Middle East and in Israel, where our research and development facilities are located, may harm our operations._**\n\nOur office where we conduct our research and development, operations, sales outside the Americas, and administration activities, is located in Israel. Many of our employees are residents of Israel. Most of our officers and directors are residents of Israel. Since the establishment of the State of Israel in 1948, a number of armed conflicts have taken place between Israel and its neighboring countries, and between Israel and the Hamas (an Islamist militia and political group in the Gaza Strip) and Hezbollah (an Islamist militia and political group in Lebanon).\n\nIn particular, in October 2023, Hamas terrorists infiltrated Israel’s southern border from the Gaza Strip and conducted a series of attacks on civilian and military targets. Hamas also launched extensive rocket attacks on the Israeli population and industrial centers located along Israel’s border with the Gaza Strip and in other areas within the State of Israel. These attacks resulted in thousands of deaths and injuries, and Hamas additionally kidnapped many Israeli civilians and soldiers. Following the attack, Israel’s security cabinet declared war against Hamas and commenced a military campaign against Hamas and Hezbollah and these terrorist organizations in parallel continued rocket and terror attacks. As a result of the events of October 7, 2023 whereby Hamas terrorists invaded southern Israel and launched thousands of rockets in a widespread terrorist attack on Israel, the Israeli government declared that the country was at war and the Israeli military began to call-up reservists for active duty. As of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, we have not been impacted by any absences of personnel at our service providers or counterparties located in Israel. Military service call ups that result in absences of personnel from us for an extended period of time may materially and adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. As of the date of this Quarterly Report, we currently have 42 full-time employees, with 33 employees located in Israel and 9 employees located outside of Israel.\n\nSince the war broke out on October 7, 2023, our operations have not been adversely affected by this situation, and we have not experienced any material disruptions to our operations. We have the ability, if necessary, to shift our manufacturing from Israel to other countries where we have business partners, and we have not had customers in Israel in the last year. However, the intensity and duration of the war in the Middle East is difficult to predict at this stage, as are such war’s economic implications on the Company’s business and operations and on Israel’s economy in general. if the war in the other fronts, such as Lebanon, Syria and the West Bank expands further, our operations may be adversely affected.\n\nIn addition, since the commencement of these events, there have been continued hostilities along Israel’s northern border with Lebanon (with the Hezbollah terror organization) and southern border (with the Houthi movement in Yemen). It is possible that hostilities with Hezbollah in Lebanon will escalate, and that other terrorist organizations, including Palestinian military organizations in the West Bank as well as other hostile countries will join the hostilities. Such clashes may escalate in the future into a greater regional conflict. In addition, Iran recently launched a direct attack on Israel involved hundreds of drones and missiles, and has threatened to continue to attack Israel and is widely believed to be developing nuclear weapons. Iran is also believed to have a strong influence among extremist groups in the region, such as Hamas in Gaza, Hezbollah in Lebanon, the Houthi movement in Yemen and various rebel militia groups in Syria. These situations may potentially escalate in the future to more violent events which may affect Israel and us. Any armed conflicts, terrorist activities or political instability in the region could adversely affect business conditions, could harm our results of operations and could make it more difficult for us to raise capital. Parties with whom we do business may decline to travel to Israel during periods of heightened unrest or tension, forcing us to make alternative arrangements when necessary in order to meet our business partners face to face. In addition, the political and security situation in Israel may result in parties with whom we have agreements involving performance in Israel claiming that they are not obligated to perform their commitments under those agreements pursuant to force majeure provisions in such agreements. Further, in the past, the State of Israel and Israeli companies have been subjected to economic boycotts. Several countries still restrict business with the State of Israel and with Israeli companies. These restrictive laws and policies may have an adverse impact on our operating results, financial condition or the expansion of our business.\n\nAny hostilities involving Israel or the interruption or curtailment of trade between Israel and its trading partners could adversely affect our operations and results of operations. In recent years, the hostilities involved missile strikes against civilian targets in various parts of Israel, including areas in which our employees and some of our consultants are located, and negatively affected business conditions in Israel.\n\nOur commercial insurance does not cover losses that may occur as a result of events associated with the security situation in the Middle East. Although the Israeli government currently covers the reinstatement value of direct damages that are caused by terrorist attacks or acts of war, we cannot assure you that this government coverage will be maintained. Any losses or damages incurred by us could have a material adverse effect on our business. Any armed conflicts or political instability in the region would likely negatively affect business conditions and could harm our results of operations. To-date, we have received Israeli government war related support funding of approximately $100,000.\n\n11\n\nFinally, political conditions within Israel may affect our operations. Israel has held five general elections between 2019 and 2022, and prior to October 2023, the Israeli government pursued extensive changes to Israel’s judicial system, which sparked extensive political debate and unrest. To date, these initiatives have been substantially put on hold. Actual or perceived political instability in Israel or any negative changes in the political environment, may individually or in the aggregate adversely affect the Israeli economy and, in turn, our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\n\n**_If we fail to comply with the continued listing requirements of the Nasdaq Capital Market, our common stock may be delisted and the price of our common stock and our ability to access the capital markets could be negatively impacted._**\n\nNasdaq has established certain standards for the continued listing of a security on the Nasdaq Capital Market. The standards for continued listing include, among other things, that the minimum bid price for the listed securities not fall below $1.00 per share for a period of 30 consecutive trading days and that we maintain a minimum of $2,500,000 in shareholders’ equity.\n\nWe have in the past, and may in the future, be unable to comply with certain of the listing standards that we are required to meet to maintain the listing of our ordinary shares on Nasdaq.\n\nFor instance, on August 25, 2023, we received a notification letter from the Listing Qualifications Staff (the “Staff”) of the Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”) indicating that we are not in compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(b)(1) due to our failure to maintain a minimum of $2,500,000 in shareholders’ equity (the “Minimum Shareholders’ Equity Requirement”) or any alternatives to such requirement. In order to maintain our listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market, we submitted a plan of compliance addressing how we intended to regain compliance\n\nOn August 27, 2024, we received formal written notice from Nasdaq confirming that we have evidenced compliance with all applicable criteria for continued listing on Nasdaq as set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550, including the Minimum Shareholders’ Equity Requirement. In accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5815(d)(4)(B), we will remain subject to a panel monitor for equity compliance through August 27, 2025.\n\nIn addition, on May 20, 2024, the Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”) notified the Company that it was not in compliance with the minimum bid price requirements set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2), which requires the Company’s common stock to maintain a minimum bid price of $1.00 per share. On June 20, 2024, the Company received a letter from Nasdaq that, for the 10 consecutive business days from June 5, 2024 to June 28, 2024, the closing bid price of the Company’s common stock had been at $1.00 per share or greater. Accordingly, the Company has regained compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) and Nasdaq considers the prior bid price deficiency matter now closed.\n\nIf we fail to satisfy the continued listing requirements of Nasdaq, such as minimum stockholders’ equity requirements or minimum bid price requirements, Nasdaq may take steps to delist our shares of common stock. Such a delisting would have a negative effect on the price of our shares of common stock, impair the ability to sell or purchase our shares of common stock when persons wish to do so, and any delisting materially adversely affect our ability to raise capital or pursue strategic restructuring, refinancing or other transactions on acceptable terms, or at all. Delisting from Nasdaq could also have other negative results, including the potential loss of institutional investor interest and fewer business development opportunities, as well as a limited amount of news and analyst coverage of us. Delisting could also result in a determination that our shares of common stock are a “penny stock,” which would require brokers trading in our shares of common stock to adhere to more stringent rules, possibly resulting in a reduced level of trading activity in the secondary market for our shares of common stock. In the event of a delisting, we would attempt to take actions to restore our compliance with Nasdaq’s listing requirements, but we can provide no assurance that any such action taken by us would allow our shares of common stock to become listed again, stabilize the market price or improve the liquidity of our securities, prevent our shares of common stock from dropping below the Nasdaq minimum bid price requirement or prevent future non-compliance with Nasdaq’s listing requirements.\n\n12\n\n**Item 2.

Actelis Networks, Inc. (hereafter -the Company) was established in 1998, under the laws of the state of Delaware. The Company has a wholly-owned\nsubsidiary in Israel, Actelis Networks Israel Ltd. (hereafter – the Subsidiary). The Company is engaged in the design, development, manufacturing, and\nmarketing of cyber hardened, hybrid fiber, networking solutions for IoT and Telecommunication governmental agencies and companies. The Company’s\ncustomers include governmental agencies, providers of telecommunication services, enterprises as well as resellers of the Company’s products. On May 12,\n2022, the Company accepted a notification of effectiveness from the SEC, and on May 17, 2022, completed its IPO. The Company’s Common Stock is listed\non the NASDAQ.\nb. The Company has incurred significant losses and negative cash flows from operations. Net loss was $2,575 and $4,355 for the nine months ended September\n30, 2024, and September 30, 2023, respectively. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and September 30, 2023, the Company had negative cash\nflows from operations of $4,781 and $5,194, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, the Company’s accumulated deficit was $42,263. The Company has\nfunded its operations to date through equity and debt financing and has cash on hand (including restricted cash equivalents) of $2,541 restricted bank deposits\nof $91 as of September 30, 2024. The Company monitors its cash flow projections on a current basis and takes active measures to obtain the funding it\nrequires to continue its operations. However, these cash flow projections are subject to various uncertainties concerning their fulfilment such as the ability to\nincrease revenues by attracting and expanding its customer base or reducing cost structure. If the Company is not successful in generating sufficient cash flow\nor completing additional financing, including debt refinancing which shall release restricted cash, then it will need to execute a new cost reduction plan in\naddition to previous cost reduction plans that were executed so far. The Company’s transition to profitable operations is dependent on generating a level of\nrevenue adequate to support its cost structure. The Company expects to fund operations using cash on hand, through operational cash flows and raising\nadditional proceeds. There are no assurances, however, that the Company will be able to generate the revenue necessary to support its cost structure or that it\nwill be successful in obtaining the level of financing necessary for its operations. Management has evaluated the significance of these conditions and has\ndetermined that the Company does not have sufficient resources to meet its operating obligations for at least one year from the issuance date of these\ncondensed consolidated financial statements. These conditions raise substantial doubt as to the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. These\nconsolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern and do not include any adjustments that\nmight result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\nc. On October 7, 2023, Hamas launched a series of attacks on civilian and military targets in Southern and Central Israel, to which the Israel Defense Forces\nhave responded. In addition, both Hezbollah and the Houthi movement have attacked military and civilian targets in Northern Israel, to which Israel has\nresponded, including through increased air and ground operations in Lebanon. In addition, the Houthi movement has attacked international shipping lanes in\nthe red sea. Further, on April 2024, and on October 2024, Iran launched a series of drone and missile strikes against Israel, to which Israel has responded. To\ndate our operations and financial results have not been materially affected. The Company continues to monitor its ongoing activities and will make\nadjustments in its business if needed, including updating any estimates or judgments impacting its financial statements as appropriate, while supporting the\nsafety and well-being of its employees. It is currently not possible to predict the effects of such conflicts and its impact on the Company’s business, operations\nor financial conditions. We continue to monitor political and military developments closely and examine the consequences for our business, results of\noperations and financial condition.\nF-10\nACTELIS NETWORKS, INC.\nNOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nU.S. DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS\nNOTE 1 – GENERAL: (continued):\nOn November 21, 2023 we applied for an Israeli government grant associated with the Swords of Iron war declared by the State of Israel following the\nOctober 7, 2023 attack by Hamas.\nThe Company was found eligible and received an amount of $163 which was recognized as other income during the second quarter in 2024. The grant is not\nrepayable.\nd. On August 25, 2023, the Company received a notification letter from the Nasdaq Staff indicating that the company was not in compliance with Nasdaq\nListing Rule 5550(b)(1) due to the company's failure to meet the Minimum Shareholders’ Equity Requirement or any alternatives to such requirement. In\norder to maintain listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market, the company has submitted a plan of compliance addressing how we intended to regain compliance.\nThe company had until February 21, 2024 to evidence compliance with the Minimum Shareholders’ Equity Requirement.\nOn March 27, 2024, the Company received a delist determination letter (the “Delist Letter”) from the Staff advising the Company that the Staff had\ndetermined to delist the Company’s securities from Nasdaq due to its non-compliance with the Equity Rule unless the Company timely requests a hearing\nbefore the Nasdaq Hearings Panel (the “Panel”). The Company timely requested a hearing before the Panel. Following the hearing, on June 10, 2024, the\nPanel granted the Company’s request for continued listing subject to the Company evidencing compliance with the Minimum Shareholders’ Equity\nRequirement by August 30, 2024.\nOn August 27, 2024, the Company received formal written notice from the Nasdaq Staff confirming that the Company has evidenced compliance with all\napplicable criteria for continued listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market as set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550. In accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule\n5815(d)(4)(B), the Company will remain subject to Panel monitor for equity compliance through August 27, 2025.\nNOTE 2 – SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES:\na. Basis of presentation\nThe accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Article 10 of the Securities and\nExchange Commission (“SEC”)’s Regulation S-X. As permitted under those rules, certain footnotes and other financial information that are normally required\nby generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“U.S. GAAP”) can be condensed or omitted. These financial statements reflect all\nadjustments, which include only normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair statement of its financial position as of and for the periods presented.\nThese condensed consolidated financial statements and notes thereto are unaudited and should be read in conjunction with the Company’s audited financial\nstatements for the year ended December 31, 2023. The results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, are not necessarily\nindicative of results that could be expected for the 2024 fiscal year or any other interim period or for any other future year. All intercompany transactions and\nbalances have been eliminated in consolidation.\nb. Use of estimates in preparation of financial statements\nThe preparation of the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates,\njudgments and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. The\nCompany evaluates on an ongoing basis its assumptions, including those related to contingencies, fair values of financial instruments, inventory write-offs, as\nwell as in estimates used in applying the revenue recognition policy. The Company’s management believes that the estimates, judgments, and assumptions\nused are reasonable based upon information available at the time they are made. These estimates, judgments and assumptions can affect the reported amounts\nof assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, and the\nreported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nF-11\nACTELIS NETWORKS, INC.\nNOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nU.S. DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS\nNOTE 2 – SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES: (continued):\nc. Fair value of financial instruments\nFair value measurements are classified and disclosed in one of the following three categories:\nLevel 1 – Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities.\nLevel 2 – Quoted prices in markets that are not active, or inputs which are observable, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the asset or\nliability.\nLevel 3 – Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.\nThe Company measured the fair value of the warrants it issued (see note 5) based on Level 3 inputs, and the warrants liability amounted to $8 as September\n30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, are presented in the Other current liabilities in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets.\nAs of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, the fair values of the Company’s cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and cash equivalents, short\nand long-term deposits, trade receivables, trade payables, long-term loan, restricted bank deposits, Severance pay fund and other current assets approximated\nthe carrying values of these instruments presented in the Company’s condensed consolidated balance sheets because of their nature.\nd. Concentration of risk\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject the Company to significant concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, restricted\ncash, and trade receivables. Cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash are placed with banks and financial institutions in the United States and Israel.\nManagement believes that the financial institutions that hold the Company’s investments are financially sound and, accordingly, present minimal credit risk\nwith respect to those investments.\nThe Company’s trade receivables are derived primarily from telecommunication operators, the Company’s reseller customers and enterprises located mainly\nin the United States, Europe, and Asia.\nCredit risk with respect to trade receivables exists to the full extent of the amounts presented in the condensed consolidated financial statements. Management\nmakes judgments as to its ability to collect outstanding accounts receivable and provides allowances for the applicable portion of accounts receivable when\ncollection becomes doubtful.\nManagement provides allowances based upon a specific review of all significant outstanding invoices, analysis of its historical collection experience, and\ncurrent economic trends. If the historical data used to calculate the allowance for credit losses does not reflect the Company’s future ability to collect\noutstanding accounts receivable, additional provisions for credit losses may be needed, and the future results of operations could be materially affected.\nF-12\nACTELIS NETWORKS, INC.\nNOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nU.S. DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS\nNOTE 2 – SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES: (continued):\nThe Company has customers balances representing 10% or more of Trade receivables as follows:\n1) Customer A represented 0% and 30% of the Company Trade receivables balance as of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, respectively.\n2) Customer B represented 4.5 % and 11% of the Company Trade receivables balance as of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, respectively.\n3) Customer C represented0 % and 11% of the Company Trade receivables balance as of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, respectively.\n4) Customer D represented 38% and 0% of the Company Trade receivables balance as of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, respectively.\n5) Customer E represented 21.4% and 0% of the Company Trade receivables balance as of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, respectively.\nThe Company does not see any credit risk regarding the major trade receivable balance.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nAccounting Pronouncements effective in future periods\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-07 Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures. The ASU\nimproves reportable segments disclosure requirements, primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. The ASU is effective for\nfiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted. The\nCompany is evaluating the potential impact of this guidance on its consolidated financial statements.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09 Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures. The ASU improves the transparency of income tax disclosures\nby requiring (1) consistent categories and greater disaggregation of information in the rate reconciliation and (2) income taxes paid disaggregated by\njurisdiction. It also includes certain other amendments to improve the effectiveness of income tax disclosures. For public business entities, the ASU is\neffective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024. The Company is evaluating the potential impact of this guidance on its consolidated financial\nstatements.\nNOTE 3 – INVENTORIES:\nSeptember 30, December 31,\n2024 2023\nRaw materials 1,344 757\nFinished goods 1,028 1,769\n2,372 2,526\nInventory write-downs amounted to $39 and $132 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively and $14 and $35 during the\nthree months ended September 30 2024 and 2023, respectively. Inventories write-downs are recorded in cost of revenues.\nNOTE 4 – LOANS:\na. As a result of the COVID pandemic, the US and Israeli governments offered different programs of financial aid. The Company participated in the following\nprograms:\nOn July 1, 2020, the Company received Economic Injury Disaster Loan (the “EIDL Loan”) from an American Bank under the Small Business Administration\nCOVID19 Program in the total of $150.

Our unique portfolio of hybrid fiber, environmentally hardened aggregation switches, high\ndensity Ethernet devices, advanced management software and cyber-protection capabilities, unlocks the hidden value of essential networks, delivering safer connectivity for\nrapid, cost-effective deployment.\nOur networking solutions use a combination of newly deployed fiber infrastructure and existing copper and coaxial lines which our patented technology can upgrade\nto Fiber-grade to jointly create what we believe to be a highly cost-effective, secure and quick-to-deploy network. Our patent protected hybrid fiber networking solutions\ndeliver excellent communication over fiber to locations that may be easy to reach with new fiber. However, for locations that are difficult, or too costly to reach with fiber, we\ncan upgrade existing copper lines to deliver cyber-hardened, high-speed connectivity without needing to replace the existing copper infrastructure with new fiber. We believe\nthat such hybrid fiber-copper networking solution has distinct advantages in most real-life installations, while providing significant budget savings and accelerating deployment\nof modern IoT networks, as based on our experience, most IoT projects have challenging, hard to reach with fiber locations which may explode such projects’ timeline and\nbudgets. We believe that our solutions can provide connectivity over either fiber or copper with speeds of up to multi-Gigabit communication, while supporting Fiber-grade\nreliability and quality.\nA primary focus of ours is to provide our customers with a cyber-secure network solution. We currently offer Triple-Shield protection of data delivered with coding,\nscrambling and encryption of the network traffic. We also provide secure, encrypted access to our network management software, and are working to further enhance system-\nlevel and device-level software protection. We are also working to introduce additional capabilities for network-wide cyber protection software as an additional SW and license-\nbased service.\nWhen high speed, long reach, reliable and secure connectivity is required, network operators usually resort to using wireline communication over physical\ncommunication lines such as fiber, coax and copper, rather than wireless communication that is more limited in performance, reliability, reach and security. However, new fiber\nwireline infrastructure is costly to deploy, involves lengthy civil works to install, and, based on our internal calculations, often accounts for more than 50% of total cost of\nownership (ToC) and time to deploy wide-area IoT projects.\n2\nProviding new fiber connectivity to hard-to-reach locations is especially costly and time-consuming, often requiring permits for boring, trenching, and right-of-way,\nsometimes done over many miles. Connecting such hard-to-reach locations may cause significant delays and budget overruns in IoT projects. Our solutions aim to solve these\nchallenges by instantly enhancing performance of such existing copper and coax infrastructure to fiber-grade performance, through the use of advanced signal processing an\nunique, patented network architecture, without the need to run new fiber to hard-to-reach locations; thus, effectively accelerating deployment of many IoT projects, as we\nestimate, sometimes from many months to only days. The result for the network owner isa hybrid network that optimizes the use of both new Fiber (where available) as well as\nupgraded, fiber-grade copper and coax that is now modernized, digitized and cyber-hardened. This unique hybrid network approach is making IoT projects often significantly\nmore affordable, fast to deploy and predictable to plan and budget.\nIn addition, our solutions can also provide power over existing copper and coax lines to remotely power up network elements and IoT components connected to them\n(like cameras, small cell and Wi-Fi base stations sensors etc.). Connecting power lines to millions of IoT locations can be costly and very time consuming as well (similar to\ndata connectivity, for the same reason-need for civil works). By offering the ability to combine power delivery over the same existing copper and coax lines that we use for\nhigh-speed data, we believe our solutions are solving yet another important challenge in connecting hard-to-reach locations. We believe that combining communication and\npower over the same existing lines is particularly important to help connect many fifth generation, or 5G, small cells and Wi-Fi base stations, as high cost of connectivity and\npower is often slowing their deployment.\nSince our inception, our business was focused on serving telecommunication service providers, also known as Telcos, to provide connectivity for enterprises and\nresidential customers. Our products and solutions have been deployed with more than 100 telecommunication service providers worldwide, in enterprise, residential and mobile\nbase station connectivity applications. In recent years, as we have further developed our technology and introduced additional products, we turned our focus on serving the\nwide-area IoT markets. Our operations are focused on our fast-growing IoT business, while maintaining our commitment to our existing Telco customers. In 2023, we\nintroduced new product offering, some of which could serve both the IoT markets and our Telco customers.\nRecent Developments\nNasdaq Listing Compliance\nOn August 25, 2023, we received a notification letter from the Listing Qualifications Staff (the “Staff”) of the Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”) indicating that\nwe are not in compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(b)(1) due to our failure to maintain a minimum of $2,500,000 in shareholders’ equity (the “Minimum Shareholders’\nEquity Requirement”) or any alternatives to such requirement. In order to maintain our listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market, we submitted a plan of compliance addressing\nhow we intended to regain compliance. On March 27, 2024, we received a delist determination letter from Nasdaq advising us that the Staff had determined to delist our\nsecurities from Nasdaq due to non-compliance with the Minimum Shareholders’ Equity Requirement, unless we timely request a hearing before the Nasdaq Hearings Panel (the\n“Panel”). We timely requested a hearing before the Panel.\nOn August 27, 2024, we received formal written notice from Nasdaq confirming that we have evidenced compliance with all applicable criteria for continued listing on\nNasdaq as set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550, including the Minimum Shareholders’ Equity Requirement. In accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5815(d)(4)(B), we will\nremain subject to a panel monitor for equity compliance through August 27, 2025.\nHamas-Israel War\nIn October 2023, Hamas terrorists infiltrated Israel’s southern border from the Gaza Strip and conducted a series of attacks on civilian and military targets. Hamas also\nlaunched extensive rocket attacks on the Israeli population and industrial centers located along Israel’s border with the Gaza Strip and in other areas within the State of Israel.\nThese attacks resulted in thousands of deaths and injuries, and Hamas additionally kidnapped many Israeli civilians and soldiers. Following the attack, Israel’s security cabinet\ndeclared war against Hamas and commenced a military campaign against Hamas and these terrorist organizations in parallel continued rocket and terror attacks. Nevertheless,\nour clinical and business development activities remain on track. See also Risk Factors – “We conduct our operations in Israel. Conditions in Israel, including the recent attack\nby Hamas and other terrorist organizations and Israel’s war against them, may affect our operations”.\nQIND Term Sheet\nOn May 23, 2024, we announced that we have entered into a binding term sheet (as amended, the “Term Sheet”) with Quality Industrial Corp, a Nevada corporation\ntraded on the OTC under the symbol QIND (“Target”), and Ilustrato Pictures International Inc., a Nevada corporation, providing for the potential acquisition of between 61% to\n75% of the issued and outstanding shares of the Target’s share capital.\nOn November 11, 2024, the Company notified the Target that the Term Sheet is terminated.\n3\nResults of Operations\nThe table below provides our results of operations for the periods indicated.\nThree months ended Nine months ended\nSeptember 30 September 30\n2024 2023 2024 2023\n(dollars in thousands) (dollars in thousands)\nRevenues 2,541 845 6,698 4,589\nCost of revenues 798 619 2,792 3,043\nGross profit 1,743 226 3,906 1,546\nResearch and development expenses, net 543 691 1,793 2,117\nSales and marketing, net 727 691 2,001 2,332\nGeneral and administrative, net 790 971 2,398 2,805\nOther income, net - - (163) -\nOperating loss (317) (2,127) (2,123) (5,708)\nInterest expenses (246) (161) (590) (512)\nOther Financial income (expenses), net 52 1,421 138 1,865\nNet Comprehensive Loss for the period (511) (867) (2,575) (4,355)\nThree and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024, Compared to Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023\nRevenues\nOur revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2024 amounted to $2.54 million compared to $0.85 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023.\nThe increase from the corresponding period was primarily attributable to an increase of $1.4 million of revenues generated from North America driven by volume increase and\na renewal of a service and software contract and an increase of $0.3 million of revenues generated from Asia Pacific and Europe, the Middle East and Africa driven by volume\nincrease.\nOur revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 amounted to $6.7 compared to $4.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase\nfrom the corresponding period was primarily attributable to an increase of $3.4 million in revenues generated from North America associated with volume increase and a\nrenewal of a service and software contract offset by decrease of $1.3 million in revenues generated from Asia Pacific and Europe, the Middle East and Africa associated with\ncompleted projects in the prior year period.\nCost of Revenues\nOur cost of revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2024, amounted to $0.8 million compared to $0.6 million for the three months ended September 30,\n2023. The increase from the corresponding period was primarily attributable to the increase in revenues as well as change in the product mix as well as indirect costs not\nincreasing significantly with revenues growing.\nOur cost of revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, amounted to $2.8 million compared to $3.0 million for the nine months ended September 30,\n2023. The decrease from the corresponding period was primarily attributable to the change in regional mix of revenue of an increase in North America revenues, which are\nmore profitable, and a decrease in Europe, Middle East and Africa revenues which are less profitable as well as indirect costs not increasing significantly with revenues\ngrowing.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nOur research and development expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024, amounted to $0.5 million compared to $0.7 million for the three months\nended September 30, 2023. The decrease is primarily attributable to cost reduction measures taken.\nOur research and development expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, amounted to $1.7 million compared to $2.1 million for the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023. The decrease is primarily attributable to cost reduction measures taken.\n4\nSales and Marketing Expenses\nOur sales and marketing expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024, amounted to $0.7 million compared to $0.7 for the three months ended September\n30, 2023.\nOur sales and marketing expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 amounted to $2.0 million compared to $2.3 for the nine months ended September 30,\n2023. The decrease was mainly due to cost reduction measures taken.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nOur general and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024, amounted to $0.8 million compared to $1.0 million for the three months\nended September 30, 2023. The decrease is driven by cost reduction measures taken.\nOur general and administrative expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, amounted to $2.4 million compared to $2.8 million for the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023. The decrease is driven by cost reduction measures taken.\nOther Income\nOur Other Income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 amounted to $163,000 compared to none for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The\nincrease is driven by a government grant from the State of Israel associated with the Iron Swords war received during the second quarter of 2024.\nOperating Loss\nOur operating loss for the three months ended September 30, 2024, was $0.3 million, compared to an operating loss of $2.1 million for the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023. The decrease was mainly due to the increase in revenues, improved gross margin due to regional revenue mix, and cost reduction measures taken, reducing\noperating expenses.\nOur operating loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was $2.1 million, compared to an operating loss of $5.7 million for the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023. The decrease was mainly due to the increase in revenues, improved gross margin due to regional revenue mix, and cost reduction measures taken, reducing\noperating expenses.\nFinancial Expenses, Net and Interest Expenses\nOur financial income, net was $52,000 million and our interest expense was $0.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to financial\nincome, net of $1.4 million and including $0.2 million interest expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase is mainly due to financial income in the\nprior year from bank deposits and exchange rate differences not repeated in current period.\nOur financial income, net was $138,000 and our interest expense was $0.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to financial income, net of\n$1.9 million and interest expense of $0.5 million interest expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase is mainly due to financial income in the prior\nyear from bank deposits and exchange rate differences not repeated in current period.\nNet Loss\nOur net loss for the three months ended September 30, 2024, was $0.5 million, compared to net loss of $0.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023.\nThis decrease was primarily due to the increase in revenues, improved gross margin due to regional revenue mix, and cost reduction measures taken, reducing operating\nexpenses, partially offset by financial income in the prior year not repeating itself.\nOur net loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was $2.6 million, compared to net loss of $4.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\nThis decrease was primarily due to the increase in revenues, improved gross margin due to regional revenue mix, and cost reduction measures taken, reducing operating\nexpenses, partially offset by financial income in the prior year not repeating itself.\n5\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nThree months Three months Nine months Nine months\nEnded Ended Ended Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30, September 30, September 30,\n(U.S. dollars in thousands) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nRevenues $ 2,541 $ 845 $ 6,698 $ 4,589\nGAAP net loss (511) (867) (2,575) (4,355)\nInterest Expense 246 161 590 512\nOther Financial expenses (income), net (52) (1,421) (138) (1,865)\nTax Expense 1 18 33 58\nFixed asset depreciation expense 3 7 10 20\nStock based compensation 80 106 259 298\nResearch and development, capitalization - 113 - 371\nOther one-time costs and expenses (income) - 120 (189) 343\nNon-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA (233) (1,763) (2,010) (4,618)\nGAAP net loss margin (20.11)% (102.60)% (38.44)% (94.90)%\nAdjusted EBITDA margin (9.17)% (208.64)% (30.00)% (100.63)%\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Information\nNon-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are Non-GAAP financial measures. In addition to reporting financial results in accordance with GAAP,\nwe provide Non-GAAP supplemental operating results adjusted for certain items, including: financial expenses, which are interest, financial instrument fair value adjustments,\nexchange rate differences of assets and liabilities, stock based compensation expenses, depreciation and amortization expense, tax expense, and impact of development\nexpenses ahead of product launch. We adjust for the items listed above and show non-GAAP financial measures in all periods presented, unless the impact is clearly immaterial\nto our financial statements. When we calculate the tax effect of the adjustments, we include all current and deferred income tax expense commensurate with the adjusted\nmeasure of pre-tax profitability.\nWe utilize the adjusted results to review our ongoing operations without the effect of these adjustments but not for comparison to budgeted operating results.. We\nbelieve the supplemental adjusted results are useful to investors because they help them compare our results to previous periods and provide important insights into underlying\ntrends in the business and how management oversees and optimizes our business operations on a day-to-day basis. We exclude the costs in calculating adjusted results to allow\nus and investors to evaluate the performance of the business based upon its expected ongoing operating structure. We believe the adjusted measures, accompanied by the\ndisclosure of the costs of these programs, provides valuable insight to our financial performance.

Our primary requirements for liquidity and capital are to finance working capital, capital expenditures and general corporate\npurposes.\nOur future capital requirements will be affected by many factors, including our revenue growth, the timing and extent of investments to support such growth, the\nexpansion of sales and marketing activities, increases in general and administrative costs, repayment of principal of our existing credit line, working capital to support securing\nraw material supply and many other factors as described under “Risk Factors.”\n6\nTo the extent additional funds are necessary to meet our long-term liquidity needs as we continue to execute our business strategy, we anticipate that they will be\nobtained through the incurrence of additional indebtedness, additional equity financings or a combination of these potential sources of funds; however, such financing may not\nbe available on favorable terms, or at all. In particular, the repercussions from the COVID 19 pandemic, as well as the war in Israel and the war between Russia and the\nUkraine, has resulted in, and may continue to result in, significant disruption of global financial markets, reducing our ability to access capital.\nOn June 5, 2024, we entered into an inducement agreement with a certain holder of certain of our existing warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 999,670 shares of\nour common stock originally issued on May 8, 2023, with a five and one-half year term, at an exercise price of $2.75 per share (the “May 2023 Warrants”). Pursuant to the\ninducement agreement, the holder agreed to exercise for cash its May 2023 Warrants to purchase an aggregate of 999,670 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of\n$2.75 per share, in consideration of our agreement to issue new common stock purchase warrants (the “June 2024 Warrants”), as described below, to purchase up to an\naggregate of 1,999,340 shares of our common stock, at an exercise price of $2.00 per share. The closing of the June 2024 Warrant Inducement occurred on June 6, 2024, and\nresulted in gross proceeds from the exercise of the existing warrants by the holder to the Company of $3.0 million, before deducting placement agent fees and other offering\nexpenses payable by the Company.\nOn June 30, 2024, we entered into an inducement letter with a holder of our June 2024 Warrants, to purchase up to an aggregate of 999,670 shares of the June 2024\nWarrants, originally issued on June 6, 2024, with a twenty-four month term, at an exercise price of $2.00 per share. Pursuant to the inducement letter, the holder agreed to\nexercise for cash its warrants to purchase an aggregate of 999,670 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $2.00 per share, in consideration of our agreement to issue\nnew common stock purchase warrants (the “July 2024 Warrants”), as descried below, to purchase up to an aggregate of 1,999,340 shares of our common stock, at an exercise\nprice of $1.75 per share. The closing of the July 2024 Warrant Inducement occurred on July 2, 2024, and resulted in gross proceeds from the exercise of the existing warrants by\nthe holder to the Company of $2.25 million, before deducting placement agent fees and other offering expenses payable by the Company.\nOn September 18, 2024, we filed a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (the “Registration Statement”). Pursuant to the Registration Statement, we may offer and\nsell securities having an aggregate public offering price of up to $50.0 million. In connection with the filing of the Registration Statement, on September 25, 2024, we entered\ninto a sales agreement with H.C. Wainwright & Co. (the “Sales Agent”), pursuant to which we may issue and sell shares of our common stock for an aggregate offering price of\nup to $3.4 million under an at-the-market offering program (the “ATM”), which is included in the $50.0 million of securities that may be offered pursuant to the Registration\nStatement. Pursuant to the ATM, we will pay the Sales Agent a commission rate of up to 3.0% of the gross proceeds from the sale of any shares of our common stock. We are\nnot obligated to make any sales of shares under the ATM. As of September 30, 2024, we have sold 227,939 shares of our common stock and received approximately $317,000\nin net proceeds under the ATM.\nAs discussed in Note 1(c) to the condensed consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Quarterly report on Form 10-Q, we have incurred significant\nlosses and negative cash flows from operations and incurred losses of $2.5 million and $6.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023, respectively. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and the year ended December 31, 2023, we had negative cash flows from operations of\n$4.7 million and $6.5 million, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, we had negative working capital and an accumulated deficit of $42.2 million.\nAs of September 30, 2024, we had cash on hand (including short term deposits and restricted bank deposits) of approximately $2.3 million and long-term deposits,\nrestricted bank deposits and restricted cash of $300,000. We monitor our cash flow projections on a current basis and take active measures to obtain the funding we require to\ncontinue our operations, as well as make adjustments to our cost structure that were done year to date. However, these cash flow projections are subject to various uncertainties\nconcerning their fulfilment, such as the ability to increase revenues by attracting and expanding our customer base or reducing cost structure. If we are not successful in\ngenerating sufficient cash flow or completing additional financing, then we will need to execute additional cost reduction actions that have been planned. Our transition to\nprofitable operations is dependent on generating a level of revenue adequate to support our cost structure. We expect to fund operations using cash on hand, through operational\ncash flows and raising additional proceeds. There are no assurances, however, that we will be able to generate the revenue necessary to support our cost structure or that we will\nbe successful in obtaining the level of financing necessary for our operations. Management has evaluated the significance of these conditions and has determined that we do not\nhave sufficient resources to meet our operating obligations for at least one year from the issuance date of these condensed consolidated financial statements. These factors raise\nsubstantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. These condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the\nCompany will continue as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business, and do not include any\nadjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\n7\nCash Flows\nThe table below, for the periods indicated, provides selected cash flow information:\nNine Months Nine Months\nEnded Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n(U.S. dollars in thousands) 2024 2023\nNet cash used in operating activities $ (4,781) $ (5,194)\nNet cash provided by (used in) investing activities 197 1,430\nNet cash provided by financing activities 1,624 2,586\nNet change in cash $ (2,974) $ (1,190)\nAs of September 30, 2024, we had cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash of $2.5 million compared to $3.1 million of cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash as\nof September 30, 2023.\nCash used in operating activities amounted to $4.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $5.2 for the nine months ended September 30,\n2023. The decrease in cash used in operating activities was mainly due to cost reduction measures taken.\nNet cash provided by investing activities was $0.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to cash used in investing activities of $1.4 for the\nnine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease from the corresponding period was mainly due to the reduction in short-term bank deposits.\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $1.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $2.6 million for the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023. The decrease is related to the repayment of long-term loan, offset by funds raised from an investor warrant exercise. See notes 2 to the condensed\nconsolidated financial statements\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements or relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as\nstructured finance or special purpose entities.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements\nrequires management to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at\nthe date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the applicable periods. We evaluate our estimates, assumptions and judgments on\nan ongoing basis. Our estimates, assumptions and judgments are based on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the\ncircumstances. Different assumptions and judgments would change the estimates used in the preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements, which, in turn,\ncould change the results from those reported.\nOur management’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements, which we have prepared in\naccordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB. The preparation of these financial statements\nrequires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the\nfinancial statements, as well as the reported expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nOur significant accounting policies include revenue from contracts with customers which is more fully described in the notes to our condensed consolidated financial\nstatements appearing elsewhere in this Quarterly report on Form 10-Q and our annual financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023, including the footnotes, for a\ndescription of our significant accounting policies. We believe that these accounting policies discussed are critical to our financial results and to the understanding of our past\nand future performance, as these policies relate to the more significant areas involving management’s estimates and assumptions. We consider an accounting estimate to be\ncritical if: (1) it requires us to make assumptions because information was not available at the time or it included matters that were highly uncertain at the time we were making\nour estimate; and (2) changes in the estimate could have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations.\n8\nItem 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk.\nNot required for a smaller reporting company.\nItem 4. Controls and Procedures.\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nWe continued to conduct ongoing evaluation of the effectiveness of our “disclosure controls and procedures”, as defined by Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of\nExchange Act, as of September 30, 2024, the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report. This evaluation, which was performed under the supervision and with the\nparticipation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”), is performed to determine whether our disclosure controls\nand procedures are effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange\nAct is accumulated and communicated to management, including our CEO and CFO, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and are effective to\nprovide reasonable assurance that such information is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the SEC’s rules and forms. There are\ninherent limitations to the effectiveness of any system of disclosure controls and procedures. Disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and effectively\noperated, can only provide reasonable assurance of achieving their control objectives.\nBased upon that evaluation, our CEO and CFO concluded our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of the period covered by this Quarterly Report\non Form 10-Q due to the material weakness discussed below.\nManagement’s report on internal control over financial reporting\nManagement is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the\nExchange Act. Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the\nconsolidated financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with GAAP.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, our internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect all misstatements, including the possibility of human error,\nthe circumvention or overriding of controls or fraud. Effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of\nfinancial statements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may\nbecome inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate over time.\nUnder the supervision and with the participation of the CEO and the CFO, management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over\nfinancial reporting as of September 30, 2024. We performed an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework\ndescribed in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”). Based on this\nevaluation, our management concluded that we did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2024 given the existence of the\npreviously identified material weakness described below having not been remediated as of the last day of the period covered by this Quarterly Report.\nMaterial Weakness\nWe have identified one material weakness in our design and operation of our internal control over financial reporting in connection with the preparation of our\nfinancial remediated as of September 30, 2024.\nA material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a\nmaterial misstatement of a company’s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. The Company’s management, including our\nCEO and CFO, concluded that, as of September 30, 2024:\n9\nWe lacked a sufficient complement of professionals with an appropriate level of accounting knowledge, training and experience to maintain appropriate segregation of\nduties in our finance and accounting functions.\nOur independent registered public accounting firm will not be required to opine on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section\n404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act until we are no longer an “emerging growth company” as defined in the JOBS Act.\nRemediation Plan and Status\nWe have taken and intend to continue to take actions to remediate the material weakness described above. To remediate this material weakness, we continue to map,\ndocument and test our internal controls (recently, with the assistance of a third-party accounting firm with specific expertise in SOX compliance), and accordingly, we\ncontinued to make progress in our internal controls plan. Among other procedures, management has executed the following remedial actions:\n● Hired new financial experts and increasing the number of financial personnel.\n● Continued to map, document and test our internal controls, with the assistance of a third-party accounting firm with specific expertise in SOX compliance.\n● Implemented new control procedures over certain areas identified as requiring enhancement in order to address the lack of a sufficient number of finance\npersonnel to allow for adequate segregation of duties.\nIn addition to the actions underway, we continue to add enhancements to our internal controls over financial reporting in 2024. Additional remedial actions include:\n● Maintain or increase the level and design of segregation of duties, including maintaining or growing the quality and number of finance personnel\n● Continue to document and test annually our internal control over financial reporting\n● Continue engagement with an outside accounting firm with specific SOX and Internal Control expertise\n● Continued hiring of additional accounting, information technology, and internal controls resources who possess public company accounting, auditing and\nreporting expertise\nThe actions we are taking are subject to ongoing senior management review, as well as oversight of the audit committee of our Board. We also may conclude that\nadditional measures may be required to remediate the material weaknesses or determine to modify the remediation plans described above. We will not be able to fully remediate\nthis material weakness until these steps have been completed and have been operating effectively. We will continue to monitor the design and effectiveness of these and other\nprocesses, procedures, and controls and make any further changes management deems appropriate.\nIn addition to the items noted above, as we continue to evaluate, remediate and improve our internal control over financial reporting, executive management may elect\nto implement additional measures to address control deficiencies or may determine that the remediation efforts described above require modification. Executive management, in\nconsultation with and at the direction of our Audit Committee and an expert outside consultant, will continue to assess the control environment and the above-mentioned efforts\nto remediate the underlying causes of the identified material weakness.\nAlthough we plan to complete this remediation process as quickly as possible, we are unable, at this time to estimate how long it will take; and our efforts may not be\nsuccessful in remediating the deficiencies or material weaknesses.\nNotwithstanding the material weakness set forth above, based on the performance of additional procedures by management designed to ensure reliability of financial\nreporting, the Company’s management has concluded that the consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, fairly present, in all material\nrespects, the Company’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows as of the dates, and for the periods presented, in conformity with GAAP.\nChanges in Internal Controls over Financial Reporting\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\n10\nPart II - Other Information\nItem 1. Legal Proceedings.\nFrom time to time, we are involved in various claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business. To the knowledge of our management, there are no\nlegal proceedings currently pending against us which we believe would have a material effect on our business, financial position or results of operations and, to the best of our\nknowledge, there are no such legal proceedings contemplated or threatened.\nItem 1A. Risk Factors.\nExcept as set forth below in this Item 1A and the Risk Factors included in our previous filings made with the SEC, there have been no material changes to our risk\nfactors from those disclosed in “Part I. Item 1A. Risk Factors” in the Form 10-K filed with the SEC on March 26, 2024.\nConditions in the Middle East and in Israel, where our research and development facilities are located, may harm our operations.\nOur office where we conduct our research and development, operations, sales outside the Americas, and administration activities, is located in Israel. Many of our\nemployees are residents of Israel. Most of our officers and directors are residents of Israel. Since the establishment of the State of Israel in 1948, a number of armed conflicts\nhave taken place between Israel and its neighboring countries, and between Israel and the Hamas (an Islamist militia and political group in the Gaza Strip) and Hezbollah (an\nIslamist militia and political group in Lebanon).\nIn particular, in October 2023, Hamas terrorists infiltrated Israel’s southern border from the Gaza Strip and conducted a series of attacks on civilian and military\ntargets. Hamas also launched extensive rocket attacks on the Israeli population and industrial centers located along Israel’s border with the Gaza Strip and in other areas within\nthe State of Israel. These attacks resulted in thousands of deaths and injuries, and Hamas additionally kidnapped many Israeli civilians and soldiers. Following the attack,\nIsrael’s security cabinet declared war against Hamas and commenced a military campaign against Hamas and Hezbollah and these terrorist organizations in parallel continued\nrocket and terror attacks. As a result of the events of October 7, 2023 whereby Hamas terrorists invaded southern Israel and launched thousands of rockets in a widespread\nterrorist attack on Israel, the Israeli government declared that the country was at war and the Israeli military began to call-up reservists for active duty. As of the date of this\nQuarterly Report on Form 10-Q, we have not been impacted by any absences of personnel at our service providers or counterparties located in Israel. Military service call ups\nthat result in absences of personnel from us for an extended period of time may materially and adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and results of\noperations. As of the date of this Quarterly Report, we currently have 42 full-time employees, with 33 employees located in Israel and 9 employees located outside of Israel.\nSince the war broke out on October 7, 2023, our operations have not been adversely affected by this situation, and we have not experienced any material disruptions to\nour operations. We have the ability, if necessary, to shift our manufacturing from Israel to other countries where we have business partners, and we have not had customers in\nIsrael in the last year. However, the intensity and duration of the war in the Middle East is difficult to predict at this stage, as are such war’s economic implications on the\nCompany’s business and operations and on Israel’s economy in general. if the war in the other fronts, such as Lebanon, Syria and the West Bank expands further, our operations\nmay be adversely affected.\nIn addition, since the commencement of these events, there have been continued hostilities along Israel’s northern border with Lebanon (with the Hezbollah terror\norganization) and southern border (with the Houthi movement in Yemen). It is possible that hostilities with Hezbollah in Lebanon will escalate, and that other terrorist\norganizations, including Palestinian military organizations in the West Bank as well as other hostile countries will join the hostilities. Such clashes may escalate in the future\ninto a greater regional conflict. In addition, Iran recently launched a direct attack on Israel involved hundreds of drones and missiles, and has threatened to continue to attack\nIsrael and is widely believed to be developing nuclear weapons. Iran is also believed to have a strong influence among extremist groups in the region, such as Hamas in Gaza,\nHezbollah in Lebanon, the Houthi movement in Yemen and various rebel militia groups in Syria. These situations may potentially escalate in the future to more violent events\nwhich may affect Israel and us. Any armed conflicts, terrorist activities or political instability in the region could adversely affect business conditions, could harm our results of\noperations and could make it more difficult for us to raise capital. Parties with whom we do business may decline to travel to Israel during periods of heightened unrest or\ntension, forcing us to make alternative arrangements when necessary in order to meet our business partners face to face. In addition, the political and security situation in Israel\nmay result in parties with whom we have agreements involving performance in Israel claiming that they are not obligated to perform their commitments under those agreements\npursuant to force majeure provisions in such agreements. Further, in the past, the State of Israel and Israeli companies have been subjected to economic boycotts. Several\ncountries still restrict business with the State of Israel and with Israeli companies. These restrictive laws and policies may have an adverse impact on our operating results,\nfinancial condition or the expansion of our business.\nAny hostilities involving Israel or the interruption or curtailment of trade between Israel and its trading partners could adversely affect our operations and results of\noperations. In recent years, the hostilities involved missile strikes against civilian targets in various parts of Israel, including areas in which our employees and some of our\nconsultants are located, and negatively affected business conditions in Israel.\nOur commercial insurance does not cover losses that may occur as a result of events associated with the security situation in the Middle East. Although the Israeli\ngovernment currently covers the reinstatement value of direct damages that are caused by terrorist attacks or acts of war, we cannot assure you that this government coverage\nwill be maintained. Any losses or damages incurred by us could have a material adverse effect on our business. Any armed conflicts or political instability in the region would\nlikely negatively affect business conditions and could harm our results of operations. To-date, we have received Israeli government war related support funding of\napproximately $100,000.\n11\nFinally, political conditions within Israel may affect our operations. Israel has held five general elections between 2019 and 2022, and prior to October 2023, the Israeli\ngovernment pursued extensive changes to Israel’s judicial system, which sparked extensive political debate and unrest. To date, these initiatives have been substantially put on\nhold. Actual or perceived political instability in Israel or any negative changes in the political environment, may individually or in the aggregate adversely affect the Israeli\neconomy and, in turn, our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nIf we fail to comply with the continued listing requirements of the Nasdaq Capital Market, our common stock may be delisted and the price of our common stock\nand our ability to access the capital markets could be negatively impacted.\nNasdaq has established certain standards for the continued listing of a security on the Nasdaq Capital Market. The standards for continued listing include, among other\nthings, that the minimum bid price for the listed securities not fall below $1.00 per share for a period of 30 consecutive trading days and that we maintain a minimum of\n$2,500,000 in shareholders’ equity.\nWe have in the past, and may in the future, be unable to comply with certain of the listing standards that we are required to meet to maintain the listing of our ordinary\nshares on Nasdaq.\nFor instance, on August 25, 2023, we received a notification letter from the Listing Qualifications Staff (the “Staff”) of the Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”)\nindicating that we are not in compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(b)(1) due to our failure to maintain a minimum of $2,500,000 in shareholders’ equity (the “Minimum\nShareholders’ Equity Requirement”) or any alternatives to such requirement. In order to maintain our listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market, we submitted a plan of compliance\naddressing how we intended to regain compliance\nOn August 27, 2024, we received formal written notice from Nasdaq confirming that we have evidenced compliance with all applicable criteria for continued listing on\nNasdaq as set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550, including the Minimum Shareholders’ Equity Requirement. In accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5815(d)(4)(B), we will\nremain subject to a panel monitor for equity compliance through August 27, 2025.\nIn addition, on May 20, 2024, the Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”) notified the Company that it was not in compliance with the minimum bid price requirements\nset forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2), which requires the Company’s common stock to maintain a minimum bid price of $1.00 per share. On June 20, 2024, the Company\nreceived a letter from Nasdaq that, for the 10 consecutive business days from June 5, 2024 to June 28, 2024, the closing bid price of the Company’s common stock had been at\n$1.00 per share or greater. Accordingly, the Company has regained compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) and Nasdaq considers the prior bid price deficiency matter\nnow closed.\nIf we fail to satisfy the continued listing requirements of Nasdaq, such as minimum stockholders’ equity requirements or minimum bid price requirements, Nasdaq\nmay take steps to delist our shares of common stock. Such a delisting would have a negative effect on the price of our shares of common stock, impair the ability to sell or\npurchase our shares of common stock when persons wish to do so, and any delisting materially adversely affect our ability to raise capital or pursue strategic restructuring,\nrefinancing or other transactions on acceptable terms, or at all. Delisting from Nasdaq could also have other negative results, including the potential loss of institutional investor\ninterest and fewer business development opportunities, as well as a limited amount of news and analyst coverage of us. Delisting could also result in a determination that our\nshares of common stock are a “penny stock,” which would require brokers trading in our shares of common stock to adhere to more stringent rules, possibly resulting in a\nreduced level of trading activity in the secondary market for our shares of common stock. In the event of a delisting, we would attempt to take actions to restore our compliance\nwith Nasdaq’s listing requirements, but we can provide no assurance that any such action taken by us would allow our shares of common stock to become listed again, stabilize\nthe market price or improve the liquidity of our securities, prevent our shares of common stock from dropping below the Nasdaq minimum bid price requirement or prevent\nfuture non-compliance with Nasdaq’s listing requirements.\n12\nItem 2.

Business\nCompany Overview\nActelis Networks, Inc. (“we,” “the Company”, “Actelis”, “us”, “our”) is a market leader in cyber-hardened, rapid-deployment networking solutions for wide-area IoT\napplications including federal, state and local government, intelligent traffic systems (“ITS”), military, utility, rail, telecom and campus applications. Our unique portfolio of\nhybrid fiber, environmentally hardened aggregation switches, high density Ethernet devices, advanced management software and cyber-protection capabilities, unlocks the\nhidden value of essential networks, delivering safer connectivity for rapid, cost-effective deployment.\nOur networking solutions use a combination of newly deployed fiber infrastructure and existing copper and coaxial lines which our patented technology can upgrade to\nFiber-grade to jointly create what we believe to be a highly cost-effective, secure and quick-to-deploy network. Our patent protected hybrid fiber networking solutions deliver\nexcellent communication over fiber to locations that may be easy to reach with new fiber. However, for locations that are difficult, or too costly to reach with fiber, we can\nupgrade existing copper lines to deliver cyber-hardened, high-speed connectivity without needing to replace the existing copper infrastructure with new fiber. We believe that\nsuch hybrid fiber-copper networking solution has distinct advantages in most real-life installations, while providing significant budget savings and accelerating deployment of\nmodern IoT networks, as based on our experience, most IoT projects have challenging, hard to reach with fiber locations which may explode such projects’ timeline and\nbudgets. We believe that our solutions can provide connectivity over either fiber or copper with speeds of up to multi-Gigabit communication, while supporting Fiber-grade\nreliability and quality.\nA primary focus of ours is to provide our customers with a cyber-secure network solution. We currently offer Triple-Shield protection of data delivered with coding,\nscrambling and encryption of the network traffic. We also provide secure, encrypted access to our network management software, and are working to further enhance system-\nlevel and device-level software protection. We are also working to introduce additional capabilities for network-wide cyber protection software as an additional SW and license-\nbased service.\nWhen high speed, long reach, reliable and secure connectivity is required, network operators usually resort to using wireline communication over physical communication\nlines such as fiber, coax and copper, rather than wireless communication that is more limited in performance, reliability, reach and security. However, new fiber wireline\ninfrastructure is costly to deploy, involves lengthy civil works to install, and, based on our internal calculations, often accounts for more than 50% of total cost of ownership\n(ToC) and time to deploy wide-area IoT projects.\nProviding new fiber connectivity to hard-to-reach locations is especially costly and time-consuming, often requiring permits for boring, trenching, and right-of-way,\nsometimes done over many miles. Connecting such hard-to-reach locations may cause significant delays and budget overruns in IoT projects. Our solutions aim to solve these\nchallenges by instantly enhancing performance of such existing copper and coax infrastructure to fiber-grade performance, through the use of advanced signal processing an\nunique, patented network architecture, without the need to run new fiber to hard-to-reach locations; thus, effectively accelerating deployment of many IoT projects, as we\nestimate, sometimes from many months to only days. The result for the network owner isa hybrid network that optimizes the use of both new Fiber (where available) as well as\nupgraded, fiber-grade copper and coax that is now modernized, digitized and cyber-hardened. This unique hybrid network approach is making IoT projects often significantly\nmore affordable, fast to deploy and predictable to plan and budget.\nIn addition, our solutions can also provide power over existing copper and coax lines to remotely power up network elements and IoT components connected to them (like\ncameras, small cell and Wi-Fi base stations sensors etc.). Connecting power lines to millions of IoT locations can be costly and very time consuming as well (similar to data\nconnectivity, for the same reason-need for civil works). By offering the ability to combine power delivery over the same existing copper and coax lines that we use for high-\nspeed data, we believe our solutions are solving yet another important challenge in connecting hard-to-reach locations. We believe that combining communication and power\nover the same existing lines is particularly important to help connect many fifth generation, or 5G, small cells and Wi-Fi base stations, as high cost of connectivity and power is\noften slowing their deployment.\n1\nSince our inception, our business was focused on serving telecommunication service providers, also known as Telcos, to provide connectivity for enterprises and residential\ncustomers. Our products and solutions have been deployed with more than 100 telecommunication service providers worldwide, in enterprise, residential and mobile base\nstation connectivity applications. In recent years, as we have further developed our technology and introduced additional products, we turned our focus on serving the wide-area\nIoT markets. Our operations are focused on our fast-growing IoT business, while maintaining our commitment to our existing Telco customers. In 2023, we introduced new\nproduct offering, some of which could serve both the IoT markets and our Telco customers.\nWe derive a growing portion of our revenue from our existing and new IoT customers. For the years ended December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, our IoT customers\nin the aggregate accounted for approximately 73% and 65% of our revenues, respectively.\nWe derive a significant portion of our revenue from a limited number of our customers. For the years ended December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, our top ten\ncustomers in the aggregate accounted for approximately 66% and 82% of our revenues.\nWe have incurred significant losses and negative cash flows from operations and as of December 31, 2023, we had an accumulated deficit of $39.7 million. We have\nfunded our operations to date through equity financing and we had cash on hand (including short term bank deposits and restricted cash equivalents) of $2.4 million and long-\nterm restricted cash and cash equivalents and restricted bank deposits of $3.4 million as of December 31, 2023. We continue to invest in sales and marketing resources to fuel\nour growth.\nTo address many of the most difficult wide-area IoT connectivity challenges, we combine the benefits of fiber-optic infrastructure, where available, with the hidden\npotential in existing legacy copper/coax wires that already connect billions of locations and devices globally (often at low speed, experiencing interruptions and presenting poor\ninformation security, delivering mostly voice, or low speed control signals). However, these lines are readily available at no additional deployment cost and can reach, as we\nbelieve, most locations. Using our patented signal-processing software and hardware technology and system architecture, we can “upgrade” these lines, by deriving fiber-grade\nperformance from them, and integrate them with new fiber installations, where available, to create a seamless end-to-end hybrid-fiber network, enabling fast, reliable, and safe\nfiber-grade connectivity that is rapid to deploy and highly cost effective.\nOur technology is both powerful and compact and is built as a relatively small set of feature-rich network elements, that serve as building block in many IoT verticals.\nThese elements include switches, typically enhanced with signal processing SW, concentrators, reach extenders, data encryption elements, power sources and a smart\nnetworking software that allows for remote management and monitoring down to the single element and line performance, configuration management making complex network\ntopologies easy to deploy, analyze, debug and remote SW download to help with remote handling of large and small networks.\nOur solutions can also provide remote power over the same existing copper lines to power up network elements and IoT components connected to them (like cameras and\nmeters). Connecting power lines to millions of IoT locations can be costly and very time consuming (similar to data connectivity). By offering the ability to combine power\ndelivery over the same copper lines used for high-speed data, we believe our solutions are solving yet another important challenge in connecting hard-to-reach locations. We\nbelieve that combining communication and power over the same existing lines is particularly important to help connect many fifth generation, or 5G, small cells and Wi-Fi base\nstations, as high cost of connectivity and power is often slowing their deployment.\nRapid Deployment and Lower Cost of Critical Connectivity for IoT\nWe aim to become the global leading provider of cyber-secure, cost-effective and quick-to-deploy hybrid networking for all wide-area IoT applications. Our products work\nover all types of wireline media on the global data network, whether owned or operated by telecom service providers or a private network operated by enterprises or\ngovernment organizations. Our products are structured as building blocks for most IoT applications and are feature-rich. This allows for one Actelis platform to often replace\nmultiple other platforms available in the market, allowing for space-saving installation, energy conservation (which we believe results in a greener network), and making\nnetwork planning easier for our customers. We aim at having our products installed and help accelerate deployment of wire-area IoT projects and applications everywhere.\n2\nFor example, in one of the projects where our solutions are deployed, we found that 70% of locations are easy-to-reach with new fiber optic installation. Connectivity for\nsuch easy-to-reach locations may, as we believe, average $26,000 per mile for new fiber laid on poles, and can take between days to weeks to connect. However, the remaining\n30% of locations were hard-to-reach with new fiber optics, and accordingly may require boring or trenching to reach IoT sensors or camera locations. Getting fiber to those\n30% of hard-to-reach would require potentially connecting over obstacles, roads, long distances, and may also require obtaining the right of way and permits for extensive civil\nworks. We believe this aspect of the deployment of new fiber optics may cost up to $400,000 per mile, which for this particular project would have impacted thousands of miles\nof roads, resulting in enormous cost, delay and interruption to traffic.\nIn another project, we have been selected to provide networking for a major city that has fiber installed to 15% of its traffic junctions, however 85% of its junctions are\nconnected to low performance copper lines susceptible for bad actors to tamper with. Upgrading the entire city’s infrastructure to Fiber would have involved major civil works,\npermit delays and traffic interruptions for months or years, with a cost that would greatly exceed city’s budget. Our hybrid fiber-copper network allowed for the city to use its\n15% fiber deployment, upgrade instantly the performance of its existing 85% copper lines to fiber-grade and join the two under a comprehensive management and security\nsoftware package from Actelis to create one seamless network, while providing major savings of both time and money.\nIn another project, we provided our hybrid networking connectivity solution with remote powering over the data lines to 3G and 4G base stations. Looking forward, we\nbelieve that a dense grid of 5G small cells would be required to enable global 5G coverage, which, may accelerate IoT deployment in many smart city projects and other dense\nareas. We believe that connecting and powering these 5G small cells to the network cost effectively and rapidly, in both hard-to-reach and easy-to-reach locations is key to\nsuccessful and timely deployment for such network.\nIn 2022, we released our first product family of hardened, hybrid, encrypted fiber-copper product family with 10Gbps switching capacity.\nIn 2023, we introduced the next-generation product families for hybrid-fiber-copper (or in short “hybrid-fiber”) Gigabit grade connectivity under the product family name,\n“Gigaline” or GL. Under the Gigaline families of hybrid-fiber networking solutions for fiber, copper and coax environments, we solved new challenges faced by our IoT and\ntelecom customers and expanded our offerings.\nCybersecurity\nIoT networks are vulnerable to cyber-attacks as they often carry data related to critical processes and applications, such as provision of energy, water, gas and transportation\nservices, to large populations. We believe that this data requires enhanced security within the network.\nOur products all include cyber safety features that we are constantly developing. They currently include network traffic encryption and coding. We have developed and\nimplemented a multi-layered “Triple Shield” technology that includes (i) information coding for resilience and security (for copper wires); (ii) multi-line information\nscrambling for increased resilience and added security (for copper wires); and (iii) an additional 256-bit hardware-based real-time encryption of data running over fiber, coax or\ncopper — creating end-to-end protection for the entire hybrid network. Our network management software is also cyber-hardened and helps protect the system. Our systems\nhave been selected for deployment in sensitive applications with U.S. DoD and other governments and military organizations, airports, utility companies, oil and gas\ncompanies, smart cities, rail and traffic applications globally.\nWe continue to invest in further strengthening our focus on cybersecurity capabilities and solutions for our customers. We have invested in software and hardware\ncapabilities enhancing encryption of the data carried by our systems; we have introduced encrypted, cyber-hardened network management protocols; we have also introduced\nencryption of operating systems running on our devices. Furthermore, we successfully completed the certification of our product lines for Federal Intelligence Protocol\nStandards (FIPS) and were approved by the DoD’s Joint Interoperability Test Command (JITC) for interoperability and cybersecurity approved product list (APL) in 2024. We\nare exploring directions to provide software services to our customers that would allow them to flexibly safeguard their critical networks, and intelligently isolate and protect\nfrom bad actors attacking their networks. We refer to such objective as Cyber-Aware Networking.\n3\nMarket Verticals We Address\nWe execute our vision through a multi-channel, global approach that combines our expertise, with the expertise of our trusted business partners, system integrators,\ndistributors, and consultants.\nWe operate a vertical based marketing plan where we dedicate efforts and resources to each vertical. The IoT verticals that we have focused on include: (1) ITS; (4) rail;\n(2) federal and military; (3) airports; (5) energy and water; (6) smart city; (7) education campuses; and (8) industrial campuses.

To date, we have been most\nsuccessful in selling to customers in the intelligent transportation systems, rail, federal and military, and airports markets, primarily in the US, Canada, Europe, and Japan.\nState of IoT Connectivity Market\nIoT infrastructure connectivity demand is growing rapidly. We believe there is an urgent need to connect tens of millions of locations with a fast and secure connection. A\nhuge challenge for IoT projects is that implementing connectivity between different IoT points in a network can consume the majority of a project’s cost and time to implement,\nincluding unpredictable and unanticipated challenges that arise in each individual project.\nAccording to a report by Facts and Factors (January 2022) Global Internet of Things (IoT) market is expected to grow to $1.8 trillion by 2028, at a Compounded Average\nGrowth Rate (CAGR) of 24.5%.\nAccording to a report by Grand View Research (December 2022), the smart city market for connectivity infrastructure alone is expected to reach to $6,965.02 billion by\n2030 at a CAGR of 25.8%. Accordingly, we believe that the number of IoT applications requiring our fast, smart, and secure connectivity is immense and provides us with a\ngreat market opportunity to grow our business. From smart transportation systems (smart cameras, smart lights and signals, Vehicle to Everything, or V2X communication) and\nsmart security (cameras and radars), to smart parking, smart rail, power station monitoring, and industrial and warehouse automation, we believe that we are uniquely\npositioned to address all of these applications in a versatile and flexible manner.\nWe believe that there is an unserved segment that is extremely large within that market pertaining to the challenges in protecting the interface between the physical security\nand the cybersecurity of campuses, enterprises, industrial IoT (IIoT), government facilities, Smart Cities and utility plants.\nWe believe that 5G mobile technology will play a major role in the implementation and scaling of IoT networks. According to research published by ABI Research in\nJanuary 2021, 5G technology is expected to grow at a CAGR of 41.2% between 2021 and 2027 with a major part of that growth coming from servicing IoT networks.\nAccording to Grand View Research, the global small cell 5G network market size was valued at $999.43 million in 2021. The market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 72.7%\nbetween 2022-2030.\n5G base stations and small cells need to be deployed in a dense grid of millions of locations and need to be connected to Gigabit speed communication and power. We are\naddressing these needs for the rapid connectivity and power, aiming at enabling faster and more cost-effective deployment of 5G in IoT.\n4\nRecent Developments\nDecember 2023 Private Placement Offering\nOn December 17, 2023, we entered into a securities purchase agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) with an accredited investor (the “Investor”), pursuant to which we\nagreed to issue and sell to the Investor in a private placement (the “Offering”) (i) 301,000 shares (the “Shares”) of common stock of the Company, $0.0001 par value (the\n“Common Stock”), (ii) 970,187 pre-funded warrants (the “Pre-Funded Warrants”) to purchase up to 970,187 shares of Common Stock and (iii) warrants to purchase up to\n1,271,187 shares of Common Stock (“Common Warrants” and collectively with the Shares and the Common Warrants, the “Securities”) for a purchase price of $1.18 per share\nof Common Stock and related Common Warrant or $1.1799 per Pre-Funded Warrant and related Common Warrant, for a total aggregate gross proceeds of approximately\n$1.5 million.

The Common Warrants have an\nexercise price of $3.58 per share, are exercisable immediately upon issuance and expire five and one-half years following the issuance.\nOur Solutions\nWe have invested nearly $100 million over the years to develop our patented, multi-layered “Triple Shield” technology, which can serve all connectivity markets. Our\nTriple Shield technology includes signal processing software that is implementing optimization of multi-line signal coordination, the elimination of interference to boost\nconnectivity performance, the optimization of coding for resilience and security, multi-line data scrambling for low latency, increased resilience, and added security. Our\nsolutions also offer implementation of 256-bit encryption of transmission for data running over fiber or copper for network-wide protection of data. Our technology is packaged\ninto a small set of compact, hardened, feature-rich network elements (such as switches, concentrators and reach extenders) — the MetaLIGHT product family — that are used\nas building blocks addressing the needs of most wide-area IoT verticals and applications, in a space-and energy-saving fashion. The ability to drive remote powering and\nsynchronization signals to network ends over existing copper transmission lines provides additional significant cost-and-time benefits to network operators.\nIn 2023, we introduced the next-generation product families for hybrid-fiber-copper (or in short “hybrid-fiber”) Gigabit grade connectivity under the product family name,\n“Gigaline” or GL. Under the Gigaline families of hybrid-fiber networking solutions for fiber, copper and coax environments, we solved new challenges faced by our IoT and\ntelecm customers and expanded our offerings.\nOne such product line, the GL800 aims at extending multi-gigabit fiber-grade connectivity to buildings, enterprises, IoT installations, campuses, and 5G/4G base stations.\n5\nA second product line, the GL900, extends Gigabit connectivity from fiber installations outside buildings (“homes passed” by fiber) into individual offices and apartments\nwithin MDUs and MTUs, without the need for landlord investment in re-wiring buildings with fiber. MDU/MTU market in the US alone is estimated by the company to\ninclude more than 18M buildings.\nA third product group, GL5000 and GL6000, that was introduced in 2023 includes over 40 variants of hardened, 10Gbps fiber switches to expand our fiber offering into the\nIoT market.\nOur product offering includes our EMS network management software, providing built-in automation to help configure, manage, monitor, safeguard, install and maintain\ncomplex, hybrid networks of thousands of elements remotely. Our EMS management Software was enhanced to support these new products and strengthened with advanced\nsecurity features to support better cyber production and meet DoD demands. Our products are also built for future integration with enhanced security services we may introduce\nin the future.\nWe aim to continue developing our technology to include more system-wide security and further hybridity across all types of infrastructure. We will also seek to include\ncutting-edge computing capabilities to serve all connectivity needs for our IoT customers, in an effective and easily deployable way, while maintaining our commitment to\nserve our existing Telco customers.\nWe believe that our strong reputation as a provider of high-quality solutions, and the trust we gain from being recognized as a solid solution provider by prominent\ncustomers (such as the U.S. DoD) help us execute our strategy.\nProducts\n● Gigaline 800/900/5000/6000 Series. Advanced, software managed,\ntemperature and cyber-hardened, layer 2 and layer 3, hybrid-fiber-\ncopper switching devices, at multi-gigabit speeds of up to 10Gbps.\nThese devices deliver a much broader selection of solutions for large\nand small networks, at higher speeds, and better security, in support of\nhybrid-fiber networks that contain more fiber, and covering IoT, MDU\nand MTU markets.\n● MetaLight ML500/600/700/Series. EADs (Ethernet Access Devices)\nare a series of products which are cost efficient, compact and hardened\nEthernet switches for long-distance hybrid-fiber networks, located near\nthe IoT devices connected to the network. For example, our EAD is\nused to connect street traffic lights and nearby controllers, cameras and\nIoT devices to the traffic control center, where either fiber, copper or\ncoax infrastructure cabling exists. This product family can be installed\neither indoors or outdoors, including under extreme weather conditions.\n● ML2300 Aggregator Series. This product is designed for large,\nmedium, and small aggregation/operating and control centers. Network\naggregators can connect hundreds of locations or elements. For\nexample, control centers of highways could use such aggregators to\ncommunicate with hundreds of EADs installed in cabinets along\nhighways in order to securely connect IoT devices (e.g. security\ncameras) to the highway network.\n● XR239 Series. This product is installed on long copper lines and can be\nremotely powered from the data lines themselves, while a special\nalgorithm (Dynamic Spectral Software) is ensuring minimal\ninterference with other signals running on adjacent conduits in the same\ncable. It features a repeater to extend connectivity range to long\ndistances, in some cases up to 100Km. The repeater is installed\noutdoors and is resistant to cold, hot, rain, ice or snow. Our repeaters\nhave been installed along rail systems in Alaska and Canada and have\nbeen safely performing for more than five years.\n● Advanced MetaLIGHT/Gigaline EMS software. Our EMS (Element\nManagement Systems) software enable remote management,\nmonitoring, maintenance, and configuration of the installed equipment\nin the network. It is designed to monitor, control and configure our\nnetwork elements in the field, locally or remotely, for networks of\nvarious scales up to thousands of elements. Our implementation during\n2021 and 2022 for our end-user customer Highways England, as an\nexample, is using such EMS systems to control thousands of EADs\nconnecting IoT devices along thousands of highway miles. It includes\ndetailed monitoring, logging and tracking of functions both locally and\nremotely, to allow for easy debugging and configuration of networks,\nsecurity management, graphical display of network topologies,\nmanagement of licenses, remote software download, and connectivity\nto other network and management systems. EMS may also manage\nother software keys and elements (for example, for encryption or other\ncyber-safety functions), for which customers may pay separately for the\nlicenses.\nWe also offer support and maintenance services together with the sales of our product. This includes consulting, telephone troubleshooting and remote support, training,\nproduct repairs, and software updates.\n6\nProduct Specifications\nOur products use advanced signal processing implemented at the system level, with an approach that treats multiple copper lines as one multi-line channel, which we\nbelieve to achieve the following benefits:\n● Speeds ranging from 10MB to 10GBPS; distances up to 100Km (speeds a lower for longer distances) infrastructure\nSupporting any hybrid combination of new Fiber infrastructure and existing copper and coax infrastructure, supporting data security an encryption protocols, certified\nfor FIPS by US DoD labs; supporting outdoor hardened environmental requirements dense and compact to save space and allow for flexible location setting.\n● Automatic calibration tools and automated management SW enable hassle-free installation withing hours vs. weeks over existing wiring.\n● Improve communication reliability even if copper lines are of poor quality, so that network operators can, in most cases, guarantee their customers what we believe are\nService Level Availabilities (SLAs) and uptime similar to that of fiber optic infrastructure regardless of the media used, and uptime that allows our customers to\nsupport mission-critical applications.\nIn addition to these main benefits, we have focused our efforts and implemented technologies in our products in order to achieve the following:\n● Transmission in the copper lines to take into account signals in neighboring lines to minimize crosstalk interference and be “Spectrally Friendly”;\n● Multi-line spatial coding scrambling of data in a way that enhances connection immunity to interference, and makes tapping into the data very difficult;\n● Integration of remote powering and data on the same copper pairs;\n● Minimizing transmission delay to support delay-sensitive applications; and\n● Ability to safely, and accurately transmit clock signals for cellular base station synchronization (not available yet for 5G).\nSince our inception, our business was focused on serving telecommunication service providers (Telecom), also known as Telcos, for enterprises and residential customers.\nOur products and solutions have been deployed with more than 100 telecommunication service providers worldwide, in enterprise, residential and mobile base station\nconnectivity applications. In recent years, as we have further developed our technology and rolled out additional products, we turned our focus on serving the IoT markets. Our\noperations are focused on our fast-growing IoT business while maintaining our commitment to our existing Telecom customers.\nOur Competitive Advantage\nWe have invested heavily and over more than 10 years in the development of copper technologies and hybrid-fiber communication systems to create a solution that enables\nhigh-speed communication over real-life networks of mixed media, securely, reliably, and with Gigabit-grade resilience.\nCopper and coax lines are readily available in billions of locations. They are often buried in the ground, running in the walls of buildings or hanging from telephone poles,\nin bundles of tens or hundreds of wires.\n7\nCopper wires were never designed for long-reach, secure, high-speed communication. Attempts to deliver high-speed would encounter many problems, including signal\nattenuation, cross-talk interference from other lines in the Bundle and from any external electrical sources, variable quality and signal interruptions, and variable latency. Such\nwires are also relatively easy to tap into physically, and the information is also radiated outside of the cable and may be exposed to security threats.\nIn order to correct the issues with providing high speed communications over copper wiring, we developed technologies utilizing a multi-line approach, encoding,\nscrambling and processing the signals at system level (rather than at the single lines level), and finally also offering data encryption, to combat interference, electromagnetic\nnoise, and issues with copper line quality and data security.\nThe next step was to integrate our existing technologies into hybrid-fiber building blocks, that provide seamless communication over mixed, real-life fiber-copper-coax\nnetworks, and many other advantages.\nWe believe our products offer a unique solution on the market in terms of value, by providing the following:\n● High performance hybrid-fiber communication system\n● Speeds from 10Mbps to 10Gbps\n● Reach of up to 100Km (speed declines over long distances in copper)\n● Robust connectivity allowing Gigabit-grade service SLAs in various harsh environments over copper, coax or fiber\nRapid installation in hours vs. weeks or months if new infrastructure is needed\n● Cyber-protection on several levels, including Triple Shield Protection:\n● Multi-line data scrambling and coding (copper)\n● 256-bit system-wide encryption\n● System level protection (encryption and other protections) of management software, operating system and traffic flow\nMilitary — grade, DoD certified FIPS cyber protection\n● Dense, feature-full design to replace multiple alternative elements in the market, and allow for installation that is compact, lower cost and power saving:\n● Advanced switching functions supporting complex network topologies\n● Support for both advanced, digital IoT devices as well as existing analog devices with serial interfaces — to save the need to replace these devices while allowing\nthem to join the digital network\n● Power feeding for cameras and other IoT devices with the data cable\n8\n● Ability to install our IoT building blocks in remote locations with no power. Power can be provided from the communication line\n● Ability to provide precise synchronization over the communication lines to base stations\n● Routing functions\n● Support for spectrally-friendly reach extenders up to 100Km with minimal impact on other communication lines\n● Automated software tools for installation and management (including automated line calibration and configuration recognition during installation to avoid manual\nwork, advanced management systems that allow remote troubleshooting of any line connected to the system to save on operation and management time)\nWe believe that the combination of these advantages provides our customers with a highly cost-effective solution to quickly obtain IoT connectivity anywhere in their\nnetwork.\nWe believe that our hybrid-fiber solutions have a significant competitive advantage in several layers: (a) copper performance (speed, reach, link stability and data security);\n(b) seamless fiber-copper-coax integration and end-to-end data encryption; (c) overall system cyber-hardened design; (d) versatile, compact and feature-dense products with a\ngood fit to the vast majority of applications; (e) very high product and transmission reliability; automatic configuration tools and advanced management of every element in the\nfield; and (f) highly cost-effective when compared to alternatives. We believe that these advantages lead to very good value for our customers for both rapid deployment to all\nlocations, regardless of whether these locations are hard to reach. We also believe that these characteristics provide us with a competitive advantage against many, if not all,\ncompanies in our space, such as Cisco, Rad, Nokia, Siemens, Belden and others.\nWe have hundreds of large, medium and small network operators as end users of our products, including municipalities, railway, airports, electricity, water infrastructure\ncompanies as well as other governmental agencies and military customers. We believe that we enjoy a strong reputation for offering reliable, high-performance and high-end\nproducts. We expect that the acceptance process for our new products for existing customers will become simpler due to customers positive accumulated experience working\nwith us. We also have many non-exclusive third-party distributors, resellers and system integrators and partners around the world, located in the U.S., Canada, Philippines,\nGermany, Italy, Spain, Scandinavian countries, Greece, Netherlands, Japan and India. These non-exclusive third-party distributors are used to selling our products, and we\nbelieve that they appreciate the reliability of our products and the quality of service and support that we provide. All of these advantages constitute an entry barrier, which we\nbelieve may make it more difficult for a competitor to reach a similar status.\nWe believe that over the past years, we have built a reputation for providing, according to our customers, reliable, high-quality communication solutions with better copper\nand hybrid fiber performance than other alternatives on the market. A competitor who wants to enter the market will have to compete with our reputation, which has been\nacquired over a long period by providing long-term quality service to hundreds of network operators and hundreds of thousands of end customers and IoT elements.\nOur Sales and Marketing Strategy\nWe operate through two regions — Americas and International (consisting of EMEA, or Europe, Middle East and Africa, and APAC, or Asia Pacific) in a matrix with a\nvertical structure that is described below. Our sales and support teams are currently located in the United States, Mexico, Germany, Israel, and India. We also execute our sales\nand marketing plan through a multi-channel by vertical global approach that combines our expertise with the expertise of our trusted business partners. Our current business\npartners, as well as the partners we will seek in the future, are system integrators, distributors, contractors, resellers, and consultants. Our business partners are currently located\nin North America, Central America, Europe, India, Singapore, China, Australia, Vietnam and Japan. Once we identify a relevant business opportunity in a new territory, we seek\nto partner with local business partners or agents. We believe our strong brand name of high-quality communication solutions, as well as the credibility we gain with esteemed\ncustomers such as the U.S. DoD, enhances our ability to provide our products and services. For example, we achieved UL laboratories compliance with FIPS 140-2\ncybersecurity standard required by the United States Department of Defence (DoD) and the Joint Interoperability Test Command (JITC) labs approval of the Company’s\nproducts for cybersecurity and interoperability, putting the products in the DoD Approved Products List (APL).\n9\nWe operate a vertical-based marketing plan where we dedicate tailored solutions and individual resources to each specific vertical. Our verticals include Intelligent Traffic\nSystems (ITS), rail, smart city, Telecom, utilities, federal and military.\nITS\nITS include customers who manage road systems such as departments of traffic on either the municipality, county, state, or national level. The types of applications in this\nvertical that require communication include road cameras, lane management systems, and road signs.\nRail\nRail systems include customers who own and operate traditional inter-city rail lines as well as light rails. Some applications requiring communication in this vertical are\ncentral train control systems, rail signals, safety cameras and alert sensors, and rail station communication. We currently have projects within this vertical in North America,\nEurope, and Asia Pacific.\nFederal and Military\nOur current and future federal and military federal aviation authorities, US military, Air Force and Navy bases, and other government and military facilities. For example,\nduring 2022, we were selected by Norseman Defense Technologies as an authorized sales partner to provide our solutions to all branches of the US Military and Government.\nThe types of applications within this vertical that requiring communication include radars, perimeter security systems, energy systems, offices, laboratories and residences. We\ncurrently have projects within this vertical in North America, Europe and Asia Pacific.\nAirports\nAirports include customers who are either a State or Federal airport agency, or a service provider to the airport industry. The types of applications within this vertical\nrequiring communication are airport security, baggage management, and airport Wi-Fi. Since 2022, we are delivering to our airport integration customer, who is a worldwide\nmarket-leader in airport operation technology, with which we signed an agreement to provide our solutions to hundreds of airports in 39 countries.\nEnergy and Water\nEnergy and water include customers such as electric utilities, oil companies and water utilities. The types of applications within this vertical that require communication are\nsub-station monitoring, oil and gas pipeline and refineries, electric and water flow monitoring, and perimeter security. We have projects within this vertical in North America\nand Europe.\nSmart City\nWe believe the goal of nearly any city worldwide is to become smarter and better serve its residents and visitors. Smart city customers include such municipalities. The\ntypes of applications in this vertical requiring communication include security cameras, parking management, energy and water management, waste management, digital signs,\nand provision of Wi-Fi connectivity. We currently have projects in more than 100 cities, mostly in North America and Europe.\nTelco\nTelco customers include communication service providers of both wired and wireless services (including 4G and 5G). The types of applications within this vertical\nrequiring communication include enterprise offices, branch offices, residential buildings, educational facilities and back-haul for mobile base stations.\n10\nChannel and Territory coverage\nThe majority of our business is conducted indirectly through various types of business partners, namely system integrators, distributors, contractors, resellers and\nconsultants. Nevertheless, our team often accompanies a channel partner during the selling process to help secure a deal with an end-user. We seek to cover the geographic\nterritories in which we sell, in combination with the target verticals described above. In this effort, we take advantage of existing strong relationships with business partners in\nthe United States, Canada, Europe, Latin America, and Asia Pacific and also seek to recruit new business partners that can help us expand our coverage.\nIn addition, we maintain a website (at www.actelis.com) tailored to the IoT strategy and is expanding our marketing initiatives (professional organizations, shows, online\ntargeting, online campaigns and lead generation) to grow our opportunity pipeline.\nWe operate through two main regional sales teams — Americas and International (consisting of EMEA (Europe, Middle East and Africa) and APAC (Asia Pacific)) in a\nvertical model similar to that which was described in our marketing strategy above and generates its pipeline of leads and opportunities through a combination of channel\npresence, on-line presence as well as direct touch. Our sales teams are very experienced in the target verticals and have significant competencies in the target networks of\ndecision makers. We intend to invest in expanding this presence and strength.\nSoftware and Services\nOur products consist of hardware and an embedded software that function together to deliver the product’s essential functionality. Our products are sold with a two-year\nwarranty for repairs or replacements of the product in the event of damage or failure during the term of the support period, which is accounted for as a standard warranty.\nServices relating to repair or replacement of hardware beyond the standard warranty period are offered under renewable, fee-based contracts and include telephone support,\nremote diagnostics, and access to on-site technical support personnel.\nWe also offer our customers our EMS management software, either as perpetual or term-based. EMS is optional and is being sold separately from our hardware products,\nand has been sold either as a per-element license, or as a license for a whole network.\nOur customers may request added functions and features for their specific need which we can customize for an additional fee.\nWe also offer our customers product support services which include telephone support, remote diagnostics, and access to on-site technical support personnel. Such support\nservice is sold as a standalone contract or in combination with EMS management software and is offered for a term, usually 12 months with a renewal option.\nAdditionally, our customers can purchase software support service which allow them to receive some additional features or free upgrades. Such support service is sold as a\nseparate contract.\nWe offer service contracts at different levels (Silver, Gold, Platinum), which may include different levels of support (remotely or in the field), hardware repairs, spare parts,\nhelp with network design, and SW/HW upgrades. Such service contracts are sold separately from the sale of hardware products and may be sold combined with our EMS\nsoftware licenses. It usually covers periods post the expiration of our warranty period and would be renewed on an annual basis. The cost of the service is derived from the size\nof the network, and the level of support required.\nCompetition\nWe compete in markets for networking and communications services and solutions for service providers, businesses, government agencies and other organizations\nworldwide. While our hybrid-fiber offerings are unique in our opinion, providing the highest value to network operators, our customer may still elect to implement their\nnetworks in other ways.\n11\nAs such we compete with a number of companies in the markets we serve. Our key competitors include Moxa Technologies, FlexDSL Telecommunications AG,\nEtherWAN Systems, Inc. and Belden Inc.\nWe believe the following competitive attributes are necessary for our solutions to successfully compete in IoT and Telecom networking markets, and likewise we believe\nthat we are providing leading products in all the categories below:\n● the performance and reliability of our solutions over any wireline (non-wireless) medium;\nRapid deployment/implementation\n● cost of deployment and return on investment in terms of cost savings;\n● sophistication, novel and innovative intellectual property and technology, and functionality of our offerings;\n● cross-platform operability;\n● security;\n● ease of implementation and use of service;\n● management capabilities;\n● high-quality customer support; and\n● price.\nWe believe that we compare favorably on the basis of the factors listed above. However, many of our competitors have substantially greater financial, technical, and\nmarketing resources; relationships with large vendor partners; larger global presence; larger customer bases; longer operating histories; greater brand recognition; and more\nestablished relationships in the industry than we do. Furthermore, new entrants not currently considered to be competitors may enter the market through acquisitions,\npartnerships, or strategic relationships. See “Item 1.A - Risk Factors — New competitors may enter the marketplace and begin to compete with the Company.”\nManufacturing, Procurement and Logistics\nWe take advantage of the combination of our inhouse skills and those of the third parties we partner with to execute our operational tasks which are planning and\nmanufacturing finished goods inventory, planning and procuring raw materials and delivering products to our customers based on promised delivery schedules.\nOur raw material consists of electronic chipsets, FPGA components, modems, and other electronic and mechanical components. Most of those components are procured by\nour contract manufacturers and we assist them as needed in specific cases. For example, since the breakout of COVID-19, as the world is experiencing shortages of electronic\ncomponents, we have assisted our manufacturers in acquiring components that are harder to find. We also secure components as have been designated to be the close to end of\nlife by their manufacturers to ensure adequate quantities of future product shipments.\nOur products are assembled by various contract manufacturers, located in Israel and in Taiwan who possess the expertise of assembly and quality control required for\nelectronic manufacturing in a turn-key fashion. Some of our products are manufactured to our specifications under an OEM arrangement. The company uses state-of-the-art\nlogistics services from the best providers worldwide and also has in-house expertise in executing such required processes.\nWe believe that we can add and/or replace our contract manufacturer if necessary. We have successfully transitioned from one contract manufacturer to another in the past,\nand we believe that a transition would be achievable, if necessary, in the future typically within three to six months.\n12\nWarranty\nOur products are generally sold with a standard warranty of two years for product defects, as well as technical center support with properly trained personnel, during\nnormal business hours, to address incidents raised customers. Within the warranty agreement, we offer to repair or replace defective products, or software bug fixes. Upon\nexpiration of the warranty period, the customer has an option to purchase an extended warranty contract for an additional fee, typically for one or more periods of 12 months.\nGrowth Strategy\nGlobal Expansion and Recognition\nWe intend to leverage (a) the customers, partners, and representatives’ presence in over 30 countries including the Americas, Europe and Asia, (b) brand recognition\ndeveloped over more than 10 years, and (c) the fact that our products are differentiated, as we believe, and offer unique value — to expand into virtually all IoT verticals, and\nbecome the vendor of choice for cyber-protected building blocks for all IoT networking globally.\nIn order to achieve the right level of global coverage, we continue to expand our network of partners and representatives, as well as reputable advisors, and aim\nincreasingly at partnering with larger numbers of companies with global presence. These can be system-integrators, value-added resellers, contractors, distributors, and\nconsultants. For example, in 2022, we selected Norseman Technologies to serve as a business partner integrator of our products to the Federal and military markets in the US\nthrough their acquisition contracts. Additionally, we signed up new business partners in Europe and Asia Pacific, such as in Singapore, China, Vietnam and Malaysia.\nWe are investing in growing our sales, channel management and support teams, and dedicate resources which specialize in specific verticals in each of the theaters. In\nJuly 2023, we hired a new SVP of Sales, Americas who is executing campaigns our sales strategy in the United States, Canada, Central and South America. We continued in\n2023 to invest in marketing activities through social media, industry shows and conferences and other online means. We also are investing in lead-generation and management\ninternally and through third-parties who specialize in this practice.\nExpansion of Multi-year deals\nOver the past years, we entered into several large multi-year contracts with ITS, military, airports, and more that will generate more predictable sales for the next\nseveral years. For example, since the IPO, we announced several new deals we won or started to deliver, such as the worldwide airport technology provider, a provider of\nenergy services to a major European city in a major European country, the city of San Jose, California and Northern Ireland railways. We intend to expand this strategy by\ninvesting in sales and marketing presence to extend the length these contracts and add many others.\nExpansion into Cybersecurity, Recurring Revenue Model\nCybersecurity is essential for IoT infrastructure. Such security must be addressed at the data traffic, switching, and network management level. Encryption is a fundamental\nbuilding block to achieve the necessary protection, preferably at a low networking layer. Our products are already capable of delivering sensitive information for many critical\nIoT applications, and we are investing more in making this a strong differentiator, and to have our products recognized as the most cyber-safe IoT building blocks in the\ngrowing secure IoT communication market.\nBeyond that, we are expanding our cyber-protection capabilities to provide protection not only of the data that is running in the system but also to help protect elements and\ndevices connected to the network, especially in the interface between the physical and cybersecurity systems. We are referring to such objective as Cyber-Aware Networking.\nAdding the 5G Connectivity for IoT\nA dense grid of 5G small cells is required in order to build a global 5G coverage, which, as we believe, may be key to IoT deployment in many smart cities and other dense\nareas. We believe that connecting these 5G small cells to the network cost effectively and rapidly, in both hard-to-reach and easy-to-reach locations, as well as powering them\ncost-effectively is key to successful and timely deployment.\n13\n5G networks deployment is slowed down, as we believe, by the challenge to provide connectivity and power to millions of base station locations that are required for an\neffective 5G network.\nAdding Edge Computing Capabilities\nOnce mass deployment of our IoT connectivity building blocks is achieved, we are planning to leverage our presence in the field to offer our customers the option to host\nand integrate various applications into our building blocks, many of which will be installed in critical information junctions for IoT networks. Such applications may include\nvideo analysis, data monitoring and extraction, firewalls and many others, and would enable our customers, as we believe, to develop recurring revenue models for them as well\nas for us.\nSome examples for such applications that we have been evaluating are:\n● Enhanced cyber-protection for devices and users;\n● Video processing and machine vision (serving the AI ecosystem such as, intruder detection, road safety and robotics); and\n● Smart video transmission/compression for delivery of video over 5G/mobile networks.\nWe began working on such capabilities in 2023, and expect applications to be released starting late 2024.\nUnited States’ Bipartisan Infrastructure Law\nIn November 2021, President Biden signed the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to invest approximately $1.2 trillion to significantly upgrade the United States’ infrastructure.\nSpecifically, the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law mandates investing the following amounts: $110 billion to rebuild many of America’s roads and bridges; $39 billion in public\ntransit; $66 billion in high-speed rail; $108 billion to upgrade the nation’s electricity grid; $55 billion to expand access to clean drinking water; $25 billion to modernize several\nUS airports; $650 billion in previous authorized funding for roads including nearly $300 billion for the Highway Trust Fund; and $65 billion to ensure that every American has\naccess to high-speed internet through deploying broadband infrastructure.\nWe believe that this significant increase in infrastructure spending by the United States Government will likely result in investments in our communication infrastructure\nsolutions, as these spending initiatives are aimed at our targeted verticals.\nGrowth through Mergers and Acquisitions\nWe continue to evaluate potential growth through mergers and acquisitions opportunities in situations where we believe that a transaction will fill business gaps or add key\nbusiness operations without requiring us to wait years for marketing and sales cycles to materialize. The resulting combination of our existing products and services, new key\npersonnel, and strategic partnerships through M&A could provide new offerings to our existing market.\nIf we target businesses in the same sector or location, we hope to combine resources to reduce costs, eliminate duplicate facilities or departments and increase revenue. We\nbelieve this strategy will provide for accelerated growth and maximize investor returns.\nEnvironmental\nWe are not aware of any environmental laws that have been enacted, nor are we aware of any such laws being contemplated for the future, that impact issues specific to our\nbusiness.\nHuman Capital Resources\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had approximately 49 employees and contractors, of which 43 were full-time employees, including 19 in sales and marketing, 22 in research\ndevelopment, engineering, and operations and 8 in general and administration. We have approximately 34 employees and contractors in Israel, 11 in the U.S., 3 in Europe and 1\nin Asia. Our U.S.-based employees are employed through a Professional Employer Organization, providing employee benefits and services.\n14\nWe believe our culture and principles enable us to attract, retain, motivate and develop our workforce as well as drive employee engagement. We believe an engaged\nworkforce leads to a more innovative and productive company that serves its customers better. Our employees work to ensure that our products and services connect and protect\nour customers critical infrastructure. A testament to that is the long-term retention of many of our employees and their loyalty to us. We measure each one through a goal setting\nand measurement system to maximize our enterprise value and employee career potential.\nWe support and strive for ethnic and gender diversity.\nLegal Proceedings\nFrom time to time, we may be involved in various claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business. To the knowledge of our management, there are no\nlegal proceedings currently pending against us which we believe would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and, to the best\nof our knowledge, there are no such legal proceedings contemplated or threatened. Regardless of outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on us because of defense and\nsettlement costs, diversion of management resources and other factors.\nGovernment Regulation\nOur products are required to be certified for safety and local standards in each country that we sell in as needed. In the United States, Canada, Europe, and Japan our\nproducts are UL certified (safety), EN (emissions Regulation), VCCI (Japanese emissions standard), CISPR (European emission standard), ICES (Canadian radio frequency\nemissions standards), ETSI (European electromagnetic compatibility standard), CFR (US Federal Broadcasting Regulation), as well as IEC (European Safety Standard). We\nhave also received the JITC (Joint Interoperability Test Command) certification of meeting certain cybersecurity standards required by the U.S. Department of Defense.\nWe are subject to numerous federal, state, provincial, local, and foreign laws and regulations relating to the storage, handling, emission, and discharge of materials into the\nenvironment, including the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act; the Clean Water Act; the Clean Air Act; the Emergency Planning and\nCommunity Right-To-Know Act; the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act; and similar laws in the other countries in which we operate. While we believe that our existing\nenvironmental control procedures are adequate, we will continue to evaluate and update our procedures as needed to address new or changing aspects of environmental matters.\nIntellectual Property\nWe rely on a combination of trade secrets, patent, trademark and copyright laws in the United States, as well as intellectual property licenses and other contractual rights\n(including confidentiality procedures, contractual provisions, and non-disclosure and assignment-of-intellectual property agreements with our employees, independent\ncontractors, consultants and companies with which we conduct business) to establish and protect our A.I. technology, intellectual property and proprietary rights, trade secrets,\ndatabases, and our brand.\nWe have registered Actelis Networks as a service trademark in the United States, and we are the registered holder of the domain name Actelis.com that includes “Actelis\nNetworks, Inc.”. We also have 17 registered patents in the United States; 5 registered patents in Europe, 1 registered patent in Mexico, 1 registered patent in Indonesia, and 1\nWIPO patent application, all of which in the general area of high-speed carrier class Ethernet service and transport over bonded VDSL2, G.SHDSL as well as Fiber covering\nvarious aspects of our technology. While we continue to consult with counsel on the advisability to seek patent protection of some of our algorithms, we rely heavily on trade\nsecrets to protect our intellectual property around our technology.\nWithout accounting for any potential patent term adjustments or extensions or other forms of exclusivity with respect to our U.S. issued patents, 4 expire between 2024 and\n2026, 5 expire between 2027 and 2030, and 8 expire between 2031 and 2038. Any patent issuing from the pending WIPO patent application will begin to expire in 2041. With\nrespect to our European patents, 3 European patents are expected to expire between 2024 and 2026, and 2 European patent is expected to expire between 2027 and 2038. Our\nMexican patent is expected to expire in 2026 and our Indonesian patent is expected to expire in 2028.\n15\nWe continue to maintain our intellectual property and confidential business information in a number of ways. For instance, we have a policy of requiring all employees and\nconsultants to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of an employment or consulting relationship with us. Our employee agreements also require relevant\nemployees to assign to us all rights to any inventions made or conceived during their employment with us in accordance with applicable law. In addition, we have a policy of\nrequiring individuals and entities with which we discuss potential business relationships to sign non-disclosure agreements. Lastly, our agreements with clients include\nconfidentiality and non-disclosure provisions.\nCorporate Information\nWe were incorporated in Delaware in 1998.

You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, together with all of the other\ninformation in this Annual Report, before deciding to invest in our common stock. The risks and uncertainties described below may not be the only ones we face. If any of the\nrisks actually occur, our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects could be harmed. In that event, the trading price of our common stock could decline,\nand you could lose part or all of your investment. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our\nbusiness operations.\nSummary Risk Factors\nOur business is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that you should consider before investing in our company. You should carefully consider all of the risks\ndescribed more fully in the section titled “Risk Factors” in this Annual Report on page 19, before deciding to invest in our common stock. If any of these risks actually occurs,\nour business, financial condition and results of operations would likely be materially adversely affected. These key risks, include, but are not limited to, the following:\nRisks Related to Our Business\n● We have a history of net losses, may incur substantial net losses in the future, and may not achieve or sustain profitability or growth in future periods. If we cannot\nachieve and sustain profitability, our business, financial condition, and operating results will be adversely affected.\n● We have negative cash flow from our operations and, given our projected funding needs, our ability to generate positive cash flow is uncertain.\n● Our shares of common stock could be delisted from the Nasdaq Capital Market if we fail to regain compliance with the Nasdaq’s stockholders’ equity continued listing\nstandards. Our ability to publicly or privately sell equity securities and the liquidity of our shares of common stock could be adversely affected if we are delisted from\nthe Nasdaq Capital Market.\n● Our financial condition raises substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern.\n16\n● Unfavorable global economic or political conditions could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\n● Prolonged inflation rates could negatively impact our revenues and profitability if increases in the prices of our products or a decrease in customer spending results in\nlower sales.\n● We may need to raise additional capital to meet our business requirements in the future, and such capital raising may be costly or difficult to obtain and could dilute\nour stockholders’ ownership interests.\n● Our indebtedness could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund operations, limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry\nand prevent us from meeting our financial obligations.\n● To support our business growth, in the past years we increased our focus on serving certain IoT verticals, while continuing to serve our existing Telco customers. This\nchange in our strategy may make it more difficult to evaluate our business growth and future prospects, and may increase the risk that we will not be successful in our\nplans.\n● We may have ineffective sales and marketing efforts.\n● We outsource our product manufacturing and are dependent on our key manufacturers, and on our component and OEM suppliers. We are susceptible to problems, and\nhave encountered problems in the past, in connection with procurement, decreasing quality, reliability, and protectability.\n● Demand for our products and solutions may not grow or may decline.\n● Our gross margins may not increase or may deteriorate.\n● Changes in the price and availability of our raw materials and shipping could be detrimental to our profitability.\n● Expanding our operations and marketing efforts to meet expected growth may impact profitability if actual growth is less than expected.\n● If our internal Company cyber-security measures are breached or fail and unauthorized access is obtained to our IT environment, we may incur significant losses of\ndata, which we may not be able to recover and may experience a delay in our ability to conduct our day-to-day business.\n● We provide cyber security features as part of our products that may not completely prevent information security breaches, and our products are installed in live\ncustomer environments and may be compromised by cyber-attacks and damage customer assets.\n● We depend on key information systems and third-party service providers.\n● We depend on our management team and other key employees, and the loss of one or more of these employees or an inability to attract and retain highly skilled\nemployees could adversely affect our business.\n● We may face the effects of increased competition and rapid technological changes.\n● Our results of operations are likely to fluctuate from quarter to quarter and year to year, which could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.\n● The loss of one or more of our significant customers, or any other reduction in the amount of revenue we derive from any such customer, would adversely affect our\nbusiness, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\n● We are currently operating in a period of economic uncertainty and capital markets disruption, which has been significantly impacted by geopolitical instability due to\nthe ongoing military conflicts between Russia and Ukraine and between Israel and Hamas and Hezbollah. Our business, financial condition and results of operations\nmay be materially adversely affected by any negative impact on the global economy and capital markets resulting from the conflict in Ukraine and Israel or any other\ngeopolitical tensions.\n17\nRisks Related to Protecting Our Technology and Intellectual Property\n● Claims by others that we infringe their intellectual property could force us to incur significant costs or revise the way we conduct our business.\n● Our patents and proprietary technology may be challenged or disputed.\n● Any failure to protect our intellectual property rights could impair our ability to protect our proprietary technology and our brand.\n● The lives of our patents may not be sufficient to effectively protect our products and business.\nRisks Related to Managing Our Business Operations in Israel\n● Conditions in the Middle East and in Israel, where our research and development facilities are located, may harm our operations.\n● Actelis Israel received Israeli government grants for certain of our research and development activities, the terms of which require us to pay royalties and satisfy\nspecified conditions in order to manufacture products and transfer technologies outside of Israel. If we fail to satisfy these conditions, we may be required to pay\npenalties and refund grants previously received.\n● We may be adversely affected by fluctuations in the currency exchange rate of the Israeli Shekel.\n● Unanticipated changes in our effective tax rate and additional tax liabilities, including those resulting from our international operations or the implementation of new\ntax rules, could harm our future results.\nRisks Related to our Common Stock\n● The requirements of being a public company may strain our resources, divert management’s attention, and affect our ability to attract and retain executive management\nand qualified board members.\n● We have identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting. If we experience material weaknesses in the future or otherwise fail to\nimplement and maintain an effective system of internal controls in the future, we may not be able to accurately report our financial condition or results of operations\nwhich may adversely affect investor confidence in us, and as a result, the value of our common stock.\n● If we fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud. As a\nresult, stockholders could lose confidence in our financial and other public reporting, which would harm our business and the trading price of our common stock.\n18\nRISK FACTORS\nInvesting in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, together with all of the other\ninformation in this Annual Report, before deciding to invest in our common stock. The risks and uncertainties described below may not be the only ones we face. If any of the\nrisks actually occur, our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects could be harmed. In that event, the trading price of our common stock could decline,\nand you could lose part or all of your investment. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our\nbusiness operations.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe have a history of net losses, may incur substantial net losses in the future, and may not achieve or sustain profitability or growth in future periods. If we cannot achieve\nand sustain profitability, our business, financial condition, and operating results will be adversely affected.\nWe have incurred net losses in recent years, and we may not achieve or maintain profitability in the future. We experienced a net loss of $6.3 million and $11.0 million in\nthe years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. As a result, we had an accumulated deficit of $39.7 million as of December 31, 2023. We cannot predict when or\nwhether we will reach or maintain profitability.\nWe may also increase our operating expenses in the future as we continue to invest for our future growth, including expanding our research and development function to\ndrive further development of our platform, expanding our sales and marketing activities, developing the functionality to expand into adjacent markets, and reaching customers\nin new geographic locations, which will negatively affect our operating results if our total revenues do not increase. In addition to the anticipated costs to grow our business, we\nalso expect to incur significant additional legal, accounting, and other expenses as a newly public company. These efforts and additional expenses may be more costly than we\nexpect, and we cannot guarantee that we will be able to increase our revenues to offset our operating expenses. Any failure to increase our revenues or to manage our costs as\nwe invest in our business would prevent us from achieving or maintaining profitability.\nThere is no guaranty that we will be able to generate the revenue necessary to support our cost structure or obtain the level of financing necessary for our operations.\nWe have incurred significant losses and negative cash flows from operations and incurred losses of $6.3 million and $11.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2023\nand 2022, respectively. During the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, we had negative cash flows from operations of $6.6 million and $7.8 million, respectively. As of\nDecember 31, 2023, our accumulated deficit was $39.7 million. We have funded our operations to date through equity financing and have cash on hand (including short term\nbank deposits and restricted cash equivalents) of $2.4 million and long-term restricted cash and cash equivalents and restricted bank deposits of $3.4 million as of December 31,\n2023. We monitor our cash flow projections on a current basis and take active measures to obtain the funding it requires to continue our operations. However, these cash flow\nprojections are subject to various uncertainties concerning their fulfilment such as the ability to increase revenues by attracting and expanding its customer base or reducing\ncost structure. If we will not succeed in generating sufficient cash flow or completing additional financing, then it will need to execute a cost reduction plan that has been\nprepared. Our transition to profitable operations is dependent on generating a level of revenue adequate to support our cost structure. We expect to fund operations using cash\non hand, through operational cash flows and raising additional proceeds. There are no assurances, however, we will be able to generate the revenue necessary to support our\ncost structure or that we will be successful in obtaining the level of financing necessary for its operations.\nFurthermore, we may continue to incur negative cash flow from operating and investing activities for the foreseeable future as we expect to incur research and\ndevelopment, sales and marketing, and general and administrative expenses and make capital expenditures in our efforts to increase our sales. Our business also will at times\nrequire significant amounts of working capital to support our growth of additional platforms. An inability to generate positive cash flow from operating activities for the near\nterm may adversely affect our ability to raise needed capital for our business on reasonable terms, or at all, diminish supplier or customer willingness to enter into transactions\nwith us, and have other adverse effects that may decrease our long-term viability. There can be no assurance that we will achieve positive cash flow in the near future or at all.\n19\nOur financial condition raises substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern.\nOur consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue to operate as a going concern. These events and conditions, along with other\nmatters, indicate that a material uncertainty exists that may cast significant doubt on our ability to continue as a going concern. This going concern determination could\nmaterially limit our ability to raise additional funds through the issuance of equity or debt securities or otherwise. Further financial statements may include an explanatory\nparagraph with respect to our ability to continue as a going concern. There can be no assurance that we will succeed in generating sufficient revenues from our product sales to\ncontinue our operations as a going concern. If funds are not available to us, we may be required to delay, reduce the scope of, or eliminate research or development plans for, or\ncommercialization efforts with respect to our products. This may raise substantial doubts about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nOur shares of common stock could be delisted from the Nasdaq Capital Market if we fail to regain compliance with the Nasdaq’s stockholders’ equity continued listing\nstandards. Our ability to publicly or privately sell equity securities and the liquidity of our shares of common stock could be adversely affected if we are delisted from the\nNasdaq Capital Market.\nOn August 25, 2023, we received a notification letter from the Nasdaq Staff indicating that we are not in compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(b)(1) due to our\nfailure to meet the Minimum Shareholders’ Equity Requirement or any alternatives to such requirement. In order to maintain our listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market, we\nsubmitted a plan of compliance addressing how we intended to regain compliance. We had until February 21, 2024 to evidence compliance with the Minimum Shareholders’\nEquity Requirement. As of the date of this Annual Report, we have not provided such evidence. In the event that our shares of common stock would be subject to delisting, we\nintend to timely request a hearing before the Panel.\nWe have in the past, and may in the future, be unable to comply with certain of the listing standards that we are required to meet to maintain the listing of our ordinary\nshares on Nasdaq. For instance, on November 3, 2022, we received notification from the Nasdaq Staff that we were not in compliance with the minimum bid price requirement\nset forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2). Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) requires listed securities to maintain a minimum bid price of $1.00 per share and Nasdaq Listing\nRule 5810(c)(3)(A) provides that a failure to meet the minimum bid price requirement exists if the deficiency continues for a period of 30 consecutive business days. In\naccordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A), we had an initial grace period of 180 calendar days, or until May 2, 2023 (the “Minimum Bid Price Compliance Period”),\nto regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement. On April 19, 2023, we implemented a 1-for-10 reverse stock split. One of the primary intents for the\nconsolidation was that the anticipated increase in the price of our shares of common stock immediately following and resulting from a reverse stock split due to the reduction in\nthe number of issued and outstanding shares of ordinary shares would help us meet the price criteria for continued listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market. On May 3, 2023, we\nreceived a notification from the Nasdaq Staff that we had regained compliance with the Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2).\nIf we fail to satisfy the continued listing requirements of Nasdaq, such as minimum stockholders’ equity requirements or minimum bid price requirements, Nasdaq may\ntake steps to delist our shares of common stock. Such a delisting would have a negative effect on the price of our shares of common stock, impair the ability to sell or purchase\nour shares of common stock when persons wish to do so, and any delisting materially adversely affect our ability to raise capital or pursue strategic restructuring, refinancing or\nother transactions on acceptable terms, or at all. Delisting from Nasdaq could also have other negative results, including the potential loss of institutional investor interest and\nfewer business development opportunities, as well as a limited amount of news and analyst coverage of us. Delisting could also result in a determination that our shares of\ncommon stock are a “penny stock,” which would require brokers trading in our shares of common stock to adhere to more stringent rules, possibly resulting in a reduced level\nof trading activity in the secondary market for our shares of common stock. In the event of a delisting, we would attempt to take actions to restore our compliance with\nNasdaq’s listing requirements, but we can provide no assurance that any such action taken by us would allow our shares of common stock to become listed again, stabilize the\nmarket price or improve the liquidity of our securities, prevent our shares of common stock from dropping below the Nasdaq minimum bid price requirement or prevent future\nnon-compliance with Nasdaq’s listing requirements.\n20\nUnfavorable global economic or political conditions could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur business is susceptible to general conditions in the global economy and in the global financial markets. A global financial crisis or a global or regional political\ndisruption has caused, and could in the future cause, extreme volatility in the capital and credit markets. A severe or prolonged economic downturn, including a recession, the\ncurrently prolonged inflationary economic environment, continued rising interest rates, debt and equity market fluctuations, diminished liquidity and credit availability,\nincreased unemployment rates, decreased investor and consumer confidence, supply chain challenges, natural catastrophes, the effects of climate change, regional and global\nconflicts and terrorist attacks or political disruption or turmoil could result in a variety of risks to our business, including weakened demand for our product candidates or any\nfuture product candidates, if approved, and our ability to raise additional capital when needed on acceptable terms, if at all. A weak or declining economy or political disruption\ncould also strain our manufacturers or suppliers, possibly resulting in supply disruption, or cause our customers to delay making payments for our potential products. Any of the\nforegoing could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects, and we cannot anticipate all of the ways in which the\npolitical or economic climate and financial market conditions could adversely impact our business.\nProlonged inflation rates could negatively impact our revenues and profitability if increases in the prices of our products or a decrease in customer spending results in\nlower sales which would adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nInflation rates, particularly in the United States and Israel, have increased in 2023 and are prolonged in the past months, at levels not seen in years in many countries where\nour customers reside. Continued and increased inflation may result in decreased demand for our products and services, increased operating costs (including our labor costs),\nreduced liquidity, and limitations on our ability to access credit or otherwise raise debt and equity capital. In addition, the United States Federal Reserve has raised, and may\nagain raise, interest rates in response to concerns about inflation. Increases in interest rates, especially if coupled with reduced government spending and volatility in financial\nmarkets, may have the effect of further increasing economic uncertainty and heightening these risks. In an inflationary environment, we may be unable to raise the sales prices\nof our products at or above the rate at which our costs increase, which could have a material and adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nAccordingly, the U.S. dollar has strengthened against foreign currencies as a result of the United States Federal Reserve’s actions to lower inflation, which is affecting our\nbusiness partners, where they sell local currency to the end-user of our products and services.\nWe may need to raise additional capital to meet our business requirements in the future, and such capital raising may be costly or difficult to obtain and could dilute our\nstockholders’ ownership interests.\nIn order for us to pursue our business objectives, we may need to raise additional capital, which additional capital may not be available on reasonable terms or at all. Any\nadditional capital raised through the sale of equity or equity-backed securities may dilute our shareholders’ ownership percentages and could also result in a decrease in the\nmarket value of our equity securities. The terms of any securities issued by us in future capital transactions may be more favorable to new investors, and may include\npreferences, superior voting rights and the issuance of warrants or other derivative securities, which may have a further dilutive effect on the holders of any of our securities\nthen outstanding. In addition, we may incur substantial costs in pursuing future capital financing, including investment banking fees, legal fees, accounting fees, securities law\ncompliance fees, printing and distribution expenses and other costs. We may also be required to recognize non-cash expenses in connection with certain securities we issue,\nsuch as convertible notes and warrants, which may adversely impact our financial condition.\n21\nOur indebtedness could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund operations, limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry and\nprevent us from meeting our financial obligations.\nWe currently have two outstanding loans, with Migdalor, in the original principal amount of approximately $6 million, of which approximately $4.0 million remains\noutstanding as of December 31, 2023, and with Hamizrahi-Tefahot Bank with which we signed a credit line agreement in February 2024, off of which we have used\napproximately $552,000 to-date, and which are secured by all our assets (where our accounts receivable asset is carved out from Migdalor’s senior security for Mizrahi-Tefahot\nBank). If we cannot generate sufficient cash flow from operations to service our debt, we may need to further refinance our debt, dispose of assets or issue equity to obtain\nnecessary funds.\nFurthermore, on December 21, 2022, pursuant to the terms of the Senior Loan Agreement between Migdalor and our wholly owned subsidiary, Actelis Networks Israel,\nLtd., dated December 2, 2020, as amended (the “Loan Agreement”), to satisfy our obligation associated with the cover/debt ratio (as defined in the Loan Agreement), we\ndeposited $2 million to a Company-owned interest bearing bank account, or the “designated account” (as defined in the Loan Agreement). An additional $2.0 million was\ndeposited in the designated account on or about February 28, 2023, as agreed between Migdalor and us. As of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our designated\naccount has a balance covering the loan principal balance at approximately 100%.\nIn February 2024, we entered into a new credit line facility from an Israeli bank of up to $1.5 million that increases the Company’s operating liquidity while not increasing\nthe Company’s total debt, as the Company will perform an early repayment of its existing debt using its restricted cash in a similar amount. The new credit line will be secured\nby customer invoices and will incur interest at a Federal SOFR rate plus 5.5% and is available until the end of 2024, with possible extension. At the same time, the Company\nplans to perform a partial early repayment of its existing debt facility with Migdalor under the Loan Agreement using its restricted cash at an amount equal to the amount of\nfunding from the new credit line, therefore leaving the total debt amount at a similar level.\nWe do not know whether we will be able to generate sufficient cash flow from operations or raise additional capital to fund operating activities on a timely basis, on terms\nsatisfactory to us, or at all. Our indebtedness could have important consequences, including:\n● our ability to obtain additional debt or equity financing for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, acquisitions and general corporate or other\npurposes may be limited;\n● a portion of our cash flows from operations will be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on the indebtedness and will not be available for other purposes,\nincluding operations, capital expenditures and future business opportunities;\n● our ability to adjust to changing market conditions may be limited and may place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to less-leveraged competitors, if such\nexist; and\n● we may be vulnerable during a downturn in general economic conditions or in our business, or may be unable to carry on capital spending that is important to our\ngrowth.\nTo support our business growth, in the past years we increased our focus on serving certain IoT verticals, while continuing to serve our existing Telco customers. This\nchange in our strategy may make it more difficult to evaluate our business growth and future prospects, and may increase the risk that we will not be successful in our\nplans.\nSince our inception, our business was focused on serving Telcos for enterprises and residential customers. Our products and solutions have been deployed with more than\n100 telecommunication service providers worldwide, in enterprise, residential and mobile base station connectivity applications. In recent years, as we have further developed\nour technology and rolled out additional products, we turned our focus on serving the IoT markets. Our operations are focused on our fast-growing IoT business, while\nmaintaining our commitment to our existing Telco customers. A portion of our revenue continues to be derived from our existing Telco customers. For the years ended\nDecember 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, our Telco customers in the aggregate decreased from approximately 35% of our revenues in the year ended December 31, 2022, to\n27% in the year ended December 31, 2023.\n22\nOur change in strategy and our efforts to serve the IoT verticals that we have focused on may prove more expensive than we currently anticipate, or may require longer\ndevelopment and deployment times, and we may not succeed in fully penetrating such IoT verticals, or at all.\nWe may have ineffective sales and marketing efforts.\nOur sales and marketing efforts to drive growth may be ineffective as we try to win new deals either directly with end-user customers, or indirectly through business\npartners, distributors, system integrators or value-add resellers. These ineffective efforts may cause us to miss our planned growth and harm our financial results.\nWe outsource our product manufacturing and are dependent on our key manufacturers, and on our component and OEM suppliers. We are susceptible to problems, and\nhave encountered problems in the past, in connection with procurement, decreasing quality, reliability, and protectability.\nOur devices are assembled by using fully manufactured parts, the manufacturing of which has been fully outsourced, and we have no direct control over the manufacturing\nprocesses of our products. We outsource procurement and manufacturing activities to certain key manufacturers and certain component and OEM suppliers.\nWe also purchase unique components and products from suppliers who are exclusively able to fulfill such supply. We may lose some or all of these relationships, or have a\nmaterial weakness in negotiating favorable terms, or such unique components have or may be declared end-of-life which may require product design changes. Such\ncircumstances have hurt our profitability in the past, and may hurt our profitability in the future, and negatively affect our ability to deliver our product on time to customers.\nOur lack of control in our manufacturing process due to the fact that we outsource our product manufacturing may increase quality or reliability risks and could limit our\nability to quickly increase or decrease production rates. If necessary, switching production to other or additional subcontractors will entail a material cost and a temporary\ndecrease in our productivity. Our manufacturing process has been disrupted in the past, and may be disrupted in the future, by various factors, including but not limited to\nshipping delays, bottlenecks resulting from raw materials specific shortages, quality problems or a decrease in quality, manpower shortages by the manufacturers or political\nunease that would trigger the closure of a facility or financial insolvency.\nFurthermore, a supplier may discontinue production of a particular part for any number of reasons, which may require us to purchase a large inventory of such discontinued\nparts in order to ensure that a continuous supply of such parts remains available to our customers. Such “end-of-life” parts purchases could result in significant expenditures by\nus in a particular period, and ultimately any unused parts may result in a significant inventory write-off, either of which could have an adverse impact on our financial condition\nand results of operations for the applicable periods. Additionally, in case any part embedded in our products is no longer available, we may be required to redesign such product\nin order to enable usage of alternative parts, or be forced to announce end-of-life of such product. Refer to “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and\nResults of Operations,” for additional information on supply constraints related to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nDemand for our products and solutions may not grow or may decline.\nWe may experience a reduction in customer demand as a result of either of competition from other companies, technological changes required by our target markets, or\ndisruptions of existing and new customer relationships. Such demand reduction will prevent us from realizing our planned growth.\nOur gross margins may not increase or may deteriorate.\nIf our gross margins do not increase as planned or deteriorate, it will be harder for us to achieve profitability, which could substantially impact our business and ability to\ncarry on operations if other financing sources are not secured on satisfactory terms. Our gross margins may deteriorate as a result of either reductions of customers price points,\nincreases in product component and manufacturing costs, or unfavorable changes in the mix between more and less profitable customers and/or products.\n23\nChanges in the price and availability of our raw materials and shipping could be detrimental to our profitability.\nChipsets, electronic and mechanical components are significant components of our products. Over the past two years, the prices and availability of electronic and\nmechanical components have been constantly increasing.\nFurthermore, our products are assembled with various contract manufacturers located in Israel and in Taiwan. As a result of the of COVID-19 pandemic, the world is\nexperiencing shortages of electronic components. We have already experienced instances of limited supply of certain raw materials and shipping delays, which resulted in\nextended lead times, increased shipping costs and higher-than-usual backlogs. If the prices of such components and shipping were to continue to increase, or if shipping delays\ncontinue to occur, such price changes and shipping delays could have a negative effect on our gross margin and have a negative effect on revenues and earnings.\nWe may have previously agreed to set prices with our customers and any changes in supply costs may decrease our margin and directly affect profitability. If prices\nincrease, supply interruptions, shipping delays, or shortages of materials continue to occur, it could have a negative effect on revenues and earnings.\nExpanding our operations and marketing efforts to meet expected growth may impact profitability if actual growth is less than expected.\nTo meet expected growth, we plan to expand operations, including additional hiring, advertising, and promotion. If actual growth is less than expected, it would negatively\nimpact our ability to become profitable, which would require we raise additional capital if required, which may not be available on favorable terms, or at all, which would\nimpact our ability to carry on operations.\nIf our internal company cyber-security measures are breached or fail and unauthorized access is obtained to our IT environment, we may incur significant losses of data,\nwhich we may not be able to recover and may experience a delay in our ability to conduct our day-to-day business.\nAs cybersecurity attacks continue to evolve and increase, our cyber-security measures and our IT environment could be penetrated or compromised by internal and external\nparties’ intent on extracting confidential information, disrupting business processes, corrupting information, or looking to force the Company to pay a ransom. These risks could\narise from external parties or from acts or omissions of internal or service provider personnel. Such unauthorized access could disrupt our business and could result in the loss\nof assets, litigation, remediation costs, damage to our reputation and failure to retain or attract customers following such an event, which could adversely affect our business.\nCyber attackers update their methods frequently. Sometimes cyberattacks are unrecognizable at the time of their occurrence and even long after. In addition, cyber incidents\ncan occur as a result of non-technological failures, like human error or malicious acts. In some cases, information security incidents at our customers or suppliers can also lead\nto information security incidents in our information systems. For these reasons, we cannot guarantee that the safeguards taken by us and the safeguards we will take in the\nfuture will completely prevent information security incidents or damages that may result from them as detailed above.\nWe provide cyber security features as part of our products that may not completely prevent information security breaches, and our products are installed in live customer\nenvironments and may be compromised by cyber-attacks and damage customer assets.\nOur products include cyber-security features such as data-traffic encryption that are engineered to protect our customers’ data and environment. Cyber-attacks become\nmore sophisticated and evolve quickly, and these features may fail to protect our customers as intended and fail at preventing information security breaches. We plan to offer\nnew cyber security products and features which we will either develop internally, obtain from partnerships with third-parties, or through acquisitions in the future. These\nplanned new cyber-security products and features may fail to protect our customers as intended and not prevent information security breaches.\nOur products are installed in live customer network environments, and may be subject to cyber-attacks seeking access to our customers networks through our products.\nThose cyber-attack attempts may take advantage of vulnerabilities of our products within the networks, vulnerabilities that may be known or unknown to us.\n24\nOur products and services include information systems and digital data of various types, including data kept by our employees, suppliers, and customers (and their own\ncustomers). In recent years there has been an increase in the frequency and severity of cyber incidents (including cybercrime). This trend is expected to continue in the future\nand even worsen, despite all the defense mechanisms employed against it. Cyber events can lead to unauthorized access, unauthorized disclosure, misuse, disruption, deletion,\nor modification of the Company and its customer assets, data, and processing, as well as disrupting day-to-day operations, computing services, and significantly slowing them\ndown and even disabling information systems.\nIn the event of damage caused by such cyber-attacks, we may suffer negative consequences, such as disruption of the Company’s and/or our customers’ activities,\ndisruption of or disabling information systems, theft of our and/or our customers’ data, or damage to its reputation thus affecting clients’ trust in the Company, and potentially\nexposing it to lawsuits. In such cases, our business results may be severely harmed.\nWe depend on key information systems and third-party service providers.\nWe depend on key information systems to transact our business accurately and efficiently. These systems and services are vulnerable to interruptions or other failures\nresulting from, among other things, natural disasters, terrorist attacks, software, equipment or digital failures, processing errors, computer viruses, other security issues or\nsupplier defaults. Security, backup, and disaster recovery measures may not be adequate or implemented properly to avoid such disruptions or failures. Any disruption or failure\nof these systems or services could cause substantial errors, processing inefficiencies, security breaches, inability to use the systems or process transactions, loss of customers or\nother business disruptions, all of which could negatively affect our business and financial performance.\nWe depend on our management team and other key employees, and the loss of one or more of these employees or an inability to attract and retain highly skilled employees\ncould adversely affect our business.\nOur future success depends, in part, on our ability to continue to attract and retain highly skilled personnel. The loss of the services of any of our key personnel, the\ninability to attract or retain qualified personnel, or delays in hiring required personnel, particularly in engineering and sales, may seriously and adversely affect our business,\nfinancial condition and results of operations. Although we have entered into employment or consulting agreements with our personnel, their employment is generally for no\nspecific duration.\nOur future performance also depends on the continued services and continuing contributions of our senior management team, which includes Tuvia Barlev, our Chief\nExecutive Officer, to execute on our business plan and to identify and pursue new opportunities and product innovations. The loss of services of our senior management team,\nparticularly our Chief Executive Officer, could significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our development and strategic objectives, which could adversely affect our\nbusiness, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may face the effects of increased competition and rapid technological changes.\nThe industry in which we are engaged is subject to rapid and significant technological change. There can be no assurance that our systems can be upgraded to meet future\ninnovations which will be required to meet our customer’s requirements, or that new technologies will be adopted successfully by us, or existing technologies will not be\nimproved, which would render the offerings obsolete or non-competitive. Companies we compete with enjoy significant competitive advantages, including greater name\nrecognition; greater financial, technical, and service resources; established networks; additional product offerings; and greater resources for product development and sales and\nmarketing.\nThere can be no assurance that other established networking technology companies, any of which would likely have greater resources than us, will not enter the market. In\naddition, new competitors may enter the marketplace and/or begin offering networking technology products and solutions and in channels similar to or competing with ours.\nSuch competition may reduce demand for our products and impact the growth prospects and ability to achieve profitability, which may require us to raise new capital, which\nmay not be available on favorable terms, or at all, and that would impair our ability to carry on operations.\nWe cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully against any of these competitors. Our failure to compete successfully with our competitors could harm\nour business.\n25\nWe are dependent on skilled human capital.\nOur ability to innovate and execute its business plans is dependent on the ability to hire, replace, and train skilled personnel. The employment market suffers from\nshortages of candidates, and such shortages may continue in future years, causing delays and preventing us from executing our plans.\nOur results of operations are likely to fluctuate from quarter to quarter and year to year, which could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.\nOur results of operations, including our revenue, cost of revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, cash flow, and deferred revenue, have fluctuated from quarter to\nquarter and year to year in the past and may continue to vary significantly in the future so that period-to-period comparisons of our results of operations may not be meaningful.\nAccordingly, our financial results in any one quarter should not be relied upon as indicative of future performance. Our quarterly financial results may fluctuate as a result of a\nvariety of factors, many of which are outside of our control, may be difficult to predict, and may not fully reflect the underlying performance of our business. Factors that may\ncause fluctuations in our quarterly financial results include:\n● our ability to attract new customers and increase revenue from our existing customers;\n● the loss of existing customers;\n● customer satisfaction with our products, solutions, platform capabilities and customer support;\n● mergers and acquisitions or other factors resulting in the consolidation of our customer base;\n● mix of our revenue;\n● our ability to gain new partners and retain existing partners;\n● fluctuations in share-based compensation expense;\n● decisions by potential customers to purchase competing offerings or develop in-house technologies and solutions as alternatives to our offerings;\n● changes in the spending patterns of our customers;\n● the amount and timing of operating expenses related to the maintenance and expansion of our business and operations, including investments in research and\ndevelopment, sales and marketing, and general and administrative resources;\n● network outages;\n● developments or disputes concerning our intellectual property or proprietary rights, our products and services, or third-party intellectual property or proprietary rights;\n● negative publicity about our company, our offerings or our partners, including as a result of actual or perceived breaches of, or failures relating to, privacy, data\nprotection or data security;\n● the timing of expenses related to the development or acquisition of technologies or businesses and potential future charges for impairment of goodwill from acquired\ncompanies;\n● general economic, industry, and market conditions;\n● the impact of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, or any other pandemic, epidemic, outbreak of infectious disease or other global health crises on our business, the\nbusinesses of our customers and partners and general economic conditions;\n● the impact of political uncertainty or unrest;\n● changes in our pricing policies or those of our competitors;\n● fluctuations in the growth rate of the markets that our offerings address;\n26\n● seasonality in the underlying businesses of our customers, including budgeting cycles, purchasing practices and usage patterns;\n● the business strengths or weakness of our customers;\n● our ability to collect timely on invoices or receivables;\n● the cost and potential outcomes of future litigation or other disputes;\n● future accounting pronouncements or changes in our accounting policies;\n● our overall effective tax rate, including impacts caused by any reorganization in our corporate tax structure and any new legislation or regulatory developments;\n● our ability to successfully expand our business in the United States and internationally;\n● fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates; and\n● the timing and success of new products and solutions introduced by us or our competitors, or any other change in the competitive dynamics of our industry, including\nconsolidation among competitors, customers or partners.\nThe impact of one or more of the foregoing or other factors may cause our results of operations to vary significantly. Such fluctuations make forecasting more difficult and\ncould cause us to fail to meet the expectations of investors and securities analysts, which could cause the trading price of our common stock to fall substantially, resulting in the\nloss of all or part of your investment, and subject us to costly lawsuits, including securities class action suits.\nThe loss of one or more of our significant customers, or any other reduction in the amount of revenue we derive from any such customer, would adversely affect our\nbusiness, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nOur future success is dependent on our ability to establish and maintain successful relationships with a diverse set of customers.\nWe currently derive a significant portion of our revenue from a limited number of our customers. For the years ended December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, our top\nten customers in the aggregate accounted for approximately 66% and 82% of our revenues.\nWe expect to continue to derive a significant portion of our revenue from a limited number of customers in the future and, in some cases, the portion of our revenue\nattributable to individual customers may increase. The loss of one or more significant customers or a reduction in the amount of revenue we derive from any such customer\ncould significantly and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Customers may choose not to renew their contracts or may otherwise reduce\nthe breadth of the offerings which they purchase for any number of reasons. We are also subject to the risk that any such customer will experience financial difficulties that\nprevent them from making payments to us on a timely basis or at all.\nWe are currently operating in a period of economic uncertainty and capital markets disruption, which has been significantly impacted by geopolitical instability due to the\nongoing military conflict between Russia and Ukraine and between Israel and Hamas and Hezbollah. Our business, financial condition and results of operations may be\nmaterially adversely affected by any negative impact on the global economy and capital markets resulting from the conflict in Ukraine and Israel or any other geopolitical\ntensions.\nU.S. and global markets are experiencing volatility and disruption following the escalation of geopolitical tensions and the start of the military conflict between Russia and\nUkraine. On February 24, 2022, a full-scale military invasion of Ukraine by Russian troops was reported. Although the length and impact of the ongoing military conflict is\nhighly unpredictable, and although we currently have no operations or sales in either Russia or Ukraine, the conflict in Ukraine could lead to market disruptions, including\nsignificant volatility in commodity prices, credit and capital markets, as well as supply chain interruptions for some of our components. Additionally, this conflict could lead to\nsanctions, embargoes, regional instability, geopolitical shifts, cyberattacks, other retaliatory actions, and adverse effects on macroeconomic conditions, currency exchange rates,\nand financial markets, which could adversely impact our operations and financial results, as well as those of third parties with whom we conduct business. Our operations\nwould be particularly vulnerable to potential interruptions in the supply of certain critical materials and metals, such as neon gas and palladium, which are used in\nsemiconductor manufacturing. Any interruption to semiconductor chip supply could significantly impact our ability to receive the components and timely roll-out of our\noperations. Furthermore, any potential increase in geopolitical tensions in Asia, particularly in the Taiwan Strait, could also significantly disrupt existing semiconductor chip\nmanufacturing and increase the prospect of an interruption to the semiconductor chip supply across the world. A significant portion of the world’s semiconductor manufacturing\nis in Taiwan, and similar geopolitical tensions there could create further supply chain disruptions, which could result in further delays for our products’ components.\n27\nThe world’s largest semiconductor chip manufacturer is located in Taiwan and a large part of equipment and materials, is manufactured in, and imported from, Taiwan. A\nsetback to the current state of relative peace and stability in the region could compromise existing semiconductor chip production and have downstream implications for our\ncompany. We are continuing to monitor the situation in Ukraine and globally and assessing its potential impact on our business.\nGovernments in the United States and many other countries, or the Sanctioning Bodies, have imposed economic sanctions on certain Russian individuals, including\npoliticians, and Russian corporate and banking entities. The Sanctioning Bodies, or others, could also institute broader sanctions on Russia, including banning Russia from\nglobal payments systems that facilitate cross-border payments. These sanctions, or even the threat of further sanctions, may result in the decline of the value and liquidity of\nRussian securities, a weakening of the ruble or other adverse consequences to the global economy.\nThe current war in Ukraine and Israel, and geopolitical events stemming from such conflicts, could cause consumer confidence and spending to decrease or result in\nincreased volatility in the United States and worldwide financial markets and economy. The extent and duration of the military action, resulting sanctions and resulting future\nmarket disruptions in the region are impossible to predict, but could be significant and have a severe adverse effect worldwide financial markets and economy.\nThe effects of health pandemics, such as the ongoing global COVID-19 pandemic, have had, and could in the future have, an adverse impact on our business, financial\ncondition and results of operations.\nIn December 2019, a novel coronavirus disease, or COVID-19, was first reported and on March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization characterized COVID-19 as a\npandemic. The widespread health crisis is adversely affecting the broader economies, financial markets and overall demand environment for many of our products.\nOur operations and the operations of our suppliers, channel partners and customers were disrupted to varying degrees by a range of external factors related to the COVID-\n19 pandemic, some of which are not within our control. Many governments imposed, and may yet impose, a wide range of restrictions on the physical movement of people in\norder to limit the spread of COVID-19. The COVID-19 pandemic has had, and likely will continue to have, an impact on the attendance and productivity of our employees, and\nthose of our channel partners or customers, resulting in negative impacts to our results of operations and overall financial performance. We suffered delays in realization of\ncertain new orders from our customers, delay in testing of some of our new technologies in customer premises and difficulty conducting business development activities in an\neffective way (face-to-face). In addition, we had to increase our credit lines by $2.0 million to support the loss of revenue and profit. Additionally, COVID-19 has resulted, and\nlikely will continue to result, in delays in non-residential construction, non-crisis-related IT purchases and project completion schedules in general, all of which can negatively\nimpact our results in both current and future periods.\nThe duration and extent of the impact from the COVID-19 pandemic or any future epidemic or pandemic depends on future developments that cannot be accurately\npredicted at this time, such as the severity and transmission rate of the virus, the extent and effectiveness of containment actions, the effects of measures enacted by policy\nmakers and central banks around the globe, and the impact of these and other factors on our employees, customers, channel partners and suppliers. If we are not able to respond\nto and manage the impact of such events effectively, our business will be affected.\n28\nOur performance is affected by general economic and political conditions and taxation policies.\nThe success of our activities may be affected by general economic and market conditions, like interest rates, currency exchange rate fluctuations, availability of credit,\ninflation rates, economic uncertainty, changes in laws, and United States and international political circumstances. Unexpected volatility or illiquidity could impair profitability\nor result in losses.\nWe may be adversely affected by the political and economic situation in the U.S., Europe and a number of countries in Asia.\nThe U.S. communications market is directly affected by economic developments in the U.S. economy. The European and Asian communications market is similarly reliant\non political and economic stability in those regions. Changing trends in these markets may lead to a decrease in investments and a delay in projects, which could harm our\nbusiness. To reduce our sensitivity to market changes, we operate in a large number of different vertical markets and territories.\nOur business could be adversely impacted by changes in laws and regulations related to government contracts.\nFederal or state government bodies or agencies have in the past adopted, and may in the future adopt, laws or regulations affecting the use of the Internet as a commercial\nmedium. Legislators, regulators, or government bodies or agencies may also make legal or regulatory changes or interpret or apply existing laws or regulations that relate to\ngovernment contracts. Changes in these laws, regulations or interpretations could require us to modify our platform in order to comply with these changes, to incur substantial\nadditional costs or divert resources that could otherwise be deployed to grow our business, or expose us to unanticipated civil or criminal liability, among other things.\nWe are subject to laws and regulations worldwide, changes to which could increase our costs and individually or in the aggregate adversely affect our business.\nWe are subject to laws and regulations affecting our domestic and international operations in a number of areas. These U.S. and foreign laws and regulations affect our\nactivities including, but not limited to, in areas of labor, health and safety, tax, import and export requirements, foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions, data\nprivacy requirements, anti-competition, and environmental.\nCompliance with these laws, regulations and similar requirements may be onerous and expensive, and they may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, further\nincreasing the cost of compliance and doing business. Any such costs, which may rise in the future as a result of changes in these laws and regulations or in their interpretation,\ncould individually or in the aggregate make our products and services less attractive to our customers, delay the introduction of new products in one or more regions, or cause\nus to change or limit our business practices. We have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations, but there can be\nno assurance that our employees, contractors, or agents will not violate such laws and regulations or our policies and procedures.\nRisks Related to Protecting Our Technology and Intellectual Property\nClaims by others that we infringe their intellectual property could force us to incur significant costs or revise the way we conduct our business.\nOur competitors protect their proprietary rights by means of patents, trade secrets, copyrights, trademarks and other intellectual property. We have not conducted an\nindependent review of patents and other intellectual property issued to third parties, who may have patents or patent applications relating to our proprietary technology. We may\nreceive letters from third parties alleging, or inquiring about, possible infringement, misappropriation, or violation of their intellectual property rights. Any party asserting that\nwe infringe, misappropriate, or violate proprietary rights may force us to defend ourselves, and potentially our customers, against the alleged claim. These claims and any\nresulting lawsuit, if successful, could subject us to significant liability for damages or interruption or cessation of our operations. Any such claims or lawsuit could:\n● be time-consuming and expensive to defend, whether meritorious or not;\n● require us to stop providing products or services that use the technology that infringes the other party’s intellectual property;\n29\n● divert the attention of our technical and managerial resources;\n● require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements with third-parties, which may not be available on terms that we deem acceptable;\n● prevent us from operating all or a portion of our business or force us to redesign our products, services or technology, which could be difficult and expensive and may\nmake the performance or value of our product or service offerings less attractive;\n● subject us to significant liability for damages or result in significant settlement payments; or\n● require us to indemnify our customers.\nFurthermore, during the course of litigation, confidential information may be disclosed in the form of documents or testimony in connection with discovery requests,\ndepositions or trial testimony. Disclosure of our confidential information and our involvement in intellectual property litigation could materially adversely affect our business.\nSome of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of intellectual property litigation more effectively than we can because they have substantially greater resources. In\naddition, any litigation could significantly harm our relationships with current and prospective customers. Any of the foregoing could disrupt our business and have a material\nadverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nOur patents and proprietary technology may be challenged or disputed.\nWe hold certain patent and trade secret rights relating to various aspects of our technologies, which are of material importance to the Company and its future prospects.\nAny patents we have obtained or do obtain may be challenged by re-examination or otherwise invalidated or eventually found unenforceable. Both the patent application\nprocess and the process of managing patent disputes can be time consuming and expensive. Competitors may attempt to challenge or invalidate our patents or may be able to\ndesign alternative techniques or devices that avoid infringement of our patents or develop products with functionalities that are comparable to ours. In the event a competitor\ninfringes upon our patent or other intellectual property rights, litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights or to defend our patents against challenge, even if successful,\ncould be expensive and time consuming and could require significant time and attention from our management. We may not have sufficient resources to enforce our intellectual\nproperty rights or to defend our patents against challenges from others.\nAny failure to protect our intellectual property rights could impair our ability to protect our proprietary technology and our brand.\nOur success and ability to compete depend largely upon our intellectual property. To date, we have 17 registered patents in the United States; 5 registered patents in\nEurope, one registered patent in Mexico, , one registered patent in Indonesia, and one patent application pending in WIPO, all of which in the general area of high-speed carrier\nclass Ethernet service and transport over bonded VDSL2, G.SHDSL as well as Fiber. We take reasonable steps to protect our intellectual property, especially when working\nwith third parties. However, the steps we take to protect our intellectual property rights may be inadequate. For example, other parties, including our competitors, may\nindependently develop similar technology, duplicate our services, or design around our intellectual property and, in such cases, we may not be able to assert our intellectual\nproperty rights against such parties. Further, our contractual arrangements may not effectively prevent disclosure of our confidential information or provide an adequate remedy\nin the event of unauthorized disclosure of our confidential information, and we may be unable to detect the unauthorized use of, or take appropriate steps to enforce, our\nintellectual property rights.\nWe make business decisions about when to seek patent protection for a particular technology and when to rely upon trade secret protection, and the approach we select may\nultimately prove to be inadequate. Even in cases where we seek patent protection, there is no assurance that the resulting patents will effectively protect every significant\nfeature of our technology or provide us with any competitive advantages. Moreover, we cannot guarantee that any of our pending patent application will issue or be approved.\nThe United States Patent and Trademark Office and various foreign governmental patent agencies also require compliance with a number of procedurals, documentary, fee\npayment, and other similar provisions during the patent application process and after a patent has issued. There are situations in which noncompliance can result in\nabandonment or lapse of the patent, or patent application, resulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction. If this occurs, our competitors might\nbe able to enter the market, which would have a material adverse effect on our business. Effective trademark, copyright, patent, and trade secret protection may not be available\nin every country in which we conduct business. Further, intellectual property law, including statutory and case law, in the United States and other countries, is constantly\ndeveloping, and any changes in the law could make it harder for us to enforce our rights.\n30\nIn order to protect our intellectual property rights, we may be required to spend significant resources to monitor and protect these rights. Litigation brought to protect and\nenforce our intellectual property rights could be costly, time-consuming, and distracting to management and could result in the impairment or loss of portions of our intellectual\nproperty. Furthermore, our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights may be met with defenses, counterclaims, and countersuits attacking the validity and enforceability\nof our intellectual property rights. An adverse determination of any litigation proceedings could put our intellectual property at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly\nand could put our related pending patent applications at risk of not issuing. Furthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual\nproperty litigation particularly in the US, there is a risk that some of our confidential or sensitive information could be compromised by disclosure in the event of litigation. In\naddition, during the course of litigation, there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments. If securities\nanalysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a substantial adverse effect on the price of our common stock. Negative publicity related to a decision\nby us to initiate such enforcement actions against a client or former client, regardless of its accuracy, may adversely impact our other client relationships or prospective client\nrelationships, harm our brand and business, and could cause the market price of our common stock to decline. Our failure to secure, protect, and enforce our intellectual\nproperty rights could adversely affect our brand and our business.\nThe lives of our patents may not be sufficient to effectively protect our products and business.\nPatents have a limited lifespan. In the United States, if all maintenance fees are paid timely, the natural expiration of a patent is generally 20 years after its first effective\nnonprovisional filing date. Although various extensions may be available, the life of a patent, and the protection it affords, is limited. Given the amount of time required for the\ndevelopment, testing and regulatory review of new product candidates, patents protecting such candidates might expire before or shortly after such product candidates are\ncommercialized. Even if patents covering our product candidates are obtained, once the patent life has expired for a product, we may be open to competition from biosimilar or\ngeneric medications. As a result, our patent portfolio may not provide us with sufficient rights to exclude others from commercializing product candidates similar or identical to\nours. Our patents issued as of March 20, 2024 will expire on dates ranging from September 25, 2024 to October 31, 2038, subject to any patent extensions that may be available\nfor such patents. More specifically, the following patents will expire over the next three years: EP02250273.6, US7606315, US7613235, EP1943827, EP1964377, GB2556826,\nMX279453, US7587042, IDP0030744.\nIn addition, although upon issuance in the United States a patent’s life can be increased based on certain delays caused by the USPTO, this increase can be reduced or\neliminated based on certain delays caused by the patent applicant during patent prosecution. A patent term extension based on regulatory delay may be available in the\nUnited States. However, only a single patent can be extended for each marketing approval, and any patent can be extended only once, for a single product. Moreover, the scope\nof protection during the period of the patent term extension does not extend to the full scope of the claim, but instead only to the scope of the product as approved. Laws\ngoverning analogous patent term extensions in foreign jurisdictions vary widely, as do laws governing the ability to obtain multiple patents from a single patent family.\nAdditionally, we may not receive an extension if we fail to exercise due diligence during the testing phase or regulatory review process, apply within applicable deadlines, fail\nto apply prior to expiration of relevant patents or otherwise fail to satisfy applicable requirements. If we are unable to obtain patent term extension or restoration, or the term of\nany such extension is less than we request, the period during which we will have the right to exclusively market our product will be shortened and our competitors may obtain\napproval of competing products following our patent expiration and may take advantage of our investment in development and clinical trials by referencing our clinical and\npreclinical data to launch their product earlier than might otherwise be the case, and our revenue could be reduced, possibly materially. If we do not have sufficient patent life to\nprotect our products, our business and results of operations will be adversely affected.\n31\nWe may not be able to adequately defend against piracy of intellectual property in foreign jurisdictions.\nConsiderable research is being performed in countries outside of the United States, and a number of potential competitors are located in these countries. The laws\nprotecting intellectual property in some of those countries may not provide adequate protection to prevent our competitors from misappropriating our intellectual property.\nSeveral of these potential competitors may be further along in the process of product development and also operate large, company-funded research and development programs.\nAs a result, our competitors may develop more competitive or affordable products, or achieve earlier patent protection or product commercialization than we are able to\nachieve. Competitive products may render any products that we develop obsolete.\nRisks Related to Managing Our Business Operations in Israel\nConditions in the Middle East and in Israel, where our research and development facilities are located, may harm our operations.\nOur office where we conduct our research and development, operations, sales outside the Americas, and administration activities, is located in Israel. Many of our\nemployees are residents of Israel. Most of our officers and directors are residents of Israel. Since the establishment of the State of Israel in 1948, a number of armed conflicts\nhave taken place between Israel and its neighboring countries, and between Israel and the Hamas (an Islamist militia and political group in the Gaza Strip) and Hezbollah (an\nIslamist militia and political group in Lebanon).\nIn particular, in October 2023, Hamas terrorists infiltrated Israel’s southern border from the Gaza Strip and conducted a series of attacks on civilian and military targets.\nHamas also launched extensive rocket attacks on the Israeli population and industrial centers located along Israel’s border with the Gaza Strip and in other areas within the State\nof Israel. These attacks resulted in thousands of deaths and injuries, and Hamas additionally kidnapped many Israeli civilians and soldiers. Following the attack, Israel’s security\ncabinet declared war against Hamas and commenced a military campaign against Hamas and Hezbollah and these terrorist organizations in parallel continued rocket and terror\nattacks. As a result of the events of October 7, 2023 whereby Hamas terrorists invaded southern Israel and launched thousands of rockets in a widespread terrorist attack on\nIsrael, the Israeli government declared that the country was at war and the Israeli military began to call-up reservists for active duty. As of the date of this Annual Report, we\nhave not been impacted by any absences of personnel at our service providers or counterparties located in Israel. Military service call ups that result in absences of personnel\nfrom us for an extended period of time may materially and adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. As of the date of this Annual\nReport, we currently have 42 full-time employees, with 33 employees located in Israel and 9 employee located outside of Israel.\nSince the war broke out on October 7, 2023, our operations have not been adversely affected by this situation, and we have not experienced any material disruptions to our\noperations. We have the ability, if necessary, to shift our manufacturing from Israel to other countries where we have business partners, and we have not had customers in Israel\nin the last year. However, the intensity and duration of the war in the Middle East is difficult to predict at this stage, as are such war’s economic implications on the Company’s\nbusiness and operations and on Israel’s economy in general. if the war in the other fronts, such as Lebanon, Syria and the West Bank expands further, our operations may be\nadversely affected.\nIn addition, since the commencement of these events, there have been continued hostilities along Israel’s northern border with Lebanon (with the Hezbollah terror\norganization) and southern border (with the Houthi movement in Yemen). It is possible that hostilities with Hezbollah in Lebanon will escalate, and that other terrorist\norganizations, including Palestinian military organizations in the West Bank as well as other hostile countries, such as Iran, will join the hostilities. Such clashes may escalate\nin the future into a greater regional conflict. In addition, Iran has threatened to attack Israel and is widely believed to be developing nuclear weapons. Iran is also believed to\nhave a strong influence among extremist groups in the region, such as Hamas in Gaza, Hezbollah in Lebanon, the Houthi movement in Yemen and various rebel militia groups\nin Syria. These situations may potentially escalate in the future to more violent events which may affect Israel and us. Any armed conflicts, terrorist activities or political\ninstability in the region could adversely affect business conditions, could harm our results of operations and could make it more difficult for us to raise capital. Parties with\nwhom we do business may decline to travel to Israel during periods of heightened unrest or tension, forcing us to make alternative arrangements when necessary in order to\nmeet our business partners face to face. In addition, the political and security situation in Israel may result in parties with whom we have agreements involving performance in\nIsrael claiming that they are not obligated to perform their commitments under those agreements pursuant to force majeure provisions in such agreements. Further, in the past,\nthe State of Israel and Israeli companies have been subjected to economic boycotts. Several countries still restrict business with the State of Israel and with Israeli companies.\nThese restrictive laws and policies may have an adverse impact on our operating results, financial condition or the expansion of our business.\n32\nAny hostilities involving Israel or the interruption or curtailment of trade between Israel and its trading partners could adversely affect our operations and results of\noperations. In recent years, the hostilities involved missile strikes against civilian targets in various parts of Israel, including areas in which our employees and some of our\nconsultants are located, and negatively affected business conditions in Israel.\nOur commercial insurance does not cover losses that may occur as a result of events associated with the security situation in the Middle East. Although the Israeli\ngovernment currently covers the reinstatement value of direct damages that are caused by terrorist attacks or acts of war, we cannot assure you that this government coverage\nwill be maintained. Any losses or damages incurred by us could have a material adverse effect on our business. Any armed conflicts or political instability in the region would\nlikely negatively affect business conditions and could harm our results of operations. To-date, we have received Israeli government war related support funding of\napproximately $100,000.\nFinally, political conditions within Israel may affect our operations. Israel has held five general elections between 2019 and 2022, and prior to October 2023, the Israeli\ngovernment pursued extensive changes to Israel’s judicial system, which sparked extensive political debate and unrest. To date, these initiatives have been substantially put on\nhold. Actual or perceived political instability in Israel or any negative changes in the political environment, may individually or in the aggregate adversely affect the Israeli\neconomy and, in turn, our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nActelis Israel received Israeli government grants for certain of our research and development activities, the terms of which require us to pay royalties and satisfy specified\nconditions in order to manufacture products and transfer technologies outside of Israel. If we fail to satisfy these conditions, we may be required to pay penalties and\nrefund grants previously received.\nOur wholly owned subsidiary, Actelis Israel, which manages our research and development efforts, has been financed in part through royalty-bearing grants in an aggregate\namount of approximately $14 million (plus accrued interest), received from the Israeli Innovation Authority (formerly known as the Office of the Chief Scientist of the Israeli\nMinistry of Economy), or the IIA, as of December 31, 2023. We are committed to pay royalties at a rate of 3.0% on revenues up to the total amount of grants received, linked to\nthe U.S. dollar and bearing interest at an annual rate of LIBOR applicable to U.S. dollar deposits.\nWe are further required to comply with the requirements of the Israeli Encouragement of Industrial Research, Development and Technological Innovation Law, 5744-1984\n(formerly known as the Law for Encouragement of Research and Development in the Industry, 1984), as amended, and related regulations, or the Research Law, with respect to\nthose past grants. When a grantee company develops know-how, technology or products using IIA grants, the terms of these grants and the Research Law restrict the transfer or\nlicense of such know-how, and the transfer of manufacturing or manufacturing rights of such products, technologies or know-how outside of Israel, without the prior approval\nof the IIA. Therefore, the discretionary approval of an IIA committee would be required for any transfer or license to third parties inside or outside of Israel of Actelis Israel’s\nknow how or for the transfer outside of Israel of manufacturing or manufacturing rights related to those aspects of such technologies. We may not receive those approvals.\nFurthermore, the IIA may impose certain conditions on any arrangement under which it permits us to transfer technology or development outside of Israel.\nThe transfer or license of IIA-supported technology or know-how outside of Israel and the transfer of manufacturing of IIA-supported products, technology or know-how\noutside of Israel may involve the payment of significant amounts, depending upon the value of the transferred or licensed technology or know-how, our research and\ndevelopment expenses, the amount of IIA support, the time of completion of the IIA-supported research project and other factors. These restrictions and requirements for\npayment may impair our ability to sell, license or otherwise transfer our technology assets outside of Israel or to outsource or transfer development or manufacturing activities\nwith respect to any product or technology outside of Israel. Furthermore, the consideration available to our shareholders in a transaction involving the transfer outside of Israel\nof technology or know-how developed with IIA funding (such as a merger or similar transaction) may be reduced by any amounts that we are required to pay to the IIA.\n33\nThere are costs and difficulties inherent in managing cross-border business operations.\nManaging a business, operations, personnel or assets in another country is challenging and costly. Any management that we may have (whether based abroad or in the\nUnited States) may be inexperienced in cross-border business practices and unaware of significant differences in accounting rules, legal regimes, and labor practices. Even with\na seasoned and experienced management team, the costs and difficulties inherent in managing cross-border business operations, personnel, and assets can be significant (and\nmuch higher than in a purely domestic business) and may negatively impact our financial and operational performance.\nEmployment and other material contracts we have with our Israeli employees are governed by Israeli laws. Our inability to enforce or obtain a remedy under these\nagreements could adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nAll employees were asked to sign employment agreements that contain confidentiality, non-compete and assignment of intellectual property provisions. The employment\nagreements with our employees in Israel are governed by Israeli laws. The system of laws and the enforcement of existing laws and contracts in Israel may not be as certain in\nimplementation and interpretation as in the United States, leading to a higher than usual degree of uncertainty as to the outcome of any litigation. Our inability to enforce or\nobtain a remedy under any of these or future agreements could adversely affect our business and financial condition. Delay with respect to the enforcement of particular rules\nand regulations, including those relating to intellectual property, customs, tax, and labor, could also cause serious disruption to operations abroad and negatively impact our\nresults.\nIsraeli courts have required employers seeking to enforce non-compete undertakings of a former employee to demonstrate that the competitive activities of the former\nemployee will harm one of a limited number of material interests of the employer which have been recognized by the courts, such as the secrecy of a company’s confidential\ncommercial information or the protection of its intellectual property. If we cannot demonstrate that such interests will be harmed, we may be unable to prevent our competitors\nfrom benefiting from the expertise of our former employees or consultants and our ability to remain competitive may be diminished.\nIn addition, Chapter 8 of the Israeli Patents Law, 5727-1967, or the Patents Law, deals with inventions made in the course of an employee’s service and during his or her\nterm of employment, whether or not the invention is patentable, or service inventions. Section 134 of the Patents Law sets forth that if there is no agreement which explicitly\ndetermines whether the employee is entitled to compensation for the service inventions and the extent and terms of such compensation, such determination will be made by the\nCompensation and Rewards Committee, a statutory committee of the Israeli Patents Office. As a result, it is unclear if, and to what extent, our research and development\nemployees may be able to claim compensation with respect to our future revenues. Such claims, if successfully asserted, could adversely affect our results of operations and\nprofitability.\nWe may be adversely affected by fluctuations in the currency exchange rate of the Israeli Shekel.\nWe compute a significant number of expenses in Israeli Shekels, both expenses from employees and suppliers. Our customers buy our products priced in US dollars or\nEuros. The strengthening of the shekel against the dollar and the euro could erode our profitability.\nUnanticipated changes in our effective tax rate and additional tax liabilities, including those resulting from our international operations or the implementation of new tax\nrules, could harm our future results.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and Israel. Our domestic and international tax liabilities are subject to the allocation of expenses in differing\njurisdictions and complex transfer pricing regulations administered by taxing authorities in various jurisdictions. Tax rates in the jurisdictions in which we operate may change\nas a result of factors outside of our control or relevant taxing authorities may disagree with our determinations as to the income and expenses attributable to specific\njurisdictions. In addition, changes in tax and trade laws, treaties or regulations, or their interpretation or enforcement, have become more unpredictable and may become more\nstringent, which could materially adversely affect our tax position.\n34\nForecasting our estimated annual effective tax rate is complex and subject to uncertainty, and there may be material differences between our forecasted and actual effective\ntax rate. Our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings and losses in countries with differing statutory tax rates, certain non-deductible\nexpenses, the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, adjustments to income taxes upon finalization of tax returns, changes in available tax attributes, decision to\nrepatriate non-U.S. earnings for which we have not previously provided for U.S. taxes, and changes in federal, state, or international tax laws and accounting principles.\nFinally, we may be subject to income tax audits throughout the world. An adverse resolution of one or more uncertain tax positions in any period could have a material\nimpact on our results of operations or financial condition for that period.\nRisks Related to our Common Stock\nThe requirements of being a public company may strain our resources, divert management’s attention, and affect our ability to attract and retain executive management\nand qualified board members.\nAs a public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the listing standards of Nasdaq and other applicable securities rules and\nregulations. The requirements of these rules and regulations will continue to increase our legal, accounting, and financial compliance costs, make some activities more difficult,\ntime-consuming, and costly, and place significant strain on our personnel, systems, and resources. For example, the Exchange Act requires, among other things, that we file\nannual, quarterly, and current reports with respect to our business and results of operations. As a result of the complexity involved in complying with the rules and regulations\napplicable to public companies, our management’s attention may be diverted from other business concerns, which could harm our business, results of operations, and financial\ncondition.\nWe also expect that being a public company and these new rules and regulations will make it more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance, and we\nmay be required to accept reduced coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain coverage. These factors could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain\nqualified members of our board of directors, particularly to serve on our audit committee and compensation committee, and qualified executive officers.\nAs a result of disclosure of information in filings required of a public company, our business and financial condition is more visible, which may result in an increased risk\nof threatened or actual litigation, including by competitors and other third parties. If such claims are successful, our business and results of operations could be harmed, and\neven if the claims do not result in litigation or are resolved in our favor, these claims, and the time and resources necessary to resolve them, could divert the resources of our\nmanagement and harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nThe individuals who now constitute our senior management team have limited experience managing a publicly-traded company and limited experience complying with the\nincreasingly complex laws pertaining to public companies. Our senior management team may not successfully or efficiently manage our transition to a public company that is\nsubject to significant regulatory oversight and reporting obligations.\nWe are an “emerging growth company,” and our compliance with the reduced reporting and disclosure requirements applicable to “emerging growth companies” may\nmake our common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in the JOBS Act, and we have elected to take advantage of certain exemptions and relief from various reporting\nrequirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not “emerging growth companies.” These provisions include, but are not limited to: requiring only two years\nof audited financial statements and only two years of related selected financial data and management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations\ndisclosures; being exempt from compliance with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act; being exempt from any rules that could be\nadopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board requiring mandatory audit firm rotations or a supplement to the auditor’s report on financial statements; being\nsubject to reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements; and not being required to hold nonbinding advisory\nvotes on executive compensation or on any golden parachute payments not previously approved.\n35\nIn addition, while we are an “emerging growth company,” we will not be required to comply with any new financial accounting standard until such standard is generally\napplicable to private companies. As a result, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that are not “emerging growth companies” or elect not to avail\nthemselves of this provision.\nWe may remain an “emerging growth company” until as late as December 31, 2027, the fiscal year-end following the fifth anniversary of the completion of our IPO,\nthough we may cease to be an “emerging growth company” earlier under certain circumstances, including if (1) we have more than $1.07 billion in annual net revenues in any\nfiscal year, (2) we become a “large accelerated filer,” with at least $700 million of equity securities held by non-affiliates as of the end of the second quarter of that fiscal year\nor (3) we issue more than $1.0 billion of non-convertible debt over a three-year period.\nThe exact implications of the JOBS Act are still subject to interpretations and guidance by the SEC and other regulatory agencies, and we cannot assure you that we will be\nable to take advantage of all of the benefits of the JOBS Act. In addition, investors may find our common stock less attractive to the extent we rely on the exemptions and relief\ngranted by the JOBS Act. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock\nprice may decline or become more volatile.\nWe have identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting. If we experience material weaknesses in the future or otherwise fail to implement\nand maintain an effective system of internal controls in the future, we may not be able to accurately report our financial condition or results of operations which may\nadversely affect investor confidence in us, and as a result, the value of our common stock.\nAs a public company, we are subject to significant requirements for enhanced financial reporting and internal controls. The process of designing and implementing\neffective internal controls is a continuous effort that requires us to anticipate and react to changes in our business and the economic and regulatory environments and to expend\nsignificant resources to maintain a system of internal controls that is adequate to satisfy our reporting obligations as a public company. In addition, we are required, pursuant to\nSection 404, to furnish a report by management on, among other things, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting in the second annual report following\nthe completion of our IPO. This assessment will need to include disclosure of any material weaknesses identified by our management in our internal control over financial\nreporting. A material weakness is a deficiency or combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a\nmaterial misstatement of a company’s annual and interim financial statements will not be detected or prevented on a timely basis.\nThe rules governing the standards that must be met for our management to assess our internal control over financial reporting are complex and require significant\ndocumentation, testing, and possible remediation. Testing and maintaining internal controls may divert our management’s attention from other matters that are important to our\nbusiness. Once we are no longer an “emerging growth company,” or a “smaller reporting company”, our auditors will be required to issue an attestation report on the\neffectiveness of our internal controls on an annual basis.\nIn the course of preparing the financial statements that are included in this Annual Report, management has determined that a material weakness exists within the internal\ncontrol over financial reporting. The material weakness identified relates to lack of a sufficient number of finance personnel to allow for adequate segregation of duties. We\nconcluded that the material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting occurs because as a newly public company, we do not have the necessary business\nprocesses, systems, personnel, and related internal controls necessary to satisfy the accounting and financial reporting requirements of a public company.\nIn order to remediate the material weakness, we expect to hire additional accounting and finance resources with public company experience or to provide the necessary\ntraining for such new hires without public company experience, and to nominate board members with the required financial literacy.\nWe may not be able to fully remediate the identified material weakness until the steps described above have been completed and our internal controls have been operating\neffectively for a sufficient period of time.\n36\nDuring the year ending December 31, 2023 and up to the date of this Annual Report, we have made significant progress in our internal controls plan, including hiring new\nfinancial experts and increasing the amount of financial personnel, as well as mapping, documenting and testing our internal controls with the assistance of a third-party\naccounting firm with specific expertise in Sarbanes-Oxley (“SOX”) compliance. However, we cannot assure that we will be able to fully remediate the material weakness by\nsuch time. We also may incur significant costs to execute various aspects of our remediation plan but cannot provide a reasonable estimate of such costs at this time.\nIn the future, it is possible that additional material weaknesses or significant deficiencies may be identified that we may be unable to remedy before the requisite deadline\nfor these reports. Our ability to comply with the annual internal control reporting requirements will depend on the effectiveness of our financial reporting and data systems and\ncontrols across our company. Any weaknesses or deficiencies or any failure to implement new or improved controls, or difficulties encountered in the implementation or\noperation of these controls, could harm our operating results and cause us to fail to meet our financial reporting obligations, or result in material misstatements in our\nconsolidated financial statements, which could adversely affect our business and reduce our stock price.\nIf we are unable to conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal control over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404, our independent registered\npublic accounting firm may not issue an unqualified opinion. If we are unable to conclude that we have effective internal control over financial reporting, investors could lose\nconfidence in our reported financial information, which could have a material adverse effect on the trading price of our common stock. Failure to remedy any material\nweakness in our internal control over financial reporting, or to implement or maintain other effective control systems required of public companies, could also restrict our future\naccess to the capital markets.\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud. As a\nresult, stockholders could lose confidence in our financial and other public reporting, which would harm our business and the trading price of our common stock.\nEffective internal controls over financial reporting are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and, together with adequate disclosure controls and procedures,\nare designed to prevent fraud. Any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or difficulties encountered in their implementation could cause us to fail to meet our\nreporting obligations. In addition, any testing by us conducted in connection with Section 404, or any subsequent testing by our independent registered public accounting firm,\nmay reveal deficiencies in our internal controls over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses or that may require prospective or retroactive changes to our\nfinancial statements or identify other areas for further attention or improvement. Inferior internal controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial\ninformation, which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our stock.\nWe will be required to disclose changes made in our internal controls and procedures on a quarterly basis and our management will be required to assess the effectiveness\nof these controls annually, beginning with our second annual report on Form 10-K. In addition, our independent registered public accounting firm will be required to attest to\nthe effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404, however they will not be required to do so for so long as we are an emerging growth\ncompany. We could be an emerging growth company for up to five years (i.e., until December 31, 2027). An independent assessment of the effectiveness of our internal\ncontrols over financial reporting could detect problems that our management’s assessment might not. Undetected material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial\nreporting could lead to restatements of our financial statements and require us to incur the expense of remediation.\nOur disclosure controls and procedures may not prevent or detect all errors or acts of fraud.\nWe are subject to certain reporting requirements of the Exchange Act. Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to reasonably assure that information required to\nbe disclosed by us in reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, recorded, processed, summarized and reported within\nthe time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC. We believe that any disclosure controls and procedures or internal controls and procedures, no matter how well\nconceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. These inherent limitations include the realities\nthat judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the\nindividual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people or by an unauthorized override of the controls. Accordingly, because of the inherent limitations in our\ncontrol system, misstatements or insufficient disclosures due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.\n37\nAn active trading market may not develop for our securities.\nOur common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market. However, we cannot predict the extent to which investor interest in our Company will lead to the development\nof an active trading market in our common stock or how liquid that market might become. If such a market does not develop or is not sustained, it may be difficult for you to\nsell your shares of common stock at the time you wish to sell them, at a price that is attractive to you, or at all.\nThe trading market for our common stock in the future could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to several factors, including, but not limited to:\n● actual or anticipated variations in our results of operations;\n● our ability or inability to generate revenues or profit;\n● the number of shares in our public float; and\n● increased competition.\nFurthermore, our stock price may be impacted by factors that are unrelated or disproportionate to our operating performance. These market fluctuations, as well as general\neconomic, political, and market conditions, such as recessions, interest rates or international currency fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nAdditionally, moving forward we anticipate having a limited number of shares in our public float, and as a result, there could be extreme fluctuations in the price of our\ncommon stock.\nOur issuance of additional capital stock in connection with financings, acquisitions, investments, our 2015 Equity Incentive Plan, or otherwise will dilute all other\nstockholders.\nIn the future, we may need to raise additional capital through equity and debt financings in order to fund our operations. If we raise capital through equity financings in the\nfuture, that will result in dilution to all other stockholders. We also expect to grant equity awards to employees, directors, and consultants under our 2015 Equity Incentive Plan.\nAs part of our business strategy, we may acquire or make investments in complementary companies, products, or technologies and issue equity securities to pay for any such\nacquisition or investment. Any such issuances of additional capital stock may cause stockholders to experience significant dilution of their ownership interests and the per-share\nvalue of our common stock to decline.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock and, consequently, the ability of common stockholders to achieve a return on investment will depend on\nappreciation, if any, in the price of our common stock.\nYou should not rely on an investment in our common stock to provide dividend income. We do not plan to declare or pay any dividends on our capital stock in the\nforeseeable future. Instead, we intend to retain any earnings to finance the operation and expansion of our business. Any credit agreements, which we may enter into with\ninstitutional lenders, may restrict our ability to pay dividends. Whether we pay cash dividends in the future will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will be\ndependent upon our financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements and any other factors that the board of directors decides is relevant. Therefore, any return on\nyour investment in our capital stock must come from increases in the fair market value and trading price of the capital stock.\nFuture sales of our common stock, or the perception that future sales may occur, may cause the market price of our common stock to decline, even if our business is doing\nwell.\nSales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market after our IPO, or the perception that these sales may occur, could materially and adversely affect the\nprice of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities. Those shares of common stock sold in our IPO will be\nfreely tradable, without restriction, in the public market, except for any shares sold to our affiliates.\nAs of today, all shares that were in lock-up following the IPO closed in May 2022 have been released and are available for trading by their holders, subject to\nadministrative process completion with our transfer agent. Sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market after the completion of the IPO, or the\nperception that such sales could occur, could adversely affect the market price of our common stock and could materially impair our ability to raise capital through offerings of\nour common stock.\n38\nThe market price of our common stock may be volatile and may decline regardless of our operating performance, and you may lose all or part of your investments.\nThe market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control, including:\n● overall performance of the equity markets and/or publicly listed technology companies;\n● actual or anticipated fluctuations in our net revenues or other operating metrics;\n● changes in the financial projections we provide to the public or our failure to meet these projections;\n● failure of securities analysts to initiate or maintain coverage of us, changes in financial estimates by any securities analysts who follow our company, or our failure to\nmeet the estimates or the expectations of investors;\n● the economy as a whole and market conditions in our industry;\n● political and economic stability in Israel;\n● exchange rate fluctuations between U.S. dollars and Israeli New Shekel;\n● rumors and market speculation involving us or other companies in our industry;\n● announcements by us or our competitors of significant innovations, acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures, or capital commitments;\n● new laws or regulations or new interpretations of existing laws or regulations applicable to our business;\n● lawsuits threatened or filed against us;\n● recruitment or departure of key personnel;\n● other events or factors, including those resulting from war, incidents of terrorism, or responses to these events; and\n● the expiration of contractual lock-up or market standoff agreements.\nIn addition, extreme price and volume fluctuations in the stock markets have affected and continue to affect many technology companies’ stock prices. Often, their stock\nprices have fluctuated in ways unrelated or disproportionate to the companies’ operating performance. In the past, securities action litigation has often been brought against a\nCompany following a decline in the market price of its securities. This risk is especially relevant for us because technology companies have experienced significant stock price\nvolatility in recent years. If we face such litigation, it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management’s attention and resources, which could harm our business.\nA possible “short squeeze” due to a sudden increase in demand of our common stock that largely exceeds supply may lead to price volatility in our common stock.\nInvestors may purchase our common stock to hedge existing exposure in our common stock or to speculate on the price of our common stock. Speculation on the price of\nour common stock may involve long and short exposures. To the extent aggregate short exposure exceeds the number of shares of our common stock available for purchase in\nthe open market, investors with short exposure may have to pay a premium to repurchase our common stock for delivery to lenders of our common stock. Those repurchases\nmay in turn, dramatically increase the price of our common stock until investors with short exposure are able to purchase additional common stock to cover their short position.\nThis is often referred to as a “short squeeze.” A short squeeze could lead to volatile price movements in our common stock that are not directly correlated to the performance or\nprospects of our common stock and once investors purchase the shares of common stock necessary to cover their short position the price of our common stock may decline.\n39\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research, or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research, about our business, our stock price and trading volume could\ndecline.\nThe trading market for our common stock will depend, in part, on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. Securities\nand industry analysts do not currently, and may never, publish research on our company. If no securities or industry analysts commence coverage of our company, the trading\nprice for our common stock would likely be negatively impacted. In the event securities or industry analysts initiate coverage, if one or more of the analysts who cover us\ndowngrade our stock or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price would likely decline. In addition, if our operating results fail to meet the\nforecast of analysts, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to publish reports on us regularly, demand for\nour common stock could decrease, which might cause our stock price and trading volume to decline.\nProvisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could make an acquisition of our company more difficult, limit attempts by our stockholders to replace or\nremove our current board of directors and limit the market price of our common stock.\nProvisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, or the Charter, and bylaws, or the Bylaws, may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of\ncontrol or changes in our management. Our Charter and Bylaws, include provisions that:\n● permit the board of directors to establish the number of directors and fill any vacancies and newly-created directorships;\n● classify our board of directors is classified into three classes of directors with staggered three-year terms and stockholders will only be able to remove directors from\noffice for cause; and\n● provide that the board of directors is expressly authorized to make, alter, or repeal our Bylaws.\nMoreover, Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, or the DGCL, may discourage, delay, or prevent a change in control of our company. Section 203\nimposes certain restrictions on mergers, business combinations, and other transactions between us and holders of 15% or more of our common stock.\nOur Charter provides that derivative actions brought on our behalf, actions against our directors, officers, employees or agent for breach of fiduciary duty and certain\nother actions may be brought only in the Court of Chancery in the State of Delaware and the stockholders shall be deemed to have consented to this choice of forum\nprovision, which may have the effect of discouraging lawsuits against our directors, officers, other employees or agents.\nOur Charter provides that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the sole and\nexclusive forum for (a) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (b) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by, or other wrongdoing\nby, any current or former director, officer, stockholder, employee or agent of the Company to the Company or the Company’s stockholders, (c) any action asserting a claim\nagainst us or any current or former director, officer, stockholder, employee or agent of the Corporation arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL, or our Company’s\nCertificate of Incorporation or Bylaws, (d) any action to interpret, apply, enforce or determine the validity of the Company’s Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws, (e) any\naction asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine or (f) any action asserting an “internal corporate claim” as that term is defined in Section 115 of the General\nCorporation Law. The federal district courts of the United States of America shall be the exclusive forum for the resolution of any complaint, claim or proceeding asserting a\ncause of action arising under the Exchange Act or the Securities Act. Furthermore, Section 22 of the Securities Act creates concurrent jurisdiction for federal and state courts\nover all suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Securities Act or the rules and regulations thereunder.\n40\nStockholders cannot waive compliance with the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring or\nholding any interest in shares of our capital stock shall be deemed to have notice of and consented to the forum provision in our Charter.\nThe choice-of-forum provision may limit a stockholder’s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with the Company or its directors,\nofficers or other employees, and may result in increased costs to a stockholder who has to bring a claim in a forum that is not convenient to the stockholder, which may\ndiscourage such lawsuits. Although under Section 115 of the DGCL, exclusive forum provisions may be included in a company’s certificate of incorporation, the enforceability\nof similar forum provisions in other companies’ certificates or incorporation or bylaws has been challenged in legal proceedings, and it is possible that a court could find these\ntypes of provisions to be inapplicable or unenforceable. If a court were to find the exclusive forum provision of our Charter inapplicable or unenforceable with respect to one or\nmore of the specified types of actions or proceedings, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could materially and\nadversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and result in a diversion of the time and resources of our management and board of directors.\nOur financial condition raises substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern.\nOur consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue to operate as a going concern. These events and conditions, along with other\nmatters, indicate that a material uncertainty exists that may cast significant doubt on our ability to continue as a going concern. This going concern determination could\nmaterially limit our ability to raise additional funds through the issuance of equity or debt securities or otherwise. Further financial statements may include an explanatory\nparagraph with respect to our ability to continue as a going concern. There can be no assurance that we will succeed in generating sufficient revenues from our product sales to\ncontinue our operations as a going concern. If funds are not available to us, we may be required to delay, reduce the scope of, or eliminate research or development plans for, or\ncommercialization efforts with respect to our products. This may raise substantial doubts about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS.\nNone.\n41\nITEM 1C. CYBERSECURITY.\nRisk management and strategy\nWe have developed and maintain a cybersecurity risk management program that focuses primarily on securing and safeguarding computer systems, networks, cloud\nservices, business applications, and data and that is integrated in our overall risk management strategy and framework. We have implemented protocols to protect against cyber\nthreats and ensure the containment and security of sensitive business data, including ongoing security reviews of critical systems, continuous monitoring of event data, and\nemployee training programs, which processes are aligned with our overall business and operational goals and strategies. Our risk assessment occurs on an ongoing basis and\ncovers identification of risks that could act against the company’s objectives as well as specific risks related to a compromise to the security of data.\nWe engage a third-party to provide operational support for cybersecurity risks. This forms a critical part of our risk management strategy, facilitating effective management\nand mitigation of risks, and ensuring adherence to applicable regulatory and industry standards.\nOverall, we believe that we have established a robust framework for confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information, adhering to relevant security standards,\npractices, and compliance requirements. In addition, we maintain insurance to help protect against risks associated with cybersecurity threats. As of the date of this report, we\ndo not believe that any risks from cybersecurity threats have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, us, including our business strategy, results of\noperations, or financial condition. However, despite our efforts, we cannot eliminate all risks from cybersecurity threats, or provide assurances that we have not experienced an\nundetected cybersecurity incident. For more information about these risks, please see “Item 1.A – Risk Factors – Risks Related to Our Business Operations – If our internal\ncompany cyber-security measures are breached or fail and unauthorized access is obtained to our IT environment, we may incur significant losses of data, which we may not be\nable to recover and may experience a delay in our ability to conduct our day-to-day business” in this Annual Report.\nGovernance\nOur board of directors provides oversight of our cybersecurity program and helps guide our strategy for managing cybersecurity risks in the context of our overall risk\nmanagement system. Our cybersecurity program is managed by our Chief Financial Officer and our external IT team whose is responsible for leading enterprise-wide\ncybersecurity execution, protocols, framework, standards and processes. The Chief Financial Officer reports to our board of directors, as well as our Chief Executive Officer\nand other members of senior management as appropriate.\nITEM 2. PROPERTIES.\nWe lease our facility in California, which consists of approximately 3,000 square feet of office, lab and warehouse space. Our lease expires in October 2025. We also\nsublease our previous facility in California of approximately 9,000 square feet to a third party. This lease expires on March 31, 2024, and we do intend to renew the lease.\nWe also lease an office and lab facility in Petach-Tikva, Israel consisting of approximately 13,500 square feet serving our R&D personnel, operations and administration as\nwell as our EMEA and APAC sales team. Our lease expires in December 2025.\nWe believe our facilities are sufficient to meet our current needs and that suitable space will be available as and when needed. We do not own any real property.\nITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.\nWe are not currently a party to any material legal proceedings.\nITEM 4. MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES.\nNot applicable.\n42\nPART II\nITEM 5. MARKET FOR REGISTRANT’S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY\nSECURITIES\nMarket Information\nOur common stock began trading on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol “ANAS” on May 13, 2022. Prior to that time, there was no public market for our\ncommon stock.\nStockholders\nAs of March 20, 2024, we had 3,020,268 outstanding shares of common stock outstanding, including treasury shares, no outstanding shares of preferred stock, and\napproximately 54 holders of record of our outstanding shares of common stock. A significant number of shares of our common stock are held in either nominee name or street\nname brokerage accounts, and consequently, we are unable to determine the total number of beneficial owners of our common stock.\nDividends\nTo date, we have not paid cash dividends on our common stock and do not plan to pay such dividends in the foreseeable future. Our Board will determine our future\ndividend policy on the basis of many factors, including results of operations, capital requirements, and general business conditions. Dividends, under the Delaware General\nCorporation Law, may only be paid from our net profits or surplus. To date, we have not had a fiscal year with net profits and, subject to a valuation by the Board of the present\nvalue of the Company’s assets, do not have surplus.\nUnregistered Sales of Equity Securities\nWe have previously disclosed all sales of securities without registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”).\nRepurchases of Equity Securities by the Issuer and Affiliated Purchasers\nDuring the year ended December 2023, the Company purchased 7,920 shares of its common stock, for a total price of $50,000.\nITEM 6. [RESERVED]\n43\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our consolidated financial statements and related notes\nand other financial information appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth\nelsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business, includes forward-looking statements that involve\nrisks and uncertainties. As a result of many factors, including those factors set forth in “Part I, Item 1A - Risk Factors” section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our actual\nresults could differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis.\nOverview\nActelis Networks, Inc. (“we,” “the Company”, “Actelis”, “us”, “our”) is a market leader in cyber-hardened, rapid-deployment networking solutions for wide-area IoT\napplications including federal, state and local government, intelligent traffic systems (“ITS”), military, utility, rail, telecom and campus applications. Our unique portfolio of\nhybrid fiber, environmentally hardened aggregation switches, high density Ethernet devices, advanced management software and cyber-protection capabilities, unlocks the\nhidden value of essential networks, delivering safer connectivity for rapid, cost-effective deployment.\nA primary focus of ours is to provide our customers with a cyber-secure network solution. We provide Triple-Shield protection of coding, scrambling and encryption of the\nnetwork traffic. We are working to expand our cyber-security offering by introducing a convergence of our network presence with the IoT devices at the edge of such networks,\nto which we call “Cyber Aware Networking”.\nWhen high speed, long reach, reliable and secure connectivity is required, network operators usually resort to using wireline communication over physical communication\nlines rather than wireless communication that is more limited in performance, reliability and security. However, wireline communication infrastructure is costly, and, based on\nour internal calculations, often accounts for more than 50% of total cost of ownership (ToC) and time to deploy wide-area IoT projects.\nTypically, providing new fiber connectivity to hard-to-reach locations is costly and time-consuming, often requiring permits for boring, trenching, and right-of-way.\nConnecting such hard-to-reach locations may cause significant delays and budget overruns in IoT projects. Our solutions aim to solve these challenges effectively accelerating\ndeployment of IoT projects, and making IoT projects more affordable and predictable to plan and budget.\nOur solutions can also provide remote power over existing copper lines to power up network elements and IoT components connected to them (like cameras and meters).\nConnecting power lines to millions of IoT locations can be costly and very time consuming (similar to data connectivity). By offering the ability to combine power delivery\nover the same existing copper lines that we use for high-speed data, we believe our solutions are solving yet another important challenge in connecting hard-to-reach locations.\nWe believe that combining communication and power over the same existing lines is particularly important to help connect many fifth generation, or 5G, small cells and Wi-Fi\nbase stations, as high cost of connectivity and power is often slowing their deployment. Our solutions have been tested for performance and security by the U.S. DoD\nlaboratories and approved for deployment with U.S. Federal Government and U.S. defense forces as part of APL (Approved Product List) in 2019. In 2023, we received the\nU.S. DoD certification for cyber-security and interoperability and Federal Information Processing Standard (“FIPS”) compliance 140-2 compliance and inclusion in the\nApproved Product List.\nSince our inception, our business was focused on serving telecommunication service providers, also known as Telcos, providing connectivity for enterprises and residential\ncustomers. Our products and solutions have been deployed with more than 100 telecommunication service providers worldwide, in enterprise, residential and mobile base\nstation connectivity applications. In recent years, as we have further developed our technology and rolled out additional products, we turned our focus on serving the wide-\narea IoT markets. Our operations are focused on our fast-growing IoT business, while maintaining our commitment to our existing Telco customers.\n44\nWe derive a growing portion of our revenue from our existing and new IoT customers. For the years ended December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, our IoT customers\nin the aggregate accounted for approximately 73% and 65% of our revenues, respectively.\nWe derive a significant portion of our revenue from a limited number of our customers. For the years ended December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, our top ten\ncustomers in the aggregate accounted for approximately 66% and 82% of our revenues.\nAs of December 31, 2023, we have one outstanding loan with Migdalor Business Investments Fund (“Migdalor”) in the original principal amount of approximately\n$6 million which is secured by all our assets (the “Migdalor Loan”), and of which approximately $4.3 million remains outstanding. In December 2022, we deposited $2 million\nto a Company-owned interest bearing bank account, or the “designated account” and an additional $2 million was deposited on or about February 28, 2023. Migdalor consented\nto allow us to seek additional accounts receivable financing which would be used to partially repay the Migdalor Loan, which would reduce or eliminate the Additional Deposit\n(as defined in our agreement with Migdalor) and increase free operating cashflow.\nIn February 2024, we entered into a new credit line facility from an Israeli bank of up to $1.5 million that increases the Company’s operating liquidity while not increasing\nthe Company’s total debt, as the Company will perform an early repayment of its existing debt using its restricted cash in a similar amount. The new credit line will be secured\nby customer invoices and will incur interest at a Federal SOFR rate plus 5.5% and is available until the end of 2024, with possible extension. The Company performed a partial\nearly repayment of its existing debt facility with Migdalor under the Loan Agreement using its restricted cash at an amount equal to the amount of funding from the new credit\nline to-date of approximately $550,000, therefore leaving the total debt amount of the Company at a similar level.\nIf we cannot generate sufficient cash flow from operations to service our debt, we may need to further refinance our debt, dispose of assets or issue equity to obtain\nnecessary funds. Migdalor consented to allow us to seek additional accounts receivable financing which would be used to partially repay the Migdalor Loan, which would\nreduce or eliminate the Additional Deposit (as defined in our agreement with Migdalor). We expect to continue repaying the principal and interest of the Migdalor Loan from\nour operating cash flow. Please refer to the “Liquidity and Financial Condition” section below for further discussion.\nResults of Operations\nThe table below provides our results of operations for the periods indicated.\nYear ended\nDecember 31\n2023 2022\n(dollars in thousands)\nRevenues 5,606 8,831\nCost of revenues 3,706 4,721\nGross profit 1,900 4,110\nResearch and development expenses 2,702 2,766\nSales and marketing, net 3,030 3,282\nGeneral and administrative 3,531 4,163\nOperating loss (7,363) (6,101)\nInterest expenses (766) (830)\nOther financial income (expenses), net 1,843 (4,051)\nNet Comprehensive Loss for the year (6,286) (10,982)\n45\nYear Ended December 31, 2023, Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2022\nRevenues\nOur revenues for the year ended December 31, 2023 amounted to $5.6 million, compared to $8.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The decrease was\nprimarily attributable to the decline of revenues generated from telco customers, as our focus continued to shift to IoT customers by $1.6 million significantly impacted by a\ntwo-year software license renewal in 2022, therefore not repeated in 2023, driving a $0.5 million decline, and to delays of IoT projects into 2024. By region, it is primarily\nattributable to a decrease of $1.7 million of revenues generated from North America and a decrease of $1.5 million of revenues generated from Europe, the Middle East and\nAfrica.\nCost of Revenues\nOur cost of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2023, amounted to $3.7 million compared to $4.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The decrease from\nthe corresponding period was mainly due to the decrease in revenues, partially offset by the higher effect of indirect costs as the percent of the lower revenues.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nOur research and development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2023, amounted to $2.7 million compared to $2.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2022.\nThe decrease is mainly due to a decrease in payroll expenses.\nSales and Marketing Expenses\nOur sales and marketing expenses for the year ended December 31, 2023, amounted to $3.0 million compared to $3.3 for the year ended December 31, 2022. The decrease\nwas mainly due to a decrease in commission expenses as a result of the decrease in revenues.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nOur general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2023, amounted to $3.5 million compared to $4.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2022.\nThis decrease was mainly due to a reduction in professional services of approximately $0.2 million, a decrease in management bonus expenses of $0.2 million, as well as a\nreduction in other non-payroll expenses associated with the IPO in 2022.\nOperating Loss\nOur operating loss for the year ended December 31, 2023, was $7.4 million, compared to an operating loss of $6.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The\nincrease was mainly due to the decrease in revenues and gross margin while continuing to invest in Sales and Marketing and Research and Development expenses, which was\noffset by a decrease in sales commission expenses as well as general and administrative one-time expenses due to the IPO in 2022.\nFinancial Expenses (income), Net\nOur financial expenses (income), net for the year ended December 31, 2023, was ($1.1) million (including $0.8 million interest expenses) compared to $4.9 million\n(including $0.8 million interest expenses) for the year ended December 31, 2022. In 2023, the Company recorded financial income in connection with a decrease in fair value\nof warrants in the amount of $1.7 million, while in 2022 the Company recorded finance expenses as a result of increase in fair value of various financial instruments prior to the\nIPO completed in May 2022, such as a convertible loan, note and warrants, in the amount of $4.5 million. The decrease in the finance expenses, net partially offset by a\ndecrease in income from exchange rate differences in the amount of $0.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to $0.5 during the year ended December 31,\n2022.\n46\nNet Loss\nOur net loss for the year ended December 31, 2023 was $6.3 million, compared to a net loss of 11.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. This decrease was\nprimarily due to the decrease in revenues and gross margin offset by a decrease in financial expenses, net resulting from the expenses incur by the conversion of the financial\ninstruments the Company had such as a convertible loan, note and warrants from the IPO completed in May 2022 for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to income\nin connection with a decrease in fair value of warrants for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nYear Ended Year Ended\nDecember 31, December 31,\n(U.S. dollars in thousands) 2023 2022\nRevenues $ 5,606 $ 8,831\nGAAP net loss (6,286) (10,982)\nInterest Expense 766 830\nOther financial expenses (income), net (1,843) 4,051\nTax Expense 78 94\nFixed asset depreciation expense 27 23\nStock based compensation 377 220\nResearch and development, capitalization 444 525\nOther one-time costs and expenses 371 1,174\nNon-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA (6,066) (4,065)\nGAAP net loss margin (112.14)% (124.36)%\nAdjusted EBITDA margin (108.20)% (46.03)%\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Information\nNon-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin are Non-GAAP financial measures. Their most directly comparable financial measures prepared in accordance\nwith accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”) are GAAP net loss and GAAP net loss margin. In addition to reporting financial results in\naccordance with GAAP, we provide Non-GAAP supplemental operating results adjusted for certain items, including: financial expenses, which are interest, financial instrument\nfair value adjustments, exchange rate differences of assets and liabilities, stock based compensation expenses, depreciation and amortization expense, tax expense, and impact\nof development expenses ahead of product launch. We adjust for the items listed above and show non-GAAP financial measures in all periods presented, unless the impact is\nclearly immaterial to our financial statements. When we calculate the tax effect of the adjustments, we include all current and deferred income tax expense commensurate with\nthe adjusted measure of pre-tax profitability.\nWe utilize the adjusted results to review our ongoing operations without the effect of these adjustments but not for comparison to budgeted operating results. We believe\nthe supplemental adjusted results are useful to investors because they help them compare our results to previous periods and provide important insights into underlying trends in\nthe business and how management oversees and optimizes our business operations on a day-to-day basis. We exclude the costs described above in calculating adjusted results to\nallow us and investors to evaluate the performance of the business based upon its expected ongoing operating structure. We believe the adjusted measures, accompanied by the\ndisclosure of the types of expenses included in these adjustments, provides valuable insight to our financial performance. Adjusted results should be considered only in\nconjunction with results reported according to GAAP.\n47\nThe non-GAAP financial measures are presented for supplemental informational purposes only. They should not be considered a substitute for financial information\npresented in accordance with GAAP, and may be different from similarly-titled non-GAAP measures used by other companies. A reconciliation is provided above for each non-\nGAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable financial measure stated in accordance with GAAP. Investors are encouraged to review the related GAAP financial\nmeasures and the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.\nFor the year ended\nDecember 31\n(U.S. dollars in thousands) 2023 2022\nRevenues $ 5,606 $ 8,831\nNon-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA (6,066) (4,065)\nAs a percentage of revenues (108.20)% (46.03)%\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nSince our inception, we have financed our operations primarily through the sale of equity securities, debt financing, convertible loans and royalty-bearing grants that we\nreceived from the Israel Innovation Authority. Our primary requirements for liquidity and capital are to finance working capital, capital expenditures and general corporate\npurposes. We also received proceeds of $15.4 million, net of underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering costs of $1.0 million, following our IPO in May 2022.\nIn May and December 2023, we also received proceeds of $4.6 million, net of underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering costs of $0.4 million, following our\nprivate placements.\nWe have incurred significant losses and negative cash flows from operations and net loss was $6.3 million and $11.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2023, and\nDecember 31, 2022, respectively. During the years ended December 31, 2023, and December 31, 2022, we had negative cash flows from operations of $6.6 million and $7.8\nmillion, respectively. As of December 31, 2023, our accumulated deficit was $39.7 million. We have funded our operations to date through equity and debt financing and have\ncash on hand (including short term bank deposits and restricted cash equivalents) of $2.4 million and long-term restricted cash and cash equivalents and restricted bank deposits\nof $3.4 as of December 31, 2023. We monitor our cash flow projections on a current basis and take active measures to obtain the funding it requires to continue our operations.\nHowever, these cash flow projections are subject to various uncertainties concerning their fulfilment such as the ability to increase revenues by attracting and expanding its\ncustomer base or reducing cost structure. If we are not successful in generating sufficient cash flow or completing additional financing, including debt refinancing which shall\nrelease restricted cash, then we will need to execute a new cost reduction plan in addition to previous cost reduction plans that were executed so far. Our transition to profitable\noperations is dependent on generating a level of revenue adequate to support our cost structure. We expect to fund operations using cash on hand, through operational cash\nflows and raising additional proceeds. There are no assurances, however, that we will be able to generate the revenue necessary to support our cost structure or that we will be\nsuccessful in obtaining the level of financing necessary for our operations. Management has evaluated the significance of these conditions and has determined that we do not\nhave sufficient resources to meet our operating obligations for at least one year from the issuance date of these consolidated financial statements. These conditions raise\nsubstantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern. These consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern\nand do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\nOur future capital requirements will be affected by many factors, including our revenue growth, the timing and extent of investments to support such growth, the expansion\nof sales and marketing activities, increases in general and administrative costs, repayment of principal of our existing credit line, working capital to support securing raw\nmaterial supply and many other factors as described under “Risk Factors.”\nTo the extent additional funds are necessary to meet our long-term liquidity needs as we continue to execute our business strategy, and cannot generate significant recurring\nrevenues, profit and cash flow provided by operating activity, we anticipate that they will be obtained through the incurrence of additional indebtedness, additional equity\nfinancings or a combination of these potential sources of funds. However, such financing may not be available on favorable terms, or at all. In particular, the repercussions from\nthe COVID 19 pandemic, inflation, economic uncertainty, as well as the war between Russia and the Ukraine and Israel, Hamas and Hezbollah, has resulted in, and may\ncontinue to result in, significant disruption of global financial markets, reducing our ability to access capital. If we are unable to raise additional funds when desired, our\nbusiness, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\n48\nCash Flows\nThe table below, for the periods indicated, provides selected cash flow information:\nYear Ended Year Ended\nDecember 31, December 31,\n(U.S. dollars in thousands) 2023 2022\nNet cash used in operating activities (including the effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash) $ (6,346) $ (7,768)\nNet cash provided by (used in) investing activities 3,821 (4,034)\nNet cash provided by financing activities 3,761 15,286\nNet change in cash $ 1,236 $ 3,484\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash of $5.5 million compared to $4.3 million of cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash as of\nDecember 31, 2022.\nCash used in operating activities (including the effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash) amounted to $6.3 million for the year\nended December 31, 2023, compared to $7.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The decrease in cash used in operating activities was mainly due to a decrease in\ntrade receivables, which was partially offset by the increase in our operational loss.\nNet cash provided by investing activities was $3.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to cash used in investing activities of $4.0 million for the year\nended December 31, 2022. The increase in cash used in investing activities was mainly due to changes in short term deposits and restricted bank deposits.\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $3.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to $15.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The\ncash flow from financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2023, resulted from proceeds from private placements which closed on May and December 2023 in the\naggregate amount of $4.6 million, net of underwriting commissions and other offering costs of $0.4 million see note 14(d) to the condensed consolidated financial statements.\nThe cash flow from financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2022, resulted from proceeds from the Company’s IPO in the amount of $15.4, net of underwriting\ndiscounts and commissions and other offering costs of $1.0 million.\n49\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nManagement’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on the audited consolidated financial statements which are included\nelsewhere in this prospectus. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts\nof assets and liabilities, the disclosure of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting\nperiod. Actelis bases its estimates on historical and anticipated results, trends and various other assumptions that it believes are reasonable under the circumstances, including\nassumptions as to future events. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nManagement considers accounting estimates to be critical if both (i) the nature of the estimate or assumption is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment\ninvolved, and (ii) the impact within a reasonable range of outcomes of the estimate and assumption is material to the Actelis financial condition.\nManagement believes the following addresses the most critical accounting policies and estimates, which are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial\ncondition and results of operations and require management’s most difficult, subjective and complex judgments.\nCritical judgement and estimates\nCritical judgement and estimates have been used primarily in estimating the fair value of our financial instruments (for example, warrants, notes and stock options), as well\nas the estimate of future usage of existing inventory to determine the net value of our inventory (see notes in financial statements).\nEstimating the fair value of financial instruments such as warrants, notes and stock options are influenced by assessments of our future financial performance. Such\nassessments are forward-looking in nature and therefore subject to significant uncertainty. Estimating the value of net inventory is also influenced by assessments of future\nusage of such inventory which is also forward looking in nature and therefore subject to significant uncertainty.\nMarketable securities\nMarketable securities consist of debt securities. We elected the fair value option to measure and recognize our investments in debt securities in accordance with ASC 825,\nFinancial Instruments as we manage our portfolio and evaluates the performance on a fair value basis. Changes in fair value, realized gains and losses on sales of marketable\nsecurities, are reflected in the statements of operation as finance expense (income), net.\nInventory\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost (cost is determined on a weighted average cost method) or net realizable value. Our inventories generally are subject to\nimpairment as they age. We regularly evaluate the carrying value of our inventories and when, based on such evaluation, factors indicate that impairment has occurred, we\nimpair the inventories’ carrying value.\nRevenue recognition\nThe Company’s products consist of hardware and embedded software that function together to deliver the product’s essential functionality. The embedded software is\nessential to the functionality of the Company’s products. The Company’s products are generally sold with a two-year warranty for repairs or replacements of the product in the\nevent of damage or failure during the term of the support period, which is accounted for as a standard warranty. Services relating to repair or replacement of hardware beyond\nthe standard warranty period are offered under renewable, fee-based contracts and include telephone support, remote diagnostics and access to on-site technical support\npersonnel.\n50\nThe Company also offers its customers other management software. The Company sells its other non-embedded software either as perpetual or as term-based licenses.\nThe Company provides, to certain customers, software updates that it chooses to develop, which the Company refers to as unspecified software updates, and enhancements\nrelated to the Company’s management software through support service contracts. The Company also offers its customers product support services which include telephone\nsupport, remote diagnostics and access to on-site technical support personnel.\nThe Company’s customers are comprised of end-users, resellers, system integrators and distributors.\nThe Company follows five steps to record revenue: (i) identify the contract with a customer; (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (iii) determine the\ntransaction price; (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) it satisfies its performance\nobligations.\nPerformance obligations promised in a contract are identified based on the goods or services that will be transferred to the customer that are both capable of being distinct,\nwhereby the customer can benefit from the good or service either on its own or together with other resources that are readily available from third parties or from the Company,\nand are distinct in the context of the contract, whereby the transfer of the goods or services is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract.\nThe transaction price is determined based on the consideration to which the Company will be entitled in exchange for transferring goods or services to the customer. The\nCompany’s contracts do not include additional discounts once the product price is set, right of returns, significant financing components or any forms of variable consideration.\nThe Company uses the practical expedient and does not assess the existence of a significant financing component when the difference between payment and revenue\nrecognition is less than a year. The Company’s service period is for one or more years and is paid for either up front or on a quarterly basis.\nAccounting standards updates not yet adopted\nPlease see Note 2(hh) to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this prospectus for information.\nITEM 7A.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA.\nACTELIS NETWORKS, INC.\n2023 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nPage\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm (PCAOB name: Kesselman & Kesselman C.P.A.s and PCAOB ID: 1309) F-2\nConsolidated financial statements – U.S. dollars in thousands (except for share and per share amounts):\nBalance sheets F-3 – F-4\nStatements of comprehensive loss F-5\nStatements of mezzanine equity and shareholders’ equity F-6\nStatements of cash flows F-7 – F-8\nNotes to consolidated financial statements F-9 – F-42\nF-1\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Actelis Networks, Inc.\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Actelis Networks, Inc. and its subsidiary (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the\nrelated consolidated statements of comprehensive loss, of mezzanine equity and shareholders’ equity and of cash flows for the years then ended, including the related notes\n(collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial\nposition of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended in conformity with accounting\nprinciples generally accepted in the United States of America.\nSubstantial Doubt about the Company’s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 1b to the\nconsolidated financial statements, the Company has incurred recurring losses and negative cash flows from operating activities and has an accumulated deficit as of December\n31, 2023 that raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management’s plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 1b. The\nconsolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s consolidated\nfinancial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are\nrequired to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and\nExchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits of these consolidated financial statements in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit\nto obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not\nrequired to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of\ninternal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.\nAccordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing\nprocedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial\nstatements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of\nthe consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n/s/ Kesselman & Kesselman\nCertified Public Accountants (Isr.)\nA member firm of PricewaterhouseCoopers International Limited\nTel Aviv, Israel\nMarch 26, 2024\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2019.\nKesselman & Kesselman, 146 Derech Menachem Begin, Tel-Aviv 6492103, Israel,\nP.O Box 7187 Tel-Aviv 6107120, Telephone: +972 -3- 7954555, Fax:+972 -3- 7954556, www.pwc.com/il\nF-2\nACTELIS NETWORKS, INC.\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\n(U.

GENERAL:\na. Actelis Networks, Inc. (hereafter -the Company) was established in 1998, under the laws of the state of Delaware. The Company has a wholly-owned subsidiary in\nIsrael, Actelis Networks Israel Ltd. (hereafter – the Subsidiary). The Company is engaged in the design, development, manufacturing, and marketing of cyber\nhardened, hybrid fiber, networking solutions for IoT and Telecommunication governmental agencies and companies. The Company’s customers include\ngovernmental agencies, providers of telecommunication services, enterprises as well as resellers of the Company’s products. On May 12, 2022, the Company\naccepted a notification of effectiveness from the SEC, and on May 17, 2022, completed its IPO. See note 14c below for further details. The Company’s Common\nStock is listed on the NASDAQ.\nb. The Company has incurred significant losses and negative cash flows from operations, net loss was $6,286 and $10,982 for the years ended December 31, 2023,\nand December 31, 2022, respectively. During the years ended December 31, 2023, and December 31, 2022, the Company had negative cash flows from operations\nof $6,577 and $7,768, respectively. As of December 31, 2023, the Company’s accumulated deficit was $39,688. The Company has funded its operations to date\nthrough equity and debt financing and has cash on hand (including short term bank deposits and restricted cash equivalents) of $2,382 and long-term restricted\ncash and cash equivalents and restricted bank deposits of $3,424 as of December 31, 2023. The Company monitors its cash flow projections on a current basis and\ntakes active measures to obtain the funding it requires to continue its operations. However, these cash flow projections are subject to various uncertainties\nconcerning their fulfilment such as the ability to increase revenues by attracting and expanding its customer base or reducing cost structure. If the Company is not\nsuccessful in generating sufficient cash flow or completing additional financing, including debt refinancing which shall release restricted cash, then it will need to\nexecute a new cost reduction plan in addition to previous cost reduction plans that were executed so far. The Company’s transition to profitable operations is\ndependent on generating a level of revenue adequate to support its cost structure. The Company expects to fund operations using cash on hand, through\noperational cash flows and raising additional proceeds. There are no assurances, however, that the Company will be able to generate the revenue necessary to\nsupport its cost structure or that it will be successful in obtaining the level of financing necessary for its operations. Management has evaluated the significance of\nthese conditions and has determined that the Company does not have sufficient resources to meet its operating obligations for at least one year from the issuance\ndate of these consolidated financial statements. These conditions raise substantial doubt as to the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. These\nconsolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern and do not include any adjustments that might\nresult from the outcome of this uncertainty.\nc. On October 7th, 2023, an attack by the Hamas terrorist organization was inflicted on the State of Israel which started a war between Israel and the Hamas as well\nas military conflicts on other fronts. As of the date of the issuance of these consolidated financial statements, the Company has not identified any material effect\non its operations as a result of those events. The Company continues to monitor its ongoing activities and will make adjustments in its business if needed,\nincluding updating any estimates or judgments impacting its financial statements as appropriate, while supporting the safety and well-being of its employees. It is\ncurrently not possible to predict the effects of such conflicts and its impact on the Company’s business, operations or financial conditions.\nF-9\nNOTE 2 - SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES:\na. Basis of Presentation\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of\nAmerica (“US GAAP”).\nb. Use of estimates in preparation of financial statements\nThe preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that\naffect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. The Company evaluates on an ongoing basis its assumptions,\nincluding those related to Fair value of financial instruments, inventory write-offs, as well as in estimates used in applying the revenue recognition policy. The\nCompany’s management believes that the estimates, judgment, and assumptions used are reasonable based upon information available at the time they are made.\nThese estimates, judgments and assumptions can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of liabilities at the dates of the consolidated\nfinancial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nc. Functional currency\nThe currency of the primary economic environment in which the operations of the Company and its Subsidiary are conducted is the U.S. dollar (“$” or “dollar”).\nTherefore, the functional currency of the Company and its Subsidiary is the dollar. In determining the appropriate functional currency to be used, the Company\nreviewed factors relating to sales, costs and expenses, financing activities and cash flows.\nTransactions and balances denominated in dollars are presented at their original amounts. Non-dollar transactions and balances have been re-measured to dollars\nin accordance with the provisions of ASC 830-10, “Foreign Currency Translation”. All transaction gains and losses from re-measurement of monetary balance\nsheet items denominated in non-dollar currencies are reflected in the statement of comprehensive loss as Other financial income (expenses), net , as appropriate.\nd. Principles of consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiary. Intercompany transactions and balances have been\neliminated upon consolidation.\ne. Cash and cash equivalents\nThe Company considers all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents. Cash\nequivalents are carried at cost, which approximates their fair value.\nf. Restricted cash and cash equivalents and restricted deposits\nRestricted cash and cash equivalents consists of cash and cash equivalents held in restricted accounts, classified as current or long term based on the expected\ntiming of the disbursement. Restricted deposits consist of deposits held in restricted deposit bank accounts including deposits held as collateral for guarantees to\nthird parties and others, classified as current or long term based on the expected timing of the disbursement.\ng. Treasury Shares\nTreasury shares represent ordinary shares repurchased by the Company that are no longer outstanding and are held by the Company. Treasury shares are accounted\nfor under the cost method. Under this method, repurchases of ordinary shares are recorded as treasury shares at historical purchase prices. The treasury shares\nhave no rights.\nF-10\nNOTE 2 - SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued):\nh. Trade Receivables, net\nTrade receivables are recorded at the invoiced amount, are mostly unsecured and do not bear interest. Accounts receivable have been reduced by an allowance for\ncredit losses. The Company maintains the allowance for estimated losses resulting from the inability of the Company’s customers to make required payments. The\nallowance represents the current estimate of lifetime expected credit losses over the remaining duration of existing accounts receivable considering current market\nconditions and supportable forecasts when appropriate. The estimate is a result of the Company’s ongoing evaluation of collectability, customer creditworthiness,\nhistorical levels of credit losses and future expectations. On this basis, management has determined that an allowance for credit losses of $168 and $125 was\nappropriate as of December 31, 2023, and December 31, 2022, respectively. Expenses for allowance for credit losses for the years ended December 31, 2023, and\n2022 were $43 and $64, respectively.\ni. Inventories\nInventories are stated at a lower of cost or net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less\nreasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. Inventory write-offs are provided to cover risks arising from slow-moving items, excess\ninventories, discontinued products, new products introduction and for market prices lower than cost. Any write-off is recognized in the consolidated statement of\ncomprehensive loss as cost of revenues. In addition, if required, the Company records a liability for firm non-cancelable and unconditional purchase commitments\nwith contract manufacturers for quantities in excess of the Company’s future demands forecast consistent with its valuation of excess and obsolete inventory.\nCost is determined as follows:\nRaw materials, parts, supplies and finished products- using the weighted average cost method.\nj. Property and equipment, net\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. Depreciation expense is calculated on\na straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the related assets. The cost and related accumulated depreciation of assets sold or otherwise disposed of are\nremoved from the accounts and the related gain or loss is reported in the statement of comprehensive loss.\nThe useful lives of the assets are as follows:\nYears\nComputers, electronic equipment Mainly 3\nOffice furniture and equipment 7\nLeasehold improvements By the shorter of lease term and the\nestimated useful life of the asset\nk. Impairment of long-lived assets subject to amortization\nThe Company evaluates long-lived assets, such as property and equipment with finite lives, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate\nthe carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. The Company identifies impairment of long-lived assets when estimated undiscounted future cash flows\nexpected to result from the use of the assets plus net proceeds expected from disposition of the assets, if any, are less than the carrying value of the assets. If the\nCompany identifies an impairment, the Company reduces the carrying amount of the assets to their estimated fair value based on a discounted cash flow approach\nor, when available and appropriate, to comparable market values.\nl. Revenue recognition\nThe Company’s products consist of hardware and embedded software that function together to deliver the product’s essential functionality. The embedded\nsoftware is essential to the functionality of the Company’s products. The Company’s products are generally sold with a two-year warranty for repairs or\nreplacements of the product in the event of damage or failure during the term of the support period, which is accounted for as a standard warranty. Services\nrelating to repair or replacement of hardware beyond the standard warranty period are offered under renewable, fee-based contracts and include telephone support,\nremote diagnostics and access to on-site technical support personnel.\nF-11\nNOTE 2 - SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued):\nThe Company also offers its customers other management software. The Company sells its other non-embedded software either as perpetual or as term-based\nlicenses.\nThe Company provides, to certain customers, software updates that it chooses to develop, which the Company refers to as unspecified software updates, and\nenhancements related to the Company’s management software through support service contracts. The Company also offers its customers product support services\nwhich include telephone support, remote diagnostics and access to on-site technical support personnel.\nThe Company’s customers are comprised of end-users, resellers, system integrators and distributors.\nThe Company follows five steps to record revenue: (i) identify the contract with a customer; (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (iii)\ndetermine the transaction price; (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) it satisfies\nits performance obligations.\nPerformance obligations promised in a contract are identified based on the goods or services that will be transferred to the customer that are both capable of being\ndistinct, whereby the customer can benefit from the good or service either on its own or together with other resources that are readily available from third parties\nor from the Company, and are distinct in the context of the contract, whereby the transfer of the goods or services is separately identifiable from other promises in\nthe contract.\nThe transaction price is determined based on the consideration to which the Company will be entitled in exchange for transferring goods or services to the\ncustomer. The Company’s contracts do not include additional discounts once the product price is set, right of returns, significant financing components or any\nforms of variable consideration.\nThe Company uses the practical expedient and does not assess the existence of a significant financing component when the difference between payment and\nrevenue recognition is less than a year. The Company’s service period is for one or more years and is paid for either up front or on a quarterly basis.\nSales of products\nMost of the Company’s contracts are of a single performance obligation (sales of the product with a standard warranty) thus the entire transaction price is\nallocated to the single performance obligation. In addition, the Company also sells separate services such as product support service and extended warranty.\nSales of software with related services\nThe Company sells perpetual management software and term-based licenses for its management software together with related services. The perpetual\nmanagement software stand-alone selling price is established by taking into consideration available information such as historical selling prices of the perpetual\nlicense, geographic location, and market conditions. For contracts that contain more than one identified performance obligation (a term-based license for its\nmanagement software together with related services), the stand-alone selling price of a term-based license, is based on a ratio from the relevant perpetual\nmanagement software stand-alone selling price. The stand-alone selling price of the related service is then determined by applying the residual method.\nF-12\nNOTE 2 - SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued):\nRevenue from selling the Company’s product and/or the software management (either as term-based or perpetual) is recognized at a point in time which is\ntypically at the time of shipment of products to the customer or when the code is transferred, respectively. Revenue from services (e.g., product support service,\nsoftware support service or extended warranty) is recognized on a straight-line basis over the service period, as a time-based measure of progress best reflects our\nperformance in satisfying this performance obligation.\nm. Cost of revenues\nCost of revenues includes cost of materials, costs associated with packaging, assembly and testing costs, as well as cost of personnel (including share-based\ncompensation), shipping costs, inventory write down, royalties, costs of logistics and quality assurance, access to on-site technical support personnel as well as\nwarranty expenses and other expenses associated with manufacturing support.\nn. Offering Costs associated with the Initial Public Offering and private placements\nOffering costs consist principally of professional and registration fees incurred through the balance sheet date that are related to the IPO and private placements.\nOffering costs directly attributable to the issuance of an equity contract to be classified in equity are recorded as a reduction of equity.\nIn 2022, as a result of the IPO, the Company incurred offering costs amounting to approximately $1.45 million, related to underwriting discounts and\ncommissions, and other offering costs of $1 million- see note 14c\nIn 2023 as a result of private placements, the Company incurred offering and other costs amounting to approximately $0.4 million - see note 14d.\no. Basic and diluted net loss per share\nBasic net loss per share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares, Pre-Funded Warrants to purchase shares of Common Stock for an\nexercise price of $0.0001 which are exercisable immediately and fully vested RSUs outstanding during the period, net of treasury shares. In computing diluted\nloss per share, basic loss per share is adjusted to take into account the potential dilution that could occur upon: (i) the exercise of options and non-vested RSUs\ngranted under employee stock compensation plans, and the exercise of warrants using the treasury stock method; and (ii) the conversion of the redeemable\nconvertible preferred stock, and convertible loan using the “if-converted” method, by adding to net loss the change in the fair value of the convertible loan, net of\ntax benefits, and by adding the weighted average number of shares issuable upon assumed conversion of these instruments; and (iii) the conversion of the warrants\nclassified as lability, by adding to net loss the change in the fair value of the warrants and by adding the weighted average number of shares issuable upon\nassumed conversion of these warrants using the treasury stock method.\np. Fair value of financial instruments\nFair value measurements are classified and disclosed in one of the following three categories:\nLevel 1 – Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities.\nLevel 2 – Quoted prices in markets that are not active, or inputs which are observable, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the asset or\nliability.\nLevel 3 – Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.\nThe Company measured the fair value of the warrants (see note 13) based on Level 3 inputs, and the warrants liability amounted to $8 as of December 31, 2023,\nand 2022, are presented in the Other current liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.\nF-13\nNOTE 2 - SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued):\nAs of December 31, 2023, and 2022, the fair values of the Company’s cash, cash equivalents, short and long-term deposits, Restricted bank deposits, trade\nreceivables, trade payables, long-term loan and restricted cash approximated the carrying values of these instruments presented in the Company’s consolidated\nbalance sheets because of their nature.\nq. Concentrations of credit risk\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject the Company to significant concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, restricted\ncash, trade receivables and Restricted bank deposits. Cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash are placed with banks and financial institutions in the United\nStates and Israel.\nManagement believes that the financial institutions that hold the Company’s investments are financially sound and, accordingly, present minimal credit risk with\nrespect to those investments.\nThe Company’s trade receivables are derived primarily from telecommunication operators, the Company’s reseller customers and enterprises located mainly in the\nUnited States, Europe, and Asia.\nCredit risk with respect to trade receivables exists to the full extent of the amounts presented in the consolidated financial statements. Management makes\njudgments as to its ability to collect outstanding accounts receivable and provides allowances for the applicable portion of accounts receivable when collection\nbecomes doubtful.\nManagement provides allowances based upon a specific review of all significant outstanding invoices, analysis of its historical collection experience, and current\neconomic trends. If the historical data used to calculate the allowance for doubtful accounts does not reflect the Company’s future ability to collect outstanding\naccounts receivable, additional provisions for doubtful accounts may be needed, and the future results of operations could be materially affected.\nThe Company has customers balances representing 10% or more of Trade receivables as follows:\n1. Customer A- 30% and 5% of the Company Trade receivables balance as of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022 respectively.\n2. Customer B- 11% and 29% of the Company Trade receivables balance as of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022 respectively.\n3. Customer C- 11% and 1% of the Company Trade receivables balance as of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022 respectively.\nSee note 17 for details regarding the revenues from these customers.\nThe Company does not see any credit risk regarding this balance, as most of the remaining balance was paid off after the balance sheet date.\nF-14\nNOTE 2 - SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued):\nr. Warranty costs\nThe Company’s products generally include a standard warranty of two years for product defects. The Company accrues for warranty at the time revenue is\nrecognized. The Company’s estimates of future warranty obligations may change due to product failure rates, material usage, and other rework costs incurred in\ncorrecting a product failure. In addition, specific warranty accruals may be recorded if unforeseen problems arise. The provision for warranty amounted to $47 and\n$96 as of December 31, 2023, and 2022, respectively. These provisions are included in “Other current liabilities” and “Other long-term liabilities” in the\naccompanying consolidated balance sheets.\ns. Sales and marketing expenses, net\nSales and marketing expenses include such expenses for the company’s sales teams, business development activities, sales engineering, and customer support.\nt. Research and development costs\nResearch and development costs are expensed as incurred and include compensation for engineers, external services, and material costs associated with new\nproduct development, enhancement of current products.\nBased on the Company’s product development process, the Company does not incur material costs after the point in time at which the product as a whole reaches\ntechnological feasibility.\nu. Shipping and handling\nThe Company classifies shipping and handling charged to customers as revenues and classifies costs relating to shipping and handling as cost of revenues.\nv. Government grants and related royalties\nThe Company is paying royalties to the government of Israel for funding received for research and development. Royalties are calculated and paid at a rate of 3%\nof the applicable revenues. During 2023 and 2022, respectively, the Company incurred royalty expenses of $334 and $257, included within cost of revenues (see\nnote 11).\nw. Segments\nThe Company operates in one segment. Management does not segregate its business for internal reporting. The chief operating decision maker is the Company’s\nChief Executive Officer (“CODM”) The CODM evaluates the performance of its business based on financial data consistent with the presentation in the\naccompanying financial statements. The Company concluded that its unified business is conducted globally and accordingly represents one operating segment.\nF-15\nNOTE 2 - SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued):\nx. Income taxes\nThe Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with ASC 740, “Income Taxes” (“ASC 740”). ASC 740 prescribes the use of the asset and liability method\nwhereby deferred tax assets and liability account balances are determined based on differences between the financial reporting and the tax basis of assets and\nliabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. The Company provides a\nvaluation allowance, if necessary, to reduce deferred tax assets to their estimated realizable value if it is more likely than not that a portion or all of the deferred\ntax assets will not be realized.\nThe Company implements a two-step approach to recognize and measure uncertain tax positions. The first step is to evaluate the tax position taken or expected to\nbe taken in a tax return by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that, on an evaluation of the technical merits, the\ntax position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the\nlargest amount that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement. The Company does not have any liabilities in any reported periods regarding\nuncertain tax positions.\nTaxes which would apply in the event of disposal of investment in foreign subsidiary have not been taken into account in computing the deferred taxes, since the\nCompany’s intention is to hold, and not to realize the investment.\ny. Employee related benefits:\nSeverance pay\nThe Company’s liability for severance pay for its Israeli employees is calculated pursuant to the Israeli Severance Pay Law based on the most recent salary of the\nemployees multiplied by the number of years of employment, as of the balance sheet date. Employees whose employment is terminated by the Company or who\nare otherwise entitled to severance pay in accordance with Israeli law or labor agreements are entitled to one month’s salary for each year of employment or a\nportion thereof. The Company’s liability for all of its Israeli employees is partly provided for by monthly deposits for insurance policies and the remainder by an\naccrual. The accrued value of these policies is recorded as an asset in the Company’s consolidated balance sheet. Such deposits are not considered to be “plan\nassets” and are therefore included in “Severance pay fund” in the consolidated balance sheets.\nDuring April and May 2008 (the “transition date”), the Company amended the contracts of most of its Israeli employees so that starting on the transition date, such\nemployees are subject to Section 14 of the Severance Pay Law, 1963 (“Section 14”) for severance pay accumulated in periods of employment subsequent to the\ntransition date. Pursuant to Section 14, these employees are entitled to monthly deposits made by the Company on their behalf with insurance companies. These\ndeposits are not recorded as an asset on the Company’s balance sheet, and there is no liability recorded as the Company does not have a future obligation to make\nany additional payments. The Company’s contributions to the defined contribution plans are charged to the consolidated statements of Comprehensive loss as and\nwhen the services are received from the Company’s employees. For the Company’s employees in Israel that began employment prior to Article 14, the Company\ncalculates the liability for severance pay based on the most recent salary of these employees multiplied by the number of years of employment as of the Article 14\ninception date. These liabilities are presented under “Accrued severance pay” in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets.\nThe carrying value for the deposited funds for the Company’s employees’ severance pay for employment periods prior to the transition date includes profits and\nlosses accumulated up to the balance sheet date.\nF-16\nNOTE 2 - SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued):\nThe amounts of contribution plans expenses were approximately $175 and $182 for each of the years ended December 31, 2023, and 2022, respectively.\nThe Company expects to contribute approximately $169 in the year ending December 31, 2024, to insurance companies in connection with its contribution plans.\nGain (loss) on amounts funded in respect of employee rights upon retirement totaled approximately $5 and $(4) for the years ended December 31, 2023, and\nDecember 31, 2022, respectively.\n401(k) profit sharing plans\nThe Company has a number of savings plans in the United States that qualify under Section 401(k) of the current Internal Revenue Code as a “safe harbor” plan.\nThe Company must make a mandatory contribution to the 401(k) plan to satisfy certain nondiscrimination requirements under the Internal Revenue Code. This\nmandatory contribution is made to all eligible employees. The contribution costs were $8 and $9 for the years ended December 31, 2023, and 2022, respectively.\nz. Share-based compensation\nShare-based compensation expense for all share-based payment awards, including share options and restricted share units (“RSUs”), is determined based on the\ngrant-date fair value. The Company recognizes these compensation costs net of actual forfeitures and recognizes compensation cost for all options on a straight-\nline basis over the requisite service period of the award, which is generally the option vesting term of four years and three years for the RSUs.\nThe Company accounts for share-based compensation arrangements with non-employees based on the estimated fair value of the equity instrument using the\nBlack-Scholes option-pricing model. Compensation cost is recognized over the period that the services are provided, and the award is earned by the counterparty.\nThe Company follows ASC 718 to determine whether a share-based payment should be classified and accounted for as a liability award or equity award. All\ngrants of share-based awards to employee classified as equity awards are recognized in the financial statements based on their grant date fair values which are\ncalculated using the Black-Scholes Option-pricing model.\nFor options and RSU’s with graded vesting, the Company has elected a fair-value-based measure of the entire award by using a single weighted-average expected\nterm.\nThe Company records forfeitures for share-based payments awards as they occur.\nShare-based compensation classified as mezzanine equity\nShare-based compensation subject to possible redemption are classified as mezzanine equity based on the guidance provided under ASC 480-10-S99-3A and SAB\nTopic 14E. See also Note 14d for additional information on share-based compensation granted to the underwriter in connection with an offering of common stocks\nand warrants.\naa. Convertible Note\nThe Company follows ASC 480-10, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity (“ASC 480-10”) in its evaluation of the accounting for a hybrid instrument. A financial\ninstrument that embodies an unconditional obligation, or a financial instrument other than an outstanding share that embodies a conditional obligation, that the\nissuer must or may settle by issuing a variable number of its equity shares shall be classified as a liability (or an asset in some circumstances) if, at inception, the\nmonetary value of the obligation is based solely or predominantly on any one of the following: (a) a fixed monetary amount known at inception; (b) variations in\nsomething other than the fair value of the issuer’s equity shares; or (c) variations inversely related to changes in the fair value of the issuer’s equity shares. Hybrid\ninstruments meeting these criteria are not further evaluated for any embedded derivatives and are carried as a liability at fair value at each balance sheet date with\nremeasurements reported in interest expense in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Loss.\nF-17\nNOTE 2 - SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued):\nThe Company concluded that the value of the note is predominantly based on a fixed monetary amount known at the date of issuance, to be converted into shares\nof common stock, at a conversion price per share reflecting a discount of 40% from the conversion price Accordingly, the note was classified as a liability and is\nmeasured at its fair value at each reporting date, pursuant to the provisions of ASC 480-10. Upon the consummation of the IPO, the convertible note was\nautomatically converted into the Company’s common stock based on its contractual terms and conditions. (See note 10).\nbb. Convertible loan\nThe Company follows ASC 480-10, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity (“ASC 480-10”) in its evaluation of the accounting for a hybrid instrument. A financial\ninstrument that embodies an unconditional obligation, or a financial instrument other than an outstanding share that embodies a conditional obligation, that the\nissuer must or may settle by issuing a variable number of its equity shares shall be classified as a liability (or an asset in some circumstances) if, at inception, the\nmonetary value of the obligation is based solely or predominantly on any one of the following: (a) a fixed monetary amount known at inception; (b) variations in\nsomething other than the fair value of the issuer’s equity shares; or (c) variations inversely related to changes in the fair value of the issuer’s equity shares. Hybrid\ninstruments meeting these criteria are not further evaluated for any embedded derivatives and are carried as a liability at fair value at each balance sheet date with\nremeasurements reported in interest expense in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Loss.\nThe Company concluded that the value of the loan is predominantly based on a fixed monetary amount known at the date of issuance, to be converted into shares\nof common stock, at a conversion price per share reflecting a discount of no more than 65% of the lowest price per share paid by any investor in an offering.\nAccordingly, the loan was classified as a liability and is measured at its fair value, pursuant to the provisions of ASC 480-10. Upon the consummation of the IPO,\nthe convertible loan was automatically converted into the Company’s common stock based on its contractual terms and conditions. (See note 10).\ncc. Warrants\nCommon stock warrants\nThe Company accounts for its warrants as either equity-classified or liability-classified instruments based on an assessment of the specific terms of the warrants\nand applicable authoritative guidance in Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 480, “Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity” (“ASC 480”), and ASC 815,\n“Derivatives and Hedging” (“ASC 815”). The assessment considers whether the warrants are freestanding financial instruments pursuant to ASC 480, meet the\ndefinition of a liability pursuant to ASC 480, or meet all of the requirements for equity classification under ASC 815, including whether the warrants are indexed\nto the Company’s own common stock and whether the warrant holders could potentially require “net cash settlement” in a circumstance outside of the Company’s\ncontrol, among other conditions for equity classification. See note 14.\nRedeemable Preferred stock warrants\nThe Company accounts for redeemable preferred stock warrants at fair value and classifies redeemable preferred stock warrants as liabilities in accordance with\nASC 480, as the warrants are exercisable into contingently redeemable preferred stock as described in Note 14. All redeemable preferred stock warrants are\nrecognized at fair value and re-measured at each balance sheet date. At the end of each reporting period, changes in fair value during the period are recognized as a\ncomponent of financial income (expense), net.\nF-18\nNOTE 2 - SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued):\nFollowing the guidance of ASC 480, the Redeemable Preferred stock warrants were required to be classified as a liability because the redemption feature of their\nunderlying redeemable preferred stock potentially requires the Company to repurchase its stock by transferring assets upon specific events which would not\nnecessarily be within the control of the Company (See note 14). In connection with the consummation of the IPO, the type of the stock has changed from\nredeemable preferred stock to common stock at conversion, and the Company re-evaluated the classification of certain warrants.\nOther redeemable preferred stock warrants were converted into the Company’s common stock upon the consummation of the IPO.\nWarrants issued in connection with obtaining loans and/or securing credit facilities.\nWarrants issued in connection with obtaining a loan or securing a credit facility are considered deferred issuance costs. Deferred issuance costs for obtaining a\nloan are reflected as a deduction from the carrying amount of the related loan and are amortized using the effective interest method.\ndd. Redeemable Preferred stock\nThe Company’s redeemable preferred stock is not mandatorily redeemable, nor redeemable at the option of the holder after a specified date, but a deemed\nliquidation event would constitute a redemption event outside of the common shareholders’ control. Therefore, all redeemable Preferred stock has been presented\noutside of permanent equity in accordance with ASC 480-10-S99-3A, “Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity”. Upon the consummation of the IPO, all of the\nCompany’s redeemable preferred stocks were converted into common stock and reclassified from temporary equity, into permanent equity (see note 14c)\nee. Commitments and contingencies\nThe Company accounts for its contingent liabilities in accordance with ASC Topic 450, Contingencies (“ASC 450”). A provision is recorded when it is both\nprobable that liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. With respect to legal matters, provisions are reviewed and\nadjusted to reflect the impact of negotiations, estimated settlements, legal rulings, advice of legal counsel and other information and events pertaining to a\nparticular matter.\nff. Reverse stock split\nOn April 15, 2022, the Company’s Board of Directors approved a Reverse Stock Split in the ratio of forty-six to-one. The Reverse Stock split became effective as\nof May 2, 2022.\nOn March 8, 2023, the Company’s Board of Directors approved an additional Reverse Stock Split in the ratio of ten-to-one. The Reverse Stock split became\neffective as of April 18, 2023.\nThe Company accounted for the Reverse Stock Splits on a retroactive basis. As a result, all common stock, Non-voting Common stock, redeemable Convertible\nPreferred stock, warrants, RSUs and options outstanding and exercisable for common stock, exercise prices and loss per share amounts have been adjusted, on a\nretroactive basis, for all periods presented in these consolidated financial statements and the applicable disclosures, to reflect such Reverse Stock Splits.\nF-19\nNOTE 2 - SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued):\ngg. Leases\nOn January 1, 2022, the Company adopted ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (“Topic 842”). The Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Balances\nrelated to operating leases are included in operating lease right-of-use (“ROU”) assets, Current maturities of operating leases liabilities and non-current operating\nleases liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets.\nLeases primarily consist of real estate property and vehicles and are classified as operating leases with fixed payment terms. The Company determines if an\narrangement is a lease, or contains a lease, at inception and records the leases upon lease commencement, which is the date when the underlying asset is made\navailable for use by the lessor. Right-of-use (“ROU”) assets represent the Company’s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities\nrepresent the Company’s obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease.\nLease expenses for the operating leases are recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term and are included in operating expenses in the consolidated\nstatements of operations and comprehensive loss. Options to extend or terminate the lease are taken into account when it is reasonably certain at the\ncommencement date that such options will be exercised. The Company elected to apply for the short-term lease exemption for lease with a non-cancelable period\nof twelve months or less. Additionally, the Company has lease agreements with lease and non-lease components. On the commencement date, lease payments that\ninclude variable lease payments dependent on an index or a rate (such as the Consumer Price Index or a market interest rate), are initially measured using the\nindex or rate at the commencement date. Such variable payments are recognized in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss in the period\nin which the event or condition that triggers the payment occurs. These variable payment amounts were not material to the consolidated financial statements for\nthe periods presented.\nThe interest rate used to determine the present value of the future lease payments is the Company’s incremental borrowing rate because the interest rate implicit in\nmost of its leases is not readily determinable.\nASC 842 provides several optional practical expedients in transition, which permits the Company not to reassess its prior conclusions regarding lease\nidentification, lease classification and initial direct costs under the new standard. The Company elected to utilize the available package of practical expedients\npermitted under the transition guidance within ASC 842 which does not require it to reassess the prior conclusions about lease identification, lease classification\nand initial direct costs.\nSublease\nIn October 2021, the Company entered into a sublease agreement for its offices in the United States.\nThe Company applies the guidelines in ASC-842 regarding subleases, which state that the classification should be based on the underlying asset being subleased\nand concluded that the sublease is an operating lease where the Company is the Lessor.\nThe sublease income is recognized on a straight-line basis over the expected lease term less any allowances for doubtful collection of rent and is included in the\noperating expenses, net, in the Company’s consolidated statements of comprehensive loss.\nF-20\nNOTE 2 - SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued):\nhh. New Accounting Pronouncements\nRecently adopted accounting pronouncements:\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments—Credit Losses (“ASC 326”): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments to\nintroduce a new model for recognizing credit losses on financial instruments based on estimated current expected credit losses, or CECL. Under the new standard,\nan entity is required to estimate CECL on trade receivables at inception, based on historical information, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable\nforecasts. The guidance is effective for the Company for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2022, including interim periods within those fiscal years.\nEarly application is permitted. The Company adopted ASC 326 on January 1, 2023, and upon adoption of the standard, there was no immediate impact to the\nCompany’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows. On an ongoing basis, the Company will contemplate forward-looking economic conditions in\nrecording lifetime expected credit losses for the Company’s financial assets measured at cost, such as the Company’s trade receivables.\nIn August 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-06 Debt- Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging- Contracts in\nEntity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40) (“ASU 2020-06”): Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity’s Own Equity. This guidance\nsimplifies the accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of liabilities and equity, including convertible instruments and contracts on an\nentity’s own equity. Furthermore, ASU 2020-06 requires the application of the if-converted method for calculating diluted earnings per share. ASU 2020-06 is\neffective for the Company for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company adopted this\nguidance on January 1, 2023, and there was no material impact on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet and the consolidated statements of operations upon\nadoption.\nRecently issued accounting pronouncements, not yet adopted:\nAs an emerging growth company, the Jumpstart Our Business Startup Act (“JOBS Act”) allows the Company to delay adoption of new or revised accounting\npronouncements applicable to public companies until such pronouncements are made applicable to private companies. The Company has elected to use this\nextended transition period under the JOBS Act. The adoption dates discussed below reflect this election.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09 Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures. The ASU improves the transparency of income tax disclosures by\nrequiring (1) consistent categories and greater disaggregation of information in the rate reconciliation and (2) income taxes paid disaggregated by jurisdiction. It\nalso includes certain other amendments to improve the effectiveness of income tax disclosures. The ASU is effective for the Company for annual periods\nbeginning after December 15, 2025. The Company is evaluating the potential impact of this guidance on its consolidated financial statements. The amendments in\nthis Update should be applied on a prospective basis. Retrospective application is permitted.\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07 “Segment Reporting: Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures.” This guidance expands public\nentities’ segment disclosures primarily by requiring disclosure of significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker\nand included within each reported measure of segment profit or loss, an amount and description of its composition for other segment items, and interim\ndisclosures of a reportable segment’s profit or loss and assets. Public entities with a single reportable segment are required to provide the new disclosures and all\nthe disclosures required under ASC 280. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years\nbeginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted.

The\ninitial conversion price for each redeemable convertible preferred share shall be the original issue price for such redeemable preferred share. The conversion price\nis subject to adjustment.\nEach redeemable convertible preferred stock will automatically convert into shares of common stock at the then-effective conversion price for each such share\nimmediately upon the earlier of: (i) the Company’s sale of its common stock in a firm commitment, underwritten public offering pursuant to a registration\nstatement under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (“Securities Act”), which results in aggregate gross proceeds to the Company of not less than $ 5,000 at a\nCompany valuation of at least $15,000; or (ii) the date specified in a written request to the Company for such conversion from either the holders (a) of at least\n75% of the series B redeemable convertible preferred stock then outstanding, or (b) from the holders of at least 75% of the series A redeemable convertible\npreferred stock then outstanding.\nF-27\nNOTE 12 - REDEEMABLE CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK (continued):\nLiquidation rights:\nUpon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company, whether voluntary or involuntary or deemed liquidation the assets of the Company available for\ndistribution to its shareholders shall be distributed in the following order of priority:\nFirst and in preference to any distribution of any available assets to the holders of any other class or series of share of the corporation, the holders of series B\nredeemable convertible preferred stock shall be entitled to receive an amount equal to $ 0.9991 per share plus interest at the rate of 8% per annum from the\noriginal issuance date of such series B redeemable convertible preferred stock.

If the assets are insufficient to permit a full payment, then all assets shall be distributed ratably among the holders of series A. If the assets exceed the\namount necessary to fulfill the payment, then the remaining assets shall be distributed ratably among the holders of common stock.\nVoting rights:\nThe holders of redeemable convertible preferred stock will vote together with, in the same manner and with the same effect as the holders of common stock on all\nmatters on which the holders of common stock shall be entitled to vote. The holders of redeemable convertible preferred Stock shall be entitled to cast such\nnumber of votes equal to the number of shares of common stock into which the redeemable convertible preferred stocks are then convertible.\nThe Company applied the provision of ASC 480-10-S99-3A and classifies the redeemable convertible preferred Stock outside of permanent equity.\nAs of December 31, 2023, and December 31, 2022, all of the Company’s Redeemable convertible preferred stock were converted to common stock.\nNOTE 13 - WARRANTS:\na) On August 24, 2016, the Company issued warrants to Comerica Bank (“Comerica”) for the purchase of 73,048 shares of the Company’s Series B Redeemable\nPreferred Stock at an exercise price of $1.02672 per share contemporaneously with obtaining a loan from Comerica which was fully repaid in 2018 (the\n“Comerica Warrants”).

As part of the contractual terms and conditions of Comerica’s Warrants, a portion of the warrants are\nexercisable, as of the IPO date, into the Company’s common stock. The Comerica Warrants are still outstanding as of December 31, 2023. The Company has\nevaluated whether the Comerica Warrants are still classified as liabilities and concluded that due to a change-of-control provision which may affect the exercise\nprice or entitle Comerica to demand cash, instead of shares, to settle the warrants, Comerica’s Warrants will continue to be classified as liabilities and will be\nexercisable into the Company’s common shares. As of December 31, 2023, and December 31, 2022, the estimated fair value of the Comerica warrants was $8, and\nit was based on a Black-Scholes option-pricing model.\nF-28\nNOTE 13 - WARRANTS (continued):\nb) During the period from February 2018 through November 2020, the Company issued warrants to Mizrahi-Tefahot Bank (“Mizrahi”) contemporaneously with\nobtaining a loan and a credit facility.

These warrants were classified as liabilities mainly due to the redemption feature over the options.\nUpon the consummation of the IPO (as further described in Note 14d below), the Company converted the outstanding warrants issued to Migdalor into the\nCompany’s common stock based on the contractual terms and conditions of the related warrant agreements.\nd) On May 8, 2023, the Company completed a fund-raising round. Upon the consummation of the Offering and pursuant to an agreement entered into with the\nHolder and the underwriter, the Company issued warrants to purchase shares of Common Stock. Such warrants were classified as liabilities based on the terms of\nthe underlying agreement.

The repurchase program may be suspended, terminated, or modified at any time for any reason, including market conditions, the\ncost of repurchasing shares, the availability of alternative investment opportunities, liquidity, and other factors deemed appropriate. These factors may also affect\nthe timing and amount of share repurchases.

CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE.\nNone.\nITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.\nEvaluation on Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nWe have conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our “disclosure controls and procedures”, as defined by Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of Exchange Act, as of\nDecember 31, 2023, the end of the period covered by this Annual Report. This evaluation, which was performed under the supervision and with the participation of\nmanagement, including our Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”), is performed to determine whether our disclosure controls and procedures\nare effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is\naccumulated and communicated to management, including our CEO and CFO, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and are effective to\nprovide reasonable assurance that such information is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the SEC’s rules and forms. There are\ninherent limitations to the effectiveness of any system of disclosure controls and procedures. Disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and effectively\noperated, can only provide reasonable assurance of achieving their control objectives.\nBased upon that evaluation, our CEO and CFO concluded our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of the period covered by this Annual Report on\nForm 10-K due to the material weakness discussed below.\nManagement’s report on internal control over financial reporting\nManagement is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the\nExchange Act. Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the\nconsolidated financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with GAAP.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, our internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect all misstatements, including the possibility of human error, the\ncircumvention or overriding of controls or fraud. Effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of\nfinancial statements. . Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may\nbecome inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate over time.\nUnder the supervision and with the participation of the CEO and the CFO, management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial\nreporting as of December 31, 2023. We performed an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework described\nin Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”). Based on this evaluation,\nour management concluded that we did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023 given the existence of the previously identified\nmaterial weakness described below having not been remediated as of year-end.\n52\nMaterial Weakness\nWe have identified one material weakness in the design and operation of our internal control over financial reporting in connection with the preparation of our financial\nstatements, as previously disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022, that had not been remediated as of December 31, 2023. A\nmaterial weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material\nmisstatement of a company’s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. The Company’s management, including our CEO and\nCFO, concluded that, as of December 31, 2023:\nWe lacked a sufficient complement of professionals with an appropriate level of accounting knowledge, training and experience to maintain appropriate segregation of\nduties in our finance and accounting functions.\nOur independent registered public accounting firm will not be required to opine on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404\nof the Sarbanes-Oxley Act until we are no longer an “emerging growth company” as defined in the JOBS Act.\nRemediation Plan and Status\nWe have taken and intend to continue to take actions to remediate the material weakness described above. To remediate this material weakness, we continue to map,\ndocument and test our internal controls (recently, with the assistance of a third-party accounting firm with specific expertise in SOX compliance), and accordingly, we\ncontinued to make progress in our internal controls plan. Among other procedures, management has executed the following remedial actions:\n● Hired new financial experts and increasing the number of financial personnel.\n● Continued to map, document and test our internal controls, with the assistance of a third-party accounting firm with specific expertise in SOX compliance.\n● Implemented new control procedures over certain areas identified as requiring enhancement in order to address the lack of a sufficient number of finance personnel to\nallow for adequate segregation of duties.\nIn addition to the actions underway, we plan to continue enhancements to our internal controls over financial reporting in 2024. Additional remedial actions include:\n● Maintain or increase the level and design of segregation of duties, including maintaining or growing the quality and number of finance personnel\n● Continue to document and test annually our internal control over financial reporting\n● Continue engagement with an outside accounting firm with specific SOX and Internal Control expertise\n● Continued hiring of additional accounting, information technology, and internal controls resources who possess public company accounting, auditing and reporting\nexpertise\nThe actions we are taking are subject to ongoing senior management review, as well as oversight of the audit committee of our Board. We also may conclude that\nadditional measures may be required to remediate the material weaknesses or determine to modify the remediation plans described above. We will not be able to fully remediate\nthis material weakness until these steps have been completed and have been operating effectively. We will continue to monitor the design and effectiveness of these and other\nprocesses, procedures, and controls and make any further changes management deems appropriate.\n53\nIn addition to the items noted above, as we continue to evaluate, remediate and improve our internal control over financial reporting, executive management may elect to\nimplement additional measures to address control deficiencies or may determine that the remediation efforts described above require modification. Executive management, in\nconsultation with and at the direction of our Audit Committee and an expert outside consultant, will continue to assess the control environment and the above-mentioned efforts\nto remediate the underlying causes of the identified material weakness.\nAlthough we plan to complete this remediation process as quickly as possible, we are unable, at this time to estimate how long it will take; and our efforts may not be\nsuccessful in remediating the deficiencies or material weaknesses.\nNotwithstanding the material weakness set forth above, based on the performance of additional procedures by management designed to ensure reliability of financial\nreporting, the Company’s management has concluded that the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, fairly present, in all material\nrespects, the Company’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows as of the dates, and for the periods presented, in conformity with GAAP.\nChanges In Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2023 that have materially affected, or are\nreasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nITEM 9B.

We face a number of risks, including economic risks,\nfinancial risks, legal and regulatory risks and others, such as the impact of competition. Management is responsible for the day-to-day management of the risks that we face,\nwhile our Board, as a whole and through its committees, has responsibility for the oversight of risk management. In its risk oversight role, our Board is responsible for\nsatisfying itself that the risk management processes designed and implemented by management are adequate and functioning as designed. Our Board assesses major risks facing\nour Company and options for their mitigation in order to promote our stockholders’ interests in the long-term health of our Company and our overall success and financial\nstrength. A fundamental part of risk management is not only understanding the risks a company faces and what steps management is taking to manage those risks, but also\nunderstanding what level of risk is appropriate for us. The involvement of our full Board of Directors in the risk oversight process allows our Board to assess management’s\nappetite for risk and also determine what constitutes an appropriate level of risk for our Company. Our Board regularly includes agenda items at its meetings relating to its risk\noversight role and meets with various members of management on a range of topics, including corporate governance and regulatory obligations, operations and significant\ntransactions, risk management, insurance, pending and threatened litigation and significant commercial disputes.\nWhile our Board is ultimately responsible for risk oversight, various committees of our Board oversee risk management in their respective areas and regularly report on\ntheir activities to our entire Board. In particular, the Audit Committee has the primary responsibility for the oversight of financial risks facing our Company. The Audit\nCommittee’s charter provides that it will discuss our major financial risk exposures and the steps we have taken to monitor and control such exposures. Our Board has also\ndelegated primary responsibility for the oversight of all executive compensation and our employee benefit programs to the Compensation Committee. The Compensation\nCommittee strives to create incentives that encourage a level of risk-taking behavior consistent with our business strategy.\nWe believe the division of risk management responsibilities described above is an effective approach for addressing the risks facing our Company and that our Board’s\nleadership structure provides appropriate checks and balances against undue risk taking.\n60\nCode of Business Conduct and Ethics\nOur Board has adopted a code of ethical conduct that applies to our principal executive officer, principal financial officer and senior financial management. This code of\nethical conduct is embodied within our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, which applies to all persons associated with our Company, including our directors, officers and\nemployees (including our principal executive officer, principal financial officer, principal accounting officer and controller). In order to satisfy our disclosure requirements\nunder Item 5.05 of Form 8-K, we will disclose amendments to, or waivers of, certain provisions of our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics relating to our chief executive\nofficer, chief financial officer, chief accounting officer, controller or persons performing similar functions on our website promptly following the adoption of any such\namendment or waiver. The Code of Business Conduct and Ethics provides that any waivers of, or changes to, the code that apply to the Company’s executive officers or\ndirectors may be made only by the Audit Committee. In addition, the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics includes updated procedures for non-executive officer employees to\nseek waivers of the code.\nNumber and Terms of Office of Officers and Directors\nOur board of directors has five members, at least three of whom will be deemed “independent” under SEC and Nasdaq rules.\nOur officers are appointed by the board of directors and serve at the discretion of the board of directors, rather than for specific terms of office. Our board of directors is\nauthorized to appoint persons to the offices set forth in our certificate of incorporation as it deems appropriate.\nEach of the directors of the Company were elected pursuant to the provisions of the Stockholders Agreement and our Certificate of Incorporation in effect prior to the\nIPO. Tuvia Barlev had a right under the Stockholders Agreement to designate one director. Dr. Niv was elected by the holders of the majority of the Series A Preferred Stock.\nJoseph Moscovitz, Naama Halevi-Davidov, and Noemi Schmayer were elected by both the majority of our outstanding common stock and the holders of the majority of the\nSeries A Preferred Stock and Series Preferred B Stock. The Stockholders Agreement was terminated in connection with our IPO and going forward, each of the directors were\nappointed by the holders of the majority of our outstanding common stock pursuant to the provisions of our Certificate of Incorporation, with (i) directors in Class I, consisting\nof Noemi Schmayer, to stand for election at the Annual Meeting to be held in 2026; (ii) directors in Class II, consisting of Joseph Moscovitz and Naama Halevi-Davidov, to\nstand for election at the annual meeting of stockholders to be held in 2024; and (iii) directors in Class III, consisting of Israel Niv and Tuvia Barlev, to stand for election at the\nannual meeting of stockholders to be held in 2025.\nOur Company is governed by our Board. Currently, each member of our Board, other than Tuvia Barlev and Joseph Moscovitz, is an independent director; and all standing\ncommittees of our Board of Directors are composed entirely of independent directors, in each case under Nasdaq’s independence definition applicable to boards of directors.\nFor a director to be considered independent, our Board of Directors must determine that the director has no relationship which, in the opinion of our Board, would interfere with\nthe exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director. Members of the Audit Committee also must satisfy a separate SEC independence\nrequirement, which provides that they may not accept directly or indirectly any consulting, advisory or other compensatory fee from us or any of our subsidiaries other than\ntheir directors’ compensation. In addition, under SEC rules, an Audit Committee member who is an affiliate of the issuer (other than through service as a director) cannot be\ndeemed to be independent. In determining the independence of members of the Compensation Committee, Nasdaq listing standards require our Board of Directors to consider\ncertain factors, including, but not limited to: (1) the source of compensation of the director, including any consulting, advisory or other compensatory fee paid by us to the\ndirector, and (2) whether the director is affiliated with us, one of our subsidiaries or an affiliate of one of our subsidiaries. Under our Compensation Committee Charter,\nmembers of the Compensation Committee also must qualify as “outside directors” for purposes of Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the\nCode, and as “non-employee directors” for purposes of Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act. The independent members of the Board of Directors are Israel Niv, Naama Halevi-\nDavidov, and Noemi Schmayer.\nCommittees of the Board of Directors\nOur board of directors has an audit committee, a compensation committee and a nominating and corporate governance committee, each with its own charter that has been\napproved by the board.

The composition of\nour compensation committee meets the requirements for independence under Nasdaq Capital Market listing standards and SEC rules and regulations. Each member of the\ncompensation committee is also a non-employee director, as defined pursuant to Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act. The purpose of our compensation committee\nis to discharge the responsibilities of our board of directors relating to compensation of our executive officers. The compensation committee operates under a written charter\nthat satisfies the applicable standards of the SEC and Nasdaq.

We face a number of risks, including economic risks,\nfinancial risks, legal and regulatory risks and others, such as the impact of competition. Management is responsible for the day-to-day management of the risks that we face,\nwhile our Board, as a whole and through its committees, has responsibility for the oversight of risk management. In its risk oversight role, our Board is responsible for\nsatisfying itself that the risk management processes designed and implemented by management are adequate and functioning as designed. Our Board assesses major risks facing\nour Company and options for their mitigation in order to promote our stockholders’ interests in the long-term health of our Company and our overall success and financial\nstrength. A fundamental part of risk management is not only understanding the risks a company faces and what steps management is taking to manage those risks, but also\nunderstanding what level of risk is appropriate for us. The involvement of our full Board of Directors in the risk oversight process allows our Board to assess management’s\nappetite for risk and also determine what constitutes an appropriate level of risk for our Company. Our Board regularly includes agenda items at its meetings relating to its risk\noversight role and meets with various members of management on a range of topics, including corporate governance and regulatory obligations, operations and significant\ntransactions, risk management, insurance, pending and threatened litigation and significant commercial disputes.\nWhile our Board is ultimately responsible for risk oversight, various committees of our Board oversee risk management in their respective areas and regularly report on\ntheir activities to our entire Board. In particular, the Audit Committee has the primary responsibility for the oversight of financial risks facing our Company. The Audit\nCommittee’s charter provides that it will discuss our major financial risk exposures and the steps we have taken to monitor and control such exposures. Our Board has also\ndelegated primary responsibility for the oversight of all executive compensation and our employee benefit programs to the Compensation Committee. The Compensation\nCommittee strives to create incentives that encourage a level of risk-taking behavior consistent with our business strategy.\nWe believe the division of risk management responsibilities described above is an effective approach for addressing the risks facing our Company and that our Board’s\nleadership structure provides appropriate checks and balances against undue risk taking.\nCode of Business Conduct and Ethics\nOur Board has adopted a code of ethical conduct that applies to our principal executive officer, principal financial officer and senior financial management. This code of\nethical conduct is embodied within our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, which applies to all persons associated with our Company, including our directors, officers and\nemployees (including our principal executive officer, principal financial officer, principal accounting officer and controller). In order to satisfy our disclosure requirements\nunder Item 5.05 of Form 8-K, we will disclose amendments to, or waivers of, certain provisions of our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics relating to our chief executive\nofficer, chief financial officer, chief accounting officer, controller or persons performing similar functions on our website promptly following the adoption of any such\namendment or waiver. The Code of Business Conduct and Ethics provides that any waivers of, or changes to, the code that apply to the Company’s executive officers or\ndirectors may be made only by the Audit Committee. In addition, the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics includes updated procedures for non-executive officer employees to\nseek waivers of the code.\n63\nITEM 11.

The Board, or a duly authorized committee of the Board, administers the Plan, or the Administrator. Under the Plan, the Administrator has the authority,\nsubject to applicable law, to interpret the terms of the Plan and any award agreements or awards granted thereunder, designate recipients of awards, determine and amend the\nterms of awards, including the exercise price of an option award, the fair market value of a share, the time and vesting schedule applicable to an award or the method of\npayment for an award, accelerate or amend the vesting schedule applicable to an award, prescribe the forms of agreement for use under the Plan and take all other actions and\nmake all other determinations necessary for the administration of the 2015 Plan.\nThe administrator also has the authority to approve the conversion, substitution, cancellation or suspension under and in accordance with the Plan of any or all awards, and\nthe authority to modify outstanding awards unless otherwise provided by the terms of the Plan.\nThe administrator may adopt special appendices and/or guidelines and provisions for persons who are residing in or employed in, or subject to, the taxes of, any domestic\nor foreign jurisdictions, to comply with applicable laws, regulations, or accounting, listing or other rules with respect to such domestic or foreign jurisdictions.\nEligibility. The Plan provides for granting awards under various tax regimes, including, without limitation, in compliance with Section 102 of the Ordinance and\nSection 3(i) of the Ordinance and for awards granted to our United States employees or service providers, including those who are deemed to be residents of the United States\nfor tax purposes, Section 422 of the Code and Section 409A of the Code.\nGrants. All awards granted pursuant to the Plan will be evidenced by an award agreement. Award agreements need not be in the same form and may differ in the terms and\nconditions included therein. The award agreement will set forth the terms and conditions of the award, including the type of award, number of shares subject to such award,\nvesting schedule and conditions, the exercise price, if applicable, the date of expiration of the award, any special terms applying to such award (if any), including the terms of\nany country-specific or other applicable appendix, as determined by our board of directors.\nAwards. The Plan provides for the grant of stock options, Nonstatutory Stock Options, Stock Appreciation Rights, Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units.\nWith respect to options granted under the Plan, unless otherwise determined by the administrator, and subject to the conditions of the Plan, options vest and become\nexercisable, if applicable, under the following schedule: 25% of the shares covered by the option on the first anniversary of the vesting commencement date determined by the\nadministrator (and in the absence of such determination, the date on which such option was granted) and 6.25% of the shares covered by the option at the end of each\nsubsequent three-month period thereafter over the course of the following three years; provided that the grantee remains continuously as an employee or provides services to\nour company and our affiliates throughout such vesting dates.\nEach option will expire ten years from the date of the grant thereof, unless such shorter term of expiration is otherwise designated by the administrator or required by\napplicable law.\nOptions under the Plan may be exercised by providing our company with a notice of exercise and full payment of the exercise price for such shares underlying the option,\nif applicable, in such form and method as may be determined by the administrator and permitted by applicable law. An option may not be exercised for a fraction of a share. If\nthe Company’s shares are listed for trading on any securities exchange, and if the administrator so determines, all or part of the exercise price and any withholding taxes may be\npaid by the delivery of an irrevocable direction to a securities broker approved by our company to sell shares and to deliver all or part of the sales proceeds to our company or\nthe trustee, or, the delivery of an irrevocable direction to pledge shares to a securities broker or lender approved by our company, as security for a loan, and to deliver all or part\nof the loan proceeds to our company, or such other method of payment acceptable to our company as determined by the administrator.\nTransferability. Other than by will, the laws of descent and distribution or as otherwise provided under the Plan, the awards and shares granted under the 2015 Plan are not\nassignable or transferable, unless determined otherwise by the Administrator in which case such Award may only be transferred as permitted by Rule 701 of the Securities\nAct of 1933.\n70\nTermination of Relationship. In the event of termination of a grantee’s employment or service with our company, all vested and exercisable options held by such grantee as\nof the date of termination may be exercised within ninety days after such date of termination, unless otherwise determined by the administrator, but in no event later than the\ndate of expiration of the option as set forth in the award agreement. After such ninety-day period, all such unexercised options will terminate, and the shares covered by such\noptions shall again be available for issuance under the Plan.\nIn the event of termination of a grantee’s employment or service with our company or any of our affiliates due to such grantee’s death or permanent disability, all vested\nand exercisable options held by such grantee as of the date of termination may be exercised by the grantee or the grantee’s legal guardian, estate or by a person who acquired\nthe right to exercise the options by bequest or inheritance, as applicable, within 12 months after such date of termination, unless otherwise provided by the administrator, but in\nno event later than the date of expiration of the option as set forth in the award agreement. Any options which are unvested as of the date of such termination or which are\nvested but not then exercised within the 12-month period following such date, will terminate and the shares covered by such options shall again be available for issuance under\nthe Plan.\nAll restricted shares still subject to restriction under the applicable restriction period as set by the administrator in the applicable award agreement, lapsed will revert to the\nCompany and again will become available for grant under the Plan.\nRights as a stockholder. Subject to terms of the Plan, a grantee shall have no rights as a stockholder of our company with respect to any shares covered by an award until\nthe grantee shall have exercised the award and paid the exercise price therefor, if applicable, and becomes the record holder of the subject shares.\nTransactions. Shares subject to an award, as well as the price per share covered by each outstanding award, shall be proportionately adjusted for any increase or decrease in\nthe number of issued shares resulting from a share split, reverse share split, combination or reclassification of the shares, or any other increase or decrease in the number of\nissued shares effected without receipt of consideration by our company, provided, however, that the Administrator will make such adjustments to an Award required by\nSection 25102(o) of the California Corporations Code to the extent the Company is relying upon the exemption afforded thereby with respect to the Award.\nIn the event of a merger or Change in Control, each outstanding Award will be treated as the Administrator determines without a Participant’s consent, including, without\nlimitation, that either (i) Awards will be assumed, or substantially equivalent Awards will be substituted, by the acquiring or succeeding corporation (or an affiliate thereof) with\nappropriate adjustments as to the number and kind of shares and prices; (ii) upon written notice to a Participant, that the Participant’s Awards will terminate upon or\nimmediately prior to the consummation of such merger or Change in Control (subject to the provisions of the paragraph above); (iii) outstanding Awards will vest and become\nexercisable, realizable, or payable, or restrictions applicable to an Award will lapse, in whole or in part prior to or upon consummation of such merger or Change in Control,\nand, to the extent the Administrator determines, terminate upon or immediately prior to the effectiveness of such merger of Change in Control; (iv) (A) the termination of an\nAward in exchange for an amount of cash and/or property, if any, equal to the amount that would have been attained upon the exercise of such Award or realization of the\nParticipant’s rights as of the date of the occurrence of the transaction (and, for the avoidance of doubt, if as of the date of the occurrence of the transaction the Administrator\ndetermines in good faith that no amount would have been attained upon the exercise of such Award or realization of the Participant’s rights, then such Award may be terminated\nby the Company without payment), or (B) the replacement of such Award with other rights or property selected by the Administrator in its sole discretion; or (v) any\ncombination of the foregoing or other alternative not listed hereinabove. In taking any of the actions permitted under this subsection, the Administrator will not be obligated to\ntreat all Awards, all Awards held by a Participant, or all Awards of the same type, similarly. In the event of liquidation or winding up of our company, the administrator will\nnotify each Participant as soon as practicable prior to the effective date of such proposed transaction. To the extent it has not been previously exercised, an Award will terminate\nimmediately prior to the consummation of such proposed action.\n71\nITEM 13.

Under the terms of the Vromen\nServices Agreement, Dr. Vromen provides services to us as an independent contractor. The services include advising us and aiding in fundraising, assisting with presentations\nand providing follow-up, negotiating deals, legal assistance. We agreed to pay the outstanding amount for unpaid services rendered by Dr. Vromen during the period between\nFebruary 15, 2015, and ending on December 31, 2019, of $197,500 plus VAT, or the Outstanding Fees. Pursuant to the Vromen Services Agreement, Dr. Vromen will also be\nentitled to additional fees in the amount of $150,000, plus VAT as follows: Dr. Vromen will receive (1) $100,000 upon the earlier to occur of (i) the closing of a financing round\nby us of at least $2.0 million and (ii) achievement of at least $3.0 million in EBITDA as reported by us, which VAT was paid to Dr. Vromen in January 2022 following the\nclosing of our private placement, and (2) $50,000 upon the earlier to occur of (i) the closing of a financing round by us of at least $4.0 million and (ii) achievement of at least\n$3.0 million in EBITDA as reported by us. In the event that we reach one of the milestones set forth above and Dr. Vromen is entitled to receive such additional fees, then we\nwill pay to Dr. Vromen all of the Outstanding Fees, together with the payment of such additional fees, provided that we may pay any and all of the Outstanding Fees in several\ninstallments over a period not to exceed twenty-four (24) months from achievement of the applicable milestone.\nRelated Party Transaction Policy\nWe adopted a formal, written policy that our executive officers, directors (including director nominees), holders of more than 5% of any class of our voting securities and any\nmember of the immediate family of or any entities affiliated with any of the foregoing persons, are not permitted to enter into a related party transaction with us without the\nprior approval or, in the case of pending or ongoing related party transactions, ratification of our audit committee. For purposes of our policy, a related party transaction is a\ntransaction, arrangement or relationship where we were, are or will be involved and in which a related party had, has or will have a direct or indirect material interest.\nCertain transactions with related parties, however, are excluded from the definition of a related party transaction including, but not limited to:\n● transactions involving the purchase or sale of products or services in the ordinary course of business, not exceeding $20,000;\n● transactions where a related party’s interest derives solely from his or her service as a director of another entity that is a party to the transaction;\n● transactions where a related party’s interest derives solely from his or her ownership of less than 10% of the equity interest in another entity that is a party to the\ntransaction; and\n● transactions where a related party’s interest derives solely from his or her ownership of a class of our equity securities and all holders of that class received the same\nbenefit on a pro rata basis.\n72\nNo member of the Audit Committee may participate in any review, consideration or approval of any related party transaction where such member or any of his or her\nimmediate family members is the related party. In approving or rejecting the proposed agreement, our Audit Committee shall consider the relevant facts and circumstances\navailable and deemed relevant by the Audit Committee, including, but not limited to:\n● the benefits and perceived benefits to us;\n● the materiality and character of the related party’s direct and indirect interest;\n● the availability of other sources for comparable products or services;\n● the terms of the transaction; and\n● the terms available to unrelated third parties under the same or similar circumstances.\nIn reviewing proposed related party transactions, the Audit Committee will only approve or ratify related party transactions that are in, or not inconsistent with, the best\ninterests of us and our stockholders.\nThe transactions described below were consummated prior to our adoption of the formal, written policy described above, and therefore the foregoing policies and procedures\nwere not followed with respect to the transactions. However, we believe that the terms obtained or consideration that we paid or received, as applicable, in connection with the\ntransactions described were comparable to terms available or the amounts that would be paid or received, as applicable, in arm’s-length transactions.\nPolicy for Approval of Related Party Transactions\nWe have adopted our Code of Ethics to avoid, wherever possible, all conflicts of interests, except under guidelines or resolutions approved by our Board (or the appropriate\ncommittee of our Board) or as disclosed in our public filings with the SEC. Under our Code of Ethics, conflict of interest situations will include any financial transaction,\narrangement or relationship (including any indebtedness or guarantee of indebtedness) involving Actelis. Our Code of Ethics is filed as an exhibit to this Annual Report.\nIn addition, the Audit Committee of our Board adopted a charter, providing for the review, approval and/or ratification of “related party transactions,” which are those\ntransactions required to be disclosed pursuant to Item 404 of Regulation S-K as promulgated by the SEC, by the Audit Committee. At its meetings, the Audit Committee shall\nbe provided with the details of each new, existing, or proposed related party transaction, including the terms of the transaction, any contractual restrictions that the company has\nalready committed to, the business purpose of the transaction, and the benefits of the transaction to the company and to the relevant related party. Any member of the committee\nwho has an interest in the related party transaction under review by the committee shall abstain from voting on the approval of the related party transaction, but may, if so\nrequested by the chairman of the committee, participate in some or all of the committee’s discussions of the related party transaction. Upon completion of its review of the\nrelated party transaction, the committee may determine to permit or to prohibit the related party transaction. Our Audit Committee will review on a quarterly basis all payments\nthat were made by us to our sponsor, officers, or directors, or our or any of their affiliates.\nThese procedures are intended to determine whether any such related party transaction impairs the independence of a director or presents a conflict of interest on the part of a\ndirector, employee or officer.\nThe Board has determined that Israel Niv, Naama Halevi-Davidov, and Noemi Schmayer are “independent” directors, as defined by the rules of the SEC and the Nasdaq rules\nand regulations.\n73\nITEM 14.

Purpose\nThis Executive Officer Clawback Policy describes the circumstances under which Covered Persons of Actelis Networks, Inc. and any of its direct or indirect subsidiaries (the\n“Company”) will be required to repay or return Erroneously-Awarded Compensation to the Company.\nThis Policy and any terms used in this Policy shall be construed in accordance with any SEC regulations promulgated to comply with Section 954 of the Dodd-Frank Wall\nStreet Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, including without limitation Rule 10D-1 promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the\nrules adopted by Nasdaq.\nEach Covered Person of the Company shall sign an Acknowledgement and Agreement to the Clawback Policy in the form attached hereto as Exhibit A as a condition to his or\nher participation in any of the Company’s incentive-based compensation programs; provided that this Policy shall apply to each Covered Person irrespective of whether such\nCovered Person shall have failed, for any reason, to have executed such Acknowledgement and Agreement.\nII. Definitions\nFor purposes of this Policy, the following capitalized terms shall have the respective meanings set forth below:\n(a) “Accounting Restatement” shall mean an accounting restatement (i) due to the material noncompliance of the Company with any financial reporting requirement under\nthe securities laws, including any required accounting restatement to correct an error in previously issued financial restatements that is material to the previously issued\nfinancial statements (a “Big R” restatement), or (ii) that corrects an error that is not material to previously issued financial statements, but would result in a material\nmisstatement if the error were corrected in the current period or left uncorrected in the current period (a “little r” restatement). Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the\nfollowing changes to the Company’s financial statements represent error corrections and shall not be deemed an Accounting Restatement: (a) retrospective application of a\nchange in accounting principle; (b) retrospective revision to reportable segment information due to a change in the structure of the Company’s internal organization; (c)\nretrospective reclassification due to a discontinued operation; (d) retrospective application of a change in reporting entity, such as from a reorganization of entities under\ncommon control; and (e) retrospective revision for share splits, reverse share splits, share dividends or other changes in capital structure.\n(b) “Board” shall mean the Board of Directors of the Company.\n(c) “Clawback-Eligible Incentive Compensation” shall mean, in connection with an Accounting Restatement, any Incentive-Based Compensation Received by a Covered\nPerson (regardless of whether such Covered Person was serving at the time that Erroneously-Awarded Compensation is required to be repaid) (i) on or after the Nasdaq\nEffective Date, (ii) after beginning service as a Covered Person, (iii) while the Company has a class of securities listed on a national securities exchange or national\nsecurities association and (iv) during the Clawback Period.\n(d) “Clawback Period” shall mean, with respect to any Accounting Restatement, the three completed fiscal years immediately preceding the Restatement Date and any\ntransition period (that results from a change in the Company’s fiscal year) of less than nine months within or immediately following those three completed fiscal years.\n(e) “Committee” shall mean the Compensation Committee of the Board.\n(f) “Covered Person” shall mean any person who is, or was at any time, during the Clawback Period, an Executive Officer of the Company. For the avoidance of doubt,\nCovered Person may include a former Executive Officer that left the Company, retired or transitioned to an employee non-Executive Officer role (including after serving as\nan Executive Officer in an interim capacity) during the Clawback Period, and this Policy applies regardless of whether the Covered Person was at fault for an accounting\nerror or other action that resulted in, or contributed to, the Accounting Restatement.\n(g) “Erroneously-Awarded Compensation” shall mean the amount of Clawback-Eligible Incentive Compensation that exceeds the amount of Incentive-Based Compensation\nthat otherwise would have been Received had it been determined based on the restated amounts. This amount must be computed without regard to any taxes paid.\n(h) “Executive Officer” shall mean the Company’s president, principal financial officer, principal accounting officer (or if there is no such accounting officer, the controller),\nany vice-president in charge of a principal business unit, division, or function (such as sales, administration, or finance), any other officer who performs a policy-making\nfunction, or any other person (including an officer of the Company’s parent(s) or subsidiaries) who performs similar policy-making functions for the Company. For the\nsake of clarity, at a minimum, all persons who would be executive officers pursuant to Rule 401(b) under Regulation S-K shall be deemed “Executive Officers”.\n(i) “Financial Reporting Measures” shall mean measures that are determined and presented in accordance with the accounting principles used in preparing the Company’s\nfinancial statements, and all other measures that are derived wholly or in part from such measures, including, without limitation, measures that are “non-GAAP financial\nmeasures” for purposes of Exchange Act Regulation G and Item 10(e) of Regulation S-K, as well other measures, metrics and ratios that are not non- GAAP measures. For\npurposes of this Policy, Financial Reporting Measures shall include stock price and total shareholder return (and any measures that are derived wholly or in part from stock\nprice or total shareholder return). A Financial Reporting Measure need not be presented within the Company’s financial statements or included in a Company filing with\nthe SEC.\n(j) “Incentive-Based Compensation” shall have the meaning set forth in Section III below.\n2\n(k) “Nasdaq” shall mean The Nasdaq Stock Market.\n(l) “Nasdaq Effective Date” shall mean October 2, 2023.\n(m)“Policy” shall mean this Executive Officer Clawback Policy, as the same may be amended and/or restated from time to time.\n(n) “Received” shall mean Incentive-Based Compensation received, or deemed to be received, in the Company’s fiscal period during which the Financial Reporting Measure\nspecified in the Incentive-Based Compensation is attained, even if the payment or grant occurs after the fiscal period.\n(o) “Repayment Agreement” shall have the meaning set forth in Section V below.\n(p) “Restatement Date” shall mean the earlier of (i) the date the Board, a committee of the Board or the officers of the Company authorized to take such action if Board action\nis not required, concludes, or reasonably should have concluded, that the Company is required to prepare an Accounting Restatement, or (ii) the date that a court, regulator\nor other legally authorized body directs the Company to prepare an Accounting Restatement.\n(q) “SARs” shall mean stock appreciation rights.\n(r) “SEC” shall mean the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.\nIII. Incentive-Based Compensation\n“Incentive-Based Compensation” shall mean any compensation that is granted, earned or vested wholly or in part upon the attainment of a Financial Reporting Measure.\nFor purposes of this Policy, specific examples of Incentive-Based Compensation include, but are not limited to:\n● Non-equity incentive plan awards that are earned based, wholly or in part, based on satisfaction of a Financial Reporting Measure performance goal;\n● Bonuses paid from a “bonus pool,” the size of which is determined, wholly or in part, based on satisfaction of a Financial Reporting Measure performance goal;\n● Other cash awards based on satisfaction of a Financial Reporting Measure performance goal;\n● Restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance share units, stock options and SARs that are granted or become vested, wholly or in part, on satisfaction of a\nFinancial Reporting Measure performance goal; and\n● Proceeds received upon the sale of shares acquired through an incentive plan that were granted or vested based, wholly or in part, on satisfaction of a Financial\nReporting Measure performance goal.\n3\nFor purposes of this Policy, Incentive-Based Compensation excludes:\n● Any base salaries (except with respect to any salary increases earned, wholly or in part, based on satisfaction of a Financial Reporting Measure performance goal);\n● Bonuses paid solely at the discretion of the Committee or Board that are not paid from a “bonus pool” that is determined by satisfying a Financial Reporting Measure\nperformance goal;\n● Bonuses paid solely upon satisfying one or more subjective standards and/or completion of a specified employment period;\n● Non-equity incentive plan awards earned solely upon satisfying one or more strategic measures or operational measures; and\n● Equity awards that vest solely based on the passage of time and/or satisfaction of one or more non-Financial Reporting Measures.\nIV. Determination and Calculation of Erroneously-Awarded Compensation\nIn the event of an Accounting Restatement, the Committee shall promptly determine the amount of any Erroneously-Awarded Compensation for each Executive Officer in\nconnection with such Accounting Restatement and shall promptly thereafter provide each Executive Officer with a written notice containing the amount of Erroneously-\nAwarded Compensation and a demand for repayment, forfeiture or return thereof, as applicable.\n(a) Cash Awards. With respect to cash awards, the Erroneously-Awarded Compensation is the difference between the amount of the cash award (whether payable as a lump\nsum or over time) that was Received and the amount that should have been Received applying the restated Financial Reporting Measure.\n(b) Cash Awards Paid From Bonus Pools. With respect to cash awards paid from bonus pools, the Erroneously-Awarded Compensation is the pro rata portion of any\ndeficiency that results from the aggregate bonus pool that is reduced based on applying the restated Financial Reporting Measure.\n(c) Equity Awards. With respect to equity awards, if the shares, options, SARs or other equity awards are still held at the time of recovery, the Erroneously-Awarded\nCompensation is the number of such securities Received in excess of the number that should have been received applying the restated Financial Reporting Measure (or the\nvalue in excess of that number). If the options, SARs or other equity awards have been exercised, vested, settled or otherwise converted into underlying shares, but the\nunderlying shares have not been sold, the Erroneously-Awarded Compensation is the number of shares underlying the excess options or SARs (or the value thereof). If the\nunderlying shares have already been sold, the Erroneously-Awarded Compensation is the higher of the value of the stock upon vesting, exercise or sale.\n(d) Compensation Based on Stock Price or Total Shareholder Return. For Incentive-Based Compensation based on (or derived from) stock price or total shareholder\nreturn, where the amount of Erroneously-Awarded Compensation is not subject to mathematical recalculation directly from the information in the applicable Accounting\nRestatement, the amount shall be determined by the Committee based on a reasonable estimate of the effect of the Accounting Restatement on the stock price or total\nshareholder return upon which the Incentive-Based Compensation was Received (in which case, the Committee shall maintain documentation of such determination of that\nreasonable estimate and provide such documentation to Nasdaq in accordance with applicable listing standards).\n4\nV. Recovery of Erroneously-Awarded Compensation\nOnce the Committee has determined the amount of Erroneously-Awarded Compensation recoverable from the applicable Covered Person, the Committee shall take all\nnecessary actions to recover the Erroneously-Awarded Compensation. Unless otherwise determined by the Committee, the Committee shall pursue the recovery of Erroneously-\nAwarded Compensation in accordance with the below:\n(a) Cash Awards. With respect to cash awards, the Committee shall either (i) require the Covered Person to repay the Erroneously-Awarded Compensation in a lump sum in\ncash (or such property as the Committee agrees to accept with a value equal to such Erroneously-Awarded Compensation) reasonably promptly following the Restatement\nDate or (ii) if approved by the Committee, offer to enter into a Repayment Agreement. If the Covered Person accepts such offer and signs the Repayment Agreement within\na reasonable time as determined by the Committee, the Company shall countersign such Repayment Agreement.\n(b) Unvested Equity Awards. With respect to those equity awards that have not yet vested, the Committee shall take all necessary action to cancel, or otherwise cause to be\nforfeited, the awards in the amount of the Erroneously-Awarded Compensation.\n(c) Vested Equity Awards. With respect to those equity awards that have vested and the underlying shares have not been sold, the Committee shall take all necessary action to\ncause the Covered Person to deliver and surrender the underlying shares in the amount of the Erroneously-Awarded Compensation.\nIn the event that the Covered Person has sold the underlying shares, the Committee shall either (i) require the Covered Person to repay the Erroneously-Awarded\nCompensation in a lump sum in cash (or such property as the Committee agrees to accept with a value equal to such Erroneously-Awarded Compensation) reasonably\npromptly following the Restatement Date or (ii) if approved by the Committee, offer to enter into a Repayment Agreement. If the Covered Person accepts such offer and\nsigns the Repayment Agreement within a reasonable time as determined by the Committee, the Company shall countersign such Repayment Agreement.\n(d) Repayment Agreement. “Repayment Agreement” shall mean an agreement (in a form reasonably acceptable to the Committee) with the Covered Person for the\nrepayment of the Erroneously-Awarded Compensation as promptly as possible without unreasonable economic hardship to the Covered Person.\n(e) Effect of Non-Repayment. To the extent that a Covered Person fails to repay all Erroneously-Awarded Compensation to the Company when due (as determined in\naccordance with this Policy), the Company shall, or shall cause one or more other members of the Company to, take all actions reasonable and appropriate to recover such\nErroneously-Awarded Compensation from the applicable Covered Person. Unless otherwise determined by the Committee in its discretion, the applicable Covered Person\nshall be required to reimburse the Company for any and all expenses reasonably incurred (including legal fees) by the Company in recovering such Erroneously-Awarded\nCompensation in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence.\nThe Committee shall have broad discretion to determine the appropriate means of recovery of Erroneously-Awarded Compensation based on all applicable facts and\ncircumstances and taking into account the time value of money and the cost to shareholders of delaying recovery. However, in no event may the Company accept an\namount that is less than the amount of Erroneously-Awarded Compensation in satisfaction of a Covered Person’s obligations hereunder.\n5\nVI. Discretionary Recovery\nNotwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Company shall not be required to take action to recover Erroneously-Awarded Compensation if any one of the following\nconditions are met and the Committee determines that recovery would be impracticable:\n(i) The direct expenses paid to a third party to assist in enforcing this Policy against a Covered Person would exceed the amount to be recovered, after the Company\nhas made a reasonable attempt to recover the applicable Erroneously-Awarded Compensation, documented such attempts and provided such documentation to\nNasdaq;\n(ii) Recovery would violate home country law where that law was adopted prior to November 28, 2022, provided that, before determining that it would be\nimpracticable to recover any amount of Erroneously-Awarded Compensation based on violation of home country law, the Company has obtained an opinion of\nhome country counsel, acceptable to Nasdaq, that recovery would result in such a violation and a copy of the opinion is provided to Nasdaq; or\n(iii) Recovery would likely cause an otherwise tax-qualified retirement plan, under which benefits are broadly available to employees of the Company, to fail to meet\nthe requirements of 26 U.S.C. 401(a)(13) or 26 U.S.C. 411(a) and regulations thereunder.\nVII. Reporting and Disclosure Requirements\nThe Company shall file all disclosures with respect to this Policy in accordance with the requirements of the federal securities laws, including the disclosure required by the\napplicable filings required to be made with the SEC.\nVIII. Effective Date\nThis Policy shall apply to any Incentive-Based Compensation Received on or after the Nasdaq Effective Date.\nIX. No Indemnification\nThe Company shall not indemnify any Covered Person against the loss of Erroneously-Awarded Compensation and shall not pay, or reimburse any Covered Persons for\npremiums, for any insurance policy to fund such Covered Person’s potential recovery obligations.\n6\nX. Administration\nThe Committee has the sole discretion to administer this Policy and ensure compliance with Nasdaq Rules and any other applicable law, regulation, rule or interpretation of the\nSEC or Nasdaq promulgated or issued in connection therewith. Actions of the Committee pursuant to this Policy shall be taken by the vote of a majority of its members. The\nCommittee shall, subject to the provisions of this Policy, make such determinations and interpretations and take such actions as it deems necessary, appropriate or advisable. All\ndeterminations and interpretations made by the Committee shall be final, binding and conclusive.\nXI. Amendment; Termination\nThe Committee may amend this Policy from time to time in its discretion and shall amend this Policy as it deems necessary, including as and when it determines that it is\nlegally required by any federal securities laws, SEC rule or the rules of any national securities exchange or national securities association on which the Company’s securities are\nthen listed. The Committee may terminate this Policy at any time. Notwithstanding anything in this Section XI to the contrary, no amendment or termination of this Policy shall\nbe effective if such amendment or termination would (after taking into account any actions taken by the Company contemporaneously with such amendment or termination)\ncause the Company to violate any federal securities laws, SEC rule, or the rules of any national securities exchange or national securities association on which the Company’s\nsecurities are then listed.\nXII. Other Recoupment Rights; No Additional Payments\nThe Committee intends that this Policy will be applied to the fullest extent of the law. The Committee may require that any employment agreement, equity award agreement or\nany other agreement entered into on or after the Adoption Date shall, as a condition to the grant of any benefit thereunder, require a Covered Person to agree to abide by the\nterms of this Policy. Any right of recoupment under this Policy is in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other rights under applicable law, regulation or rule or pursuant to any\nsimilar policy in any employment agreement, equity plan, compensation policy, equity award agreement or similar arrangement and any other legal remedies available to the\nCompany. However, this Policy shall not provide for recovery of Incentive-Based Compensation that the Company has already recovered pursuant to Section 304 of the\nSarbanes-Oxley Act or other recovery obligations.\nXIII. Successors\nThis Policy shall be binding and enforceable against all Covered Persons and their beneficiaries, heirs, executors, administrators or other legal representatives.\n7\nExhibit A\nACKNOWLEDGEMENT AND AGREEMENT\nTO THE\nEXECUTIVE OFFICER CLAWBACK POLICY\nOF\nACTELIS NETWORKS.\nBy signing below, the undersigned acknowledges and confirms that the undersigned has received and reviewed a copy of Actelis Networks, Inc.
