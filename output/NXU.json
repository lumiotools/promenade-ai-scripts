Files Registration Statement on Form S-4 for Proposed Business Combination with Verde Bioresins, Inc.\n\nNovember 12, 2024\n\n[PDF Version](/node/8501/pdf)\n\nMESA, Ariz., Nov. 12, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Nxu, Inc., (NASDAQ: NXU) (“Nxu”, “the Company”), a domestic technology company focused on energy storage and charging solutions for the infrastructure we need to power our electrified future, has filed a registration statement on Form S-4 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) relating to the previously announced proposed merger ( the “Merger”) with Verde Bioresins, Inc. (“Verde”), a leader in sustainable product innovation and full-service bioplastics production.\n\nAs previously announced on October 24, 2024, Nxu and Verde have entered into a merger agreement pursuant to which Nxu will acquire all of the issued and outstanding common shares of Verde in an all-stock transaction. Upon closing of the Merger, the combined company is expected to be renamed Verde Bioresins, Corp. and list its common stock on Nasdaq under the new ticker symbol “VRDE.”\n\nThe registration statement includes a preliminary prospectus and proxy statement in connection with the Merger. Although the registration statement has not yet become effective and the information contained therein is subject to change, it provides important information about Nxu, Verde and the Merger.\n\nUpon the closing of the Merger, it is expected that pre-Merger Verde stockholders will own approximately 95% of the combined company and pre-Merger Nxu stockholders will own approximately 5% of the combined company, in each case, on a fully-diluted and as-converted basis, and assuming Nxu’s aggregate enterprise value is approximately $16.2 million. For purposes of determining the exchange ratio in the transaction, Verde has been ascribed an aggregate enterprise value of approximately $306.9 million, and Nxu’s aggregate enterprise value will be an amount equal to approximately $16.2 million, less an amount equal to the excess of certain lease payments remaining unpaid at closing over Nxu’s cash balance at closing.\n\nThe closing of the Merger is expected to occur in the first quarter 2025, subject to approval of Nxu’s stockholders, the registration statement being declared effective, approval of the combined company’s stock for trading on Nasdaq, approval of Verde’s stockholders and the satisfaction of other customary closing conditions.\n\n“Filing the S-4 is a critical step toward completion of the Merger, marking the start of the SEC review process,” said Nxu Founder, Chairman, and CEO Mark Hanchett. “The Board believes in the potential long-term value creation from this combination, and urges shareholders to read the S-4 and proxy statement/prospectus and any amendments to such documents before making any voting or investment decision with respect to the Merger.”\n\n**About Verde** Verde is committed to pioneering sustainable solutions to the plastics problem in the form of biobased, biodegradable and recyclable PolyEarthylene resins. Verde is addressing the Growing Global Plastic Pollution Crisis: 85% of all plastics in the United States end up in a landfill, taking hundreds of years or more to decompose. Through its sustainable product innovation and proprietary technology, Verde provides comprehensive design and development solutions for companies seeking alternatives to conventional plastics. Verde targets food service, consumer goods, skincare and beauty, automotive, agricultural, and other packaging end markets with resins for blown film, thermoform, injection molding and blow molding applications.

(“Verde”), a leader in sustainable product innovation and full-service bioplastics production, have entered into a merger agreement pursuant to which Nxu will acquire all of the issued and outstanding common shares of Verde in an all-stock transaction. Upon closing of the merger, the combined company is expected to be renamed “Verde Bioresins, Corp.” and list its common stock on Nasdaq under the new ticker symbol “VRDE.” The members of the boards of directors of both companies unanimously approved, and will recommend that shareholders of each company approve, the proposed transaction.\n\nVerde pioneered PolyEarthyleneTM, an innovative and proprietary bioresin that has the potential to replace traditional petroleum-based plastics and disrupt the plastics industry. It is an economically feasible alternative that is intended to be dropped into existing plastics manufacturing processes, and Verde is one of the first scalable full-service bio-resin market solutions intended to meet most of the environmental, application, manufacturing, and cost requirements of the industry. Verde’s current polyethylene and polypropylene replacement applications are designed to address nearly half of the approximate $600 billion total addressable global plastics market.\n\n“We are thrilled to merge with Nxu, a company at the forefront of sustainable solutions in transportation,” said Brian Gordon, Co-founder and President of Verde. “In addition to selling our biobased, biodegradable and recyclable PolyEarthylene resins to global brands and large plastics converters, we look forward to developing ways to incorporate PolyEarthylene resins into Nxu’s EV charging systems with the hopes of creating an even more environmentally friendly offering.”\n\n“Nxu has remained steadfast in its pursuit of a sustainable future through clean technology, and a combination with Verde is a creative path to that future that has the potential for long-term value creation for our shareholders,” said Nxu Founder, Chairman and CEO Mark Hanchett. “Verde’s PolyEarthylene resins are making waves in the plastics market, and I’m incredibly excited about the potential for disruption.”\n\n**Proposed Transaction Details** Upon the closing of the Merger, assuming Nxu’s aggregate enterprise value is approximately $16.2 million, pre-Merger Verde stockholders will own approximately 95% of the combined company and pre-Merger Nxu stockholders will own approximately 5% of the combined company, in each case, on a fully-diluted and as-converted basis. For purposes of determining the exchange ratio in the transaction, Verde has been ascribed an aggregate enterprise value of approximately $306.9 million, and Nxu’s aggregate enterprise value will be an amount equal to approximately $16.2 million less an amount equal to the excess of certain lease payments remaining unpaid at closing over Nxu’s cash balance at closing.\n\nThe transaction is subject to certain closing conditions, including approval by Nxu and Verde shareholders. Upon closing of the Merger, the board of directors of the combined company will consist of seven members, six of whom will be appointed by Verde and one of whom will be appointed by Nxu; and the Verde management team will manage the business of the combined company.\n\nVerde’s controlling shareholder Humanitario Capital, LLC has signed a support agreement to vote all of its shares of Verde common stock in favor of the transaction. Similarly, Mark Hanchett Chairman, CEO, & Founder and Annie Pratt, President, holding an aggregate of approximately 19% of the total voting power of Nxu’s common stock, have entered into support agreements to vote all of their shares of Nxu common stock in favor of the Merger. Humanitario Capital, LLC has also entered into a Lock-Up Agreement with an initial lock-up period of 180 days, after which the transfer of any shares of Nxu common stock representing more than 5% of the aggregate shares in any calendar month is prohibited for a period of 24 months.\n\nThe proposed transaction between Verde and Nxu is the culmination of a formal process initiated by Nxu's Board of Directors to explore a range of possible strategic alternatives for optimizing Nxu's assets and generating sustained shareholder value while still managing potential risks. Since April 2024, the Strategic Planning Committee of the Nxu Board, with the assistance of its advisors and management, evaluated many former potential merger and acquisition candidates as well as new ones, including Verde. Nxu's Strategic Planning Committee made a unanimous, formal recommendation to the Nxu Board to pursue a combination with Verde and to proceed with the proposed transaction.\n\nBritt Ide, co-chair of the Strategic Planning Committee, commented, “Nxu’s Strategic Committee and senior management team have conducted thorough due diligence on Verde, and we have been tremendously impressed with their technology, management team, business, and potential for growth.” Co-chair Jessica Billingsley added, “Verde has the opportunity to be a major player in the plastics industry, and we believe that by leveraging the public markets they will be able to grow their market share quickly. The proposed merger provides Nxu shareholders with the exciting opportunity to participate in the creation of a more sustainable future via Verde’s growth.”\n\n**Advisors** Lake Street Capital Markets, LLC has provided a fairness opinion to the Nxu Board in connection with the proposed transaction. Snell & Wilmer L.L.P. is serving as legal counsel to Nxu in connection with the proposed transaction.\n\nRoth Capital Partners, LLC is serving as financial advisor to Verde. Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale and Dorr LLP is serving as legal counsel to Verde in connection with the proposed transaction.\n\n**Proxy Solicitor Information and Shareholder Questions** Nxu’s shareholders who have questions should contact _[info@nxuenergy.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=s5xNQMMPjdx0yUXZXgXdUTyiGgqsES5G9QD2gQhTEG69rfOOuEnI8LmZKSgxwQqcJzbPX96puxeuJwzBAZMDPS4Sr0AfPM9PGx3F3OIixz0=)_\n\nIt is anticipated that the Nxu special shareholder meeting will take place in the first quarter of 2025.
