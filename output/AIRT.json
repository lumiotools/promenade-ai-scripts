Reports Second Quarter Fiscal 2025 Results\n\nby [Media Team](https://airt.net/author/media-team/ \"Posts by Media Team\") | Nov 12, 2024 | [Press Release](https://airt.net/category/press-release/)\n\n#### Air T, Inc. Reports Second Quarter Fiscal 2025 Results\n\n**CHARLOTTE, NC, November 12, 2024** — Air T, Inc. (NASDAQ: AIRT) is an industrious American company with a portfolio of businesses, each of which is independent yet interrelated. We seek dynamic individuals and teams to operate companies with processes and insights that drive increasing value over time. We believe we can invest corporate resources to help activate growth and overcome challenges.\n\nOur core segments are overnight air cargo; ground equipment sales; commercial jet engines and parts; and corporate and other. The Company also invests in non-consolidated investments, notably in Crestone Asset Management, LLC and its joint venture, Crestone JV II LLC.\n\n**Today the Company is announcing results for the fiscal second quarter ended September 30, 2024:**\n\n  * Revenues totaled $81.2 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, an increase of $2.3 million, or 3% from the prior year’s comparable quarter.\n  * Operating income was $3.9 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, an increase of $3.1 million from the prior year comparable quarter’s operating income of $0.8 million.\n  * Adjusted EBITDA* profit of $5.0 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to an Adjusted EBITDA* profit of $1.6 million in the prior year’s comparable quarter.\n  * Net Income attributable to Air T stockholders for its equity method investees was $2.3 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024; compared to Net Income attributable to Air T stockholders for its equity method investees of $0.7 million from the prior year’s comparable quarter.\n  * The investment balance for the Company’s equity method investees was $17.6 million at September 30, 2024; as compared to $14.2 million at September 30, 2023.\n  * Earnings per share of $0.91 for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to the loss per share of $0.57 for the prior year’s comparable quarter.\n\n\n\n*Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure; see below for further explanation and reconciliation to GAAP measure.\n\n**Company Chairman and CEO Nick Swenson commented:**\n\n“Results for the quarter were driven by strong margins in our aviation parts trading business. We are heartened by the outstanding leadership provided by the management of these businesses, particularly since the COVID times were incredibly difficult. They are great people who have a wise and intuitive feel for the business. Challenges for the quarter included a combination of issues that lowered industry-wide sales of de-icing equipment, namely a second warmer winter and, we believe, the psychological impacts of election uncertainty and political violence coincident with the selling season. GGS’s great team is primed with new products and services; and we expect them to rebound with the market, but that may not occur until next year.”\n\n“Our financial disclosures this quarter include additional information about our equity method investments and related distributions & dividends. Additionally, we are highlighting relevant information related to our equity method investment in Crestone Asset Management.”\n\n**Business Segment Results**\n\n**Overnight Air Cargo**\n\n  * This segment provides air express delivery services, primarily for FedEx, and repair services.\n  * Revenues for this segment increased 11% to $31.2 million in the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to $28.2 million in the prior year’s comparable quarter. The increase was principally attributable to higher administrative fees due to an increased fleet of 105 aircraft in the current year’s quarter compared to 85 aircraft in the prior year’s comparable quarter and additional routes granted by FedEx.\n  * Adjusted EBITDA* for this segment was $2.0 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of $0.2 million when compared to the prior year’s comparable quarter.\n\n\n\n**Ground Equipment Sales (“GGS”)**\n\n  * This segment—which includes some of the world-leading brands in the category—manufactures mobile deicers and other specialized ground-support equipment. Customers include passenger and cargo airlines, airports, the military, and other industrial customers.\n  * Revenues for this segment totaled $14.5 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, up 18% when compared to revenue of $12.2 million in the previous year’s second fiscal quarter. The increase was primarily driven by the higher number of deicing trucks sold in the current year quarter compared to prior year’s comparable quarter.\n  * Adjusted EBITDA* profit for this segment was $0.5 million in the quarter ended September 30, 2024, an increase of $0.5 million compared to the prior year’s quarter, due primarily to the revenue increase noted above.\n  * As of September 30, 2024, this segment’s order backlog was $9.1 million versus $7.0 million as of September 30, 2023.\n\n\n\n**Commercial Jet Engines and Parts**\n\n  * This segment leases commercial jet engines and aircraft; buys, sells and trades in surplus and aftermarket commercial jet engines, engine parts, airframes, and airframe parts, avionics, and other; then delivers the related documents and logistics.\n  * Revenues for this segment totaled $32.9 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of $3.6 million versus the previous year’s fiscal second quarter. The decrease was primarily driven by four whole engine sales at Contrail in the prior year’s quarter compared to none in the current year’s quarter. This was partially offset by the increase in component part sales in the current year’s quarter compared to the prior year’s quarter. We believe Contrail’s increased component part sales is driven by airlines’ focusing on maintaining existing fleets of 737NG and A320CEO aircraft, because new orders from the OEMs have been cancelled or delayed. The company is in a position to satisfy customer demand through available inventory and expertise in serviceable aftermarket material.\n  * Adjusted EBITDA* profit for this segment was $4.1 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, an increase of $2.8 million when compared to the prior year’s comparable quarter. The increase is primarily attributable to higher profit margins on Contrail’s component part sales compared to the prior year’s comparable quarter.\n\n\n\n**Corporate and Other**\n\n  * This segment reflects the Company’s activities as a capital allocator and resource for its consolidated businesses. Moreover, Corporate and Other segment also comprises activity related to its smaller businesses and business interests.\n  * Revenues for this segment totaled $2.7 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, an increase of $0.6 million versus the previous year’s fiscal second quarter. The increase was primarily attributable to increased software subscriptions at Shanwick.\n  * This segment’s Adjusted EBITDA* for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, represented a loss of $1.6 million in the quarter, a decrease of $0.3 million when compared to the prior year’s comparable quarter. The increase is primarily to increased software subscriptions.\n\n\n\n**Crestone Asset Management**\n\nWe launched Crestone Asset Management, LLC (“CAM”) and its joint venture, Crestone JV II LLC (“CJVII”), in May 2021, in order to develop products and services for the aircraft asset management industry. This strategic initiative leverages our expertise in asset origination and aircraft management to capitalize on the demand for commercial aircraft and jet engines.\n\nCrestone JV II is designed as a series LLC, allowing for targeted investments across multiple individual series. Its activities focus on current-generation narrow-body aircraft and engines. Through this structure we seek to enhance our investment flexibility and help optimize risk management across diverse asset classes.\n\n_Dual Functionality of CAM:_\n\n  1. Asset Management Function: CAM directs the sourcing, acquisition, and management of aircraft assets owned by CJVII. This is governed by a comprehensive Management Agreement, ensuring that our operations are efficient and aligned with best practices in asset management.\n  2. Investment Function: CAM invests alongside our institutional partners in CJVII, in order to demonstrate our commitment, and participate in what we believe will likely be attractive returns on investment.\n\n\n\n_Financial Highlights:_\n\nCAM’s assets under management totaled $5.9 million, $116.7 million, $215.1 million, and $410.4 million as of December 31, 2021*, December 31, 2022*, December 31, 2023*, and September 30, 2024, respectively.\n\nThe table below presents net income (loss) attributable to Air T, Inc. stockholders and cash distributions to the Company (in thousands):\n\n![](https://airt.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/1st-table-2.png)\n\n**Non-GAAP Financial Measures**\n\nThe Company uses adjusted earnings before taxes, interest, and depreciation and amortization (“Adjusted EBITDA”), a non-GAAP financial measure as defined by the SEC, to evaluate the Company’s financial performance. This performance measure is not defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and should be considered in addition to, and not in lieu of, GAAP financial measures.\n\n4Management believes that Adjusted EBITDA is a useful measure of the Company’s performance because it provides investors additional information about the Company’s operations allowing better evaluation of underlying business performance and better period-to-period comparability. Adjusted EBITDA is not intended to replace or be an alternative to operating income, the most directly comparable amounts reported under GAAP.\n\nThe table below provides a reconciliation of operating income to Adjusted EBITDA for the periods ended September 30, 2024, and 2023 (in thousands):\n\n![](https://airt.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2nd-table.png)\n\n**NOTE REGARDING STAKEHOLDER QUESTIONS**\n\nIf you have questions related to this release or other Air T matters, please use our interactive Q&A capability, through [Slido.com](https://airt.net/investors/ask-mgmt-question/)[,](https://airt.net/investors/ask-mgmt-question/) accessible from our website, to submit your questions.
