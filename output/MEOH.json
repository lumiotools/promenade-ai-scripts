Our average realized price in the third quarter was $356 per tonne compared to $352 per tonne in the second\nquarter of 2024.\n• Announced the signing of a definitive agreement to acquire OCI Global's international methanol business for\napproximately $2.05 billion, including OCI’s interest in two world class methanol facilities in Beaumont, Texas. The\ntransaction is expected to close in the first half of 2025.\n• Geismar 3 (\"G3\") produced first methanol in July 2024 and has since passed its commercial and technical performance\ntests. During the third quarter, as the plant was being brought to full rates, two separate shutdowns were taken to\ncalibrate the newly commissioned equipment to ensure reliability of plant operations at sustained full rates, which led to\nlower operating rates in the third quarter. G3 has been operating at full rates since early October, and in the last thirty\ndays has produced approximately 154,000 tonnes and is running as designed at a 1.8 MMT per annum rate.\n• In Chile, we agreed to extend the gas contracts with Chilean gas producer, ENAP, and Argentinean gas producer, YPF,\nuntil 2030 and 2027, respectively, on similar economic terms as the previous agreements. These two gas contracts\nunderpin approximately 55% of the site's gas requirements. In addition, we have secured agreements to purchase gas\nfrom Argentina on a firm basis for the non-winter months (October-April) which will allow us to produce at full rates\nthrough to the end of April 2025.\n• In New Zealand, operations were temporarily idled in August as we entered short-term commercial arrangements to\nprovide available natural gas into the New Zealand electricity market until the end of October 2024 as the country’s\noverall energy balances were very strained. Based on the medium-term gas outlook from our gas suppliers the decision\nwas made to restart one plant and indefinitely idle the other Motunui plant. As a result, a non-cash, non-recurring asset\nimpairment expense of $90 million (net of tax) has been recorded in the third quarter. The site has optimized its\noperating and capital costs and we expect that these actions will substantially offset the adjusted EBITDA and free cash\nflow impact from idling one plant.\n• Returned $12.5 million to shareholders through regular dividends and ended the third quarter with $511 million in cash.\nVANCOUVER, BRITISH COLUMBIA - For the third quarter of 2024, Methanex (TSX:MX) (NASDAQ:MEOH) reported net income\nattributable to Methanex shareholders of $31 million ($0.35 net income per common share on a diluted basis) compared to net\nincome of $35 million ($0.52 net income per common share on a diluted basis) in the second quarter of 2024. Net income in the\nthird quarter of 2024 was similar compared to the prior quarter. Adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter of 2024 was $216 million\nand Adjusted net income was $82 million ($1.21 Adjusted net income per common share). This compares with Adjusted EBITDA\nof $164 million and Adjusted net income of $42 million ($0.62 Adjusted net income per common share) for the second quarter of\n2024.\nMETHANEX CORPORATION 2024 THIRD QUARTER NEWS RELEASE PAGE 1\nOur average realized price in the third quarter was $356 per tonne compared to $352 per tonne in the second quarter of 2024.\nThe increase in our average realized price was driven by stable global demand, with tight market conditions in the Atlantic from\nsupply outages and decreasing inventories and balanced market conditions in China and Asia Pacific.\nIn the third quarter, we returned $12.5 million to shareholders through the regular dividend. We ended the quarter with $511\nmillion in cash, or $490 million in cash excluding non-controlling interests and including our share of cash in the Atlas joint\nventure.\nRich Sumner, President & CEO of Methanex, said, \"I am pleased that G3 has passed its commercial and technical performance\ntest and has been operating at full rates since early October. Looking forward to the fourth quarter we expect to see an increase in\nour production levels with G3 at full rates and Chile receiving full gas supply along with higher pricing as the methanol markets\nhave further tightened. We are focused on delivering strong cash flows from our existing business to de-lever and post close, our\npriority will be to seamlessly integrate OCI's methanol business.\"\nFURTHER INFORMATION\nThe information set forth in this news release summarizes Methanex's key financial and operational data for the third quarter of\n2024.

Net income in the third quarter of 2024 was similar compared to the prior\nquarter as a non-recurring asset impairment charge was offset by the recognition in the quarter of gas sale net proceeds in New\nZealand and the non-recurring impact of the Egypt insurance recovery. Also, lower sales of Methanex-produced methanol was\noffset by a higher average realized price and the impact of the mark-to-market changes in fair-value of assets and share-based\ncompensation.\n▪ We sold 2,623,000 tonnes in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 2,612,000 tonnes in the second quarter of 2024. Sales of\nMethanex-produced methanol were 1,378,000 tonnes in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 1,580,000 tonnes in the second\nquarter of 2024.\n▪ Production for the third quarter of 2024 was 1,347,000 tonnes compared to 1,422,000 tonnes for the second quarter of 2024.\nProduction was lower in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the second quarter of 2024 mainly due to lower production in\nNew Zealand, Chile and Egypt which was partially offset by higher production in Geismar.\n▪ Geismar 3 (\"G3\") produced first methanol in July 2024 and has since passed its commercial and technical performance tests.\nDuring the third quarter, as the plant was being brought to full rates, two separate shutdowns were taken to calibrate the newly\ncommissioned equipment to ensure reliability of plant operations at sustained full rates, which led to lower operating rates in\nthe third quarter. G3 has been operating at full rates since early October, and in the last thirty days has produced approximately\n154,000 tonnes and is running as designed at a 1.8 MMT per annum rate.\n▪ In the third quarter of 2024 we paid a quarterly dividend of $0.185 per common share for a total of $12.5 million.\nMETHANEX CORPORATION 2024 THIRD QUARTER NEWS RELEASE PAGE 4\n▪ At September 30, 2024, we had a strong liquidity position including a cash balance of $511 million, or $490 million excluding\nnon-controlling interests and including our share of cash in the Atlas joint venture. In addition, the majority of the New Zealand\ngas sales ($45 million) and the Egypt insurance recovery ($30 million) will be received in cash in the fourth quarter of 2024. As\nat the end of the third quarter, we also have undrawn revolving credit facilities of $500 million, which we subsequently\nextended to $600 million, to provide additional financial flexibility. The extension is subject to the closing of the OCI\nacquisition.\nPRODUCTION HIGHLIGHTS\nQ3 2024 Q2 2024 Q3 2023 YTD Q3 2024 YTD Q3 2023\n(thousands of tonnes) Operating Capacity 1 Production Production Production Production Production\nUSA (Geismar) 1,000 605 514 574 1,690 1,555\nTrinidad (Methanex interest) 2 490 262 231 287 751 791\nNew Zealand 3 430 72 178 226 527 1,037\nChile 425 173 229 168 793 590\nEgypt (50% interest) 158 93 129 160 305 484\nCanada (Medicine Hat) 150 142 141 130 424 406\n2,653 1,347 1,422 1,545 4,490 4,863\n1 The operating capacity of our production facilities may be higher or lower than original nameplate capacity as, over time, these figures have been adjusted to reflect\nongoing operating efficiencies at these facilities. Actual production for a facility in any given year may be higher or lower than operating capacity due to a number\nof factors, including natural gas availability, feedstock composition, the age of the facility's catalyst, turnarounds and access to CO from external suppliers for\n2\ncertain facilities. We review and update the operating capacity of our production facilities on a regular basis based on historical performance.\n2 The operating capacity of Trinidad is made up of the Titan (100% interest) and Atlas (63.1% interest) facilities. The Atlas facility is currently idle. Refer to the\nTrinidad section below.\n3 The operating capacity of New Zealand is made up of the two Motunui facilities, one of which is idle. Refer to the New Zealand section below.\nKey production and operational highlights during the third quarter include:\nUnited States\nGeismar produced 605,000 tonnes in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 514,000 tonnes in the second quarter of 2024.\nProduction was higher in the third quarter with the start up of the Geismar 3 plant. The plant produced first methanol at the end of\nJuly and successfully passed its commercial and technical performance test in early October. During Q3, as the plant was being\nbrought to full rates, two separate shutdowns were taken to calibrate the newly commissioned equipment to ensure reliability of\nplant operations at sustained full rates, which led to lower operating rates in the third quarter. G3 has been operating at full rates\nsince early October, and in the last thirty days has produced approximately 154,0000 tonnes and is running as designed at a 1.8\nMMT per annum rate.\nTrinidad\nTrinidad produced 262,000 tonnes (Methanex interest) in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 231,000 tonnes in the second\nquarter of 2024. Production was higher in the third quarter compared to the second quarter due to two unplanned outages during\nthe second quarter. In mid-September the Atlas plant (Methanex interest 63.1% or 1,085,000 tonnes per year capacity) was idled,\nas its legacy 20-year natural gas supply agreement expired, and the Titan plant (875,000 tonnes per year capacity) was\nsuccessfully re-started, on a two-year natural gas supply agreement with the National Gas Company of Trinidad and Tobago\n(NGC).\nNew Zealand\nNew Zealand produced 72,000 tonnes in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 178,000 tonnes in the second quarter of 2024.\nProduction in the third quarter was lower compared to the second quarter as operations were temporarily idled in August as we\nentered short-term commercial arrangements to provide contracted natural gas into the New Zealand electricity market until the\nend of October 2024 as the country’s overall energy balances were very strained. Based on the medium-term gas outlook from\nour gas suppliers for the next few years, the decision was made in September to indefinitely idle one of the two Motunui plants.\nMETHANEX CORPORATION 2024 THIRD QUARTER NEWS RELEASE PAGE 5\nThe site has optimized its operating and capital costs and we expect that these actions will substantially offset the adjusted\nEBITDA and free cash flow impact from idling one plant. Future production will be dependent on gas availability and any on-\nselling of gas into the electricity market to support New Zealand’s energy needs. We are in continuing discussions with our gas\nsuppliers to ensure our contractual entitlements, which are in place until 2029, are being respected as well as engaging with our\ngas suppliers and government agencies in supporting efforts to improve energy balances in the country. Based on production year\nto date and expectations for the fourth quarter, we expect 2024 production will be approximately 600,000 tonnes.\nAs a result of the outlook for gas supply and the idling of one of the Motunui plants, a non-cash before-tax asset impairment\ncharge of $125 million ($90 million after-tax) was recorded to write down the carrying value of our New Zealand assets.\nChile\nChile produced 173,000 tonnes in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 229,000 tonnes in the second quarter of 2024.\nProduction was lower in the third quarter compared to the second quarter primarily due to lower seasonal gas supply from\nArgentina during the third quarter. Planned maintenance at Chile 1 and a turnaround at Chile 4 were successfully completed\nwhich we expect will improve efficiency and production. Based on production year to date and progress we have made securing\ngas from Argentina for the non-winter period this year, we expect 2024 production will be slightly above the high-end of our\nguidance of 1.1-1.2 million tonnes.\nIn Q3, we successfully agreed to extend the gas contracts with Chilean gas producer, ENAP, and Argentinean gas producer, YPF,\nuntil 2030 and 2027, respectively on similar economic terms as the previous agreements. These two gas contracts underpin\napproximately 55% of the sites gas requirements. In addition, we have secured agreements to purchase gas from Argentina on a\nfirm basis for the non-winter months (October-April) which will allow us to produce at full rates through to the end of April 2025.\nThese gas contracts are expected to allow us to continue to incrementally increase our production from Chile as natural gas\ndevelopment and related infrastructure investments in Argentina continue to progress which we believe will allow increased gas\navailability to our two plants in the coming years.\nEgypt\nEgypt produced 186,000 tonnes (Methanex interest - 93,000 tonnes) in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 258,000 tonnes\n(Methanex interest - 129,000 tonnes) in the second quarter of 2024. Production decreased compared to the second quarter due to\nfluctuating operating rates based on gas availability. In Egypt, industrial plants were impacted by gas curtailments due to increased\nseasonal demand for power generation due to elevated temperatures coupled with lower domestic supply. The plant is currently\noperating at full rates. There has been stabilization of gas balances in the country as temperatures have moderated but some\ncontinued limitations on supply to industrial plants are expected going forward, particularly during the summer months.\nCanada\nMedicine Hat produced 142,000 tonnes in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 141,000 tonnes in the second quarter of 2024.\nOutlook\nOur expected production guidance for Q4 2024 is approximately 1.9 million tonnes (Methanex interest) which will be sold\nthrough in the fourth quarter of 2024 and the first quarter of 2025 as produced sales normalize to the increased production.\nActual production may vary by quarter based on gas availability in Chile and New Zealand, turnarounds, other gas availability,\nunplanned outages and unanticipated events.\nIn the fourth quarter, we expect similar Adjusted EBITDA compared to the third quarter, with higher produced sales and a higher\naverage realized price offset by lower New Zealand gas sales and no contribution from Egypt insurance recovery in the fourth\nquarter. Based on our October and November posted prices we expect that our average realized price range will be between\napproximately $365 to $375 per tonne for these two months.\nMETHANEX CORPORATION 2024 THIRD QUARTER NEWS RELEASE PAGE 6\nCONFERENCE CALL\nA conference call is scheduled for November 7, 2024 at 11:00 am ET (8:00 am PT) to review these third quarter results.

These items are\nnon-GAAP measures and ratios that do not have any standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and therefore are unlikely to be comparable to similar measures\npresented by other companies. Refer to Additional Information - Non-GAAP Measures on page 15 of the MD&A for reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP\nmeasures.\n▪ We recorded net income attributable to Methanex shareholders of $31 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared to net\nincome of $35 million in the second quarter of 2024. Net income in the third quarter of 2024 was similar compared to the prior\nquarter as a non-recurring asset impairment charge was offset by the recognition in the quarter of gas sale net proceeds in New\nZealand and the non-recurring impact of the Egypt insurance recovery. Also, lower sales of Methanex-produced methanol was\noffset by a higher average realized price and the impact of the mark-to-market changes in fair-value of assets and share-based\ncompensation.\n▪ We sold 2,623,000 tonnes in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 2,612,000 tonnes in the second quarter of 2024. Sales of\nMethanex-produced methanol were 1,378,000 tonnes in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 1,580,000 tonnes in the second\nquarter of 2024. Refer to the Supply/Demand Fundamentals section on page 12 of the MD&A for more information.\n▪ Production for the third quarter of 2024 was 1,347,000 tonnes compared to 1,422,000 tonnes for the second quarter of 2024.\nProduction was lower in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the second quarter of 2024 mainly due to lower production in\nNew Zealand, Chile and Egypt which was partially offset by higher production in Geismar. Refer to the Production Summary\nsection on page 4 of the MD&A.\n▪ Geismar 3 (\"G3\") produced first methanol in July 2024 and has since passed its commercial and technical performance tests.\nDuring the third quarter, as the plant was being brought to full rates, two separate shutdowns were taken to calibrate the newly\ncommissioned equipment to ensure reliability of plant operations at sustained full rates, which led to lower operating rates in the\nthird quarter. G3 has been operating at full rates since early October, and in the last thirty days has produced approximately\n154,000 tonnes and is running as designed at a 1.8 MMT per annum rate.\n▪ In the third quarter of 2024 we paid a quarterly dividend of $0.185 per common share for a total of $12.5 million.\n▪ At September 30, 2024, we had a strong liquidity position including a cash balance of $511 million, or $490 million excluding\nnon-controlling interests and including our share of cash in the Atlas joint venture. In addition, the majority of the New Zealand\ngas sales ($45 million) and the Egypt insurance recovery ($30 million) will be received in cash in the fourth quarter of 2024. As at\nthe end of the third quarter, we also have undrawn revolving credit facilities of $500 million, which we subsequently extended to\n$600 million, to provide additional financial flexibility. The extension is subject to the closing of the OCI acquisition.\nMETHANEX CORPORATION 2024 THIRD QUARTER\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS PAGE 3\nPRODUCTION HIGHLIGHTS\nQ3 2024 Q2 2024 Q3 2023 YTD Q3 2024 YTD Q3 2023\n(thousands of tonnes) Operating Capacity 1 Production Production Production Production Production\nUSA (Geismar) 1,000 605 514 574 1,690 1,555\nTrinidad (Methanex interest) 2 490 262 231 287 751 791\nNew Zealand 3 430 72 178 226 527 1,037\nChile 425 173 229 168 793 590\nEgypt (50% interest) 158 93 129 160 305 484\nCanada (Medicine Hat) 150 142 141 130 424 406\n2,653 1,347 1,422 1,545 4,490 4,863\n1 The operating capacity of our production facilities may be higher or lower than original nameplate capacity as, over time, these figures have been adjusted to reflect\nongoing operating efficiencies at these facilities. Actual production for a facility in any given year may be higher or lower than operating capacity due to a number of\nfactors, including natural gas availability, feedstock composition, the age of the facility's catalyst, turnarounds and access to CO from external suppliers for certain\n2\nfacilities. We review and update the operating capacity of our production facilities on a regular basis based on historical performance.\n2 The operating capacity of Trinidad is made up of the Titan (100% interest) and Atlas (63.1% interest) facilities. The Atlas facility is currently idle. Refer to the Trinidad\nsection below.\n3 The operating capacity of New Zealand is made up of the two Motunui facilities, one of which is idle. Refer to the New Zealand section below.\nKey production and operational highlights during the third quarter include:\nUnited States\nGeismar produced 605,000 tonnes in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 514,000 tonnes in the second quarter of 2024.\nProduction was higher in the third quarter with the start up of the Geismar 3 plant. The plant produced first methanol at the end of\nJuly and successfully passed its commercial and technical performance test in early October. During Q3, as the plant was being\nbrought to full rates, two separate shutdowns were taken to calibrate the newly commissioned equipment to ensure reliability of\nplant operations at sustained full rates, which led to lower operating rates in the third quarter. G3 has been operating at full rates\nsince early October, and in the last thirty days has produced approximately 154,0000 tonnes and is running as designed at a 1.8\nMMT per annum rate.\nTrinidad\nTrinidad produced 262,000 tonnes (Methanex interest) in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 231,000 tonnes in the second\nquarter of 2024. Production was higher in the third quarter compared to the second quarter due to two unplanned outages during\nthe second quarter. In mid-September the Atlas plant (Methanex interest 63.1% or 1,085,000 tonnes per year capacity) was idled, as\nits legacy 20-year natural gas supply agreement expired, and the Titan plant (875,000 tonnes per year capacity) was successfully re-\nstarted, on a two-year natural gas supply agreement with the National Gas Company of Trinidad and Tobago (NGC).\nNew Zealand\nNew Zealand produced 72,000 tonnes in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 178,000 tonnes in the second quarter of 2024.\nProduction in the third quarter was lower compared to the second quarter as operations were temporarily idled in August as we\nentered short-term commercial arrangements to provide contracted natural gas into the New Zealand electricity market until the end\nof October 2024 as the country’s overall energy balances were very strained. Based on the medium-term gas outlook from our gas\nsuppliers for the next few years, the decision was made in September to indefinitely idle one of the two Motunui plants. The site has\noptimized its operating and capital costs and we expect that these actions will substantially offset the adjusted EBITDA and free cash\nflow impact from idling one plant. Future production will be dependent on gas availability and any on-selling of gas into the\nelectricity market to support New Zealand’s energy needs. We are in continuing discussions with our gas suppliers to ensure our\ncontractual entitlements, which are in place until 2029, are being respected as well as engaging with our gas suppliers and\ngovernment agencies in supporting efforts to improve energy balances in the country. Based on production year to date and\nexpectations for the fourth quarter, we expect 2024 production will be approximately 600,000 tonnes.\nMETHANEX CORPORATION 2024 THIRD QUARTER\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS PAGE 4\nAs a result of the outlook for gas supply and the idling of one of the Motunui plants, a non-cash before-tax asset impairment charge\nof $125 million ($90 million after-tax) was recorded to write down the carrying value of our New Zealand assets.\nChile\nChile produced 173,000 tonnes in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 229,000 tonnes in the second quarter of 2024. Production\nwas lower in the third quarter compared to the second quarter primarily due to lower seasonal gas supply from Argentina during the\nthird quarter. Planned maintenance at Chile 1 and a turnaround at Chile 4 were successfully completed which we expect will\nimprove efficiency and production. Based on production year to date and progress we have made securing gas from Argentina for\nthe non-winter period this year, we expect 2024 production will be slightly above the high-end of our guidance of 1.1-1.2 million\ntonnes.\nIn Q3, we successfully agreed to extend the gas contracts with Chilean gas producer, ENAP, and Argentinean gas producer, YPF,\nuntil 2030 and 2027, respectively on similar economic terms as the previous agreements. These two gas contracts underpin\napproximately 55% of the sites gas requirements. In addition, we have secured agreements to purchase gas from Argentina on a firm\nbasis for the non-winter months (October-April) which will allow us to produce at full rates through to the end of April 2025. These\ngas contracts are expected to allow us to continue to incrementally increase our production from Chile as natural gas development\nand related infrastructure investments in Argentina continue to progress which we believe will allow increased gas availability to our\ntwo plants in the coming years.\nEgypt\nEgypt produced 186,000 tonnes (Methanex interest - 93,000 tonnes) in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 258,000 tonnes\n(Methanex interest - 129,000 tonnes) in the second quarter of 2024. Production decreased compared to the second quarter due to\nfluctuating operating rates based on gas availability. In Egypt, industrial plants were impacted by gas curtailments due to increased\nseasonal demand for power generation due to elevated temperatures coupled with lower domestic supply. The plant is currently\noperating at full rates. There has been stabilization of gas balances in the country as temperatures have moderated but some\ncontinued limitations on supply to industrial plants are expected going forward, particularly during the summer months.\nCanada\nMedicine Hat produced 142,000 tonnes in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 141,000 tonnes in the second quarter of 2024.\nOutlook\nOur expected production guidance for Q4 2024 is approximately 1.9 million tonnes (Methanex interest) which will be sold through\nin the fourth quarter of 2024 and the first quarter of 2025 as produced sales normalize to the increased production. Actual\nproduction may vary by quarter based on gas availability in Chile and New Zealand, turnarounds, other gas availability, unplanned\noutages and unanticipated events.\nIn the fourth quarter, we expect similar Adjusted EBITDA compared to the third quarter, with higher produced sales and a higher\naverage realized price offset by lower New Zealand gas sales and no contribution from Egypt insurance recovery in the fourth\nquarter. Based on our October and November posted prices we expect that our average realized price range will be between\napproximately $365 to $375 per tonne for these two months.\nFINANCIAL RESULTS\nFor the third quarter of 2024, we reported net income attributable to Methanex shareholders of $31 million ($0.35 net income per\ncommon share on a diluted basis) compared to net income attributable to Methanex shareholders for the second quarter of 2024 of\n$35 million ($0.52 net income per common share on a diluted basis) and net income attributable to Methanex shareholders for the\nthird quarter of 2023 of $24 million ($0.36 net income per common share on a diluted basis). Net income in the third quarter of\n2024 was similar compared to the prior quarter as a non-recurring asset impairment charge was offset by the recognition in the\nquarter of gas sale net proceeds in New Zealand and the non-recurring impact of the Egypt insurance recovery. Also, lower sales of\nMethanex-produced methanol was offset by a higher average realized price and the impact of the mark-to-market changes in fair-\nvalue of assets and share-based compensation. Net income was higher compared to the third quarter of 2023 primarily due to a\nMETHANEX CORPORATION 2024 THIRD QUARTER\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS PAGE 5\nhigher average realized price, the New Zealand gas sale net proceeds, the New Zealand gas contract revaluation and the impact of\nthe mark-to-market portion of share-based compensation due to changes in Methanex's share price, partially offset by the non-\nrecurring asset impairment charge in New Zealand and lower sales of Methanex-produced methanol in the third quarter of 2024.\nFor the third quarter of 2024, we recorded Adjusted EBITDA of $216 million and Adjusted net income of $82 million ($1.21\nAdjusted net income per common share). This compares with Adjusted EBITDA of $164 million and Adjusted net income of $42\nmillion ($0.62 Adjusted net income per common share) for the second quarter of 2024 and Adjusted EBITDA of $105 million and\nAdjusted net income of $1 million ($0.02 Adjusted net income per common share) for the third quarter of 2023.\nWe calculate Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted net income by including amounts related to our equity share of the Atlas facility\n(63.1% interest) and by excluding the non-controlling interests' share, the mark-to-market impact of share-based compensation as a\nresult of changes in our share price, the impact of the Egypt and New Zealand gas contract revaluations included in finance income\nand other and the impact of certain items associated with specific identified events. Refer to Additional Information - Non-GAAP\nMeasures on page 15 for a further discussion on how we calculate these measures. Our analysis of depreciation and amortization,\nfinance costs, finance income and other and income taxes is consistent with the presentation of our consolidated statements of\nincome and excludes amounts related to Atlas.\nWe review our financial results by analyzing changes in Adjusted EBITDA, mark-to-market impact of share-based compensation,\ndepreciation and amortization, gas contract settlement, finance costs, finance income and other and income taxes.

We review the results of operations by\nanalyzing changes in the components of Adjusted EBITDA. For a discussion of the definitions used in our Adjusted EBITDA analysis,\nrefer to How We Analyze Our Business on page 19. Changes in these components - average realized price, sales volume and total\ncash costs - similarly impact net income attributable to Methanex shareholders. The changes in Adjusted EBITDA resulted from\nchanges in the following:\nQ3 2024 Q3 2024 YTD Q3 2024\ncompared with compared with compared with\n($ millions) Q2 2024 Q3 2023 YTD Q3 2023\nAverage realized price $ 9 $ 127 $ 93\nSales volume 2 (1) (14)\nGeismar 3 delay costs 10 3 (25)\nNew Zealand gas sale proceeds, net of gas and fixed costs during idle period 63 63 63\nTotal cash costs (32) (81) (51)\nIncrease in Adjusted EBITDA $ 52 $ 111 $ 66\nAverage realized price\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSep 30 Jun 30 Sep 30 Sep 30 Sep 30\n($ per tonne) 2024 2024 2023 2024 2023\nMethanex average non-discounted posted price 519 499 395 496 439\nMethanex average realized price 356 352 303 350 337\nMethanex’s average realized price for the third quarter of 2024 was $356 per tonne compared to $352 per tonne in the second\nquarter of 2024 and $303 per tonne in the third quarter of 2023, resulting in an increase of $9 million and an increase of $127\nmillion in Adjusted EBITDA, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our average realized price was $350 per\ntonne compared to $337 per tonne for the same period in 2023, increasing Adjusted EBITDA by $93 million. The increase in our\naverage realized price was driven by stable global demand, with tight market conditions in the Atlantic from supply outages and\ndecreasing inventories and balanced market conditions in China and Asia Pacific. Refer to the Supply/Demand Fundamentals\nsection on page 12 of the MD&A for more information.\nSales volume\nMethanol sales volume excluding commission sales volume in the third quarter of 2024 was 19,000 tonnes higher than the second\nquarter of 2024 and 13,000 tonnes lower than the third quarter of 2023. The increase in sales volume in the third quarter of 2024\ncompared to the second quarter of 2024 increased Adjusted EBITDA by $2 million. The decrease in sales volume for the third\nquarter of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 decreased Adjusted EBITDA by $1 million. For the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023, methanol sales volume excluding commission sales volume was\n181,000 tonnes lower, decreasing Adjusted EBITDA by $14 million. Sales volume may vary quarter to quarter depending on\ncustomer requirements and inventory levels as well as the available commission sales volume.\nGeismar 3 delay costs\nThe operating costs related to the delay in start-up of our Geismar 3 project include organizational build-up, take-or-pay obligations\non utilities contracts as well as additional recognition of gas hedges. The total delay costs incurred in the third quarter of 2024\nleading up to first methanol production in late July were $10 million lower compared to the second quarter of 2024 and $3 million\nlower compared to the third quarter of 2023 as detailed below. The total delay costs for the nine months ended September 30, 2024\ncompared to the same period in 2023 were $25 million higher.\nMETHANEX CORPORATION 2024 THIRD QUARTER\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS PAGE 7\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSep 30 Jun 30 Sep 30 Sep 30 Sep 30\n($ millions) 2024 2024 2023 2024 2023\nOrganizational build-up and take-or-pay obligations\narising from delay 3 13 6 25 16\nOver-hedged gas costs — — — 16 —\nTotal 3 13 6 41 16\nOver-hedged gas costs\nDue to the delayed start-up of the Geismar 3 plant, a portion of our existing natural gas hedges exceeded the expected Geismar site\nproduction requirements which resulted in an over-hedged gas cost associated with the delay of $16 million which was recorded in\nthe first quarter of 2024 and which covered the entire period of the anticipated delay. As a result, no further over-hedged gas costs\nwere recorded in the second or third quarter of 2024. For additional information, refer to Note 9 of the condensed consolidated\ninterim financial statements.\nNew Zealand gas sale proceeds, net of gas and fixed costs\nIn the third quarter of 2024 we entered short-term commercial arrangements to provide available natural gas into the New Zealand\nelectricity market until the end of October 2024 as the country’s overall energy balances were very strained. Adjusted EBITDA for\nthe third quarter of 2024 includes $63 million, net proceeds less fixed costs, for which there is no equivalent transaction in the\ncomparative periods. This does not include the impact of lost margin on the sale of methanol that was not produced in the period\nand additional supply chain costs incurred. For additional information, refer to Note 10 of the condensed consolidated interim\nfinancial statements.\nTotal cash costs\nThe primary drivers of changes in our total cash costs are changes in the cost of Methanex-produced methanol and changes in the\ncost of methanol we purchase from others (\"purchased methanol\"). We supplement our production with methanol produced by\nothers through methanol offtake contracts and purchases on the spot market to meet customer needs and to support our marketing\nefforts within the major global markets.\nWe apply the first-in, first-out method of accounting for inventories and it generally takes between 30 and 60 days to sell the\nmethanol we produce or purchase. Accordingly, the changes in Adjusted EBITDA as a result of changes in Methanex-produced and\npurchased methanol costs primarily depend on changes in methanol pricing and the timing of inventory flows.\nIn a rising price environment, our margins at a given price are higher than in a stable price environment as a result of timing of\nmethanol purchases and production versus sales. Generally, the opposite applies when methanol prices are decreasing.\nThe changes in Adjusted EBITDA due to changes in total cash costs were due to the following:\nQ3 2024 Q3 2024 YTD Q3 2024\ncompared with compared with compared with\n($ millions) Q2 2024 Q3 2023 YTD Q3 2023\nMethanex-produced methanol costs $ (12) $ (23) $ 17\nProportion of Methanex-produced methanol sales (24) (7) 3\nPurchased methanol costs 1 (46) (31)\nLogistics costs (9) (9) (31)\nEgypt insurance recovery 30 30 30\nOther, net (18) (26) (39)\nDecrease in Adjusted EBITDA due to changes in total cash costs $ (32) $ (81) $ (51)\nMETHANEX CORPORATION 2024 THIRD QUARTER\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS PAGE 8\nMethanex-produced methanol costs\nNatural gas is the primary feedstock at our methanol facilities and is the most significant component of Methanex-produced\nmethanol costs. We purchase natural gas for more than half of our production under agreements where the unique terms of each\ncontract include a base price and a variable price component linked to methanol price to reduce our commodity price risk\nexposure. The variable price component is adjusted by a formula linked to methanol sales prices above a certain level. We also\npurchase natural gas in North America and are exposed to natural gas spot price fluctuations for the unhedged portion of our gas\nneeds in the region.\nFor the third quarter of 2024 compared to the second quarter of 2024, higher Methanex-produced methanol costs decreased\nAdjusted EBITDA by $12 million. For the third quarter of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023, higher Methanex-produced\nmethanol costs decreased Adjusted EBITDA by $23 million. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared with the\nsame period in 2023, lower Methanex-produced methanol costs increased Adjusted EBITDA by $17 million. Changes in Methanex-\nproduced methanol costs for all periods presented are primarily due to the impact of changes in realized methanol prices on the\nvariable portion of our natural gas cost, changes in spot gas prices which impact the unhedged portion of our North American\noperations, timing of inventory flows and changes in the mix of production sold from inventory.\nProportion of Methanex-produced methanol sales\nThe cost of purchased methanol is linked to the selling price for methanol at the time of purchase and the cost of purchased\nmethanol is generally higher than the cost of Methanex-produced methanol. Accordingly, an increase (decrease) in the proportion of\nMethanex-produced methanol sales results in a decrease (increase) in our overall cost structure for a given period. For the third\nquarter of 2024 compared to the second quarter of 2024 and the third quarter of 2023, a lower proportion of Methanex-produced\nmethanol sales decreased Adjusted EBITDA by $24 million and $7 million, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30,\n2024 compared with the same period in 2023, a higher proportion of Methanex-produced methanol sales increased Adjusted\nEBITDA by $3 million.\nPurchased methanol costs\nChanges in purchased methanol costs for all periods presented are primarily a result of changes in methanol pricing and the timing\nof purchases sold from inventory, as well as the volume and regional mix of sourcing for purchased methanol. For the third quarter\nof 2024 compared to the second quarter of 2024, the impact of lower purchased methanol costs increased Adjusted EBITDA by $1\nmillion. For the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023, the impact of higher purchased methanol costs\ndecreased Adjusted EBITDA by $46 million. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared with the same period in\n2023, higher purchased methanol costs decreased Adjusted EBITDA by $31 million.\nLogistics costs\nLogistics costs include the cost of transportation, storage and handling of product, and can vary from period to period primarily\ndepending on the levels of production from each of our production facilities, the resulting impact on our supply chain, and\nvariability in bunker fuel costs. Logistics costs for the third quarter of 2024, compared with the second quarter of 2024, decreased\nAdjusted EBITDA by $9 million and for the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023, decreased Adjusted EBITDA\nby $9 million, primarily due to lower volume and lower contribution from backhaul ocean freight journeys earned from third\nparties. Logistics costs for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were $31 million higher compared to the same period in\n2023. Changes in logistics costs are impacted by the mix of production from various plants and the impact on ocean freight of\nlonger supply routes. Higher logistics costs for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023\nwere due to the mix of production from various plants, unplanned outages, and the impact on ocean freight of longer supply routes.\nEgypt insurance recovery\nWe experienced an outage at the Egypt plant from October 2023 to February 2024. The insurance recovery of $30 million\n(Methanex share) was recognized in the third quarter of 2024 which partially offsets repair costs charged to earnings and lost\nmargins incurred in the fourth quarter of 2023 and first quarter of 2024. For additional information, refer to Note 11 of the\ncondensed consolidated interim financial statements.\nOther, net\nOther, net relates to unabsorbed fixed costs, selling, general and administrative expenses and other operational items. Other costs\ndecreased Adjusted EBITDA by $18 million during the third quarter of 2024 compared to the second quarter of 2024 and decreased\nMETHANEX CORPORATION 2024 THIRD QUARTER\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS PAGE 9\nAdjusted EBITDA by $26 million compared to the third quarter of 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared\nwith the same period in 2023, other costs decreased Adjusted EBITDA by $39 million. The increase in other costs is primarily driven\nby transaction costs to acquire OCI Global's methanol business and by the decrease in production in the quarter, which caused\nhigher unabsorbed costs to be recorded in the third quarter of 2024. Additionally, the decision to indefinitely idle one of the plants\nin New Zealand led to restructuring costs of $4 million in the third quarter of 2024, for which there is no equivalent transaction in\nthe comparative periods.\nMark-to-Market Impact of Share-based Compensation\nWe grant share-based awards as an element of compensation. Share-based awards granted include stock options, share appreciation\nrights, tandem share appreciation rights, deferred share units, restricted share units and performance share units. For all share-based\nawards, share-based compensation is recognized over the related vesting period for the proportion of the service that has been\nrendered at each reporting date. Share-based compensation includes an amount related to the grant-date value and a mark-to-\nmarket impact as a result of subsequent changes in the fair value of the share-based awards primarily driven by the Company’s share\nprice. The grant-date value amount is included in Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted net income. The mark-to-market impact of share-\nbased compensation as a result of changes in our share price is excluded from Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted net income and\nanalyzed separately.\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSep 30 Jun 30 Sep 30 Sep 30 Sep 30\n($ millions except share price) 2024 2024 2023 2024 2023\nMethanex Corporation share price 1 $ 41.34 $ 48.26 $ 45.05 $ 41.34 $ 45.05\nGrant-date fair value expense included in Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted net\nincome 4 7 4 17 15\nMark-to-market impact 2 (18) 8 8 (20) 13\nTotal share-based compensation expense (recovery), before tax $ (14) $ 15 $ 12 $ (3) $ 28\n1 US dollar share price of Methanex Corporation as quoted on the NASDAQ Global Market on the last trading day of the respective period.\n2 For all periods presented, the mark-to-market impact on share-based compensation is primarily due to changes in the Methanex Corporation share price.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation and amortization was $99 million for the third quarter of 2024 compared to $101 million for the second quarter of\n2024 and $98 million for the third quarter of 2023. Compared to the second quarter of 2024, depreciation and amortization in the\nthird quarter of 2024 was lower due to lower produced product sales in the quarter. Depreciation and amortization for the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2024 was $295 million compared to $292 million in the same period in 2023.\nFinance Costs\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSep 30 Jun 30 Sep 30 Sep 30 Sep 30\n($ millions) 2024 2024 2023 2024 2023\nFinance costs before capitalized interest $ 44 $ 44 $ 41 $ 132 $ 127\nLess capitalized interest (16) (16) (15) (49) (40)\nFinance costs $ 28 $ 28 $ 26 $ 83 $ 87\nFinance costs are primarily comprised of interest on borrowings and lease obligations.\nFinance costs were comparable for all periods presented.

Refer to Note 9 and Note 10 of the third quarter 2024 condensed consolidated interim financial statements for\nmore information.\nIncome Taxes\nA summary of our income taxes for the third quarter of 2024 compared to the second quarter of 2024 and the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 is as follows:\nThree Months Ended September 30, 2024 Three Months Ended June 30, 2024\nPer consolidated Per consolidated\n($ millions except where noted) statement of income Adjusted 1, 2 statement of income Adjusted 1, 2\nNet income before income tax $ 76 $ 116 $ 69 $ 55\nIncome tax expense (11) (34) (5) (13)\nNet income after income tax $ 65 $ 82 $ 64 $ 42\nEffective tax rate 14 % 29 % 7 % 24 %\nNine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023\nPer consolidated Per consolidated\n($ millions except where noted) statement of income Adjusted 1, 2 statement of income Adjusted 1, 2\nNet income before income tax $ 216 $ 226 $ 241 $ 156\nIncome tax expense (21) (58) (16) (38)\nNet income after income tax $ 195 $ 168 $ 225 $ 118\nEffective tax rate 10 % 26 % 7 % 24 %\n1 Adjusted effective tax rate is a non-GAAP ratio and is calculated as adjusted income tax expense or recovery, divided by adjusted net income before tax.\n2 Adjusted net income before income tax and Adjusted income tax expense are non-GAAP measures. Adjusted effective tax rate is a non-GAAP ratio. These do not have\nany standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and therefore are unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. Management uses\nthese to assess the effective tax rate. These measures and ratios are useful as they are a better measure of our underlying tax rate across the jurisdictions in which we\noperate.\nWe earn the majority of our income in the United States, New Zealand, Trinidad, Chile, Egypt and Canada. Including applicable\nwithholding taxes, the statutory tax rate applicable to Methanex in the United States is 22%, New Zealand is 28%, Trinidad is 38%,\nChile is 35%, Egypt is 30% and Canada is 24.5%. We accrue for withholding taxes that will be incurred upon distributions from our\nsubsidiaries when it is probable that the earnings will be repatriated. As the Atlas entity is accounted for using the equity method,\nany income taxes related to Atlas are included in earnings of associate and therefore excluded from total income taxes but included\nin the calculation of Adjusted net income.\nThe effective tax rate based on Adjusted net income was 29% for the third quarter of 2024 and 24% for the second quarter of 2024.\nAdjusted net income represents the amount that is attributable to Methanex shareholders and excludes the mark-to-market impact of\nshare-based compensation and the impact of certain items associated with specific identified events.

Overall demand for\ntraditional chemical applications was relatively flat with seasonally higher demand into energy applications and slightly lower\ndemand from methanol-to-olefins (MTO) in China. MTO demand was lower during the first half of the quarter due to seasonal\nmaintenance, methanol supply shortages and resulting challenged economics. Operating rates increased in the second half of the\nquarter with improved methanol supply availability and economics.\nOver the long term, we believe that traditional chemical demand for methanol is influenced by the strength of global and regional\neconomies and industrial production levels. We believe that demand for energy-related applications will be influenced by energy\nprices, pricing of end products, and government policies that are playing an increasing role in encouraging new applications for\nmethanol due to its emissions benefits as a fuel. The demand outlook for methanol as a marine fuel continues to grow. Based on\ncurrent dual-fueled vessels operating coupled with the order book for new builds and retrofits, we expect there will be over 300\nships capable of running on methanol on the water in the next five years. Actual methanol consumption from marine applications\nwill depend on regulations, relative economics versus other fuels, and other factors. The future operating rates and methanol\nconsumption from MTO producers will depend on a number of factors including the pricing for their various final products, the\nMETHANEX CORPORATION 2024 THIRD QUARTER\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS PAGE 12\ndegree of downstream integration of these units with other products, the impact of olefin industry feedstock costs, including\nnaphtha, on relative competitiveness and plant maintenance schedules.\nSupply\nThroughout the third quarter, supply in the Atlantic basin gradually tightened with feedstock constraints and plant outages which led\nto a drawdown of inventories and improving prices in the Atlantic. In Asia Pacific and China, the market remained balanced which\nled to stable pricing through the quarter.\nWe expect limited capacity additions in the next five years. In North America, our new 1.8 million tonne Geismar 3 facility\nsuccessfully produced first methanol in late July and is now operating at full rates. With the shutdown of Atlas and the restart of\nTitan in September 2024 the overall production in Trinidad is lower by approximately 1 million tonnes annually. In Malaysia, a 1.8\nmillion tonne plant announced it will be starting in 2024. In Iran, projects under development are showing slow progress due to\ntechnical and financing challenges from sanctions and the operating rates of existing methanol plants are constrained by gas\navailability due to depleting gas fields. China has planned capacity additions which we expect will be somewhat offset by the\nclosure of some inefficient older plants. New capacity built in China is expected to be consumed domestically as China requires\nmethanol imports to meet growing demand.\nMethanol Price\nOur average realized price in the third quarter of 2024 was $356 per tonne compared to $352 per tonne in the second quarter of\n2024.\nFuture methanol prices will depend on the strength of the global economy, industry operating rates, global energy prices, new\nsupply additions and the strength of global demand.\nThe following table outlines our recent regional non-discounted Methanex Non-Discounted Regional Posted Prices 1\nposted prices. Methanol is a global commodity and future\nNov Oct Sep Aug Jul\nmethanol prices are directly impacted by changes in methanol (US$ per tonne) 2024 2024 2024 2024 2024\nsupply and demand.

At September 30, 2024, our cash balance was $511 million, or $490 million excluding non-controlling interest portion of\n$43 million but including our share of cash held by the Atlas joint venture of $22 million. In addition, the majority of the New\nZealand gas sales ($45 million) and the Egypt insurance recovery ($30 million) will be received in cash in the fourth quarter of 2024.\nWe invest our cash only in highly rated instruments that have maturities of three months or less to ensure preservation of capital and\nappropriate liquidity. We continuously evaluate the liquidity requirements needed to achieve our strategic objectives, including our\ncapital expenditures.\nThe Company has access to a $500 million committed revolving credit facility, which is with a syndicate of highly rated financial\ninstitutions. In late October, to support the acquisition of OCI Global’s international methanol business (“OCI Acquisition”), the\nCompany renewed the $500 million revolving credit facility and increased it to $600 million, and a term loan commitment of $650\nmillion was added. Both are subject to the closing of the OCI Acquisition. As a result of the successful syndication of the $650\nmillion term loan commitment, the commitment under a 364-day bridge facility that was syndicated in early October was reduced\nto $525 million.\nMETHANEX CORPORATION 2024 THIRD QUARTER\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS PAGE 13\nWe have a $300 million bond due in December 2024 which we plan to repay rather than re-finance. The OCI Acquisition financing\nhas been structured to allow the flexible repayment of the term loan commitment to support our capital allocation priority to de-\nlever.\nA summary of our sources and uses of cash for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same\nperiods in 2023, is as follows:\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSep 30 Sep 30 Sep 30 Sep 30\n($ millions) 2024 2023 Variance 2024 2023 Variance\nCash provided by operating activities $ 210 $ 106 $ 104 $ 456 $ 465 $ (9)\nCash used in financing activities (86) (73) (13) (300) (386) 86\nCash used in investing activities (39) (151) 112 (103) (408) 305\nIncrease (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ 85 $ (118) $ 203 $ 53 $ (329) $ 382\nCash flows from operating activities in the third quarter of 2024 were $210 million compared to $106 million for the third quarter of\n2023. Cash flows from operating activities were higher in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023 primarily\ndue to higher earnings, partially offset by changes in working capital that were primarily driven by the proceeds recognized from the\nNew Zealand gas sale and the Egypt insurance recovery.\nCash flows used in financing activities in the third quarter of 2024 were $86 million compared to $73 million for the third quarter of\n2023.\nIn the third quarter of 2024 we paid a quarterly dividend of $0.185 per common share for a total of $12.5 million.\nCash used in investing activities relates to capital spend on maintenance and major projects and a repayment of long-term loan\nreceivable from Atlas. For more information on our capital projects, please see Capital Projects and Growth Opportunities below.\nCapital Projects and Growth Opportunities\nThe Geismar 3 (\"G3\") plant successfully produced first methanol in late July with the capital totaling slightly less than $1.30 billion,\nexcluding fixed costs related to the delay.\nOur planned operational capital expenditure directed towards maintenance, turnarounds, and catalyst changes, including our\n63.1% share of Atlas and 50% of Egypt, is currently estimated to be approximately $100 million for 2024.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nThe Company reviews the carrying value of long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate\nthat the carrying amount may not be recoverable. The Company decided to restructure its New Zealand operations to a single plant\noperation in September 2024 due to a forecasted decline in New Zealand’s gas profile. The restructuring and shift to a one plant\noperation has been identified as an impairment indicator for the New Zealand cash generating unit (\"New Zealand CGU\") and the\ncarrying value of the New Zealand CGU was tested for impairment at September 30, 2024.\nThe recoverable amount of the New Zealand CGU was based on fair value less costs of disposal, estimated using discounted cash\nflows. The model contains significant unobservable inputs and as a result is classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.\nImpairment was measured by comparing the carrying value of the New Zealand CGU to estimated fair value, discounted at a rate of\n9%.\nThere are two key variables that impact the Company’s estimates of future cash flows: (1) the methanol price and (2) the volume of\nnatural gas. Methanol price estimates are based on supply and demand fundamentals and consideration is given to many factors,\nincluding, but not limited to, estimates of global industrial production rates, energy prices, changes in general economic conditions,\nfuture global methanol production capacity, industry operating rates and the global industry cost structure. The Company’s estimate\nof the volume of natural gas takes into consideration the current contracted terms, as well as factors that it believes are relevant to\nMETHANEX CORPORATION 2024 THIRD QUARTER\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS PAGE 14\nsupply under these contracts and supplemental natural gas sources. Other assumptions included in the Company’s estimate of future\ncash flows include the estimated cost incurred to maintain the facilities, estimates of transportation costs and other variable costs\nincurred in producing methanol in each period. The values assigned to the key assumptions represent management's assessment of\nfuture trends and have been based on historical data from both external and internal sources.\nBased on the test performed, the Company recorded a non-cash before-tax asset impairment charge of $125 million ($90 million\nafter-tax) in property, plant and equipment to write down the carrying value of the New Zealand CGU at September 30, 2024.\nThe following table presents the Level 3 inputs and the sensitivities of the fair value less costs of disposal model to changes in these\ninputs:\nSensitivities\nResulting change in\nValuation input Input value or range Change in input valuation\nMethanol price forecast $317 - $365 per MT +/- $25 per MT $+24/-27 million\nAnnual estimates based\nVolume of natural gas on third party forecasts +/-10% $+19/-21 million\nDiscount rate (after-tax) 9% +/- 1% $+/-2 million\nThe sensitivity has been prepared considering each variable independently. It is possible that the assumptions used in establishing\nfair value amounts will differ from future outcomes and the impact of such variations could be material.\nCONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nDuring the third quarter of 2024, no changes were made in our internal controls over financial reporting that have materially\naffected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nADDITIONAL INFORMATION – NON-GAAP MEASURES\nIn addition to providing measures prepared in accordance with IFRS, we present certain additional non-GAAP measures and ratios\nthroughout this document. These are Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted net income, Adjusted net income per common share, Adjusted net\nincome before income tax, Adjusted income tax expense, and Adjusted effective tax rate. These non-GAAP financial measures and\nratios reflect our 63.1% economic interest in the Atlas Facility, our 50% economic interest in the Egypt Facility and our 60%\neconomic interest in Waterfront Shipping, and are useful as they are a better measure of our underlying performance, and assist in\nassessing the operating performance of the Company's business. These measures, at our share of our facilities, are a better measure\nof our underlying performance, as we fully run the operations on our partners' behalf, despite having less than full share of the\neconomic interest. Adjusted EBITDA is also frequently used by securities analysts and investors when comparing our results with\nthose of other companies. These measures do not have any standardized meaning prescribed by generally accepted accounting\nprinciples (\"GAAP\") and therefore are unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. These\nsupplemental non-GAAP measures and ratios are provided to assist readers in determining our ability to generate cash from\noperations and improve the comparability of our results from one period to another.\nThese measures should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, net income and revenue reported in accordance\nwith IFRS.\nMETHANEX CORPORATION 2024 THIRD QUARTER\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS PAGE 15\nAdjusted EBITDA\nAdjusted EBITDA differs from the most comparable GAAP measure, net income attributable to Methanex shareholders, because it\nexcludes the mark-to-market impact of share-based compensation, depreciation and amortization, gas contract settlement, finance\ncosts, finance income and other, income taxes and asset impairment charge. Adjusted EBITDA includes an amount representing our\n63.1% share of the Atlas facility and excludes the non-controlling shareholders' interests in entities which we control but do not\nfully own.\nAdjusted EBITDA and Adjusted net income exclude the mark-to-market impact of share-based compensation related to the impact of\nchanges in our share price on SARs, TSARs, deferred share units, restricted share units and performance share units. The mark-to-\nmarket impact related to share-based compensation that is excluded from Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted net income is calculated\nas the difference between the grant-date value and the fair value recorded at each period-end. As share-based awards will be settled\nin future periods, the ultimate value of the units is unknown at the date of grant and therefore the grant-date value recognized in\nAdjusted EBITDA and Adjusted net income may differ from the total settlement cost.\nThe following table shows a reconciliation from net income attributable to Methanex shareholders to Adjusted EBITDA:\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSep 30 Jun 30 Sep 30 Sep 30 Sep 30\n($ millions) 2024 2024 2023 2024 2023\nNet income attributable to Methanex shareholders $ 31 $ 35 $ 24 $ 119 $ 141\nMark-to-market impact of share-based compensation (18) 8 8 (20) 13\nGas contract settlement, net of tax — — (31) — (31)\nDepreciation and amortization 99 101 98 295 292\nFinance costs 28 28 26 83 87\nFinance income and other (42) (3) (2) (49) (29)\nIncome tax expense (recovery) 11 5 (18) 21 16\nAsset impairment charge 125 — — 125 —\nEarnings of associate adjustment 1 14 16 23 41 51\nNon-controlling interests adjustment 2 (32) (26) (23) (75) (66)\nAdjusted EBITDA $ 216 $ 164 $ 105 $ 540 $ 474\n1 This adjustment represents the add-back of depreciation and amortization, finance costs, finance income and other and income taxes associated with our 63.1%\ninterest in the Atlas methanol facility which are included in net income attributable to Methanex shareholders but excluded from Adjusted EBITDA.\n2 This adjustment represents the deduction of the portion of depreciation and amortization, finance costs, finance income and other and income taxes associated with\nour non-controlling interests' share which has been added back above but is excluded from Adjusted EBITDA.\nMETHANEX CORPORATION 2024 THIRD QUARTER\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS PAGE 16\nAdjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Income per Common Share\nAdjusted net income and Adjusted net income per common share are a non-GAAP measure and a non-GAAP ratio, respectively,\nbecause they exclude the mark-to-market impact of share-based compensation, the impact of the Egypt and New Zealand gas\ncontract revaluations included in finance income and other and the impact of certain items associated with specific identified\nevents.

We review our financial results by\nanalyzing changes in the components of Adjusted EBITDA, mark-to-market impact of share-based compensation, depreciation and\namortization, finance costs, finance income and other and income taxes.\nThe Company has used the terms Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted net income and Adjusted net income per common share throughout\nthis document. These items are non-GAAP measures that do not have any standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and therefore\nare unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. Refer to the Additional Information - Non-GAAP\nMeasures section on page 15 for a description of each non-GAAP measure and reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP\nmeasures.\nIn addition to the methanol that we produce at our facilities, we also purchase and re-sell methanol produced by others and we sell\nmethanol on a commission basis. We analyze the results of all methanol sales together, excluding commission sales volume. The\nkey drivers of changes in Adjusted EBITDA are average realized price, cash costs and sales volume, which are defined and\ncalculated as follows:\nPRICE The change in Adjusted EBITDA as a result of changes in average realized price is calculated as the difference from\nperiod to period in the selling price of methanol multiplied by the current period total methanol sales volume,\nexcluding commission sales volume.\nCASH The change in Adjusted EBITDA as a result of changes in cash costs is calculated as the difference from period to\nCOSTS\nperiod in cash costs per tonne multiplied by the current period total methanol sales volume, excluding commission\nsales volume in the current period. The cash costs per tonne is the weighted average of the cash cost per tonne of\nMethanex-produced methanol and the cash cost per tonne of purchased methanol. The cash cost per tonne of\nMethanex-produced methanol includes absorbed fixed cash costs per tonne and variable cash costs per tonne. The\ncash cost per tonne of purchased methanol consists principally of the cost of methanol itself. In addition, the change\nin Adjusted EBITDA as a result of changes in cash costs includes the changes from period to period in unabsorbed\nfixed production costs, consolidated selling, general and administrative expenses and fixed storage and handling costs.\nSALES The change in Adjusted EBITDA as a result of changes in sales volume is calculated as the difference from period to\nVOLUME\nperiod in total methanol sales volume, excluding commission sales volume, multiplied by the margin per tonne for the\nprior period. The margin per tonne for the prior period is the weighted average margin per tonne of Methanex-\nproduced methanol and margin per tonne of purchased methanol. The margin per tonne for Methanex-produced\nmethanol is calculated as the selling price per tonne of methanol less absorbed fixed cash costs per tonne and variable\ncash costs per tonne. The margin per tonne for purchased methanol is calculated as the selling price per tonne of\nmethanol less the cost of purchased methanol per tonne.\nWe own 63.1% of the Atlas methanol facility and market the remaining 36.9% of its production through a commission offtake\nagreement. A contractual agreement between us and our partners establishes joint control over Atlas. As a result, we account for this\ninvestment using the equity method of accounting, which results in 63.1% of the net assets and net earnings of Atlas being presented\nseparately in the consolidated statements of financial position and consolidated statements of income, respectively. For purposes of\nanalyzing our business, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted net income and Adjusted net income per common share include an amount\nrepresenting our 63.1% equity share in Atlas. Our analysis of depreciation and amortization, finance costs, finance income and\nother and income taxes is consistent with the presentation of our consolidated statements of income and excludes amounts related\nto Atlas.\nWe own 50% of the 1.26 million tonne per year Egypt methanol facility and market the remaining 50% of its production through a\ncommission offtake agreement. We own 60% of Waterfront Shipping, which provides service to Methanex for the ocean freight\ncomponent of our distribution and logistics costs. We consolidate both Egypt and Waterfront Shipping, which results in 100% of the\nfinancial results being included in our financial statements. Non-controlling interests are included in the Company’s consolidated\nfinancial statements and represent the non-controlling shareholders’ interests in the Egypt methanol facility and Waterfront Shipping.\nFor purposes of analyzing our business, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted net income and Adjusted net income per common share\nexclude the amounts associated with non-controlling interests.\nMETHANEX CORPORATION 2024 THIRD QUARTER\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS PAGE 19\nFORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION WARNING\nThis Third Quarter 2024 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (\"MD&A\") as well as comments made during the Third Quarter\n2024 investor conference call contain forward-looking statements with respect to us and our industry.

Basis of presentation:\nMethanex Corporation (\"the Company\") is an incorporated entity with corporate offices in Vancouver, Canada. The Company’s\noperations consist of the production and sale of methanol, a commodity chemical. The Company is the world’s largest producer\nand supplier of methanol to the major international markets of Asia Pacific, North America, Europe and South America.\nThese condensed consolidated interim financial statements are prepared in accordance with International Accounting Standards\n(\"IAS\") 34, Interim Financial Reporting, as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (\"IASB\") on a basis consistent\nwith those followed in the most recent annual consolidated financial statements except for the adoption of amendments\neffective January 1, 2024 to IAS 1, Presentation of Financial Statements regarding the classification of liabilities as current or\nnon-current, IFRS 16, Leases regarding sale-and-leaseback transactions and IAS 7, Statement of Cash Flows regarding supplier\nfinance arrangements. The amendments did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.\nPillar Two model rules were published by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (“Pillar Two rules”)\nand establish a global minimum fifteen percent top-up tax regime. Pillar Two rules were implemented in Canada and are\neffective for tax years beginning January 1, 2024. The Company is in scope of the proposed legislation. In May 2023, the IASB\nissued an amendment to IAS 12, establishing a mandatory exception for recognition and disclosure of deferred taxes related to\nthe Pillar Two rules. The amendment also includes current tax disclosure requirements in the periods the rules are effective. The\nCompany has adopted the IAS 12 amendment and our 2024 results do not indicate any significant amount of Pillar Two top-up\ntaxes.\nThese condensed consolidated interim financial statements do not include all of the information required for full annual\nfinancial statements and were approved and authorized for issue by the Audit, Finance & Risk Committee of the Board of\nDirectors on November 6, 2024.\nThese condensed consolidated interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company’s consolidated\nfinancial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023.\n2.

The Company decided to restructure its New Zealand operations to a\nsingle plant operation in September 2024 due to a forecasted decline in New Zealand’s gas profile. The restructuring and shift\nto a one plant operation has been identified as an impairment indicator for the New Zealand cash generating unit (\"New\nZealand CGU\") and the carrying value of the New Zealand CGU was tested for impairment at September 30, 2024.\nThe recoverable amount of the New Zealand CGU was based on fair value less costs of disposal, estimated using discounted\ncash flows. The model contains significant unobservable inputs and as a result is classified within Level 3 of the fair value\nhierarchy. Impairment was measured by comparing the carrying value of the New Zealand CGU to estimated fair value,\ndiscounted at a rate of 9%.\nThere are two key variables that impact the Company’s estimates of future cash flows: (1) the methanol price and (2) the volume\nof natural gas. Methanol price estimates are based on supply and demand fundamentals and consideration is given to many\nfactors, including, but not limited to, estimates of global industrial production rates, energy prices, changes in general economic\nconditions, future global methanol production capacity, industry operating rates and the global industry cost structure. The\nCompany’s estimate of the volume of natural gas takes into consideration the current contracted terms, as well as factors that it\nbelieves are relevant to supply under these contracts and supplemental natural gas sources. Other assumptions included in the\nCompany’s estimate of future cash flows include the estimated cost incurred to maintain the facilities, estimates of\ntransportation costs and other variable costs incurred in producing methanol in each period. The values assigned to the key\nassumptions represent management's assessment of future trends and have been based on historical data from both external and\ninternal sources.\nBased on the test performed, the Company recorded a non-cash before-tax asset impairment charge of $125 million ($90\nmillion after-tax) in property, plant and equipment to write down the carrying value of the New Zealand CGU at September 30,\n2024 to $93 million.\nThe following table presents the Level 3 inputs and the sensitivities of the fair value less costs of disposal model to changes in\nthese inputs:\nSensitivities\nResulting change in\nValuation input Input value or range Change in input valuation\nMethanol price forecast $317 - $365 per MT +/- $25 per MT $+24/-27 million\nAnnual estimates based\nVolume of natural gas on third party forecasts +/-10% $+19/-21 million\nDiscount rate (after-tax) 9% +/- 1% $+/-2 million\nThe sensitivity has been prepared considering each variable independently. It is possible that the assumptions used in\nestablishing fair value amounts will differ from future outcomes and the impact of such variations could be material.\nb) Right-of-use assets:\nOcean Going Terminals,\nVessels Tanks and Rail Other Total\nCost at September 30, 2024 $ 943,607 $ 357,487 $ 61,186 $ 1,362,280\nAccumulated depreciation at September 30, 2024 388,762 218,263 35,099 642,124\nNet book value at September 30, 2024 $ 554,845 $ 139,224 $ 26,087 $ 720,156\nCost at December 31, 2023 $ 910,720 $ 332,441 $ 58,622 $ 1,301,783\nAccumulated depreciation at December 31, 2023 314,324 196,303 33,863 544,490\nNet book value at December 31, 2023 $ 596,396 $ 136,138 $ 24,759 $ 757,293\nMETHANEX CORPORATION 2024 THIRD QUARTER\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) PAGE 7\n3. Interest in Atlas joint venture:\na) Stand-alone financial information:\nThe Company has a 63.1% equity interest in Atlas Methanol Company Unlimited (\"Atlas\"). Atlas owns a 1.8 million tonne\nper year methanol production facility in Trinidad. In mid-September the Atlas facility was idled, as its legacy 20-year\nnatural gas supply agreement expired,The Company accounts for its interest in Atlas using the equity method. Summarized\nfinancial information of Atlas (100% basis) is as follows:\nSep 30 Dec 31\nStatements of financial position 2024 2023\nCash and cash equivalents $ 35,696 $ 126,392\nOther current assets 220,357 189,062\nNon-current assets 151,958 149,354\nCurrent liabilities (144,133) (157,835)\nOther long-term liabilities, including current maturities (74,007) (135,940)\nNet assets at 100% $ 189,871 $ 171,033\nNet assets at 63.1% $ 119,809 $ 107,921\nLong-term receivable from Atlas 39,391 76,328\nInvestment in associate $ 159,200 $ 184,249\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSep 30 Sep 30 Sep 30 Sep 30\nStatements of income 2024 2023 2024 2023\nRevenue $ 112,660 $ 103,210 $ 344,892 $ 361,378\nCost of sales and depreciation and amortization (76,584) (39,381) (239,277) (221,146)\nGas contract settlement (b) — 75,000 — 75,000\nOperating income 36,076 138,829 105,615 215,232\nFinance costs, finance income and other (948) (2,719) (5,226) (7,754)\nIncome tax expense (b) (12,747) (48,346) (30,560) (72,316)\nNet earnings at 100% $ 22,381 $ 87,764 $ 69,829 $ 135,162\nEarnings of associate at 63.1% $ 14,122 $ 55,379 $ 44,062 $ 85,287\nDividends received from associate $ 6,310 $ 15,775 $ 32,181 $ 43,539\nb) Atlas tax assessments:\nThe Board of Inland Revenue of Trinidad and Tobago (\"the BIR\") has audited and issued assessments against Atlas in\nrespect of the 2005 to 2017 financial years. All subsequent tax years remain open to assessment. The assessments relate to\nthe pricing arrangements of certain long-term fixed-price sales contracts that commenced in 2005 and continued with\naffiliates through 2014 and with an unrelated third party through 2019.\nThe long-term fixed-price sales contracts with affiliates were established as part of the formation of Atlas and management\nbelieves these were reflective of market considerations at that time.\nDuring the periods under assessment and continuing through 2014, approximately 50% of Atlas-produced methanol was\nsold under these fixed-price contracts. From late 2014 through 2019 fixed-price sales to an unrelated third party\nrepresented approximately 10% of Atlas-produced methanol. Atlas had partial relief from corporation income tax until late\nJuly 2014.\nThe Company believes it is impractical to disclose a reasonable estimate of the potential contingent liability due to the\nwide range of assumptions and interpretations implicit in the assessments.\nThe Company has lodged objections to the assessments. No deposits have been required to lodge objections. Based on the\nmerits of the cases and advice from legal counsel, the Company believes its position should be sustained, that Atlas has\nfiled its tax returns and paid applicable taxes in compliance with Trinidadian tax law, and as such has not accrued for any\nMETHANEX CORPORATION 2024 THIRD QUARTER\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) PAGE 8\namounts relating to these assessments. Contingencies inherently involve the exercise of significant judgment, and as such\nthe outcomes of these assessments and the financial impact to the Company could be material.\nThe Company anticipates the resolution of this matter through the court systems to be lengthy and, at this time, cannot\npredict a date as to when this matter is expected to be ultimately resolved.\n4.

The limited recourse debt facilities are described as limited\nrecourse as they are secured only by the assets of the entity that carries the debt. Accordingly, the lenders to the limited\nrecourse debt facilities have no recourse to the Company or its other subsidiaries.\nThe covenants governing the Company’s unsecured notes, which are specified in an indenture, apply to the Company and its\nsubsidiaries, excluding the Egypt entity and the Atlas joint venture entity, and include restrictions on liens, sale and lease-back\ntransactions, a merger or consolidation with another corporation or sale of all or substantially all of the Company’s assets. The\nindenture also contains customary default provisions.\nFailure to comply with any of the covenants or default provisions of the long-term debt arrangements described above could\nresult in a default under the applicable credit agreement that would allow the lenders to not fund future loan requests,\naccelerate the due date of the principal and accrued interest on any outstanding loans, or restrict the payment of cash or other\ndistributions.\nAs at September 30, 2024, management believes the Company was in compliance with all covenants related to long-term debt\nobligations.\nIn October, to support the acquisition of OCI Global’s international methanol business (“OCI Acquisition”), the Company\nsuccessfully syndicated a 364-day bridge facility (“Bridge Facility”). The Company also renewed its $500 million revolving\ncredit facility by increasing the existing $300 million tranche to $400 million with a new five-year tenor, and the renewal of the\n$200 million tranche with a new three-year tenor from the closing date of the OCI Acquisition. Additionally, a term loan\ncommitment of $650 million was added to partially finance the OCI Acquisition. The increase to a total availability of $600\nmillion under the revolving credit facility and availability of the $650 million term loan commitment are subject to the closing\nof the OCI Acquisition. As a result of the successful syndication of the $650 million term loan commitment, the commitment\nunder a 364-day bridge facility that was syndicated in early October was reduced to $525 million.\n6. Net income per common share:\nDiluted net income per common share is calculated by considering the potential dilution that would occur if outstanding stock\noptions and, under certain circumstances, tandem share appreciation rights (\"TSARs\") were exercised or converted to common\nshares.\nOutstanding TSARs may be settled in cash or common shares at the holder’s option and for purposes of calculating diluted net\nincome per common share, the more dilutive of the cash-settled and equity-settled method is used, regardless of how the plan\nis accounted for. Accordingly, TSARs that are accounted for using the cash-settled method will require adjustments to the\nnumerator if the equity-settled method is determined to have a dilutive effect on diluted net income per common share as\ncompared to the cash-settled method. The equity-settled method was more dilutive for the three and nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024, and an adjustment was required for the numerator and the denominator. For the three months and nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2023, the cash-settled method was more dilutive and no adjustment was required for the\nnumerator or the denominator.\nStock options and, if calculated using the equity-settled method, TSARs are considered dilutive when the average market price\nof the Company’s common shares during the period disclosed exceeds the exercise price of the stock option or TSAR. For the\nthree and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, stock options were dilutive, resulting in an adjustment to the\ndenominator.

The fair value at September 30, 2024 was $18.6 million compared to the recorded\nliability of $16.0 million. The difference between the fair value and the recorded liability of $2.6 million will be\nrecognized over the weighted average remaining vesting period of approximately 1.5 years. The weighted average fair\nvalue was estimated at September 30, 2024 using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.\nFor the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compensation expense related to SARs and TSARs\nincluded a recovery in cost of sales and operating expense of $7.7 million (2023 - an expense of $3.7 million) and a\nrecovery of $5.4 million (2023 - an expense of $9.9 million), respectively. This included a recovery of $8.7 million\n(2023 - an expense of $2.9 million) and a recovery of $10.2 million (2023 - an expense of $6.7 million), related to the\neffect of the change in the Company’s share price for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023,\nrespectively.\nb) Deferred, restricted and performance share units:\nDeferred, restricted and performance share units outstanding at September 30, 2024 are as follows:\nNumber of Deferred Number of Restricted Number of\nShare Units Share Units Performance Share Units\nOutstanding at December 31, 2023 157,700 310,854 631,122\nGranted 24,311 134,080 234,430\nPerformance factors impact on redemption 1 — — 47,473\nGranted in-lieu of dividends 1,440 2,667 4,889\nRedeemed — (108,090) (297,331)\nCancelled — (8,955) (16,383)\nOutstanding at June 30, 2024 183,451 330,556 604,200\nGranted 2,589 — —\nGranted in-lieu of dividends 820 1,556 2,852\nCancelled — (3,434) (4,331)\nOutstanding at September 30, 2024 186,860 328,678 602,721\n1 The number of performance share units that ultimately vest are determined by performance factors as described below.

Units vest over three years and include two equally weighted performance factors: (i) relative\ntotal shareholder return of Methanex shares versus a specific market index (the market performance factor) and (ii) three\nyear average modified return on capital employed (the non-market performance factor). The market performance factor is\nmeasured by the Company at the grant date and reporting date using a Monte-Carlo simulation model to determine fair\nvalue. The non-market performance factor reflects management's best estimate to determine the expected number of units\nto vest. Based on these performance factors, the performance share unit payout will range between 0% to 200%.\nCompensation expense for deferred, restricted and performance share units is measured at fair value based on the market\nvalue of the Company’s common shares and is recognized over the vesting period. Changes in fair value are recognized in\nnet income for the proportion of the service that has been rendered at each reporting date. The fair value of deferred,\nrestricted and performance share units at September 30, 2024 was $44.4 million compared to the recorded liability of\n$33.5 million. The difference between the fair value and the recorded liability of $10.9 million will be recognized over the\nweighted average remaining vesting period of approximately 1.8 years.\nFor the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compensation expense related to deferred, restricted and\nperformance share units included in cost of sales and operating expenses was a recovery of $5.9 million (2023 - an\nexpense of $7.6 million) and an expense of $2.8 million (2023 - an expense of $18.0 million), respectively. This included a\nrecovery of $9.1 million (2023 - an expense of $4.7 million) and a recovery of $9.8 million (2023 - an expense of $6.1\nmillion), related to the effect of the change in the Company’s share price for the three and nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 and 2023 respectively.\n8.

Financial instruments:\nFinancial instruments are either measured at amortized cost or fair value.\nIn the normal course of business, the Company's assets, liabilities and forecasted transactions, as reported in U.S. dollars, are\nimpacted by various market risks including, but not limited to, natural gas prices and currency exchange rates. The time frame\nand manner in which the Company manages those risks varies for each item based on the Company's assessment of the risk\nand the available alternatives for mitigating risks.\nThe Company uses derivatives as part of its risk management program to mitigate variability associated with changing market\nMETHANEX CORPORATION 2024 THIRD QUARTER\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) PAGE 13\nvalues. Changes in fair value of derivative financial instruments are recorded in earnings unless the instruments are designated\nas cash flow hedges. The Company designates as cash flow hedges derivative financial instruments to hedge its risk exposure to\nfluctuations in natural gas prices and fluctuations in the Euro compared to the U.S. dollar.\nThe fair value of derivative instruments is determined based on industry-accepted valuation models with those using market\nobservable inputs classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy and those using significant unobservable inputs classified\nas Level 3. The fair value of all of the Company's derivative contracts as presented in the consolidated statements of financial\nposition are determined based on present values and the discount rates used are adjusted for credit risk. The effective portion of\nthe changes in fair value of derivative financial instruments designated as cash flow hedges is recorded in other comprehensive\nincome as the change in fair value of cash flow hedges. The change in the fair value of the forward element of forward\ncontracts is recorded separately in other comprehensive income as the forward element is excluded from the hedging\nrelationships. Once a commodity hedge settles, the amount realized during the period and not recognized immediately in the\nstatement of income is reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income (equity) to inventory and ultimately through\ncost of goods sold. Foreign currency hedges settled, are realized during the period directly to the statement of income,\nreclassified from the statement of other comprehensive income.\nUntil settled, the fair value of Level 2 derivative financial instruments will fluctuate based on changes in commodity prices or\nforeign currency exchange rates and the fair value of Level 3 derivative financial instruments will fluctuate based on changes in\nthe observable and unobservable valuation model inputs.\nNorth American natural gas forward contracts\nThe Company manages its exposure to changes in natural gas prices for a portion of its North American natural gas\nrequirements by executing a number of fixed price forward contracts: both financial and physical.\nThe Company has entered into forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges to manage its exposure to changes in natural\ngas prices for Geismar. Natural gas is fungible across the Geismar plants. Other costs incurred to transport natural gas from the\ncontracted delivery point Henry Hub to the relevant production facility represent an insignificant portion of the overall\nunderlying risk and are recognized as incurred outside of the hedging relationship.\nSep 30 Dec 31\nAs at 2024 2023\nMaturities 2024-2032 2024-2032\nNotional quantity 1 315,210 347,190\nNotional quantity per day, annualized 1 50 - 180 50 - 170\nNotional amount $ 1,068,776 $ 1,183,319\nNet fair value $ 32,608 $ 29,925\n1 In thousands of Million British Thermal Units (MMBtu)\nInformation regarding the gross amounts of the Company's natural gas forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges in the\nunaudited consolidated statements of financial position is as follows:\nSep 30 Dec 31\nAs at 2024 2023\nOther current assets $ 13,111 $ 470\nOther non-current assets 82,240 120,638\nOther current liabilities (28,984) (60,532)\nOther long-term liabilities (33,759) (30,651)\nNet fair value $ 32,608 $ 29,925\nMETHANEX CORPORATION 2024 THIRD QUARTER\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) PAGE 14\nEuro forward exchange contracts\nThe Company manages its foreign currency exposure to euro denominated sales by executing a number of forward contracts\nwhich it has designated as cash flow hedges for its highly probable forecast euro collections.\nAs at September 30, 2024, the Company had outstanding forward exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges to sell a\nnotional amount of 26.8 million euros (December 31, 2023 - 12.2 million euros).

The amounts reflect the maturity profile of the hedging instruments and are subject to change\nbased on the prevailing market rate at each of the future settlement dates.

There is no publicly traded market for the\nlimited recourse debt facilities. The fair value of the limited recourse debt facilities as disclosed on a recurring basis and\ncategorized as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy is estimated by reference to current market rates as at the reporting date.\nThe fair value of the unsecured notes disclosed on a recurring basis and also categorized as Level 2 within the fair value\nhierarchy is estimated using quoted prices and yields as at the reporting date. The fair value of the Company’s long term debt\nwill fluctuate until maturity.\nMETHANEX CORPORATION 2024 THIRD QUARTER\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) PAGE 15\nFair value - Level 3 instrument - Egyptian natural gas supply contract\nThe Company holds a long-term natural gas supply contract expiring in 2035 with the Egyptian Natural Gas Holding Company,\na State-Owned enterprise in Egypt. The natural gas supply contract includes a base fixed price plus a premium based on the\nrealized price of methanol for the full volume of natural gas to supply the plant through 2035. As a result of an amendment in\n2022, the contract is being treated as a derivative measured at fair value.\nThere is no observable, liquid spot market or forward curve for natural gas in Egypt. In addition, there are limited observable\nprices for natural gas in Egypt as all natural gas purchases and sales are controlled by the government and the observed prices\ndiffer based on the produced output or usage.\nDue to the absence of an observable market price for an equivalent or similar contract to measure fair value, the contract's fair\nvalue is estimated using a Monte-Carlo model. The Monte-Carlo model includes significant unobservable inputs and as a result\nis classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. We consider market participant assumptions in establishing the model\ninputs and determining fair value, including adjusting the base fixed price and methanol based premium at the valuation date to\nconsider estimates of inflation since contract inception.\nAt September 30, 2024 the fair value of the derivative associated with the remaining term of the natural gas supply contract is\n$18.2 million recorded in Other non-current assets (December 31, 2023 - $20.4 million). Changes in fair value of the contract\nare recognized in Finance income and other.\nThe table presents the Level 3 inputs and the sensitivities of the Monte-Carlo model valuation to changes in these inputs:\nSensitivities\nResulting change in\nValuation input Input value or range Change in input valuation\nMethanol price volatility (before impact of mean reversion) 35% +/- 5% $+/-6 million\nMethanol price forecast $320 - $420 per MT +/- $25 per MT $-5/+6 million\nDiscount rate 6.9% +/- 1% $-1/+1 million\nIt is possible that the assumptions used in establishing fair value amounts will differ from future outcomes and the impact of\nsuch variations could be material.\nFair value - Level 3 instrument - New Zealand natural gas supply contract\nThe Company holds a long-term natural gas supply contract expiring in 2029 with OMV New Zealand (\"OMV\"), one of the\nlargest gas suppliers in New Zealand. The natural gas supply contract includes a base fixed price plus a premium based on the\nrealized price of methanol.\nDuring the third quarter of 2024 the Company entered into short-term commercial arrangements to provide its contracted\nnatural gas into the New Zealand electricity market (Refer to Note 10 - New Zealand gas sale net proceeds). The on-sale of\nnatural gas has impacted the accounting assessment for the contract whereby it is now considered a derivative to be measured\nat fair value.\nThe New Zealand wholesale gas market is relatively small and concentrated as there are a limited number of suppliers and\nconsumers. There is a limited observable, liquid spot market and no forward curve for natural gas in New Zealand. The gas\ntrading platform used to facilitate short-term balance in the gas market trades inconsequential volumes relative to the scope of\nthe Company’s gas consumption and the overall gas market. The Company does not believe transactions on this platform take\nplace with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information.\nDue to the absence of an observable market price for an equivalent or similar contract to measure fair value, we have estimated\nfair value using an economic model. The model includes significant unobservable inputs and as a result is classified within\nLevel 3 of the fair value hierarchy. We have considered market participant assumptions in establishing the model inputs and\ndetermining fair value, including potential sharing mechanisms for gas on-sales to consider the change in the local market gas\nsupply and demand dynamics since contract inception.\nAt September 30, 2024 the fair value of the derivative associated with the remaining term of the natural gas supply contract\nfollowing the on-sale is $35 million recorded in Other assets and recognized as an unrealized gain in Finance income (loss) and\nother expenses.\nMETHANEX CORPORATION 2024 THIRD QUARTER\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) PAGE 16\nThe table presents the Level 3 inputs and the sensitivities of the economic model valuation to changes in these inputs:\nSensitivities\nResulting change in\nValuation input Input value or range Change in input valuation\nNew Zealand forward electricity pricing $129 - $271 NZD$/MWH +/- $50 NZD/MWH $-/+ 2 million\nMethanol price forecast $300 - $350 per MT +/- $25 per MT $-/+1 million\nAnnual estimates based on\nVolume of natural gas third party forecasts +/- 10% $+4/-3 million\nIt is possible that the assumptions used in establishing fair value amounts will differ from future outcomes and the impact of\nsuch variations could be material.\n10. New Zealand gas sale net proceeds:\nIn the third quarter of 2024, the Company entered into short-term commercial arrangements to provide the natural gas available\nto the Company into the New Zealand electricity market. As a result, the Company has recognized $71 million of net proceeds\nin the third quarter of 2024 relating to gas provided up to the end of September. This does not include fixed costs, the impact of\nlost margin on the sale of methanol that was not produced in the period and additional supply chain costs incurred.\n11. Egypt insurance recovery:\nWe experienced an outage at the Egypt plant from October 2023 to February 2024. We have recorded a $59 million ($30\nmillion - attributable to Methanex) insurance recovery which partially offsets repair costs charged to earnings and lost margins\nincurred in the fourth quarter of 2023 and first quarter of 2024. At September 30, 2024, the insurance recovery is included in\nTrade and other receivables as the proceeds were received in the fourth quarter of 2024.\n12. Agreement to Acquire OCI Global's Methanol Business:\nOn September 8, 2024, Methanex entered into a definitive agreement to acquire OCI Global’s international methanol business\n(“OCI Methanol”), subject to certain conditions and approvals. Excluding the impact of cash, debt, and working capital\nadjustments, and including the assumption of a share of non-recourse debt, consideration for the acquisition of OCI Methanol\nwill consist of $1.18 billion in cash, and the issuance of 9.9 million common shares of Methanex Corporation.\nMETHANEX CORPORATION 2024 THIRD QUARTER\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) PAGE 17"

Our average realized price in the second quarter was $352 per tonne compared to $343 per tonne in the first\nquarter of 2024.\n• The repairs to the autothermal reformer are complete on the 1.8 million tonne methanol plant, Geismar 3 (\"G3\"). First\nmethanol was successfully produced in late July and the plant is in the process of ramping up to full rates. G3 will\nsignificantly enhance our cash flow capability at a range of methanol prices and will have one of the lowest emission\nintensity profiles in the industry.\n• Produced 1.4 million tonnes in the second quarter.\n◦ In Chile, based on production year to date, a successful turnaround at Chile IV, and progress we have made in\nsecuring gas for the winter months, we expect 2024 production will be slightly above the high-end of our\nguidance of 1.1-1.2 million tonnes.\n◦ Since June 2024, the Egypt plant has experienced reduced operating rates due to lower availability of natural\ngas. The plant is currently operating with rate limitations based on gas availability and we expect this could\ncontinue through the third quarter.\n◦ In New Zealand, we operated at reduced rates and based on production year to date and current gas deliveries,\nwe expect 2024 production will be below our previous guidance of 1.0 - 1.1 million tonnes.\n• Returned $12.5 million to shareholders through regular dividends and ended the second quarter with $426 million in\ncash.\nVANCOUVER, BRITISH COLUMBIA - For the second quarter of 2024, Methanex (TSX:MX) (NASDAQ:MEOH) reported net\nincome attributable to Methanex shareholders of $35 million ($0.52 net income per common share on a diluted basis) compared\nto net income of $53 million ($0.77 net income per common share on a diluted basis) in the first quarter of 2024. Net income in\nthe second quarter of 2024 was lower compared to the prior quarter primarily due to lower sales of Methanex-produced methanol\nand the negative impact of the mark-to-market portion of share-based compensation due to changes in Methanex's share price,\noffset by a higher average realized price and by the one-time impact of the cost of the ineffective portion of natural gas hedges at\nour Geismar site recognized during the first quarter of 2024. Adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter of 2024 was $164 million\nand Adjusted net income was $42 million ($0.62 Adjusted net income per common share). This compares with Adjusted EBITDA\nof $160 million and Adjusted net income of $44 million ($0.65 Adjusted net income per common share) for the first quarter of\n2024.\nOur average realized price in the second quarter was $352 per tonne compared to $343 per tonne in the first quarter of 2024. In\nthe second quarter, the methanol market was tight. Growing demand from seasonal manufacturing, construction and\ntransportation activities coupled with constrained global methanol production led to lower inventory levels and increasing\nmethanol prices through the quarter.\nIn the second quarter, we returned $12.5 million to shareholders through the regular dividend. We ended the quarter with $426\nmillion in cash, or approximately $390 million in cash excluding non-controlling interests and including our share of cash in the\nAtlas joint venture. We also have an undrawn $500 million revolving credit facility to provide additional financial flexibility.\nMETHANEX CORPORATION 2024 SECOND QUARTER NEWS RELEASE PAGE 1\nRich Sumner, President & CEO of Methanex, said, \"I am excited to announce another quarter of solid financial results and first\nmethanol production at G3. The safety performance of our team and partners on the G3 project has been outstanding and I would\nlike to extend my personal thanks to the team for their hard work and dedication to completing this project safely. As G3 ramps\nup to full rates and is incorporated into our supply chain, we expect to see strong cash flow contribution which will further\nenhance our business.\"\nFURTHER INFORMATION\nThe information set forth in this news release summarizes Methanex's key financial and operational data for the second quarter of\n2024.

Net income in the second quarter of 2024 was lower compared to the prior\nquarter primarily due to lower sales of Methanex-produced methanol and the negative impact of the mark-to-market portion of\nshare-based compensation due to changes in Methanex's share price, offset by a higher average realized price and by the one-\ntime impact of the cost of the ineffective portion of natural gas hedges at our Geismar site recognized during the first quarter of\n2024.\n▪ We recorded Adjusted EBITDA of $164 million for the second quarter of 2024 compared to $160 million for the first quarter of\n2024. We recorded Adjusted net income of $42 million for the second quarter of 2024 compared to Adjusted net income of\n$44 million for the first quarter of 2024.\n▪ We sold 2,612,000 tonnes in the second quarter of 2024 compared to 2,670,000 tonnes in the first quarter of 2024. Sales of\nMethanex-produced methanol were 1,580,000 tonnes in the second quarter of 2024 compared to 1,681,000 tonnes in the first\nquarter of 2024.\n▪ Production for the second quarter of 2024 was 1,422,000 tonnes compared to 1,721,000 tonnes for the first quarter of 2024.\nProduction was lower in the second quarter of 2024 compared to the first quarter of 2024 mainly due to lower production in\nChile and New Zealand which was partially offset by higher production in Egypt.\n▪ The repairs to the autothermal reformer are complete on the 1.8 million tonne methanol plant, Geismar 3 (\"G3\").

Actual production for a facility in any given year may be higher or lower than operating capacity due to a number\nof factors, including natural gas availability, feedstock composition, the age of the facility's catalyst, turnarounds and access to CO from external suppliers for\n2\ncertain facilities. We review and update the operating capacity of our production facilities on a regular basis based on historical performance.\n2 The operating capacity of New Zealand is made up of the two Motunui facilities. Refer to the New Zealand section below.\n3 The operating capacity of Trinidad is made up of the Titan (100% interest) and Atlas (63.1% interest) facilities. Refer to the Trinidad section below.\nKey production and operational highlights during the second quarter include:\nUnited States\nGeismar produced 514,000 tonnes in the second quarter of 2024 compared to 571,000 tonnes in the first quarter of 2024.\nProduction was lower in the second quarter as we pro-actively took a short maintenance outage which is expected to improve\noperating performance until the next planned turnaround.\nNew Zealand\nNew Zealand produced 178,000 tonnes in the second quarter of 2024 compared to 277,000 tonnes in the first quarter of 2024.\nProduction in the second quarter was lower compared to the first quarter due to lower gas deliveries. We operated one plant\nthrough the second quarter due to both lower-than-expected gas deliveries from upstream suppliers as well as from the redirection\nof some of our contractual gas for use in the power sector. The country’s overall energy balances are currently very tight with\ndemand seasonally high during the Southern hemisphere winter combined with low hydro levels and relatively lower gas supply\nin 2024 compared with previous years. As a result, we believe some of our contractual gas has been re-directed to the electricity\nand other domestic markets. We are in continuing discussions with our gas suppliers to ensure our contractual entitlements are\nbeing respected as well as engaging with our gas suppliers and government agencies in supporting efforts to improve energy\nbalances in the country. Based on production year to date and current gas deliveries, we expect 2024 production will be below\nour previous guidance of 1.0 million tonnes.\nTrinidad\nAtlas produced 231,000 tonnes (Methanex interest) in the second quarter of 2024 compared to 258,000 tonnes in the first quarter\nof 2024. Production was lower in the second quarter due to two unplanned outages during the quarter. In October 2023,\nMethanex signed a two-year natural gas supply agreement with the National Gas Company of Trinidad and Tobago (NGC) for its\ncurrently idled, wholly owned, Titan methanol plant (875,000 tonnes per year capacity) to restart operations in September 2024.\nSimultaneously, the Atlas plant (Methanex interest 63.1% or 1,085,000 tonnes per year capacity) will be idled in September 2024,\nwhen its legacy 20-year natural gas supply agreement expires. We are planning for the Titan restart with minimal capital required.\nChile\nChile produced 229,000 tonnes in the second quarter of 2024 compared to 391,000 tonnes in the first quarter of 2024.\nProduction was lower in the second quarter compared to the first quarter as we primarily operated one plant due to to lower\nseasonal gas supply from Argentina. We successfully completed a turnaround at Chile IV and expect the new catalyst will drive\nimproved efficiency and production in the fall. Based on production year to date, a successful turnaround at Chile IV, and\nprogress we have made securing gas from Argentina for the non-winter period this year, we expect 2024 production will be\nMETHANEX CORPORATION 2024 SECOND QUARTER NEWS RELEASE PAGE 5\nslightly above the high-end of our guidance of 1.2 million tonnes. This production is underpinned by year-round natural gas\nsupply from Chile for about 30 – 35% of our requirements with the remaining 65 – 70% being delivered from Argentina during\nthe Southern hemisphere non-winter months. Natural gas development and related infrastructure investments in Argentina\ncontinue to progress and we are working with our natural gas suppliers on extending the period of full gas availability to our\nplants.\nEgypt\nEgypt produced 258,000 tonnes (Methanex interest - 129,000 tonnes) in the second quarter of 2024 compared to 166,000 tonnes\n(Methanex interest - 83,000 tonnes) in the first quarter of 2024. Production increased compared to the first quarter as the plant\nrestarted and reached full operating rates in February after an unplanned outage in mid-October caused by a mechanical failure in\nthe synthesis gas compressor. In June 2024, the Egypt plant was temporarily idled when significantly increased seasonal demand\nfor power generation due to elevated temperatures led to various measures by the government to manage gas balances in the\ncountry including gas curtailments to industrial plants. The plant restarted at reduced operating rates shortly thereafter and has\noperated at fluctuating rates based on gas availability with current operating rates at approximately 80%. There has been some\nstabilization of gas balances in the country but some continued limitations on supply are expected through the third quarter.\nCanada\nMedicine Hat produced 141,000 tonnes in each of the second and first quarters of 2024.\nOutlook\nOur expected production guidance for 2024 is approximately 7 million tonnes (Methanex interest). Actual production may vary\nby quarter based on gas availability in Chile and New Zealand, the start up of the G3 plant, turnarounds, other gas availability,\nunplanned outages and unanticipated events.\nIn the third quarter, we expect lower earnings due to lower produced sales because of lower production from Chile and New\nZealand, as well as G3 building inventory. Based on our July and August posted prices we expect that our average realized price\nrange is between approximately $350 to $360 per tonne for these two months.\nCONFERENCE CALL\nA conference call is scheduled for July 31, 2024 at 11:00 am ET (8:00 am PT) to review these second quarter results.

These items are\nnon-GAAP measures and ratios that do not have any standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and therefore are unlikely to be comparable to similar measures\npresented by other companies. Refer to Additional Information - Non-GAAP Measures on page 14 of the MD&A for reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP\nmeasures.\n▪ We recorded net income attributable to Methanex shareholders of $35 million in the second quarter of 2024 compared to net\nincome of $53 million in the first quarter of 2024. Net income in the second quarter of 2024 was lower compared to the prior\nquarter primarily due to lower sales of Methanex-produced methanol and the negative impact of the mark-to-market portion of\nshare-based compensation due to changes in Methanex's share price, offset by a higher average realized price and by the one-\ntime impact of the cost of the ineffective portion of natural gas hedges at our Geismar site recognized during the first quarter of\n2024.\n▪ We recorded Adjusted EBITDA of $164 million for the second quarter of 2024 compared to $160 million for the first quarter of\n2024. We recorded Adjusted net income of $42 million for the second quarter of 2024 compared to Adjusted net income of $44\nmillion for the first quarter of 2024.\n▪ We sold 2,612,000 tonnes in the second quarter of 2024 compared to 2,670,000 tonnes in the first quarter of 2024. Sales of\nMethanex-produced methanol were 1,580,000 tonnes in the second quarter of 2024 compared to 1,681,000 tonnes in the first\nquarter of 2024. Refer to the Supply/Demand Fundamentals section on page 12 of the MD&A for more information.\n▪ Production for the second quarter of 2024 was 1,422,000 tonnes compared to 1,721,000 tonnes for the first quarter of 2024.\nProduction was lower in the second quarter of 2024 compared to the first quarter of 2024 mainly due to lower production in\nChile and New Zealand which was partially offset by higher production in Egypt. Refer to the Production Summary section on\npage 4 of the MD&A.\n▪ The repairs to the autothermal reformer are complete on the 1.8 million tonne methanol plant, Geismar 3 (\"G3\"). First methanol\nwas successfully produced in late July and the plant is in the process of ramping up to full rates. G3 will significantly enhance our\ncash flow capability at a range of methanol prices and will have one of the lowest emission intensity profiles in the industry.\n▪ In the second quarter of 2024 we paid a quarterly dividend of $0.185 per common share for a total of $12.5 million.\n▪ At June 30, 2024, we had a strong liquidity position including a cash balance of $426 million, or approximately $390 million\nexcluding non-controlling interests and including our share of cash in the Atlas joint venture. We have $500 million of undrawn\nfacilities providing financial flexibility.\nMETHANEX CORPORATION 2024 SECOND QUARTER\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS PAGE 3\nPRODUCTION HIGHLIGHTS\nQ2 2024 Q1 2024 Q2 2023 YTD Q2 2024 YTD Q2 2023\n(thousands of tonnes) Operating Capacity 1 Production Production Production Production Production\nUSA (Geismar) 550 514 571 532 1,085 981\nNew Zealand 2 430 178 277 408 455 811\nTrinidad (Methanex interest) 3 490 231 258 248 489 504\nChile 425 229 391 173 620 422\nEgypt (50% interest) 158 129 83 163 212 324\nCanada (Medicine Hat) 150 141 141 134 282 276\n2,203 1,422 1,721 1,658 3,143 3,318\n1 The operating capacity of our production facilities may be higher or lower than original nameplate capacity as, over time, these figures have been adjusted to reflect\nongoing operating efficiencies at these facilities. Actual production for a facility in any given year may be higher or lower than operating capacity due to a number of\nfactors, including natural gas availability, feedstock composition, the age of the facility's catalyst, turnarounds and access to CO from external suppliers for certain\n2\nfacilities. We review and update the operating capacity of our production facilities on a regular basis based on historical performance.\n2 The operating capacity of New Zealand is made up of the two Motunui facilities. Refer to the New Zealand section below.\n3 The operating capacity of Trinidad is made up of the Titan (100% interest) and Atlas (63.1% interest) facilities. Refer to the Trinidad section below.\nKey production and operational highlights during the second quarter include:\nUnited States\nGeismar produced 514,000 tonnes in the second quarter of 2024 compared to 571,000 tonnes in the first quarter of 2024.\nProduction was lower in the second quarter as we pro-actively took a short maintenance outage which is expected to improve\noperating performance until the next planned turnaround.\nNew Zealand\nNew Zealand produced 178,000 tonnes in the second quarter of 2024 compared to 277,000 tonnes in the first quarter of 2024.\nProduction in the second quarter was lower compared to the first quarter due to lower gas deliveries. We operated one plant\nthrough the second quarter due to both lower-than-expected gas deliveries from upstream suppliers as well as from the redirection\nof some of our contractual gas for use in the power sector. The country’s overall energy balances are currently very tight with\ndemand seasonally high during the Southern hemisphere winter combined with low hydro levels and relatively lower gas supply in\n2024 compared with previous years. As a result, we believe some of our contractual gas has been re-directed to the electricity and\nother domestic markets. We are in continuing discussions with our gas suppliers to ensure our contractual entitlements are being\nrespected as well as engaging with our gas suppliers and government agencies in supporting efforts to improve energy balances in\nthe country. Based on production year to date and current gas deliveries, we expect 2024 production will be below our previous\nguidance of 1.0 million tonnes.\nTrinidad\nAtlas produced 231,000 tonnes (Methanex interest) in the second quarter of 2024 compared to 258,000 tonnes in the first quarter of\n2024. Production was lower in the second quarter due to two unplanned outages during the quarter. In October 2023, Methanex\nsigned a two-year natural gas supply agreement with the National Gas Company of Trinidad and Tobago (NGC) for its currently\nidled, wholly owned, Titan methanol plant (875,000 tonnes per year capacity) to restart operations in September 2024.\nSimultaneously, the Atlas plant (Methanex interest 63.1% or 1,085,000 tonnes per year capacity) will be idled in September 2024,\nwhen its legacy 20-year natural gas supply agreement expires. We are planning for the Titan restart with minimal capital required.\nChile\nChile produced 229,000 tonnes in the second quarter of 2024 compared to 391,000 tonnes in the first quarter of 2024. Production\nwas lower in the second quarter compared to the first quarter as we primarily operated one plant due to to lower seasonal gas\nsupply from Argentina. We successfully completed a turnaround at Chile IV and expect the new catalyst will drive improved\nefficiency and production in the fall. Based on production year to date, a successful turnaround at Chile IV, and progress we have\nMETHANEX CORPORATION 2024 SECOND QUARTER\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS PAGE 4\nmade securing gas from Argentina for the non-winter period this year, we expect 2024 production will be slightly above the high-\nend of our guidance of 1.2 million tonnes. This production is underpinned by year-round natural gas supply from Chile for about 30\n– 35% of our requirements with the remaining 65 – 70% being delivered from Argentina during the Southern hemisphere non-\nwinter months. Natural gas development and related infrastructure investments in Argentina continue to progress and we are\nworking with our natural gas suppliers on extending the period of full gas availability to our plants.\nEgypt\nEgypt produced 258,000 tonnes (Methanex interest - 129,000 tonnes) in the second quarter of 2024 compared to 166,000 tonnes\n(Methanex interest - 83,000 tonnes) in the first quarter of 2024. Production increased compared to the first quarter as the plant\nrestarted and reached full operating rates in February after an unplanned outage in mid-October caused by a mechanical failure in\nthe synthesis gas compressor. In June 2024, the Egypt plant was temporarily idled when significantly increased seasonal demand for\npower generation due to elevated temperatures led to various measures by the government to manage gas balances in the country\nincluding gas curtailments to industrial plants. The plant restarted at reduced operating rates shortly thereafter and has operated at\nfluctuating rates based on gas availability with current operating rates at approximately 80%. There has been some stabilization of\ngas balances in the country but some continued limitations on supply are expected through the third quarter.\nCanada\nMedicine Hat produced 141,000 tonnes in each of the second and first quarters of 2024.\nOutlook\nOur expected production guidance for 2024 is approximately 7 million tonnes (Methanex interest). Actual production may vary by\nquarter based on gas availability in Chile and New Zealand, the start up of the G3 plant, turnarounds, other gas availability,\nunplanned outages and unanticipated events.\nIn the third quarter, we expect lower earnings due to lower produced sales because of lower production from Chile and New\nZealand, as well as G3 building inventory. Based on our July and August posted prices we expect that our average realized price\nrange is between approximately $350 to $360 per tonne for these two months.\nFINANCIAL RESULTS\nFor the second quarter of 2024, we reported net income attributable to Methanex shareholders of $35 million ($0.52 net income per\ncommon share on a diluted basis) compared to net income attributable to Methanex shareholders for the first quarter of 2024 of $53\nmillion ($0.77 net income per common share on a diluted basis) and net income attributable to Methanex shareholders for the\nsecond quarter of 2023 of $57 million ($0.73 net income per common share on a diluted basis). Net income in the second quarter\nof 2024 was lower compared to the prior quarter primarily due to lower sales of Methanex-produced methanol and the negative\nimpact of the mark-to-market portion of share-based compensation due to changes in Methanex's share price, offset by a higher\naverage realized price and by the one-time impact of the cost of the ineffective portion of natural gas hedges at our Geismar site\nrecognized during the first quarter of 2024. Net income was lower compared to the second quarter of 2023 primarily due to lower\nsales of Methanex-produced methanol as well as the negative impact of the mark-to-market portion of share-based compensation\ndue to changes in Methanex's share price in the second quarter of 2024, partially offset by a higher average realized price in the\nsecond quarter of 2024.\nFor the second quarter of 2024, we recorded Adjusted EBITDA of $164 million and Adjusted net income of $42 million ($0.62\nAdjusted net income per common share). This compares with Adjusted EBITDA of $160 million and Adjusted net income of $44\nmillion ($0.65 Adjusted net income per common share) for the first quarter of 2024 and Adjusted EBITDA of $160 million and\nAdjusted net income of $41 million ($0.60 Adjusted net income per common share) for the second quarter of 2023.\nMETHANEX CORPORATION 2024 SECOND QUARTER\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS PAGE 5\nWe calculate Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted net income by including amounts related to our equity share of the Atlas facility\n(63.1% interest) and by excluding the non-controlling interests' share, the mark-to-market impact of share-based compensation as a\nresult of changes in our share price, the impact of the Egypt gas contract revaluation included in finance income and other and the\nimpact of certain items associated with specific identified events. Refer to Additional Information - Non-GAAP Measures on page 14\nfor a further discussion on how we calculate these measures. Our analysis of depreciation and amortization, finance costs, finance\nincome and other and income taxes is consistent with the presentation of our consolidated statements of income and excludes\namounts related to Atlas.\nWe review our financial results by analyzing changes in Adjusted EBITDA, mark-to-market impact of share-based compensation,\ndepreciation and amortization, gas contract settlement, finance costs, finance income and other and income taxes. A summary of\nour consolidated statements of income is as follows:\nThree Months Ended Six Months Ended\nJun 30 Mar 31 Jun 30 Jun 30 Jun 30\n($ millions) 2024 2024 2023 2024 2023\nConsolidated statements of income:\nRevenue $ 920 $ 916 $ 939 $ 1,836 $ 1,978\nCost of sales and operating expenses (745) (736) (724) (1,481) (1,566)\nMark-to-market impact of share-based compensation 8 (10) (15) (2) 5\nAdjusted EBITDA attributable to associate 36 21 14 56 59\nAmounts excluded from Adjusted EBITDA attributable to non-controlling interests (55) (31) (54) (85) (107)\nAdjusted EBITDA 164 160 160 324 369\nMark-to-market impact of share-based compensation (8) 10 15 2 (5)\nDepreciation and amortization (101) (95) (95) (196) (193)\nFinance costs (28) (28) (30) (55) (61)\nFinance income and other 3 3 16 7 27\nIncome tax expense (5) (6) (19) (11) (33)\nEarnings of associate adjustment 1 (16) (9) (10) (26) (30)\nNon-controlling interests adjustment 2 26 18 20 43 42\nNet income attributable to Methanex shareholders $ 35 $ 53 $ 57 $ 88 $ 116\nNet income $ 64 $ 66 $ 91 $ 130 $ 181\n1 This adjustment represents the deduction of depreciation and amortization, finance costs, finance income and other and income taxes associated with our 63.1%\ninterest in the Atlas methanol facility which are excluded from adjusted EBITDA but included in net income attributable to Methanex shareholders.\n2 This adjustment represents the add-back of the portion of depreciation and amortization, finance costs, finance income and other and income taxes associated with our\nnon-controlling interests' share which has been deducted above but is excluded from net income attributable to Methanex shareholders.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nOur operations consist of a single operating segment - the production and sale of methanol. We review the results of operations by\nanalyzing changes in the components of Adjusted EBITDA. For a discussion of the definitions used in our Adjusted EBITDA analysis,\nrefer to How We Analyze Our Business on page 18. Changes in these components - average realized price, sales volume and total\ncash costs - similarly impact net income attributable to Methanex shareholders. The changes in Adjusted EBITDA resulted from\nchanges in the following:\nQ2 2024 Q2 2024 YTD Q2 2024\ncompared with compared with compared with\n($ millions) Q1 2024 Q2 2023 YTD Q2 2023\nAverage realized price $ 22 $ 35 $ (34)\nSales volume (12) (12) (13)\nGeismar 3 delay costs 12 (8) (16)\nTotal cash costs (18) (11) 18\nIncrease (decrease) in Adjusted EBITDA $ 4 $ 4 $ (45)\nMETHANEX CORPORATION 2024 SECOND QUARTER\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS PAGE 6\nAverage realized price\nThree Months Ended Six Months Ended\nJun 30 Mar 31 Jun 30 Jun 30 Jun 30\n($ per tonne) 2024 2024 2023 2024 2023\nMethanex average non-discounted posted price 499 471 450 485 460\nMethanex average realized price 352 343 338 348 354\nMethanex’s average realized price for the second quarter of 2024 was $352 per tonne compared to $343 per tonne in the first\nquarter of 2024 and $338 per tonne in the second quarter of 2023, resulting in an increase of $22 million and an increase of $35\nmillion in Adjusted EBITDA, respectively. For the six months ended June 30, 2024, our average realized price was $348 per tonne\ncompared to $354 per tonne for the same period in 2023, decreasing Adjusted EBITDA by $34 million. Growing demand from\nseasonal manufacturing, construction and transportation activities coupled with constrained global methanol production led to\nlower inventory levels and increasing methanol prices through the quarter. Refer to the Supply/Demand Fundamentals section on\npage 12 of the MD&A for more information.\nSales volume\nMethanol sales volume excluding commission sales volume in the second quarter of 2024 was 142,000 tonnes lower than the first\nquarter of 2024 and 159,000 tonnes lower than the second quarter of 2023. The decrease in sales volume in the second quarter of\n2024 compared to the first quarter of 2024 decreased Adjusted EBITDA by $12 million. The decrease in sales volume for the second\nquarter of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 decreased Adjusted EBITDA by $12 million. For the six months ended\nJune 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023, methanol sales volume excluding commission sales volume was 168,000\ntonnes lower, decreasing Adjusted EBITDA by $13 million. Sales volume may vary quarter to quarter depending on customer\nrequirements and inventory levels as well as the available commission sales volume.\nGeismar 3 delay costs\nThe operating costs related to the delay in start-up of our Geismar 3 project include organizational build-up, take-or-pay obligations\non utilities contracts as well as additional recognition of gas hedges. The total delay costs were $12 million lower in second quarter\nof 2024 compared to the first quarter of 2024 and $8 million higher compared to the second quarter of 2023 as detailed below.\nThree Months Ended\nQ2 2024 Q2 2024\nJun 30 Mar 31 Jun 30 compared with compared with\n($ millions) 2024 2024 2023 Q1 2024 Q2 2023\nOrganizational build-up and take-or-pay obligations $ 13 $ 9 $ 5 $ (4) $ (8)\nOver-hedged gas costs — 16 — 16 —\nTotal $ 13 $ 25 $ 5 $ 12 $ (8)\nOver-hedged gas costs\nDue to the delayed start-up of the Geismar 3 plant, a portion of our existing natural gas hedges exceeded the expected Geismar site\nproduction requirements which resulted in an over-hedged gas cost associated with the delay of $16 million which was recorded in\nthe first quarter of 2024 and which covered the entire period of the anticipated delay. As a result, no further over-hedged gas costs\nwere recorded in the second quarter of 2024. For additional information, refer to Note 9 of the condensed consolidated interim\nfinancial statements.\nTotal cash costs\nThe primary drivers of changes in our total cash costs are changes in the cost of Methanex-produced methanol and changes in the\ncost of methanol we purchase from others (\"purchased methanol\"). We supplement our production with methanol produced by\nothers through methanol offtake contracts and purchases on the spot market to meet customer needs and to support our marketing\nefforts within the major global markets.\nMETHANEX CORPORATION 2024 SECOND QUARTER\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS PAGE 7\nWe apply the first-in, first-out method of accounting for inventories and it generally takes between 30 and 60 days to sell the\nmethanol we produce or purchase. Accordingly, the changes in Adjusted EBITDA as a result of changes in Methanex-produced and\npurchased methanol costs primarily depend on changes in methanol pricing and the timing of inventory flows.\nIn a rising price environment, our margins at a given price are higher than in a stable price environment as a result of timing of\nmethanol purchases and production versus sales. Generally, the opposite applies when methanol prices are decreasing.\nThe changes in Adjusted EBITDA due to changes in total cash costs were due to the following:\nQ2 2024 Q2 2024 YTD Q2 2024\ncompared with compared with compared with\n($ millions) Q1 2024 Q2 2023 YTD Q2 2023\nMethanex-produced methanol costs $ (3) $ 5 $ 28\nProportion of Methanex-produced methanol sales — 6 10\nPurchased methanol costs (14) (7) 15\nLogistics costs 10 (3) (22)\nOther, net (11) (12) (13)\nIncrease (decrease) in Adjusted EBITDA due to changes in total cash costs $ (18) $ (11) $ 18\nMethanex-produced methanol costs\nNatural gas is the primary feedstock at our methanol facilities and is the most significant component of Methanex-produced\nmethanol costs. We purchase natural gas for more than half of our production under agreements where the unique terms of each\ncontract include a base price and a variable price component linked to methanol price to reduce our commodity price risk\nexposure. The variable price component is adjusted by a formula linked to methanol sales prices above a certain level. We also\npurchase natural gas in North America and are exposed to natural gas spot price fluctuations for the unhedged portion of our gas\nneeds in the region.\nFor the second quarter of 2024 compared to the first quarter of 2024, higher Methanex-produced methanol costs decreased\nAdjusted EBITDA by $3 million. For the second quarter of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023, lower Methanex-produced\nmethanol costs increased Adjusted EBITDA by $5 million. For the six months ended June 30, 2024 compared with the same period\nin 2023, lower Methanex-produced methanol costs increased Adjusted EBITDA by $28 million. Changes in Methanex-produced\nmethanol costs for all periods presented are primarily due to the impact of changes in realized methanol prices on the variable\nportion of our natural gas cost, changes in spot gas prices which impact the unhedged portion of our North American operations,\ntiming of inventory flows and changes in the mix of production sold from inventory.\nProportion of Methanex-produced methanol sales\nThe cost of purchased methanol is linked to the selling price for methanol at the time of purchase and the cost of purchased\nmethanol is generally higher than the cost of Methanex-produced methanol. Accordingly, an increase (decrease) in the proportion of\nMethanex-produced methanol sales results in a decrease (increase) in our overall cost structure for a given period. The proportion of\nMethanex-produced methanol sales was similar for the second quarter of 2024 compared to the first quarter of 2024. For the second\nquarter of 2024 compared to the second quarter of 2023, a higher proportion of Methanex-produced methanol sales increased\nAdjusted EBITDA by $6 million. For the six months ended June 30, 2024 compared with the same period in 2023, a higher\nproportion of Methanex-produced methanol sales increased Adjusted EBITDA by $10 million.\nPurchased methanol costs\nChanges in purchased methanol costs for all periods presented are primarily a result of changes in methanol pricing and the timing\nof purchases sold from inventory, as well as the volume and regional mix of sourcing for purchased methanol. For the second\nquarter of 2024 compared to the first quarter of 2024, the impact of higher purchased methanol costs decreased Adjusted EBITDA\nby $14 million. For the second quarter of 2024 compared to the second quarter of 2023, the impact of higher purchased methanol\ncosts decreased Adjusted EBITDA by $7 million. For the six months ended June 30, 2024 compared with the same period in 2023,\nlower purchased methanol costs increased Adjusted EBITDA by $15 million.\nMETHANEX CORPORATION 2024 SECOND QUARTER\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS PAGE 8\nLogistics costs\nLogistics costs include the cost of transportation, storage and handling of product, and can vary from period to period primarily\ndepending on the levels of production from each of our production facilities, the resulting impact on our supply chain, and\nvariability in bunker fuel costs. Logistics costs for the second quarter of 2024, compared with the first quarter of 2024, increased\nAdjusted EBITDA by $10 million. For the second quarter of 2024 compared to the second quarter of 2023, logistics costs decreased\nAdjusted EBITDA by $3 million. Logistics costs for the six months ended June 30, 2024 were $22 million higher compared to the\nsame period in 2023. Changes in logistics costs are impacted by the mix of production from various plants and the impact on ocean\nfreight of longer supply routes. The lower costs compared with the first quarter of 2024 reflects a return to normalized logistics\noperations following the increased costs caused by the outage at our Egypt facility in the first quarter of 2024.\nOther, net\nOther, net relates to unabsorbed fixed costs, selling, general and administrative expenses and other operational items. Other costs\ndecreased Adjusted EBITDA by $11 million during the second quarter of 2024 compared to the first quarter of 2024 and decreased\nAdjusted EBITDA by $12 million compared to the second quarter of 2023. For the six months ended June 30, 2024 compared with\nthe same period in 2023, other costs decreased Adjusted EBITDA by $13 million. The increase in other costs is primarily driven by\nthe decrease in production, which caused higher unabsorbed costs to be recorded in the second quarter of 2024.\nMark-to-Market Impact of Share-based Compensation\nWe grant share-based awards as an element of compensation. Share-based awards granted include stock options, share appreciation\nrights, tandem share appreciation rights, deferred share units, restricted share units and performance share units. For all share-based\nawards, share-based compensation is recognized over the related vesting period for the proportion of the service that has been\nrendered at each reporting date. Share-based compensation includes an amount related to the grant-date value and a mark-to-\nmarket impact as a result of subsequent changes in the fair value of the share-based awards primarily driven by the Company’s share\nprice. The grant-date value amount is included in Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted net income. The mark-to-market impact of share-\nbased compensation as a result of changes in our share price is excluded from Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted net income and\nanalyzed separately.\nThree Months Ended Six Months Ended\nJun 30 Mar 31 Jun 30 Jun 30 Jun 30\n($ millions except share price) 2024 2024 2023 2024 2023\nMethanex Corporation share price 1 $ 48.26 $ 44.63 $ 41.37 $ 48.26 $ 41.37\nGrant-date fair value expense included in Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted net\nincome 7 6 6 13 12\nMark-to-market impact 2 8 (10) (15) (2) 5\nTotal share-based compensation expense (recovery), before tax $ 15 $ (4) $ (9) $ 11 $ 17\n1 US dollar share price of Methanex Corporation as quoted on the NASDAQ Global Market on the last trading day of the respective period.\n2 For all periods presented, the mark-to-market impact on share-based compensation is primarily due to changes in the Methanex Corporation share price.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation and amortization was $101 million for the second quarter of 2024 compared to $95 million for the first quarter of\n2024 and $95 million for the second quarter of 2023. Compared to prior quarters, depreciation and amortization in second quarter\nof 2024 was higher due to the lower amounts of depreciation capitalized in the ending inventory. Depreciation and amortization for\nthe six months ended June 30, 2024 was $196 million compared to $193 million in the same period in 2023.\nMETHANEX CORPORATION 2024 SECOND QUARTER\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS PAGE 9\nFinance Costs\nThree Months Ended Six Months Ended\nJun 30 Mar 31 Jun 30 Jun 30 Jun 30\n($ millions) 2024 2024 2023 2024 2023\nFinance costs before capitalized interest $ 44 $ 44 $ 43 $ 88 $ 86\nLess capitalized interest (16) (16) (13) (32) (25)\nFinance costs $ 28 $ 28 $ 30 $ 55 $ 61\nFinance costs are primarily comprised of interest on borrowings and lease obligations.\nFinance costs were similar for the second quarter of 2024 compared to the first quarter of 2024.

The most\ndirectly comparable measure in the financial statements is net income before tax.\n2 Adjusted income tax expense reflects amounts required for the inclusion of 63.1% of Atlas income, 50% of Egypt and 60% of Waterfront Shipping, as well as amounts\nrequired to exclude the tax impact of mark-to-market impact of share-based compensation expense or recovery, and the impact of the Egypt gas contract revaluation\ncalculated at the appropriate applicable tax rate for their respective jurisdictions. The most directly comparable measure in the financial statements is income tax\nexpense.\n3 Adjusted effective tax rate is a non-GAAP ratio and is calculated as adjusted income tax expense or recovery, divided by adjusted net income before tax.\n4 Adjusted net income before income tax and Adjusted income tax expense are non-GAAP measures. Adjusted effective tax rate is a non-GAAP ratio. These do not have\nany standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and therefore are unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. Management uses\nthese to assess the effective tax rate. These measures and ratios are useful as they are a better measure of our underlying tax rate across the jurisdictions in which we\noperate.\nWe earn the majority of our income in the United States, New Zealand, Trinidad, Chile, Egypt and Canada. Including applicable\nwithholding taxes, the statutory tax rate applicable to Methanex in the United States is 22%, New Zealand is 28%, Trinidad is 38%,\nChile is 35%, Egypt is 30% and Canada is 24.5%. We accrue for withholding taxes that will be incurred upon distributions from our\nsubsidiaries when it is probable that the earnings will be repatriated. As the Atlas entity is accounted for using the equity method,\nany income taxes related to Atlas are included in earnings of associate and therefore excluded from total income taxes but included\nin the calculation of Adjusted net income.\nThe effective tax rate based on Adjusted net income was 24% for the second quarter of 2024 and 20% for the first quarter of 2024.\nAdjusted net income represents the amount that is attributable to Methanex shareholders and excludes the mark-to-market impact of\nshare-based compensation and the impact of certain items associated with specific identified events.

Higher demand for\ntraditional chemical and energy-related applications was driven by increased economic activity globally and seasonally higher\ndemand from manufacturing, construction and transportation activities. In the second half of the quarter, methanol-to-olefin (MTO)\ndemand decreased as several MTO units took maintenance or lowered operating rates in line with methanol market supply\nconstraints and increasing methanol prices.\nOver the long term, we believe that traditional chemical demand for methanol is influenced by the strength of global and regional\neconomies and industrial production levels. We believe that demand for energy-related applications will be influenced by energy\nprices, pricing of end products, and government policies that are playing an increasing role in encouraging new applications for\nmethanol due to its emissions benefits as a fuel. The demand outlook for methanol as a marine fuel continues to grow. Based on\ncurrent dual-fueled vessels operating coupled with the order book for new builds and retrofits, there will be over 300 ships capable\nof running on methanol on the water in the next five years. Actual methanol consumption from marine applications will depend on\nregulations, relative economics versus other fuels, and other factors. The future operating rates and methanol consumption from\nMTO producers will depend on a number of factors including the pricing for their various final products, the degree of downstream\nintegration of these units with other products, the impact of olefin industry feedstock costs, including naphtha, on relative\ncompetitiveness and plant maintenance schedules.\nSupply\nIn the second quarter, global methanol operating rates increased slightly with higher operating rates from Iran and China being\npartially offset by plant outages and gas restrictions in the Atlantic basin. Coupled with growing demand this led to tight inventory\nlevels and increasing methanol prices.\nMETHANEX CORPORATION 2024 SECOND QUARTER\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS PAGE 12\nWe expect limited capacity additions in the next five years. In North America, our new 1.8 million tonne Geismar 3 facility\nsuccessfully produced first methanol in late July and is in the process of ramping up to full rates. In Malaysia, a 1.8 million tonne\nplant has announced it will be starting up in 2024. We expect increased supply from new capacities to be partially offset by\nrationalization of existing supply in the market in 2024. With the shutdown of Atlas and the restart of Titan in September 2024 the\noverall production in Trinidad will be lower by approximately 1 million tonnes annually and we continue to monitor other factors\nthat could further impact supply such as the announced gas diversion from methanol to LNG in Equatorial Guinea. In China and\nIran, there are planned capacity additions over the near-to-medium term which we expect will be somewhat offset by the closure of\nsome small-scale, inefficient and older plants or feedstock constraints. New capacity built in China is expected to be consumed\ndomestically as China requires methanol imports to meet growing demand.\nMethanol Price\nOur average realized price in the second quarter of 2024 was $352 per tonne compared to $343 per tonne in the first quarter of\n2024.\nFuture methanol prices will depend on the strength of the global economy, industry operating rates, global energy prices, new\nsupply additions and the strength of global demand.\nThe following table outlines our recent regional non-discounted Methanex Non-Discounted Regional Posted Prices 1\nposted prices. Methanol is a global commodity and future\nAug Jul Jun May Apr\nmethanol prices are directly impacted by changes in methanol (US$ per tonne) 2024 2024 2024 2024 2024\nsupply and demand.

At June 30, 2024, our cash balance was $426 million, or approximately $390 million excluding non-controlling\ninterest portion of $45 million but including our share of cash held by the Atlas joint venture of $9 million. We invest our cash only\nin highly rated instruments that have maturities of three months or less to ensure preservation of capital and appropriate liquidity.\nWe continuously evaluate the liquidity requirements needed to achieve our strategic objectives, including our capital expenditures.\nWe have access to a $500 million committed revolving credit facility, which is with a syndicate of highly rated financial institutions.\nWe have a $300 million bond due in December 2024 and our intent remains to repay rather than re-finance this debt.\nMETHANEX CORPORATION 2024 SECOND QUARTER\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS PAGE 13\nA summary of our sources and uses of cash for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, compared to the same periods in\n2023, is as follows:\nThree Months Ended Six Months Ended\nJun 30 Jun 30 Jun 30 Jun 30\n($ millions) 2024 2023 Variance 2024 2023 Variance\nCash provided by operating activities $ 163 $ 196 $ (33) $ 246 $ 359 $ (113)\nCash used in financing activities (134) (198) 64 (214) (313) 99\nCash used in investing activities (10) (132) 122 (64) (258) 194\nIncrease (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ 19 $ (134) $ 153 $ (32) $ (212) $ 180\nCash flows from operating activities in the second quarter of 2024 were $163 million compared to $196 million for the second\nquarter of 2023. Cash flows from operating activities were lower in the second quarter of 2024 compared to the second quarter of\n2023 primarily due to changes in working capital.\nCash flows used in financing activities in the second quarter of 2024 were $134 million compared to $198 million for the second\nquarter of 2023. The higher cash outflows in the second quarter of 2023 primarily related to payments for shares repurchased under\nour normal course issuer bid.\nIn the second quarter of 2024 we paid a quarterly dividend of $0.185 per common share for a total of $12.5 million.\nCash used in investing activities relates to capital spend on maintenance and major projects including our Geismar 3 plant and a\nrepayment of long-term loan receivable from Atlas. For more information on our capital projects, please see Capital Projects and\nGrowth Opportunities below.\nCapital Projects and Growth Opportunities\nThe Geismar 3 (\"G3\") plant successfully produced first methanol in late July with the total capital cost expected to be slightly less\nthan $1.30 billion, excluding fixed costs related to the delay. The remaining cash capital expenditure of approximately $30 million\nis fully funded with cash on hand.\nOur planned operational capital expenditure directed towards maintenance, turnarounds, and catalyst changes, including our\n63.1% share of Atlas and 50% of Egypt, is currently estimated to be approximately $80 million for the remainder of 2024.\nCONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nDuring the second quarter of 2024, no changes were made in our internal controls over financial reporting that have materially\naffected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nMETHANEX CORPORATION 2024 SECOND QUARTER\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS PAGE 14\nADDITIONAL INFORMATION – NON-GAAP MEASURES\nIn addition to providing measures prepared in accordance with IFRS, we present certain additional non-GAAP measures and ratios\nthroughout this document. These are Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted net income, Adjusted net income per common share, Adjusted net\nincome before income tax, Adjusted income tax expense, and Adjusted effective tax rate. These non-GAAP financial measures and\nratios reflect our 63.1% economic interest in the Atlas Facility, our 50% economic interest in the Egypt Facility and our 60%\neconomic interest in Waterfront Shipping, and are useful as they are a better measure of our underlying performance, and assist in\nassessing the operating performance of the Company's business. These measures, at our share of our facilities, are a better measure\nof our underlying performance, as we fully run the operations on our partners' behalf, despite having less than full share of the\neconomic interest. Adjusted EBITDA is also frequently used by securities analysts and investors when comparing our results with\nthose of other companies. These measures do not have any standardized meaning prescribed by generally accepted accounting\nprinciples (\"GAAP\") and therefore are unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. These\nsupplemental non-GAAP measures and ratios are provided to assist readers in determining our ability to generate cash from\noperations and improve the comparability of our results from one period to another.\nThese measures should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, net income and revenue reported in accordance\nwith IFRS.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nAdjusted EBITDA differs from the most comparable GAAP measure, net income attributable to Methanex shareholders, because it\nexcludes the mark-to-market impact of share-based compensation, depreciation and amortization, gas contract settlement, finance\ncosts, finance income and other and income taxes. Adjusted EBITDA includes an amount representing our 63.1% share of the Atlas\nfacility and excludes the non-controlling shareholders' interests in entities which we control but do not fully own.\nAdjusted EBITDA and Adjusted net income exclude the mark-to-market impact of share-based compensation related to the impact of\nchanges in our share price on SARs, TSARs, deferred share units, restricted share units and performance share units. The mark-to-\nmarket impact related to share-based compensation that is excluded from Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted net income is calculated\nas the difference between the grant-date value and the fair value recorded at each period-end. As share-based awards will be settled\nin future periods, the ultimate value of the units is unknown at the date of grant and therefore the grant-date value recognized in\nAdjusted EBITDA and Adjusted net income may differ from the total settlement cost.\nThe following table shows a reconciliation from net income attributable to Methanex shareholders to Adjusted EBITDA:\nThree Months Ended Six Months Ended\nJun 30 Mar 31 Jun 30 Jun 30 Jun 30\n($ millions) 2024 2024 2023 2024 2023\nNet income attributable to Methanex shareholders $ 35 $ 53 $ 57 $ 88 $ 116\nMark-to-market impact of share-based compensation 8 (10) (15) (2) 5\nDepreciation and amortization 101 95 95 196 193\nFinance costs 28 28 30 55 61\nFinance income and other (3) (3) (16) (7) (27)\nIncome tax expense 5 6 19 11 33\nEarnings of associate adjustment 1 16 9 10 26 30\nNon-controlling interests adjustment 2 (26) (18) (20) (43) (42)\nAdjusted EBITDA $ 164 $ 160 $ 160 $ 324 $ 369\n1 This adjustment represents the add-back of depreciation and amortization, finance costs, finance income and other and income taxes associated with our 63.1%\ninterest in the Atlas methanol facility which are included in net income attributable to Methanex shareholders but excluded from Adjusted EBITDA.\n2 This adjustment represents the deduction of the portion of depreciation and amortization, finance costs, finance income and other and income taxes associated with\nour non-controlling interests' share which has been added back above but is excluded from Adjusted EBITDA.\nMETHANEX CORPORATION 2024 SECOND QUARTER\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS PAGE 15\nAdjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Income per Common Share\nAdjusted net income and Adjusted net income per common share are a non-GAAP measure and a non-GAAP ratio, respectively,\nbecause they exclude the mark-to-market impact of share-based compensation, the impact of the Egypt gas contract revaluation\nincluded in finance income and other and the impact of certain items associated with specific identified events.

The exclusion of the mark-to-\nmarket portion of the impact of share-based compensation is due to these amounts not being seen as indicative of operational\nperformance and can fluctuate in the intervening periods until settlement.

We review our financial results by\nanalyzing changes in the components of Adjusted EBITDA, mark-to-market impact of share-based compensation, depreciation and\namortization, finance costs, finance income and other and income taxes.\nThe Company has used the terms Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted net income and Adjusted net income per common share throughout\nthis document. These items are non-GAAP measures that do not have any standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and therefore\nare unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. Refer to the Additional Information - Non-GAAP\nMeasures section on page 14 for a description of each non-GAAP measure and reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP\nmeasures.\nIn addition to the methanol that we produce at our facilities, we also purchase and re-sell methanol produced by others and we sell\nmethanol on a commission basis. We analyze the results of all methanol sales together, excluding commission sales volume. The\nkey drivers of changes in Adjusted EBITDA are average realized price, cash costs and sales volume, which are defined and\ncalculated as follows:\nPRICE The change in Adjusted EBITDA as a result of changes in average realized price is calculated as the difference from\nperiod to period in the selling price of methanol multiplied by the current period total methanol sales volume,\nexcluding commission sales volume.\nCASH The change in Adjusted EBITDA as a result of changes in cash costs is calculated as the difference from period to\nCOSTS\nperiod in cash costs per tonne multiplied by the current period total methanol sales volume, excluding commission\nsales volume in the current period. The cash costs per tonne is the weighted average of the cash cost per tonne of\nMethanex-produced methanol and the cash cost per tonne of purchased methanol. The cash cost per tonne of\nMethanex-produced methanol includes absorbed fixed cash costs per tonne and variable cash costs per tonne. The\ncash cost per tonne of purchased methanol consists principally of the cost of methanol itself. In addition, the change\nin Adjusted EBITDA as a result of changes in cash costs includes the changes from period to period in unabsorbed\nfixed production costs, consolidated selling, general and administrative expenses and fixed storage and handling costs.\nSALES The change in Adjusted EBITDA as a result of changes in sales volume is calculated as the difference from period to\nVOLUME\nperiod in total methanol sales volume, excluding commission sales volume, multiplied by the margin per tonne for the\nprior period. The margin per tonne for the prior period is the weighted average margin per tonne of Methanex-\nproduced methanol and margin per tonne of purchased methanol. The margin per tonne for Methanex-produced\nmethanol is calculated as the selling price per tonne of methanol less absorbed fixed cash costs per tonne and variable\ncash costs per tonne. The margin per tonne for purchased methanol is calculated as the selling price per tonne of\nmethanol less the cost of purchased methanol per tonne.\nWe own 63.1% of the Atlas methanol facility and market the remaining 36.9% of its production through a commission offtake\nagreement. A contractual agreement between us and our partners establishes joint control over Atlas. As a result, we account for this\ninvestment using the equity method of accounting, which results in 63.1% of the net assets and net earnings of Atlas being presented\nseparately in the consolidated statements of financial position and consolidated statements of income, respectively. For purposes of\nanalyzing our business, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted net income and Adjusted net income per common share include an amount\nrepresenting our 63.1% equity share in Atlas. Our analysis of depreciation and amortization, finance costs, finance income and\nother and income taxes is consistent with the presentation of our consolidated statements of income and excludes amounts related\nto Atlas.\nWe own 50% of the 1.26 million tonne per year Egypt methanol facility and market the remaining 50% of its production through a\ncommission offtake agreement. We own 60% of Waterfront Shipping, which provides service to Methanex for the ocean freight\ncomponent of our distribution and logistics costs. We consolidate both Egypt and Waterfront Shipping, which results in 100% of the\nfinancial results being included in our financial statements. Non-controlling interests are included in the Company’s consolidated\nfinancial statements and represent the non-controlling shareholders’ interests in the Egypt methanol facility and Waterfront Shipping.\nFor purposes of analyzing our business, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted net income and Adjusted net income per common share\nexclude the amounts associated with non-controlling interests.\nMETHANEX CORPORATION 2024 SECOND QUARTER\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS PAGE 18\nFORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION WARNING\nThis Second Quarter 2024 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (\"MD&A\") as well as comments made during the Second Quarter\n2024 investor conference call contain forward-looking statements with respect to us and our industry.

All subsequent tax years remain open to assessment. The assessments relate to\nthe pricing arrangements of certain long-term fixed-price sales contracts that commenced in 2005 and continued with\naffiliates through 2014 and with an unrelated third party through 2019.\nThe long-term fixed-price sales contracts with affiliates were established as part of the formation of Atlas and management\nbelieves these were reflective of market considerations at that time.\nMETHANEX CORPORATION 2024 SECOND QUARTER\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) PAGE 7\nDuring the periods under assessment and continuing through 2014, approximately 50% of Atlas-produced methanol was\nsold under these fixed-price contracts. From late 2014 through 2019 fixed-price sales to an unrelated third party\nrepresented approximately 10% of Atlas-produced methanol. Atlas had partial relief from corporation income tax until late\nJuly 2014.\nThe Company believes it is impractical to disclose a reasonable estimate of the potential contingent liability due to the\nwide range of assumptions and interpretations implicit in the assessments.\nThe Company has lodged objections to the assessments. No deposits have been required to lodge objections. Based on the\nmerits of the cases and advice from legal counsel, the Company believes its position should be sustained, that Atlas has\nfiled its tax returns and paid applicable taxes in compliance with Trinidadian tax law, and as such has not accrued for any\namounts relating to these assessments. Contingencies inherently involve the exercise of significant judgment, and as such\nthe outcomes of these assessments and the financial impact to the Company could be material.\nThe Company anticipates the resolution of this matter through the court systems to be lengthy and, at this time, cannot\npredict a date as to when this matter is expected to be ultimately resolved.\n4.

The revolving credit facility was entered into with the following significant covenants and default\nprovisions:\na) the obligation to maintain a minimum EBITDA to interest coverage ratio of greater than or equal to 2:1 calculated on a\nfour-quarter trailing basis and a debt to capitalization ratio of less than or equal to 60%, both calculated in accordance\nwith definitions in the credit agreement that include adjustments to limited recourse subsidiaries,\nb) a default if payment is accelerated by a creditor on any indebtedness of $50 million or more of the Company and its\nsubsidiaries, except for the limited recourse subsidiaries, and\nc) a default if a default occurs that permits a creditor to demand repayment on any other indebtedness of $50 million or\nmore of the Company and its subsidiaries, except for the limited recourse subsidiaries.\nThe revolving credit facility is secured by certain assets of the Company, and also includes other customary covenants including\nrestrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness.\nOther limited recourse debt facilities relate to financing for a certain number of our ocean going vessels which we own through\nless than wholly-owned entities under the Company's control. The limited recourse debt facilities are described as limited\nrecourse as they are secured only by the assets of the entity that carries the debt. Accordingly, the lenders to the limited\nrecourse debt facilities have no recourse to the Company or its other subsidiaries.\nThe covenants governing the Company’s unsecured notes, which are specified in an indenture, apply to the Company and its\nsubsidiaries, excluding the Egypt entity and the Atlas joint venture entity, and include restrictions on liens, sale and lease-back\ntransactions, a merger or consolidation with another corporation or sale of all or substantially all of the Company’s assets. The\nindenture also contains customary default provisions.\nFailure to comply with any of the covenants or default provisions of the long-term debt arrangements described above could\nresult in a default under the applicable credit agreement that would allow the lenders to not fund future loan requests,\naccelerate the due date of the principal and accrued interest on any outstanding loans, or restrict the payment of cash or other\ndistributions.\nAs at June 30, 2024, management believes the Company was in compliance with all covenants related to long-term debt\nobligations.\n6. Net income per common share:\nDiluted net income per common share is calculated by considering the potential dilution that would occur if outstanding stock\noptions and, under certain circumstances, tandem share appreciation rights (\"TSARs\") were exercised or converted to common\nshares.\nOutstanding TSARs may be settled in cash or common shares at the holder’s option and for purposes of calculating diluted net\nincome per common share, the more dilutive of the cash-settled and equity-settled method is used, regardless of how the plan\nis accounted for. Accordingly, TSARs that are accounted for using the cash-settled method will require adjustments to the\nnumerator if the equity-settled method is determined to have a dilutive effect on diluted net income per common share as\ncompared to the cash-settled method. The cash-settled method was more dilutive for the three months ended June 30, 2024,\nand no adjustment was required for the numerator or the denominator. For the six months ended June 30, 2024, and the three\nmonths and six months ended June 30, 2023, the equity-settled method was more dilutive and an adjustment was required for\nboth the numerator and denominator.\nMETHANEX CORPORATION 2024 SECOND QUARTER\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) PAGE 9\nStock options and, if calculated using the equity-settled method, TSARs are considered dilutive when the average market price\nof the Company’s common shares during the period disclosed exceeds the exercise price of the stock option or TSAR. For the\nthree and six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, stock options were dilutive, resulting in an adjustment to the\ndenominator. For the three months ended June 30, 2024, TSARs were not dilutive, resulting in no adjustment to the\ndenominator. For the six months ended June 30, 2024, and the three months and six months ended June 30, 2023, TSARs were\ndilutive, resulting in an adjustment to the denominator.\nA reconciliation of the numerator used for the purposes of calculating diluted net income per common share is as follows:\nThree Months Ended Six Months Ended\nJun 30 Jun 30 Jun 30 Jun 30\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nNumerator for basic net income per common share $ 35,221 $ 56,690 $ 87,838 $ 116,460\nAdjustment for the effect of TSARs:\nCash-settled recovery included in net income — (6,138) 846 1,736\nEquity-settled expense — (1,127) (2,658) (2,136)\nNumerator for diluted net income per common share $ 35,221 $ 49,425 $ 86,026 $ 116,060\nA reconciliation of the denominator used for the purposes of calculating diluted net income per common share is as follows:\nThree Months Ended Six Months Ended\nJun 30 Jun 30 Jun 30 Jun 30\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nDenominator for basic net income per common share 67,387,492 67,711,862 67,387,492 68,241,898\nEffect of dilutive stock options 6,394 5,434 6,686 7,425\nEffect of dilutive TSARs — 183,200 176,453 208,002\nDenominator for diluted net income per common share 67,393,886 67,900,496 67,570,631 68,457,325\n7.

Units vest over three years and include two equally weighted performance factors: (i) relative\ntotal shareholder return of Methanex shares versus a specific market index (the market performance factor) and (ii) three\nyear average modified return on capital employed (the non-market performance factor). The market performance factor is\nmeasured by the Company at the grant date and reporting date using a Monte-Carlo simulation model to determine fair\nvalue. The non-market performance factor reflects management's best estimate to determine the expected number of units\nto vest. Based on these performance factors, the performance share unit payout will range between 0% to 200%.\nCompensation expense for deferred, restricted and performance share units is measured at fair value based on the market\nvalue of the Company’s common shares and is recognized over the vesting period. Changes in fair value are recognized in\nnet income for the proportion of the service that has been rendered at each reporting date. The fair value of deferred,\nrestricted and performance share units at June 30, 2024 was $56.5 million compared to the recorded liability of $39.1\nmillion.

Changes in fair value of derivative financial instruments are recorded in earnings unless the instruments are designated\nas cash flow hedges. The Company designates as cash flow hedges derivative financial instruments to hedge its risk exposure to\nfluctuations in natural gas prices and fluctuations in the Euro compared to the U.S. dollar.\nThe fair value of derivative instruments is determined based on industry-accepted valuation models with those using market\nobservable inputs classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy and those using significant unobservable inputs classified\nas Level 3. The fair value of all of the Company's derivative contracts as presented in the consolidated statements of financial\nposition are determined based on present values and the discount rates used are adjusted for credit risk. The effective portion of\nthe changes in fair value of derivative financial instruments designated as cash flow hedges is recorded in other comprehensive\nincome as the change in fair value of cash flow hedges. The change in the fair value of the forward element of forward\ncontracts is recorded separately in other comprehensive income as the forward element is excluded from the hedging\nrelationships. Once a commodity hedge settles, the amount realized during the period and not recognized immediately in the\nstatement of income is reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income (equity) to inventory and ultimately through\ncost of goods sold. Foreign currency hedges settled, are realized during the period directly to the statement of income,\nreclassified from the statement of other comprehensive income.\nUntil settled, the fair value of Level 2 derivative financial instruments will fluctuate based on changes in commodity prices or\nforeign currency exchange rates and the fair value of Level 3 derivative financial instruments will fluctuate based on changes in\nthe observable and unobservable valuation model inputs.\nNorth American natural gas forward contracts\nThe Company manages its exposure to changes in natural gas prices for a portion of its North American natural gas\nrequirements by executing a number of fixed price forward contracts: both financial and physical.\nThe Company has entered into forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges to manage its exposure to changes in natural\ngas prices for Geismar. Natural gas is fungible across the Geismar plants. Other costs incurred to transport natural gas from the\ncontracted delivery point Henry Hub to the relevant production facility represent an insignificant portion of the overall\nunderlying risk and are recognized as incurred outside of the hedging relationship.\nJun 30 Dec 31\nAs at 2024 2023\nMaturities 2024-2032 2024-2032\nNotional quantity 1 330,850 347,190\nNotional quantity per day, annualized 1 50 - 180 50 - 170\nNotional amount $ 1,128,546 $ 1,183,319\nNet fair value $ 56,781 $ 29,925\n1 In thousands of Million British Thermal Units (MMBtu)\nInformation regarding the gross amounts of the Company's natural gas forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges in the\nunaudited consolidated statements of financial position is as follows:\nJun 30 Dec 31\nAs at 2024 2023\nOther current assets $ 10,457 $ 470\nOther non-current assets 110,956 120,638\nOther current liabilities (40,079) (60,532)\nOther long-term liabilities (24,553) (30,651)\nNet fair value $ 56,781 $ 29,925\nDuring the quarter ended March 31, 2024, the Company reclassified $11.7 million from other comprehensive income to cost of\nsales and operating expenses within the statement of income on discontinuation of the hedging relationship for certain gas\nforward contracts where the hedged future cash flows were no longer highly probable to occur.\nMETHANEX CORPORATION 2024 SECOND QUARTER\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) PAGE 13\nEuro forward exchange contracts\nThe Company manages its foreign currency exposure to euro denominated sales by executing a number of forward contracts\nwhich it has designated as cash flow hedges for its highly probable forecast euro collections.\nAs at June 30, 2024, the Company had outstanding forward exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges to sell a\nnotional amount of 28.0 million euros (December 31, 2023 - 12.2 million euros).

The natural gas supply contract includes a base fixed price plus a premium based on the\nrealized price of methanol for the full volume of natural gas to supply the plant through 2035. As a result of an amendment in\n2022, the contract is being treated as a derivative measured at fair value.\nThere is no observable, liquid spot market or forward curve for natural gas in Egypt. In addition, there are limited observable\nprices for natural gas in Egypt as all natural gas purchases and sales are controlled by the government and the observed prices\ndiffer based on the produced output or usage.\nDue to the absence of an observable market price for an equivalent or similar contract to measure fair value, the contract's fair\nvalue is estimated using a Monte-Carlo model. The Monte-Carlo model includes significant unobservable inputs and as a result\nis classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. We consider market participant assumptions in establishing the model\ninputs and determining fair value, including adjusting the base fixed price and methanol based premium at the valuation date to\nconsider estimates of inflation since contract inception.\nAt June 30, 2024 the fair value of the derivative associated with the remaining term of the natural gas supply contract is $20.6\nmillion recorded in Other non-current assets (December 31, 2023 - $20.4 million).

My name is Aaron, and I will be your conference operator for today. At this time, I would like\nto welcome everyone to the Methanex Corporation 2024 Second Quarter Results Conference Call. All lines\nhave been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a\nquestion-and-answer session. Thank you.\nI would now like to turn our call over to the Director of Investor Relations at Methanex, Ms. Sarah Herriott.\nPlease go ahead, Ms. Herriott.\nSarah Herriott\nGood morning, everyone. Welcome to our second quarter 2024 results conference call. Our 2024 second\nquarter news release, management's discussion and analysis, and financial statements can be accessed from\nthe Financial Reports tab of the Investor Relations page on our website at methanex.com. I would like to\nremind our listeners that our comments and answers to your questions today may contain forward-looking\ninformation. This information, by its nature, is subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause the stated\noutcome to differ materially from the actual outcome. Certain material factors or assumptions were applied\nin drawing the conclusion or making the forecast or projection, which are included in the forward-looking\ninformation. Please refer to our second quarter 2024 MD&A and to our 2023 Annual Report for more\ninformation.\nI would also like to caution our listeners that any projections provided today regarding Methanex's future\nfinancial performance are effective as of today's date. It is our policy not to comment on or update this\nPage 1 of 13\nguidance between quarters. For clarification, any references to revenue, EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, cash flow,\nadjusted income, or adjusted earnings per share made in today's remarks reflects our 63.1% economic\ninterest in the Atlas facility or 50% economic interest in the Egypt facility and our 60% interest in Waterfront\nShipping.\nIn addition, we report adjusted EBITDA and adjusted net income to exclude the mark-to-market impact on\nshare-based compensation and the impact of certain items associated with specific identified effects. These\nitems are non-GAAP measures and ratios that do not have any standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP\nand therefore unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. We report these\nnon-GAAP measures in this way because we believe they are a better measure of underlying operating\nperformance, and we encourage analysts covering the company to report their estimates in this manner.\nI would now like to turn the call over to Methanex's President and CEO, Mr. Rich Sumner for his comments\nand a question-and-answer period.\nRich Sumner\nThank you, Sarah, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us today as we discuss our second\nquarter 2024 results. Our second quarter average realized price of $352 per tonne and produced sales of\napproximately 1.6 million tonnes generated adjusted EBITDA of $164 million and adjusted net income of\n$0.62 per share. Adjusted EBITDA was higher compared to the first quarter of 2024, primarily due to a higher\naverage realized price. Our second quarter was negatively impacted by $13 million of G3 delay costs\nrecognized in adjusted EBITDA, which was comprised of costs associated with monthly utilities take-or-pay\ncontracts and employee costs. Excluding the G3 – these G3 costs, adjusted EBITDA would have been $177\nmillion.\nThe safe restart of G3 continues to be our company's top priority. During the quarter, the G3 team completed\nthe repair to the autothermal reformer and implemented conditions to allow us to progress back into\nstartup. I'm very pleased to report that yesterday we reached first methanol production from G3, and we\nexpect the plant to ramp up to full rates in the coming weeks. The safety performance of our team and\npartners on the G3 project has been outstanding, and I would like to extend my personal thanks to the team\nfor their continued hard work and dedication to completing this project safely. G3 significantly increases our\ncash flow generation capability and has one of the lowest emission intensity profiles in the industry.\nNow, turning to the second quarter methanol pricing and market dynamics. Our second quarter global\naverage realized price of $352 per tonne was $9 higher than the previous quarter. Through the first part of\nthe quarter, methanol markets tightened with increased demand outpacing supply, leading to a significant\nglobal inventory drawdown and increasing methanol prices. Markets remained tight in the Atlantic basin and\nrebalanced in China in June, when demand slowed down with several methanol-to-olefins or MTO units\ntaking maintenance or lowering operating rates. We believe operating rates from MTO producers are\nincreasingly becoming the balance on the global market as supply struggles to keep pace with demand\ngrowth.\nOverall, global methanol demand was higher compared to the first quarter of 2024. Traditional chemical\napplications and energy-related demand grew above 3% compared to the prior quarter, driven by increased\neconomic activity globally, seasonally high construction and transportation activities, and favorable energy\npricing, which continues to support methanol demand into energy applications. MTO demand decreased in\nthe quarter as plants took outages or lowered operating rates in line with methanol supply constraints and\nincreasing methanol prices. MTO operating rates decreased from around 85% in the first quarter to\noperating rates between 50% and 60% through June and into July. With various improvements in methanol\nsupply through the quarter, we've recently seen one large MTO unit restart. But three large-scale units are\ncurrently idle, representing approximately 4 million tonnes to 5 million tonnes of annual demand.\nPage 2 of 13\nOn the supply side, we saw various planned and unplanned outages and feedstock constraints, restricting\nsupply availability in the second quarter. This limited supply from various regions globally and in particular,\nmethanol production from Iran was slower to enter the market after seasonal gas restrictions. As a result,\nglobal inventory levels were under meaningful pressure, reaching 18-month low levels in China and\nincreasing prices drove lower operating rates from the MTO sector, which led to a more balanced market in\nChina.\nTowards the end of the quarter, we've seen various improvements in methanol supply and inventories\nglobally, although markets remain quite tight, and as I already noted, there remains considerable MTO\ndemand available to restart. We are seeing methanol pricing around $290 per tonne in China, and we\ncontinue to see premiums above these levels in all regional markets. We estimate the marginal cost of\nproduction based on coal pricing in China to be around $270 to $280 per tonne.\nLooking ahead to the third quarter, we expect to see continued tight methanol markets. We're seeing healthy\ndemand growth across all traditional and energy-related downstream sectors, with MTO operating rates\ninfluenced by the availability of supply. We anticipate this increasing demand will be met by increased\noperating rates in the industry as well as new supply from G3, which will be partially offset by our supply\nreduction in Trinidad in September when we shut down the Atlas and restart Titan. Additionally, the 1.8\nmillion tonne plant in Malaysia has announced it will be starting in 2024. As always, we continue to monitor\nthe macroeconomic environment and its impact on global methanol demand.\nNow, turning to our production. Methanex production in the second quarter was lower compared to the first\nquarter due to gas constraints in Chile, Egypt, and New Zealand. In Chile, we're currently in the period of\nlower gas supplies available from Argentina, so we're operating one plant at less than full capacity. We\ncontinue to make progress on gas availability from Chile and Argentina. And based on production year-to-\ndate, a successful turnaround in Chile for that will improve efficiency on restart, and progress we've made\nsecuring gas from Argentina for the non-winter period this year, we expect 2024 production will be slightly\nabove the high end of our guidance of 1.2 million tonnes.\nIn Egypt, the plant produced at higher rates after the syn gas compressor maintenance completed in mid-\nFebruary. In early June, the plant was temporarily idled when significantly increased seasonal demand for\npower generation due to elevated temperatures in the country led to various measures by the government to\nmanage gas balances, including curtailments to industrial plants. The plant restarted at reduced operating\nrate shortly thereafter and has operated at fluctuating rates based on gas availability, with current operating\nrates at approximately 80%. We've seen some stabilization of gas balances in the country, but we expect to\nsee some continued limitations on supply as we progress through the third quarter.\nIn New Zealand, we operated one plant through the second quarter due to both lower than expected gas\ndeliveries from upstream suppliers, as well as from the redirection of some of our contractual gas for use in\nthe broader energy sector. The country's overall energy balances are currently very tight, with demand\nseasonally high during the Southern Hemisphere winter, combined with low hydro levels and relatively lower\ngas supply in 2024 compared with previous years.\nAs a result, we believe some of our contractual gas has been redirected to the electricity and other domestic\nenergy markets. We're in continuing discussions with our gas suppliers to ensure our contractual\nentitlements are being respected, as well as engaging with our gas suppliers and government agencies and\nsupporting efforts to improve energy balances in the country. Based on our production year-to-date and\ncurrent gas deliveries, we expect 2024 production will be below the low end of our previous guidance of 1\nmillion tonnes.\nNow, turning to our current financial position and outlook. We ended the first quarter with approximately\n$390 million of cash. With the G3 plant now in the process of startup, the project is now complete. The total\nPage 3 of 13\nfinal capital cost is slightly less than $1.3 billion, excluding fixed costs related to the delay, and we do not\ncurrently have any further growth capital commitments. Our primary focus for capital for the remainder of\n2024 is to repay rather than refinance the $300 million bond due in December.\nTurning to the third quarter, our European quarterly price was posted at €535 per metric tonne, a €10 per\ntonne increase. Our North America, Asia Pacific, and China prices for August were posted at $695 per tonne,\n$400 per tonne, and $380 per tonne, respectively. We estimate that based on these posted prices, our July\nand August average realized price range is between approximately $350 per metric tonne and $360 per\nmetric tonne. We expect adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter will be lower than the second quarter due\nprimarily to lower produced sales from Chile and New Zealand and G3's initial inventory build post startup.\nWe expect sales of produced product and earnings for the fourth quarter of 2024 to be more representative\nof the run rate of our company with G3 at full production.\nWe'd now be happy to answer questions.\nQUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION\nOperator\nThank you. Our first question comes from the line of Ben Isaacson with Scotiabank. Your line is live.\nAnalyst:Ben Isaacson\nQuestion – Ben Isaacson: Thank you very much, and good morning, everyone. Two questions for me. First\none is on New Zealand. New Zealand seems to be disappointing on a fairly consistent basis. Does it make\nsense to indefinitely idle one of the two Motunui plants? I mean, there are several benefits for this. The risk\nprofile of your portfolio of assets improves. You have reduced variability of free cash flow, which may result in\na higher multiple. You take out a little bit of capacity from the market. Can you just comment on that? Thank\nyou.\nAnswer – Rich Sumner: Thanks, Ben. Yeah. So, right now, we're working through a lot of I'd say two big\nissues right now. One is, as you say, I think the gas from the upstream, the investments that are being made\nin existing fields, both new wells as well as investing to enhance performance of existing wells, I think we've\nseen gas deliveries lower than expectations. I think we also are working through the short-term dynamics in\nthe industry where we believe some of our gas that would be coming to us may not be. And that's – so that's\nsomething we're also working through. But certainly right now, I think you should be thinking about in the\nforeseeable months here a one plant operation and over the next few months we'll be assessing what are our\nviews are for the rest of the year and considering how we should be operating those assets. So, I think there'll\nbe more to come as we assess the rest of the year here.\nQuestion – Ben Isaacson: Thank you for that. And my follow-up question is on the Entropy deal, which is\nreally quite interesting, but it's also a little bit scary because there's the potential for others to do this as well.\nSo, can you run through what are the constraints that's preventing everyone else from kind of copying what\nyou've done and adding another 5% to 10% of supply? That would be helpful. And actually, if you could\nactually maybe give a number in terms of how much capacity is there that can be – that could also do this.\nThank you.\nAnswer – Rich Sumner: Yeah. Maybe I'll just give a bit of background on that project. I think first and\nforemost, we're happy to be working with Entropy, which is a technology provider who already has this\ntechnology in place in gas processing plant in Alberta with sequestrations. I think when you think about the\nframework you need to make this work, you have to think about jurisdictions that, one, are going to have a\nPage 4 of 13\nregulatory and supportive regulatory framework. You also have to have sequestration available. And so, it's\nnot – I wouldn't say it's just easy to replicate, but we're excited to be exploring this opportunity in the pre-\nfeed stage here.\nJust to give you a sense. It'll capture about 400 metric tonnes of CO2 per day. About two-thirds of that would\nbe used in our production, and the remaining third would be sequestered in underground caverns close to\nour plants. That's all being worked on the infrastructure on making this commercial. And so, we're excited to\ndo it. I think this debottlenecking will add, like we said around 50,000 tonnes of low-carbon methanol. And so,\nyeah, we'll work through everything in this pre-feed stage and trying to get to a point of decision making\nsometime in middle of 2025.\nQuestion – Ben Isaacson: Thank you very much.\nOperator\nThank you for your question. Our next question comes from the line of Mike Leithead with Barclays Capital.\nYour line is live.\nAnalyst:Michael Leithead\nQuestion – Michael Leithead: Great, thanks. Good morning, guys. First question just on G3, congrats on\nsuccessfully starting that up. What is your...\nAnswer – Rich Sumner: Thank you.\nQuestion – Michael Leithead: ...thought of quotation for when that should be sort of fully running, fully\nutilized, fully flowing then through the P&L and you guys are getting commensurate earnings. And then, if we\njust kind of use where we are roughly today in terms of methanol and gas, just what's your sort of latest best\nestimate of the annualized EBITDA we should expect from this plant?\nAnswer – Rich Sumner: Yeah. So, I guess the ramp – I'll start with the ramp-up period. We expect as we\ndisclosed we'll be ramping up to full rates in the coming weeks. As of today, the plants operating at 70%\noperating rates, which is how we start up a plant and then we steadily increase over time. There could be\npoints in time where you're testing all that different elements of the plant and you may take it down for a\nperiod to bring it back up. But as of right now, we're at 70% operating rates and we'll be there for a period to\nsteadily increase in the coming weeks here. So, the ramp-up is relatively – we plan it to be relatively quick.\nIn terms of how it will actually impact earnings, I think it's safe to say we don't expect a lot of G3 coming\nthrough in the third quarter, but we would expect that to be a fairly sometime around the end of this quarter\nand the beginning of next quarter. So, inventory flows are not all that easy to track through our system. But I\nwould say it's – we've guided that 2020 (00:18:06) the fourth quarter should look something like a run rate\nwith G3.\nIn terms of the run rate EBITDA from G3, we've guided that at $350 a tonne, which was we think we're slightly\nabove that, that it generates around $200 million to $250 million in EBITDA per year depending on gas\nbetween $3 and $4 in MMBtu. So, hopefully that answers your questions there.\nQuestion – Michael Leithead: Yeah, that's super helpful. And then, just a couple of quick follow-ups on the\nEntropy announcement. First, is that correct in hearing that if everything goes to plan, you should expect to\nmake FID by mid-2025. Two, can you just speak to how dependent this project going forward is on receiving\nPage 5 of 13\ngovernment funding? And then just briefly, is this sort of a one-off opportunity just because of the plan and\nlocation or if this goes well, this is something you could seek to replicate at some of your other plants as well?\nAnswer – Rich Sumner: Yeah. So, I'll start with this – the initial phase and the timelines here. So, this is a\nphase. This is actually – this project is part of a initial a two-step phase project. The first phase is a unit that\nwould capture 400 metric tonnes per day. About two-thirds of that would be used in our production and\nabout a third would be sequestered underground. So, that when you think about value what we will be\npaying, we'll be paying for that CO2 value in methanol production for two-thirds of it. And another third will\nbe – we'll need to get carbon credits for sequestering CO2. And there's obviously a regime of carbon taxing in\nand carbon credits in Canada that will support this project.\nIn addition to that, there's other incentive programs provincially and federally that this will – they'll look to\naccess, and we think that it will be eligible for. All of those things we'll be looking at through the pre-feed\nstage. The phase 2 of the project is actually to really scale this such that you would triple the size of it, and\nyou would capture all of our Scope 1 emissions and sequester all of the – effectively all of the CO2 from the\nScope 1 of the plant. That will take more work, more infrastructure that would be required and a lot more\ncertainty around the carbon framework that would support and carbon pricing framework that would\nsupport that second phase investment. So, hopefully, that helps answer your question.\nQuestion – Michael Leithead: Great. Thank you.\nOperator\nThank you. Thank you for your questions. Our next question comes from the line of Josh Spector with UBS.\nYour line is live.\nAnalyst:James Cannon\nQuestion – James Cannon: Hey, guys. This is James Cannon on for Josh. I just wanted to poke on what's\ngoing on with the discount rate. It seems like while it's crept up over time this year, it's been a lot higher so\nfar. I think based on your comments on third quarter to-date, it seems like we're relatively stable with the last\nquarter's levels. But kind of looking beyond that, how should we think through the rest of the year and kind\nof into next?\nAnswer – Rich Sumner: Well. I think when we look at our price – when we look at our pricing we've been\nguiding for the second quarter, we guided to around $345 per tonne to $350 per tonne. I think we averaged\n$352 per tonne for the quarter – for this coming quarter where we're guiding to $350 per tonne to $360 per\ntonne. And when I look at where pricing is, we've got cost curve levels at $290 per tonne to $300 per tonne in\nChina.\nSo, I think when we look at it, we're setting price as to what a reasonable market price should be in all the\nregions where we're selling into and we're achieving significant premiums, I think, which is reflective of tight\nmarket balances, which we expect to continue for the rest of the year, as I said in earlier remarks. So, we're\nnot as focused on the discount. We're focused on realizations. And I do think you've seen discounts creeping\nup mainly because that's the competitive way pricing into the market, not what we think is reflective of lower\nrealizations.\nQuestion – James Cannon: Okay, got it. And then, I think through the quarter I saw some reports on\ncurtailments to Trinidad Gas. I think you called out a couple of unplanned outages. I was wondering were\nthose related and can you comment on how you're seeing that develop through this quarter?\nPage 6 of 13\nAnswer – Rich Sumner: Yeah. So, those were not gas related. Our outages was – we had – our air separation\nunit went down in Trinidad, and we had to perform some maintenance in Trinidad. But there was gas outages\nin the upstream during the quarter, didn't affect our operations, but it did affect other producers at the point\n(00:23:50). So – but, yeah, unrelated for our Atlas operations.\nQuestion – James Cannon: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator\nThanks for your questions. Our next question comes from the line of Joel Jackson with BMO Capital Markets.\nYour line is live.\nAnalyst:Joel Jackson\nQuestion – Joel Jackson: Hey, Rich. I'm going to ask three quick questions if you allow me. First, on your\nmaintained guidance for 7 million tonnes of Methanex produced volume, how round is that 7 million tonnes?\nIs it more like 6.5 million tonnes to 7 million tonnes? And the reason I say is to make all your numbers work,\nit's kind of hard. You say Q3 production will be a little bit lower than Q2. To get that 7 million tonnes for the\nfull year, you need to run rate, I don't know, like a 10 million tonne run rate in the fourth quarter, yeah, that\nwould be everything going full out. Can you maybe talk about how round the 7 million tonne number is?\nAnswer – Rich Sumner: I think we – I think we feel good about the 7 million tonne with G3 where it is right\nnow and our expectation for G3. I've talked about some ups and downs as it relates to Chile and New\nZealand, and I think most of the other things are factored in. So, we feel pretty good at the 7 million tonne\nrange for the year.\nQuestion – Joel Jackson: For the year, got you. And then, talking...\n(00:25:08)\nQuestion – Joel Jackson: ...second question, the Egypt repair that you had, you obviously put back on line\nsome months ago. You've got some insurance settlement maybe coming from that. Can you talk about that?\nAnd that's obviously not included in your EBITDA forecast, but I imagine that would be put into EBITDA one of\nthese quarters coming up.\nAnswer – Rich Sumner: Yeah. We expect to collect on insurance in the coming quarter. So, I think that's\ngoing to – we should expect to see insurance proceeds coming in, in Q3.\nQuestion – Joel Jackson: But that's not included in your guidance in the outlook last night?\nAnswer – Rich Sumner: No, that's not – it is not included in the guidance.\nQuestion – Joel Jackson: And finally, I mean, now that you're just – you've got G3 starting up the last day or\ntwo (00:25:55) ramped up over the next month or so, got the maturing debt later in the fourth quarter. What\nis the signpost now to be (00:26:03) to buy back stock when are you ready to go again on the buyback?\nAnswer – Rich Sumner: Right now, our first priority is to the debt. We still have some cash to build in\nadvance of that. So, that's our main focus today. I think once we move past that we don't have any major\ngrowth capital, I think we can start looking at use of capital beyond that. And we have said that there would\nPage 7 of 13\nbe – we've got a very strong free cash flow profile, as you know, and there would be room for considering\nshare repurchases along with we do think there's some room for the debt, but we think we can do things in a\nbalanced way there post building up for our $300 million debt repayment. So, I think what we want to do is\nfocus on that today and then once we get confident we're there, we can consider other uses of capital\nbeyond.\nQuestion – Joel Jackson: Thank you.\nOperator\nOur next question comes from the line of Steve Hansen with Raymond James. Your line is live.\nAnalyst:Steve Hansen\nQuestion – Steve Hansen: Yeah. Good morning, guys. Thanks for the time. Wanted to follow up on Joel's\nquestion indirectly about the buyback. I think in the past you said that $200 million to $250 million of cash is\nsort of like a comfortable position you'd like to keep on the balance sheet at any given time just to operate\nthe business methodically. I mean, has that changed at all with G3 production coming online, you need\nslightly more than that, just trying to get a sense for that comfort position so we can think about the excess\ncash build and how that might go to other uses.\nAnswer – Rich Sumner: I think we would be in the range of $250 million to $300 million. Just when we look at\nwhere our cash is earned and how we need to move it around to run the business, that's sort of our comfort\nlevel. So, I wouldn't think that there's a meaningful change with G3 and not having the capital spend there.\nBut, yeah, that's sort of a range to be using, Steve.\nQuestion – Steve Hansen: Okay, that's helpful. And then, just jumping over to Chile, you've obviously been\nsuccessful at procuring some additional gas there. You've talked about increased availability there before, but\nit's taken some time to ultimately execute on getting the gas. Is anything changed in the market down there\nthat's allowed you greater comfort to secure more gas or what are we seeing down there?\nAnswer – Rich Sumner: Well, I'm very comfortable around securing gas outside of the winter period, right?\nWe've got a lot of gas available to us from Argentina outside the winter period, in fact more than our needs. I\nthink we're being offered more than we need for our Chilean operations, which is very positive. The challenge\nwill be through the winter period because gas is restricted from an export perspective. We are in early\ndiscussions there about the winter period because the country is increasingly trying to ramp up pipeline\nconnections and gas takeaway capability out of the Vaca Muerta. They're also developing fields in the in the\nsouth, which is going to add in another 5 million cubic meters into the grid that's effectively stranded. And so,\nwe're a very logical purchaser for that gas. So, I think these things are going to develop. But our goal is to\nhave year round gas in Chile given the dynamics in Argentina.\nQuestion – Steve Hansen: Okay, that's helpful. And then, just one final one if I may, is going back to Ben's\nquestion at the very outset in some of the challenges in New Zealand. I mean, is there inability to move any\none of those plants over time you've done in the past? Those are older facilities, of course. But is there any\ncontext around whether a mover facility might make some sense in terms of optimization of the footprint?\nAnswer – Rich Sumner: Well, I guess the first thing is maybe just the relocation economics and how they\nwork. Relocation economics aren't significant savings on capital. And so, it's usually if you're looking at that,\nit's more trying to execute a project to grow methanol supply in a shorter timeframe and that's where you get\nvalue. I don't think we're in that position today. These plants are not – I don't think would be the plants you\nwould look to move. And I don't think we're in a position today to be making that decision or being exploring\nPage 8 of 13\nthat based on our gas outlook at this point. We want to – we need to get a better feel for medium, long term\nin the country before we'd be looking at anything like that.\nQuestion – Steve Hansen: Okay, very good. Appreciate your help.\nOperator\nThanks for your questions. Our next question comes from the line of Hassan Ahmed with Alembic Global.\nYour line is live.\nAnalyst:Hassan I. Ahmed\nQuestion – Hassan I. Ahmed: Morning, Rich.\nAnswer – Rich Sumner: Good morning.\nQuestion – Hassan I. Ahmed: Just wanted to revisit a bunch of questions that were asked earlier about New\nZealand. I mean, obviously you guys have gas contracts in place over there. I'm just trying to get a sort of if\nyou could dig a bit deeper into the structure of those contracts. I mean, is there any restitution? Could you\nreceive any payments maybe for the gas deliveries that did not happen?\nAnswer – Rich Sumner: So, I think maybe I'll start with the contracts themselves. These contracts we are –\nwe have entitlement to gas per year, but that is based off of what they are bringing to market, right, and\nthere is priority in terms of gas. And so, if the gas is available and our contracts should be fulfilled, yes,\nthere's restitution that should be paid. And that's certainly when we say we're in discussions with our gas\nsuppliers, these are some of the discussions are being had. Now, if the gas is not available and their portfolio\nis not delivering, that's another issue. We don't have deliver or pay obligations on those gas contracts if the\ngas is not producing. So, I think there's two issues there, and we're dealing with both of them right now.\nQuestion – Hassan I. Ahmed: Very helpful. And as a follow-up on the demand side of things, in sort of the\npress release you guys talked about global methanol demand being up sequentially. Just wanted to get a\nbetter sense of what the inventory situation looks like? Is demand improving maybe potentially because of a\nrestock? And part and parcel with that, what are you guys seeing above and beyond just the MTO side in\nterms of Chinese demand? And maybe if you could on the China side also parlay that with if you are possibly\nseeing any maybe shutdowns in Chinese capacity as well?\nAnswer – Rich Sumner: Well, thanks, Hassan. In terms of overall demand, maybe I'll just give a snapshot of\nthe market globally and look to last year and where we are this year. Last year, we would say the market was\nprobably around 92 million tonnes and that does include a slow start in China. But today, for the first half of\n2024, we're probably in the 95 million tonnes to 96 million tonnes and that's with MTO flat or slightly lower\nthan last year. So, when we think about demand growth, it's actually been – it's been pretty strong and\nhealthy around the different sectors compared to last year. I think when we look around the markets outside\nof China, growth rates are about 3% over last year. And then, when we're looking in China, we're seeing\ngrowth rates for traditional demand at about 4% to 5% over last year. And then, the energy-related demand\nthat's in China, which is quite meaningful, is also at that around 4% rates over last year.\nSo, I think that's actually really putting stress on the methanol markets and the ability to meet that demand\nwith supply and that's where the MTO sector I think is really becoming in that balance. When we think about\nChina demand, the domestic economy is something we watch really closely and domestic consumption,\nwhich we don't think is strong. Export markets have been stronger this year, which has helped bring that\nPage 9 of 13\ndemand up. In terms of operating rates in China, we're seeing operating rates in China above 60%. So, that's\nactually reasonably high relative to past performance there. And so, we don't think there's a lot of latent\ncapacity that can come on in China to meet this growing demand. So, that's – our view is that we are in a tight\nmarket. Inventories are reflective of that. There could be swings between when MTO shuts down and when it\nstarts up. But we would say we're in a pretty structurally tight market right now with inventories pretty tight.\nQuestion – Hassan I. Ahmed: Very helpful, Rich. Thank you so much.\nAnswer – Rich Sumner: Thanks.\nOperator\nThank you for your question. Our next question comes from the line of Nelson Ng with RBC Capital Markets.\nYour line is live.\nAnalyst:Nelson Ng\nQuestion – Nelson Ng: Great. Thanks, and good morning, everyone. First question is on Trinidad in terms of\nTitan restarting and mothballing Atlas. Now that you're kind of heading up to that point, should we expect\nany kind of one-time costs to impact EBITDA in Q3? And then, also is the gas contract that current one that's\nexpiring, does that expire like in early September or at the end of September?\nAnswer – Rich Sumner: So, yeah. In terms of cost, you shouldn't expect any cost, and we are planning this to\nbe quite a seamless transition from Atlas to Titan. So, we are not expecting a lot of downtime or periods\nwhere we're not producing at all in Trinidad. And then, when it relates to gas contracts, you can think mid-\nSeptember timeframe for the changeover there.\nQuestion – Nelson Ng: Okay. And then, just to clarify on the Atlas asset, are there any – do you expect any\nlike write-downs or is there any debt still at Atlas that needs to be repaid over the next – over the coming\nmonths?\nAnswer – Rich Sumner: No debt. And when we think about the asset values, we look at Trinidad as a group\nand that's something we always review and don't think we're going to point towards any asset write-downs at\nthis time. But we do look at – these assets are – they're older assets, so we don't have a tonne of book value\nassociated with them and – but that's something we'll look at as we look at our accounts each year.\nQuestion – Nelson Ng: Great, thanks. And then, my next question relates to the Entropy development. So, I\nguess big picture, you're not investing that much capital. So, I think your partners would be investing most of\nthe CapEx or it'll be coming from grants. So, from your perspective, like from a cost perspective, is it that\nmostly the – are you paying for the operating cost and the CO2 feedstock that you'll be using? So, is it\nsomewhat neutral from a – like from a cost per metric tonne of methanol production or is it going to cost you\nmore because you're producing lower or less carbon-intensive methanol? Can you just talk about the\neconomics, assuming the pre-feed and feed and all that gives you the green light to move forward with the\nproject?\nAnswer – Rich Sumner: Yeah, thanks. So, the commercial arrangements aren't finalized. That's one thing I\nwant to start with. We're – a part of the pre-feed will also be looking at what the commercial structures\nshould look like. And so, I think when we – what we in our initial press release, we said Entropy would own –\nconstruct and own the unit, obviously they are the technology provider and the experts on this technology.\nBut we're looking at the commercial arrangements as part of the pre-feed process.\nPage 10 of 13\nBut when you think about the economics, you're right. Like, the – as I said, two-thirds of the economics will\ncome from what we pay or the economics of producing methanol to produce incremental tonnes and then,\nthe remainder will come through sequestration, the value of carbon credits for storing CO2 underground. So,\nyou can think of the methanol generating two-thirds of the value and the carbon credits generating one-third\nof the value. And as it relates to those pricing, we're looking at what it takes to make this project work. And in\naddition, I think what regulatory support is available that will help push this forward as well, so – and all of\nthat we're looking through the pre-feed process.\nQuestion – Nelson Ng: Okay. So, I guess very big picture for it to work from a Methanex's perspective given\nthat you're mainly kind of paying for the CO2? Do you want to be kind of cost neutral, but generate lower\ncarbon-intensive methanol? Is that your – like is that the benefit you're looking for or?\nAnswer – Rich Sumner: I think, maybe your question is a little bit are we expecting to generate a blue\npremium or something that allows us to market this above cost. I don't think that the blue, if that's the\nquestion, I don't think the blue – there's a blue methanol market today that we're expecting is going to\nsupport this project because that market really is undeveloped. And so, what we need is the value of this\nmethanol from a conventional methanol to work and to make sense in terms of it generating additional\nearnings or EBITDA from that ethanol production.\nQuestion – Nelson Ng: I see. That makes sense. I'll leave it there. Thank you.\nOperator\nThank you for your questions. Our next question is from the line of Matthew Blair with TPH. Your line is live.\nAnalyst:Matthew Blair\nQuestion – Matthew Blair: Thank you. Good morning, Rich. Could you give us a sense on exactly how much\ninventory you're looking to build in the third quarter or any sort of metrics like days inventory you're\ntargeting with G3 online?\nAnswer – Rich Sumner: Yeah. I think, first and foremost, like I think a lot of the inventory will be managed\nthrough our sales levels and we don't expect that our sales levels change dramatically with G3. What we will\nsee as a mix of inventory, we'll have more produced product and less purchased product in our system. So,\nwe're not targeting a change in inventory to support G3. I do think what you should expect to see is that this\nis lower cost inventory that we'll be holding versus buying product on the market. So, there could be some\npositives on our working capital that we can look forward to on that.\nQuestion – Matthew Blair: Sounds good. And then, the G3 delay costs were $25 million in the first quarter,\ndown to $13 million in the second quarter. So, you pencil in anything for the third quarter?\nAnswer – Rich Sumner: Nope. Well, yeah, sorry. One month of G3 delay cost for July and that will be kind of\nyou can take our number in the second quarter divide by three.\nQuestion – Matthew Blair: Great. Thank you.\nOperator\nPage 11 of 13\nOur next question is from the line of Laurence Alexander with Jefferies. Your line is live.\nAnalyst:Laurence Alexander\nQuestion – Laurence Alexander: Good morning. Could you give a quick update on sort of how quickly the\nmarine demand should be flowing through in the next couple of years? I mean, we see kind of the longer\nterm build rate, but just how much of an impact we should be thinking of for next year and how much of –\nhow are those companies discussing with you sort of supply, given sort of how tight the market looks to be\ngetting?\nAnswer – Rich Sumner: Yeah. Thanks, Laurence. So, on the marine demand, maybe talk to where we are\ntoday and then how that will kind of develop over time. Right now, we talked about last year being the first\nyear where methanol ships outpaced LNG in terms of the order book. Right now, we're expecting that order\nbook is well over 300 ships on the water in the 2028/2029 timeframe. And I think what we're doing is talking\nabout demand potential because it's difficult to say exactly what the demand would be. And when we quote\ndemand potential, we're not saying this is what the total demand will be, but the demand potential will start\noff next year probably. The total demand is somewhere close to 10 million tonnes now. There will be 1.5\nmillion tonnes or so next year and then you build up to 3.5 million tonnes and then you're up to 7 million\ntonnes and then you work your way into that 10 million tonnes of demand potential.\nNow, the big question is, what will they actually burn because these are dual-fuel vessels. And to your point,\nwe're having a lot of discussions with the shipping companies about supply. I think a lot of those discussions\nstart with low carbon or green methanol because the intent here is a lot of these ships are looking to\nmethanol from a decarbonization perspective. I think they're seeing that, one, there's not a lot of availability.\nAnd two, that the cost is really high to begin with. So, we are in discussions as well about conventional\nmethanol.\nI think securing supply is going to be critical and that's what our low-carbon solutions team is working on\nwith the shipping company. So, it's really hard for us to kind of give you precise numbers until we work\nthrough starting to see secure – securing some contracts and working with the shipping industry more as\nthey make their decisions on these future fuel choices they're going to make. So, we hope to be able to give\nyou more insight as this develops because we are getting closer to the timeframes where these ships are in\nthe water.\nQuestion – Laurence Alexander: Thank you.\nOperator\nThank you for your question. We have a question from Charles Neivert with Piper Sandler. Your line is live.\nAnalyst:Charles Neivert\nQuestion – Charles Neivert: Good morning, guys. You talked about MTO being sort of the tipping or\nbalancing point for the industry. Can you talk a little bit about where the price of methanol needs to be to\nsort of push it out or take it back in? I mean, we're sort of balancing on the line maybe now. Can we go higher\nand still keep the MTO plants in or and this is all assuming that the ethylene and polyethylene markets stay\napproximately where they are. But on that circumstance, where are we on that pricing?\nAnswer – Rich Sumner: Yeah. I'll start with the pricing. We're at very low pricing, low like historically low. So,\nit's hard to see it getting worse. We've had two ethylene/propylene prices in Asia in between $800 per tonne\nPage 12 of 13\nand $900 per tonne for quite some time and that just on a historical basis that would be correlated to about a\n$40 oil price environment. And so, we think that there really is a low at the very low cycle right now that\ntranslates into a C2, C3 kind of straight affordability at around where the cost curve is today. So, call it that\n$280 level. These guys have integrated – a lot of them are integrated downstream. So, when you look at\nintegration and the full value chain, there's usually more value when you go further down and so it's higher\nthan that.\nBut I think when we start moving into pricing for methanol kind of getting above the $320 to $350 range, we\nstart to see some pressure on their operations and today pricings in and around that $290 level and it's\nholding so. And we've seen one MTO unit large scale just recently start up. So, I think we're kind of in this\nwhere our cost curve and MTO affordability is in that $280 to $320 kind of level, and we've seen that being\nquite stable in China around that. If there's an improvement in ethylene and propylene markets, you would\nexpect that the ability to pay goes up. And increasingly, this is a demand-driven industry right now. And so,\nwe think that that would further support pricing.\nQuestion – Charles Neivert: Thanks very much.\nOperator\nThank you for your question. And ladies and gentlemen, there are no further questions at this time. And I'll\nnow turn the call back over to Mr. Rich Sumner.\nVery well. Thank you for your questions and interest in our company. We hope you'll join us in November\nwhen we update you on our third quarter results.\nOperator\nThank you, and this does conclude today's conference call. You may now disconnect. Have a great day.\nCopyright © 2024 FactSet Research Systems Inc. All rights reserved.\nPage 13 of 13"

The size of the Offering was increased to US$600 million from the previously announced Offering size of US$500 million in aggregate principal amount of notes. The notes will be issued at a price of 99.289% of the aggregate principal amount, with an effective yield to maturity of 6.375%, and will be guaranteed on a senior basis by Methanex. The Offering is expected to close on or about November 22, 2024, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions. \n\nMethanex intends to use the net proceeds from the Offering to fund a portion of the cash purchase price of its previously announced agreement to acquire OCI Global’s international methanol business (the “OCI Acquisition”) and for general corporate purposes. \n\nThe notes will be subject to a special mandatory redemption if either (1) the OCI Acquisition is not completed within the time period required by the related acquisition agreement, as it may be extended (but in no event later than May 31, 2026) or (2) Methanex publicly announces that it will not proceed with the OCI Acquisition for any reason, as further described in the terms of the notes. \n\nThe notes have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act, or the securities laws of any other jurisdiction and may not be offered or sold in the United States or to or for the account or benefit of any U.S. persons absent registration under the Securities Act or an applicable exemption from the registration requirements thereof. The notes are being offered and sold only to qualified institutional buyers in the United States in accordance with Rule 144A under the Securities Act and outside of the United States to non-U.S. persons in reliance on Regulation S under the Securities Act. The notes will be offered and sold in Canada on a private placement basis pursuant to certain exemptions from the prospectus requirements of applicable Canadian securities laws. \n\nThis news release is for informational purposes only and does not constitute an offer to sell, or the solicitation of an offer to buy, the notes in the United States, in any province of Canada or any other jurisdiction, nor shall there be any sale of the notes in any province or jurisdiction in which such an offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such province or jurisdiction or an exemption therefrom. \n\n**About Methanex** Methanex is a Vancouver-based, publicly traded company and is the world’s largest supplier of methanol to major international markets.

Our average realized price in the third quarter was $356 per tonne compared to $352 per tonne in the second quarter of 2024. \n  * Announced the signing of a definitive agreement to acquire OCI Global’s international methanol business for approximately $2.05 billion, including OCI’s interest in two world class methanol facilities in Beaumont, Texas. The transaction is expected to close in the first half of 2025. \n  * Geismar 3 (“G3”) produced first methanol in July 2024 and has since passed its commercial and technical performance tests. During the third quarter, as the plant was being brought to full rates, two separate shutdowns were taken to calibrate the newly commissioned equipment to ensure reliability of plant operations at sustained full rates, which led to lower operating rates in the third quarter. G3 has been operating at full rates since early October, and in the last thirty days has produced approximately 154,000 tonnes and is running as designed at a 1.8 MMT per annum rate. \n  * In Chile, we agreed to extend the gas contracts with Chilean gas producer, ENAP, and Argentinean gas producer, YPF, until 2030 and 2027, respectively, on similar economic terms as the previous agreements. These two gas contracts underpin approximately 55% of the site’s gas requirements. In addition, we have secured agreements to purchase gas from Argentina on a firm basis for the non-winter months (October-April) which will allow us to produce at full rates through to the end of April 2025. \n  * In New Zealand, operations were temporarily idled in August as we entered short-term commercial arrangements to provide available natural gas into the New Zealand electricity market until the end of October 2024 as the country’s overall energy balances were very strained. Based on the medium-term gas outlook from our gas suppliers the decision was made to restart one plant and indefinitely idle the other Motunui plant. As a result, a non-cash, non-recurring asset impairment expense of $90 million (net of tax) has been recorded in the third quarter. The site has optimized its operating and capital costs and we expect that these actions will substantially offset the adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow impact from idling one plant. \n  * Returned $12.5 million to shareholders through regular dividends and ended the third quarter with $511 million in cash. \n\n\n\nVANCOUVER, British Columbia, Nov. 06, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — For the third quarter of 2024, Methanex (TSX:MX) (NASDAQ:MEOH) reported net income attributable to Methanex shareholders of $31 million ($0.35 net income per common share on a diluted basis) compared to net income of $35 million ($0.52 net income per common share on a diluted basis) in the second quarter of 2024. Net income in the third quarter of 2024 was similar compared to the prior quarter. Adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter of 2024 was $216 million and Adjusted net income was $82 million ($1.21 Adjusted net income per common share). This compares with Adjusted EBITDA of $164 million and Adjusted net income of $42 million ($0.62 Adjusted net income per common share) for the second quarter of 2024. \n\nOur average realized price in the third quarter was $356 per tonne compared to $352 per tonne in the second quarter of 2024. The increase in our average realized price was driven by stable global demand, with tight market conditions in the Atlantic from supply outages and decreasing inventories and balanced market conditions in China and Asia Pacific. \n\nIn the third quarter, we returned $12.5 million to shareholders through the regular dividend. We ended the quarter with $511 million in cash, or $490 million in cash excluding non-controlling interests and including our share of cash in the Atlas joint venture. \n\nRich Sumner, President & CEO of Methanex, said, “I am pleased that G3 has passed its commercial and technical performance test and has been operating at full rates since early October. Looking forward to the fourth quarter we expect to see an increase in our production levels with G3 at full rates and Chile receiving full gas supply along with higher pricing as the methanol markets have further tightened.

Net income in the third quarter of 2024 was similar compared to the prior quarter as a non-recurring asset impairment charge was offset by the recognition in the quarter of gas sale net proceeds in New Zealand and the non-recurring impact of the Egypt insurance recovery. Also, lower sales of Methanex-produced methanol was offset by a higher average realized price and the impact of the mark-to-market changes in fair-value of assets and share-based compensation. \n  * We sold 2,623,000 tonnes in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 2,612,000 tonnes in the second quarter of 2024. Sales of Methanex-produced methanol were 1,378,000 tonnes in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 1,580,000 tonnes in the second quarter of 2024. \n  * Production for the third quarter of 2024 was 1,347,000 tonnes compared to 1,422,000 tonnes for the second quarter of 2024. Production was lower in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the second quarter of 2024 mainly due to lower production in New Zealand, Chile and Egypt which was partially offset by higher production in Geismar. \n  * Geismar 3 (“G3”) produced first methanol in July 2024 and has since passed its commercial and technical performance tests. During the third quarter, as the plant was being brought to full rates, two separate shutdowns were taken to calibrate the newly commissioned equipment to ensure reliability of plant operations at sustained full rates, which led to lower operating rates in the third quarter. G3 has been operating at full rates since early October, and in the last thirty days has produced approximately 154,000 tonnes and is running as designed at a 1.8 MMT per annum rate. \n  * In the third quarter of 2024 we paid a quarterly dividend of $0.185 per common share for a total of $12.5 million. \n  * At September 30, 2024, we had a strong liquidity position including a cash balance of $511 million, or $490 million excluding non-controlling interests and including our share of cash in the Atlas joint venture. In addition, the majority of the New Zealand gas sales ($45 million) and the Egypt insurance recovery ($30 million) will be received in cash in the fourth quarter of 2024. As at the end of the third quarter, we also have undrawn revolving credit facilities of $500 million, which we subsequently extended to $600 million, to provide additional financial flexibility. The extension is subject to the closing of the OCI acquisition. \n\n\n\n**PRODUCTION HIGHLIGHTS**\n\n**Q3 2024** |  Q2 2024  |  Q3 2023  | **YTD Q3 2024** |  YTD Q3 2023   \n---|---|---|---|---  \n_(thousands of tonnes)_ | **Operating Capacity****1** | **Production** |  Production  |  Production  | **Production** |  Production   \nUSA (Geismar)  | **1,000** | **605** |  514  |  574  | **1,690** |  1,555   \nTrinidad (Methanex interest)  2  | **490** | **262** |  231  |  287  | **751** |  791   \nNew Zealand  3  | **430** | **72** |  178  |  226  | **527** |  1,037   \nChile  | **425** | **173** |  229  |  168  | **793** |  590   \nEgypt (50% interest)  | **158** | **93** |  129  |  160  | **305** |  484   \nCanada (Medicine Hat)  | **150** | **142** |  141  |  130  | **424** |  406   \n**2,653** | **1,347** |  1,422  |  1,545  | **4,490** |  4,863   \n  \n1  |  The operating capacity of our production facilities may be higher or lower than original nameplate capacity as, over time, these figures have been adjusted to reflect ongoing operating efficiencies at these facilities. Actual production for a facility in any given year may be higher or lower than operating capacity due to a number of factors, including natural gas availability, feedstock composition, the age of the facility’s catalyst, turnarounds and access to CO  2  from external suppliers for certain facilities. We review and update the operating capacity of our production facilities on a regular basis based on historical performance.   \n---|---  \n2  |  The operating capacity of Trinidad is made up of the Titan (100% interest) and Atlas (63.1% interest) facilities. The Atlas facility is currently idle. Refer to the _Trinidad_ section below.   \n3  |  The operating capacity of New Zealand is made up of the two Motunui facilities, one of which is idle. Refer to the _New Zealand_ section below.   \n  \nKey production and operational highlights during the third quarter include: \n\n**United States**\n\nGeismar produced 605,000 tonnes in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 514,000 tonnes in the second quarter of 2024. Production was higher in the third quarter with the start up of the Geismar 3 plant. The plant produced first methanol at the end of July and successfully passed its commercial and technical performance test in early October. During Q3, as the plant was being brought to full rates, two separate shutdowns were taken to calibrate the newly commissioned equipment to ensure reliability of plant operations at sustained full rates, which led to lower operating rates in the third quarter. G3 has been operating at full rates since early October, and in the last thirty days has produced approximately 154,0000 tonnes and is running as designed at a 1.8 MMT per annum rate. \n\n**Trinidad**\n\nTrinidad produced 262,000 tonnes (Methanex interest) in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 231,000 tonnes in the second quarter of 2024. Production was higher in the third quarter compared to the second quarter due to two unplanned outages during the second quarter. In mid-September the Atlas plant (Methanex interest 63.1% or 1,085,000 tonnes per year capacity) was idled, as its legacy 20-year natural gas supply agreement expired, and the Titan plant (875,000 tonnes per year capacity) was successfully re-started, on a two-year natural gas supply agreement with the National Gas Company of Trinidad and Tobago (NGC). \n\n**New Zealand**\n\nNew Zealand produced 72,000 tonnes in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 178,000 tonnes in the second quarter of 2024. Production in the third quarter was lower compared to the second quarter as operations were temporarily idled in August as we entered short-term commercial arrangements to provide contracted natural gas into the New Zealand electricity market until the end of October 2024 as the country’s overall energy balances were very strained. Based on the medium-term gas outlook from our gas suppliers for the next few years, the decision was made in September to indefinitely idle one of the two Motunui plants. The site has optimized its operating and capital costs and we expect that these actions will substantially offset the adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow impact from idling one plant. Future production will be dependent on gas availability and any on-selling of gas into the electricity market to support New Zealand’s energy needs. We are in continuing discussions with our gas suppliers to ensure our contractual entitlements, which are in place until 2029, are being respected as well as engaging with our gas suppliers and government agencies in supporting efforts to improve energy balances in the country. Based on production year to date and expectations for the fourth quarter, we expect 2024 production will be approximately 600,000 tonnes. \n\nAs a result of the outlook for gas supply and the idling of one of the Motunui plants, a non-cash before-tax asset impairment charge of $125 million ($90 million after-tax) was recorded to write down the carrying value of our New Zealand assets. \n\n**Chile**\n\nChile produced 173,000 tonnes in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 229,000 tonnes in the second quarter of 2024. Production was lower in the third quarter compared to the second quarter primarily due to lower seasonal gas supply from Argentina during the third quarter. Planned maintenance at Chile 1 and a turnaround at Chile 4 were successfully completed which we expect will improve efficiency and production. Based on production year to date and progress we have made securing gas from Argentina for the non-winter period this year, we expect 2024 production will be slightly above the high-end of our guidance of 1.1-1.2 million tonnes. \n\nIn Q3, we successfully agreed to extend the gas contracts with Chilean gas producer, ENAP, and Argentinean gas producer, YPF, until 2030 and 2027, respectively on similar economic terms as the previous agreements. These two gas contracts underpin approximately 55% of the sites gas requirements. In addition, we have secured agreements to purchase gas from Argentina on a firm basis for the non-winter months (October-April) which will allow us to produce at full rates through to the end of April 2025. These gas contracts are expected to allow us to continue to incrementally increase our production from Chile as natural gas development and related infrastructure investments in Argentina continue to progress which we believe will allow increased gas availability to our two plants in the coming years. \n\n**Egypt**\n\nEgypt produced 186,000 tonnes (Methanex interest – 93,000 tonnes) in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 258,000 tonnes (Methanex interest – 129,000 tonnes) in the second quarter of 2024. Production decreased compared to the second quarter due to fluctuating operating rates based on gas availability. In Egypt, industrial plants were impacted by gas curtailments due to increased seasonal demand for power generation due to elevated temperatures coupled with lower domestic supply. The plant is currently operating at full rates. There has been stabilization of gas balances in the country as temperatures have moderated but some continued limitations on supply to industrial plants are expected going forward, particularly during the summer months. \n\n**Canada**\n\nMedicine Hat produced 142,000 tonnes in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 141,000 tonnes in the second quarter of 2024. \n\n**Outlook**\n\nOur expected production guidance for Q4 2024 is approximately 1.9 million tonnes (Methanex interest) which will be sold through in the fourth quarter of 2024 and the first quarter of 2025 as produced sales normalize to the increased production. Actual production may vary by quarter based on gas availability in Chile and New Zealand, turnarounds, other gas availability, unplanned outages and unanticipated events. \n\nIn the fourth quarter, we expect similar Adjusted EBITDA compared to the third quarter, with higher produced sales and a higher average realized price offset by lower New Zealand gas sales and no contribution from Egypt insurance recovery in the fourth quarter. Based on our October and November posted prices we expect that our average realized price range will be between approximately $365 to $375 per tonne for these two months. \n\n**CONFERENCE CALL**\n\nA conference call is scheduled for November 7, 2024 at 11:00 am ET (8:00 am PT) to review these third quarter results.
