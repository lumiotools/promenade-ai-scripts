Our platform continues to evolve to serve more users, more workflows, and more outcomes. Customers see that and are turning to us for our integrated and easy-to-use experience.\" \n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Highlights:**  \n---  \n(in millions, except per share and percentage amounts)   \n**Third Quarter 2024** |  **Third Quarter 2023** |  **Y/Y** **Change**  \nAnnual Recurring Revenue  |  $298 |  $273 |  9%   \nRevenue  |  $75.2 |  $70.6 |  6%   \nGAAP Loss from Operations  |  $(20.0) |  $(20.9) |  $0.9  \nNon-GAAP Income (Loss) from Operations  |  $1.6 |  $2.8 |  $(1.2)  \nGAAP Net Loss Per Share, Basic and Diluted  |  $(0.14) |  $(0.15) |  $0.01  \nNon-GAAP Net Income (Loss) Per Share, Diluted  |  $0.03 |  $0.05 |  $(0.02)  \nNet Cash Provided by (Used in) Operating Activities  |  $6.2 |  $8.0 |  $(1.8)  \nFree Cash Flow  |  $4.5 |  $7.5 |  $(3.0)  \n  \nNon-GAAP income (loss) from operations and non-GAAP net income (loss) per share exclude expenses related to stock-based compensation expense and related employer payroll taxes and amortization of acquired intangible assets. Stock-based compensation expense and the related employer payroll taxes were $21.5 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared to $23.5 million in the third quarter of 2023. Free Cash Flow is GAAP net cash provided by (used in) operating activities, less cash used for purchases of property and equipment and capitalized internal-use software costs. The section titled \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" below contains a description of the non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations between historical GAAP and non-GAAP information are contained in the tables below. \n\n**Third Quarter and Recent Business Highlights:**\n\n  * Annual Recurring Revenue was $298 million, an increase of 9% year over year and an increase of $8 million compared to the second quarter of 2024. \n  * GAAP Net Loss per share was $0.14, based on 124.3 million shares, in the third quarter of 2024, compared to a loss of $0.15 per share, based on 117.9 million shares, in the third quarter of 2023. \n  * Non-GAAP Net Income (Loss) per share was $0.03, based on 131.3 million diluted shares, in the third quarter of 2024, compared to $0.05 per share, based on 128.1 million diluted shares, in the third quarter of 2023. \n  * Cash Flow from Operations was $6.2 million, a $1.8 million decrease year over year. \n  * Free Cash Flow was $4.5 million, a $3.0 million decrease year over year. \n  * Number of paying customers grew 41% year over year to 3,486. \n  * Number of customers representing $100,000 or more of ARR in Q3 grew to 567, an increase of 13% year over year. \n  * Hired Wade Chambers as the Company's first Chief Engineering Officer. \n  * Launched Amplitude Made Easy, a radically simplified platform experience that makes it easier for more people and more organizations to get started, get insights, and get value faster. \n  * Announced a global strategic partnership with HubSpot aimed to help Go To Market teams embrace product-led growth and close more deals. \n  * Acquired Command AI, a startup that provides intuitive, AI-powered user assistance to make software easier to use. \n  * Launched Web Experimentation, a new product that makes it easy for product managers, marketers, and growth leaders to A/B test and personalize web experiences. \n\n\n\n**Financial Outlook:**\n\nThe fourth quarter and full year 2024 outlook information provided below is based on Amplitude’s current estimates and is not a guarantee of future performance. These statements are forward-looking and actual results may differ materially. Refer to the “Forward-Looking Statements” section below for information on the factors that could cause Amplitude’s actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements. \n\nFor the fourth quarter and full year 2024, the Company expects: \n\n**Fourth Quarter 2024** |  **Full Year 2024**  \n---|---  \nRevenue  |  $76.0 - $77.0 million |  $297.1 - $298.1 million  \nNon-GAAP Operating Income (Loss)  |  $(2.1) - $(0.1) million |  $(6.3) - $(4.3) million  \nNon-GAAP Net Income (Loss) Per Share  |  $0.00 - $0.01 |  $0.04 - $0.06  \nWeighted Average Shares Outstanding  |  134.9 million, diluted  |  131.7 million, diluted   \n  \nAn outlook for GAAP income (loss) from operations, GAAP net income (loss), GAAP net income (loss) per share and a reconciliation of expected non-GAAP income (loss) from operations to GAAP income (loss) from operations, expected non-GAAP net income (loss) to GAAP net income (loss), and expected non-GAAP net income (loss) per share to GAAP net income (loss) per share have not been provided as the quantification of certain items included in the calculation of GAAP income (loss) from operations, GAAP net income (loss) and GAAP net income (loss) per share cannot be reasonably calculated or predicted at this time without unreasonable efforts. For example, the non-GAAP adjustment for stock-based compensation expense requires additional inputs such as the number and value of awards granted that are not currently ascertainable, and the non-GAAP adjustment for amortization of acquired intangible assets depends on the timing and value of intangible assets acquired that cannot be accurately forecasted. \n\n**Conference Call Information:**\n\nAmplitude will host a live video webcast to discuss its financial results for its third quarter ended September 30, 2024, as well as the financial outlook for its fourth quarter and full year 2024 today at 2:00 PM Pacific Time / 5:00 PM Eastern Time. Interested parties may access the webcast, earnings press release, and investor presentation on the events section of Amplitude’s investor relations website at [investors.amplitude.com](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Finvestors.amplitude.com%2F&esheet=54148531&newsitemid=20241106366553&lan=en-US&anchor=investors.amplitude.com&index=2&md5=1e591b8802e2bd198437fadd442c0336). A replay will be available in the same location a few hours after the conclusion of the live webcast. \n\n**Forward-Looking Statements:**\n\nThis press release contains express and implied \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including statements regarding the Company’s financial outlook for the fourth quarter and full year 2024, the Company’s growth strategy and business aspirations and its market position and market opportunity. These statements are often, but not always, made through the use of words or phrases such as “may,” “should,” “could,” “predict,” “potential,” “believe,” “expect,” “continue,” “will,” “anticipate,” “seek,” “estimate,” “intend,” “plan,” “projection,” “would,” and “outlook,” or the negative version of those words or phrases or other comparable words or phrases of a future or forward-looking nature. These forward-looking statements are not statements of historical fact, and are based on current expectations, estimates, and projections about the Company’s industry as well as certain assumptions made by management, many of which, by their nature, are inherently uncertain and beyond the Company’s control. These statements are subject to numerous uncertainties and risks that could cause actual results, performance, or achievement to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated or implied in the statements, including risks related to: the Company’s limited operating history and rapid growth over the last several years, which makes it difficult to forecast the Company’s future results of operations; the Company’s history of losses; any decline in the Company’s customer retention or expansion of its commercial relationships with existing customers or an inability to attract new customers; expected fluctuations in the Company’s financial results, making it difficult to project future results; the Company’s focus on sales to larger organizations and potentially increased dependency on those relationships, which may increase the variability of the Company’s sales cycles and results of operations; downturns or upturns in new sales, which may not be immediately reflected in the Company’s results of operations and may be difficult to discern; unfavorable conditions in the Company’s industry or the global economy, or reductions in information technology spending, which could limit the Company’s ability to grow its business; the market for SaaS applications, which may develop more slowly than the Company expects or decline; the Company’s intellectual property rights, which may not protect its business or provide the Company with a competitive advantage; evolving privacy and other data-related laws; and the impact of new sanctions related to Russia on the Company’s ability to collect receivables. Additional risks and uncertainties that could cause actual outcomes and results to differ materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements are or will be included under the caption \"Risk Factors\" and elsewhere in the reports and other documents that the Company files with the Securities and Exchange Commission from time to time, including the Company’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q being filed at or around the date hereof. The forward-looking statements made in this press release relate only to events as of the date on which the statements are made. The Company undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements made in this press release to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this press release or to reflect new information or the occurrence of unanticipated events, except as required by law. \n\n**Non-GAAP Financial Measures:**\n\nThis press release includes financial information that has not been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The Company uses non-GAAP financial measures internally in analyzing its financial results and believes they are useful to investors, as a supplement to GAAP measures, in evaluating the Company’s ongoing operational performance. The Company believes that the use of these non-GAAP financial measures provides an additional tool for investors to use in evaluating ongoing operating results and trends and in comparing the Company’s financial results with other companies in the industry, many of which present similar non-GAAP financial measures to investors. There are a number of limitations related to the use of non-GAAP financial measures versus comparable financial measures determined under GAAP. For example, other companies in the Company’s industry may calculate these non-GAAP financial measures differently or may use other measures to evaluate their performance. In addition, Free Cash Flow does not reflect the Company’s future contractual commitments and the total increase or decrease of its cash balance for a given period. \n\nNon-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of the Company’s non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures has been provided in the financial statement tables included below in this press release. Investors are encouraged to review the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures below. \n\n**Non-GAAP Gross Profit, Non-GAAP Gross Margin, Non-GAAP Operating Expenses, Non-GAAP Income (Loss) from Operations, Non-GAAP Operating Margin, Non-GAAP Net Income (Loss), and Non-GAAP Net Income (Loss) per Share:**\n\nThe Company defines these non-GAAP financial measures as their respective GAAP measures, excluding expenses related to stock-based compensation expense and related employer payroll taxes, amortization of acquired intangible assets, and non-recurring costs such as restructuring and other related charges. The Company excludes stock-based compensation expense and related employer payroll taxes, which is a non-cash expense, from certain of its non-GAAP financial measures because it believes that excluding this item provides meaningful supplemental information regarding operational performance. The Company excludes amortization of intangible assets, which is a non-cash expense, related to business combinations from certain of its non-GAAP financial measures because such expenses are related to business combinations and have no direct correlation to the operation of the Company’s business. Although the Company excludes these expenses from certain non-GAAP financial measures, the revenue from acquired companies subsequent to the date of acquisition is reflected in these measures and the acquired intangible assets contribute to the Company’s revenue generation. The Company excludes non-recurring costs from certain of its non-GAAP financial measures because such expenses do not repeat period over period and are not reflective of the ongoing operation of the Company’s business. \n\nThe Company uses non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP income (loss) from operations, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP net income (loss), and non-GAAP net income (loss) per share in conjunction with its traditional GAAP measures to evaluate the Company’s financial performance. The Company believes that these measures provide its management, board of directors, and investors consistency and comparability with its past financial performance and facilitates period-to-period comparisons of operations. \n\n**Free Cash Flow and Free Cash Flow Margin****:**\n\nThe Company defines Free Cash Flow as net cash provided by (used in) operating activities, less cash used for purchases of property and equipment and capitalized internal-use software costs. Free Cash Flow margin is calculated as Free Cash Flow divided by total revenue. The Company believes that Free Cash Flow and Free Cash Flow margin are useful indicators of liquidity that provides its management, board of directors, and investors with information about its future ability to generate or use cash to enhance the strength of its balance sheet and further invest in its business and pursue potential strategic initiatives. \n\n**Definitions of Business Metrics:**\n\n_Annual Recurring Revenue_\n\nTheCompany defines Annual Recurring Revenue (“ARR”) as the annual recurring revenue of subscription agreements, including certain premium professional services that are subject to contractual subscription terms, at a point in time based on the terms of customers’ contracts. ARR should be viewed independently of revenue, and does not represent the Company’s GAAP revenue on an annualized basis, as it is an operating metric that can be impacted by contract start and end dates and renewal rates. ARR is also not intended to be a forecast of revenue. \n\n_Dollar-Based Net Retention Rate_\n\nThe Company calculates dollar-based net retention rate as of a period end by starting with the ARR from the cohort of all customers as of 12 months prior to such period-end (the “Prior Period ARR”). The Company then calculates the ARR from these same customers as of the current period-end (the “Current Period ARR”). Current Period ARR includes any expansion and is net of contraction or attrition over the last 12 months, but excludes ARR from new customers as well as any overage charges in the current period. The Company then divides the total Current Period ARR by the total Prior Period ARR to arrive at the dollar-based net retention rate (\"NRR\"). The Company then calculates the weighted average of the trailing 12-month dollar-based net retention rates, to arrive at the trailing 12-month dollar-based net retention rate (“NRR (TTM)”). \n\n_Paying Customers_\n\nFor purposes of customer count, a customer is defined as an entity that has a unique Dunn & Bradstreet Global Ultimate (“GULT”) Data Universal Numbering System (“DUNS”) number and an active subscription contract as of the measurement date. The DUNS number is a global standard for business identification and tracking. The Company makes exceptions for holding companies, government entities, and other organizations for which the GULT, in the Company’s judgment, does not accurately represent the Amplitude customer or the DUNS does not exist. \n\n**About Amplitude**\n\nAmplitude is the leading digital analytics platform that helps companies unlock the power of their products.

With visual editing and point-and-click interaction, Web Experimentation reduces the need for engineering support and accelerates testing. \n\nToday's most successful organizations see experimentation as essential, but A/B testing tools are often difficult to use and scale. They require extensive engineering resources. They lack flexibility and introduce page slowness, which impacts conversion rates. And they suffer from disconnected data and clunky integrations. \n\nWith Web Experimentation, Amplitude now offers a powerful and self-serve way to easily run A/B tests. This enables teams to drive better conversion without compromising page performance. With step-by-step guidance, teams can modify the page, add targeting options, and start their experiment in a few clicks. And this isn't just for simple test cases. Amplitude's high-performance infrastructure provides advanced statistics that scale to meet every customer's needs. This gives teams of all sizes the confidence to run complex experiments without wasting engineering resources. \n\n\"Change is the only constant in technology. As a result, teams have to be ready to move faster than ever,\" said Francois Ajenstat, chief product officer at Amplitude. \"We want to help anyone embrace experimentation without slowing them down. That's why we created a powerful Web Experimentation product that's easy to adopt, use, and scale. Now, anyone can run effective experiments that lead to better conversion and drive growth.\" \n\nAmplitude Web Experimentation is the latest addition to the company’s integrated digital analytics platform, which helps companies everywhere build better digital products and experiences.

This will enable teams to deliver better customer experiences that increase user satisfaction and ultimately drive business impact. \n\nThe integration of these technologies makes sense given that today Amplitude helps companies understand what users are doing and where they're getting stuck. With Command AI, Amplitude can improve its ability to help those companies actively improve their products and digital experiences in a way that acknowledges the uniqueness of every user. The insights delivered through Amplitude become even more actionable. \n\nCommand AI has built the next generation of digital adoption technology by focusing on the end user experience as well as infusing AI into the product itself. The advanced AI capabilities can proactively nudge or respond to users, which will strengthen the Amplitude platform. Customers will be able to better understand and act on user intent, access insights faster, and offer more tailored user experiences. \n\n\"Innovation is the biggest driver of growth for Amplitude,\" said Spenser Skates, co-founder and CEO of Amplitude. \"We've been incredibly impressed by what the Command AI team has done, particularly in the AI space. We're excited to add their cutting-edge AI capabilities to our market-leading digital analytics platform.\" \n\n\"Everything Command AI does is more powerful when combined with analytics,\" said James Evans, co-founder and CEO of Command AI. \"While software has become more powerful and ubiquitous, most is still ‘one-size-fits-all’ and hard to use—and a lot of what purports to help users actually ends up just annoying them. I’m so excited that together Amplitude and Command AI can build the next generation of user assistance all designed for an AI-driven and product-led world. Our customers will be able to drive user growth, satisfaction, retention, and expansion all from a single platform.\" \n\nAmplitude expects to expand its platform with an experience that integrates Command AI's flagship capabilities early next year, including: \n\n  * **Guides and Product Tours:** Introduce users to your app or website in a step-by-step, interactive, and digestible way. \n  * **Announcements:** Use smart triggers to share product updates, event invites, and special offers with users who will actually care. \n  * **Surveys:** Engage users, get deeper feedback, and generate insights about their experience in real-time. \n  * **Checklists:** Help new users get up and running faster with a personalized action plan. \n\n\n\nThe Command AI team will join Amplitude and continue to serve its current customers as it integrates with the Amplitude platform.

Refer to the “Forward-Looking Statements” section below for information on the factors that could cause Amplitude’s actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements. \n\nFor the fourth quarter and full year 2024, the Company expects: \n\n**Fourth Quarter 2024** |  **Full Year 2024**  \n---|---  \nRevenue  |  $76.0 - $77.0 million |  $297.1 - $298.1 million  \nNon-GAAP Operating Income (Loss)  |  $(2.1) - $(0.1) million |  $(6.3) - $(4.3) million  \nNon-GAAP Net Income (Loss) Per Share  |  $0.00 - $0.01 |  $0.04 - $0.06  \nWeighted Average Shares Outstanding  |  134.9 million, diluted  |  131.7 million, diluted   \n  \nAn outlook for GAAP income (loss) from operations, GAAP net income (loss), GAAP net income (loss) per share and a reconciliation of expected non-GAAP income (loss) from operations to GAAP income (loss) from operations, expected non-GAAP net income (loss) to GAAP net income (loss), and expected non-GAAP net income (loss) per share to GAAP net income (loss) per share have not been provided as the quantification of certain items included in the calculation of GAAP income (loss) from operations, GAAP net income (loss) and GAAP net income (loss) per share cannot be reasonably calculated or predicted at this time without unreasonable efforts. For example, the non-GAAP adjustment for stock-based compensation expense requires additional inputs such as the number and value of awards granted that are not currently ascertainable, and the non-GAAP adjustment for amortization of acquired intangible assets depends on the timing and value of intangible assets acquired that cannot be accurately forecasted. \n\n**Conference Call Information:**\n\nAmplitude will host a live video webcast to discuss its financial results for its third quarter ended September 30, 2024, as well as the financial outlook for its fourth quarter and full year 2024 today at 2:00 PM Pacific Time / 5:00 PM Eastern Time. Interested parties may access the webcast, earnings press release, and investor presentation on the events section of Amplitude’s investor relations website at [investors.amplitude.com](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Finvestors.amplitude.com%2F&esheet=54148531&newsitemid=20241106366553&lan=en-US&anchor=investors.amplitude.com&index=2&md5=1e591b8802e2bd198437fadd442c0336). A replay will be available in the same location a few hours after the conclusion of the live webcast. \n\n**Forward-Looking Statements:**\n\nThis press release contains express and implied \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including statements regarding the Company’s financial outlook for the fourth quarter and full year 2024, the Company’s growth strategy and business aspirations and its market position and market opportunity. These statements are often, but not always, made through the use of words or phrases such as “may,” “should,” “could,” “predict,” “potential,” “believe,” “expect,” “continue,” “will,” “anticipate,” “seek,” “estimate,” “intend,” “plan,” “projection,” “would,” and “outlook,” or the negative version of those words or phrases or other comparable words or phrases of a future or forward-looking nature. These forward-looking statements are not statements of historical fact, and are based on current expectations, estimates, and projections about the Company’s industry as well as certain assumptions made by management, many of which, by their nature, are inherently uncertain and beyond the Company’s control. These statements are subject to numerous uncertainties and risks that could cause actual results, performance, or achievement to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated or implied in the statements, including risks related to: the Company’s limited operating history and rapid growth over the last several years, which makes it difficult to forecast the Company’s future results of operations; the Company’s history of losses; any decline in the Company’s customer retention or expansion of its commercial relationships with existing customers or an inability to attract new customers; expected fluctuations in the Company’s financial results, making it difficult to project future results; the Company’s focus on sales to larger organizations and potentially increased dependency on those relationships, which may increase the variability of the Company’s sales cycles and results of operations; downturns or upturns in new sales, which may not be immediately reflected in the Company’s results of operations and may be difficult to discern; unfavorable conditions in the Company’s industry or the global economy, or reductions in information technology spending, which could limit the Company’s ability to grow its business; the market for SaaS applications, which may develop more slowly than the Company expects or decline; the Company’s intellectual property rights, which may not protect its business or provide the Company with a competitive advantage; evolving privacy and other data-related laws; and the impact of new sanctions related to Russia on the Company’s ability to collect receivables. Additional risks and uncertainties that could cause actual outcomes and results to differ materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements are or will be included under the caption \"Risk Factors\" and elsewhere in the reports and other documents that the Company files with the Securities and Exchange Commission from time to time, including the Company’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q being filed at or around the date hereof. The forward-looking statements made in this press release relate only to events as of the date on which the statements are made. The Company undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements made in this press release to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this press release or to reflect new information or the occurrence of unanticipated events, except as required by law. \n\n**Non-GAAP Financial Measures:**\n\nThis press release includes financial information that has not been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The Company uses non-GAAP financial measures internally in analyzing its financial results and believes they are useful to investors, as a supplement to GAAP measures, in evaluating the Company’s ongoing operational performance. The Company believes that the use of these non-GAAP financial measures provides an additional tool for investors to use in evaluating ongoing operating results and trends and in comparing the Company’s financial results with other companies in the industry, many of which present similar non-GAAP financial measures to investors. There are a number of limitations related to the use of non-GAAP financial measures versus comparable financial measures determined under GAAP. For example, other companies in the Company’s industry may calculate these non-GAAP financial measures differently or may use other measures to evaluate their performance. In addition, Free Cash Flow does not reflect the Company’s future contractual commitments and the total increase or decrease of its cash balance for a given period. \n\nNon-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of the Company’s non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures has been provided in the financial statement tables included below in this press release. Investors are encouraged to review the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures below. \n\n**Non-GAAP Gross Profit, Non-GAAP Gross Margin, Non-GAAP Operating Expenses, Non-GAAP Income (Loss) from Operations, Non-GAAP Operating Margin, Non-GAAP Net Income (Loss), and Non-GAAP Net Income (Loss) per Share:**\n\nThe Company defines these non-GAAP financial measures as their respective GAAP measures, excluding expenses related to stock-based compensation expense and related employer payroll taxes, amortization of acquired intangible assets, and non-recurring costs such as restructuring and other related charges. The Company excludes stock-based compensation expense and related employer payroll taxes, which is a non-cash expense, from certain of its non-GAAP financial measures because it believes that excluding this item provides meaningful supplemental information regarding operational performance. The Company excludes amortization of intangible assets, which is a non-cash expense, related to business combinations from certain of its non-GAAP financial measures because such expenses are related to business combinations and have no direct correlation to the operation of the Company’s business. Although the Company excludes these expenses from certain non-GAAP financial measures, the revenue from acquired companies subsequent to the date of acquisition is reflected in these measures and the acquired intangible assets contribute to the Company’s revenue generation. The Company excludes non-recurring costs from certain of its non-GAAP financial measures because such expenses do not repeat period over period and are not reflective of the ongoing operation of the Company’s business. \n\nThe Company uses non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP income (loss) from operations, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP net income (loss), and non-GAAP net income (loss) per share in conjunction with its traditional GAAP measures to evaluate the Company’s financial performance. The Company believes that these measures provide its management, board of directors, and investors consistency and comparability with its past financial performance and facilitates period-to-period comparisons of operations. \n\n**Free Cash Flow and Free Cash Flow Margin****:**\n\nThe Company defines Free Cash Flow as net cash provided by (used in) operating activities, less cash used for purchases of property and equipment and capitalized internal-use software costs. Free Cash Flow margin is calculated as Free Cash Flow divided by total revenue. The Company believes that Free Cash Flow and Free Cash Flow margin are useful indicators of liquidity that provides its management, board of directors, and investors with information about its future ability to generate or use cash to enhance the strength of its balance sheet and further invest in its business and pursue potential strategic initiatives. \n\n**Definitions of Business Metrics:**\n\n_Annual Recurring Revenue_\n\nTheCompany defines Annual Recurring Revenue (“ARR”) as the annual recurring revenue of subscription agreements, including certain premium professional services that are subject to contractual subscription terms, at a point in time based on the terms of customers’ contracts. ARR should be viewed independently of revenue, and does not represent the Company’s GAAP revenue on an annualized basis, as it is an operating metric that can be impacted by contract start and end dates and renewal rates. ARR is also not intended to be a forecast of revenue. \n\n_Dollar-Based Net Retention Rate_\n\nThe Company calculates dollar-based net retention rate as of a period end by starting with the ARR from the cohort of all customers as of 12 months prior to such period-end (the “Prior Period ARR”). The Company then calculates the ARR from these same customers as of the current period-end (the “Current Period ARR”). Current Period ARR includes any expansion and is net of contraction or attrition over the last 12 months, but excludes ARR from new customers as well as any overage charges in the current period. The Company then divides the total Current Period ARR by the total Prior Period ARR to arrive at the dollar-based net retention rate (\"NRR\"). The Company then calculates the weighted average of the trailing 12-month dollar-based net retention rates, to arrive at the trailing 12-month dollar-based net retention rate (“NRR (TTM)”). \n\n_Paying Customers_\n\nFor purposes of customer count, a customer is defined as an entity that has a unique Dunn & Bradstreet Global Ultimate (“GULT”) Data Universal Numbering System (“DUNS”) number and an active subscription contract as of the measurement date. The DUNS number is a global standard for business identification and tracking. The Company makes exceptions for holding companies, government entities, and other organizations for which the GULT, in the Company’s judgment, does not accurately represent the Amplitude customer or the DUNS does not exist. \n\n**About Amplitude**\n\nAmplitude is the leading digital analytics platform that helps companies unlock the power of their products.
