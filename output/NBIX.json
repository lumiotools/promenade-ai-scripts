Inc.](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4296736-1&h=3441742682&u=https%3A%2F%2Fc212.net%2Fc%2Flink%2F%3Ft%3D0%26l%3Den%26o%3D4296736-1%26h%3D2148656286%26u%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.neurocrine.com%252F%26a%3DNeurocrine%2BBiosciences%252C%2BInc.&a=Neurocrine+Biosciences%2C+Inc.) (Nasdaq: NBIX) today presented subgroup analyses and data from the KINECT®-HD study showing the impact of [INGREZZA® (valbenazine) capsules](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4296736-1&h=1029406521&u=https%3A%2F%2Fc212.net%2Fc%2Flink%2F%3Ft%3D0%26l%3Den%26o%3D4296736-1%26h%3D1730099996%26u%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.ingrezza.com%252F%26a%3DINGREZZA%25C2%25AE%2B\\(valbenazine\\)%2Bcapsules&a=INGREZZA%C2%AE+\\(valbenazine\\)+capsules) on emotional health and psychiatric stability in patients with chorea associated with Huntington's disease. The subgroup analysis showed consistent efficacy in reducing chorea compared to placebo across all identified subgroups, categorized by demographics and baseline assessment scores. A separate data analysis showed improvements in some aspects of emotional health with no worsening of psychiatric symptoms. This research will be shared at the 2024 Annual Meeting of the Huntington Study Group in Cincinnati.\n\n[ ![\\(PRNewsfoto/Neurocrine Biosciences, Inc.\\)](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/678850/Neurocrine_Biosciences_Logo.jpg) ](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/678850/Neurocrine_Biosciences_Logo.html)\n\n\"In addition to physical symptoms, Huntington's disease significantly affects emotional and psychological health, often leading to increased anxiety and irritability or anger,\" said Eiry W. Roberts, M.D., Chief Medical Officer, Neurocrine Biosciences. \"These data not only support the consistent efficacy of INGREZZA in reducing chorea across various subgroups but also its potential positive impact on emotional health in patients because of the reduced movements.\"\n\n_Efficacy of Valbenazine for Chorea Associated with Huntington's Disease: Subgroup Analyses of KINECT ®-HD Results _\n\nThis analysis was conducted to assess the effects of INGREZZA (n=64) versus placebo (n=61) in subgroups of participants from the Phase 3 KINECT-HD study using the Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Scale (UHDRS®) Total Maximal Chorea (TMC) score. Participants in the study were randomized 1:1 to receive placebo or INGREZZA, with a starting dose of 40 mg that was increased up to 80 mg over an 8-week period as tolerated, for a total treatment period of 12 weeks. In the full analysis set, least-squares mean (LSM) changes for TMC score indicated significantly greater chorea improvements for INGREZZA versus placebo, with an LSM difference at maintenance of -3.2 (95% confidence interval (CI): -4.4 to -2.0; _P_ < 0.0001). To further assess INGREZZA efficacy, TMC changes were analyzed in subgroups categorized by demographics (sex, age and body mass index) and baseline assessment scores (Clinical Global Impression of Severity, Patient Global Impression of Severity, Anosognosia Scale, UHDRS Total Functional Capacity, UHDRS Total Motor Score and UHDRS TMC).\n\nTMC changes favored INGREZZA over placebo in all 19 subgroups, with the LSM difference (LSMD; 95% CI) ranging from -4.5 (-6.6 to -2.4) to -1.6 (-4.1 to 0.8). The 95% CIs for all subgroup LSMDs encompassed the primary endpoint LSMD of -3.2.\n\n_Effects of Valbenazine on Emotional Health and Psychiatric Stability in Adults with Huntington's Disease _\n\nThis separate post hoc analysis of the Phase 3 KINECT-HD study was conducted to evaluate emotional health and psychiatric stability in participants taking INGREZZA (n=64) or placebo (n=61) utilizing the Huntington's Disease Health Index (HD-HI) Emotional Health subscale. Mean score changes from baseline (CFB) to Week 10 and Week 12 were analyzed in \"affected\" participants (those with a baseline item score of at least 2). Safety assessments included adverse events of special interest (AESIs), the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS).\n\nResults showed that some aspects of emotional health appeared to improve with INGREZZA in affected participants. The largest score changes with INGREZZA compared to placebo at Week 12 were:\n\n  * Anger: -1.7 (INGREZZA; n=17) versus -0.2 (placebo; n=22)\n  * Feeling of being overwhelmed: -1.7 (n=20) versus -0.4 (n=27)\n  * Fluctuating mood: -1.5 (n=15) versus -0.4 (n=23)\n  * Reduced enjoyment with activities: -1.5 (n=25) versus -0.4 (n=26)\n  * Emotional outbursts: -1.5 (n=15) versus -0.6 (n=23)\n  * Frustration: -1.3 (n=25) versus -0.4 (n=28)\n  * Anxiety: -1.4 (n=25) versus -0.5 (n=30)\n\n\n\nIn the safety population (N=127), 5 participants (3 INGREZZA, 2 placebo) reported AESIs related to depression or suicidal ideation. HADS and C-SSRS shifts from baseline indicated no worsening in anxiety symptoms, depression symptoms or suicidal ideation with INGREZZA.\n\n**Additional Neurocrine Biosciences posters presented at the 2024 Annual Meeting of the Huntington Study Group include:**\n\n  * Huntington's Disease Health Index (HD-HI) Correlations with Clinical Measures: An Analysis of KINECT®-HD Baseline Data\n  * Somnolence-Related Events Over Time with Valbenazine Treatment for Chorea Associated with Huntington's Disease\n  * Efficacy of Once-Daily Valbenazine in Adults with Chorea Associated with Huntington's Disease: Effect Size Over Time\n\n\n\n**About Chorea Associated with Huntington's Disease (HD)** Huntington's disease (HD) is a hereditary progressive neurodegenerative disorder in which the loss of certain neurons within the brain causes motor, cognitive and psychiatric symptoms. Symptoms generally appear between the ages of 30 and 50 years and worsen over a 10- to 25-year period. Most people with HD experience chorea, an abnormal involuntary movement disorder, characterized by irregular and unpredictable movements. Chorea can affect various body parts and interfere with motor coordination, gait, swallowing and speech. HD is estimated to affect approximately 41,000 adults in the U.S., with more than 200,000 at risk of inheriting the disease.\n\n**About KINECT ®-HD**KINECT®-HD was a Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study designed to evaluate the efficacy of valbenazine as a once-daily treatment to reduce chorea associated with Huntington's disease (HD) and evaluate the safety and tolerability of valbenazine in patients with HD. The study enrolled 128 adults 18 to 75 years of age who were diagnosed with motor-manifest HD and who had sufficient chorea symptoms to meet study protocol criteria.\n\nKINECT-HD used the Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Scale (UHDRS®) Total Maximal Chorea (TMC) score as the primary efficacy endpoint. The secondary endpoints included Clinical Global Impression of Change (CGI-C) response status and Patient Global Impression of Change (PGI-C) response status for valbenazine treatment. Treatment with valbenazine resulted in a placebo-adjusted mean reduction in the TMC score of 3.2 units (_P_ < 0.0001), indicating a substantial improvement in chorea. Secondary endpoints of CGI-C response status and PGI-C response status were also statistically significant and supported the improvements in TMC score that were seen over the 12-week study period.\n\nTreatment-emergent adverse events in this study were generally consistent with the known safety profile of valbenazine. The most common adverse reactions in patients with HD included somnolence and sedation, urticaria, rash and insomnia.\n\nView the complete study results from the Phase 3 KINECT-HD study published in  _The Lancet Neurology_ [online edition](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4296736-1&h=3256947305&u=https%3A%2F%2Fc212.net%2Fc%2Flink%2F%3Ft%3D0%26l%3Den%26o%3D4008219-1%26h%3D1855037865%26u%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fc212.net%252Fc%252Flink%252F%253Ft%253D0%2526l%253Den%2526o%253D3953154-1%2526h%253D1410081926%2526u%253Dhttps%25253A%25252F%25252Fwww.thelancet.com%25252Fjournals%25252Flaneur%25252Farticle%25252FPIIS1474-4422\\(23\\)00127-8%25252Ffulltext%2526a%253Donline%252Bedition%26a%3Donline%2Bedition&a=online+edition).

Only INGREZZA offers a therapeutic dose from day one with no required titration.\n\nINGREZZA, developed by Neurocrine Biosciences, selectively inhibits VMAT2 with no appreciable binding affinity for VMAT1, dopaminergic (including D2), serotonergic, adrenergic, histaminergic or muscarinic receptors. While the specific way INGREZZA works to treat TD and HD chorea is not fully understood, INGREZZA is unique in that it selectively and specifically targets VMAT2 to inhibit the release of dopamine, a chemical in the brain that helps control movement. INGREZZA is believed to reduce extra dopamine signaling, which may lead to fewer uncontrollable movements.\n\nINGREZZA is always one capsule, once daily and can be taken together with most stable mental health regimens such as antipsychotics or antidepressants. Only INGREZZA offers the benefit of a sprinkle formulation, INGREZZA® SPRINKLE, for those who experience dysphagia, have difficulty swallowing or prefer not to swallow a pill. INGREZZA and INGREZZA SPRINKLE dosages approved for use are 40 mg, 60 mg and 80 mg capsules. \n\n**Important Information****Approved Uses** INGREZZA® (valbenazine) capsules or INGREZZA® SPRINKLE (valbenazine) capsules are prescription medicines used to treat adults with:\n\n  * movements in the face, tongue, or other body parts that cannot be controlled (tardive dyskinesia). \n  * involuntary movements (chorea) of Huntington's disease. INGREZZA or INGREZZA SPRINKLE do not cure the cause of involuntary movements, and do not treat other symptoms of Huntington's disease, such as problems with thinking or emotions.\n\n\n\nIt is not known if INGREZZA or INGREZZA SPRINKLE is safe and effective in children.\n\n**IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION**\n\n**INGREZZA or INGREZZA SPRINKLE can cause serious side effects in people with Huntington's disease, including: depression, suicidal thoughts, or suicidal actions.** Tell your healthcare provider before you start taking INGREZZA or INGREZZA SPRINKLE if you have Huntington's disease and are depressed (have untreated depression or depression that is not well controlled by medicine) or have suicidal thoughts. Pay close attention to any changes, especially sudden changes, in mood, behaviors, thoughts, or feelings. This is especially important when INGREZZA or INGREZZA SPRINKLE is started and when the dose is changed. Call your healthcare provider right away if you become depressed, have unusual changes in mood or behavior, or have thoughts of hurting yourself.\n\n**Do not take INGREZZA or INGREZZA SPRINKLE if you:**\n\n  * are allergic to valbenazine, or any of the ingredients in INGREZZA or INGREZZA SPRINKLE.\n\n\n\n**INGREZZA or INGREZZA SPRINKLE can cause serious side effects, including:**\n\n  * **Allergic reactions.** Allergic reactions, including an allergic reaction that causes sudden swelling called angioedema can happen after taking the first dose or after many doses of INGREZZA or INGREZZA SPRINKLE. Signs and symptoms of allergic reactions and angioedema include: trouble breathing or shortness of breath, swelling of your face, lips, eyelids, tongue, or throat, or other areas of your skin, trouble with swallowing, or rash, including raised, itchy red areas on your skin (hives). Swelling in the throat can be life-threatening and can lead to death. Stop taking INGREZZA or INGREZZA SPRINKLE and go to the nearest emergency room right away if you develop these signs and symptoms of allergic reactions and angioedema. \n  * **Sleepiness and tiredness that could cause slow reaction times (somnolence and sedation).** Do not drive a car or operate dangerous machinery until you know how INGREZZA or INGREZZA SPRINKLE affects you. Drinking alcohol and taking other medicines may also cause sleepiness during treatment with INGREZZA or INGREZZA SPRINKLE. \n  * **Heart rhythm problems (QT prolongation).** INGREZZA or INGREZZA SPRINKLE may cause a heart rhythm problem known as QT prolongation. You have a higher chance of getting QT prolongation if you also take certain other medicines during treatment with INGREZZA or INGREZZA SPRINKLE. Tell your healthcare provider right away if you develop any signs or symptoms of QT prolongation, including: fast, slow, or irregular heartbeat (heart palpitations), shortness of breath, dizziness or lightheadedness, or fainting or feeling like you are going to faint. \n  * **Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS).** NMS is a serious condition that can lead to death. Call a healthcare provider right away or go to the nearest emergency room if you develop these symptoms and they do not have another obvious cause: high fever, stiff muscles, problems thinking, irregular pulse or blood pressure, increased sweating, or very fast or uneven heartbeat. \n  * **Parkinson-like symptoms.** Symptoms include: body stiffness, drooling, trouble moving or walking, trouble keeping your balance, shaking (tremors), or falls.\n\n\n\n**Before taking INGREZZA or INGREZZA SPRINKLE, tell your healthcare provider about all of your medical conditions including if you:** have liver or heart problems, are pregnant or plan to become pregnant, or are breastfeeding or plan to breastfeed. \n\n**Tell your healthcare provider about all the medicines you take,** including prescription and over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements. Make sure you tell all of your healthcare providers that you are taking INGREZZA or INGREZZA SPRINKLE. Taking INGREZZA or INGREZZA SPRINKLE with certain other medicines may cause serious side effects. Especially tell your healthcare provider if you: take digoxin or take or have taken a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) medicine. You should not take INGREZZA or INGREZZA SPRINKLE if you are taking, or have stopped taking, a MAOI within the last 14 days.\n\n**The most common side effect of INGREZZA or INGREZZA SPRINKLE in people with tardive dyskinesia** **are** sleepiness and tiredness.\n\n**The most common side effects of INGREZZA or INGREZZA SPRINKLE in people with chorea associated with Huntington's disease include** sleepiness and tiredness, raised itchy red areas on your skin (hives), rash, and trouble getting to sleep or staying asleep.\n\nThese are not all of the possible side effects of INGREZZA or INGREZZA SPRINKLE.

Presents Breadth of Data Demonstrating Holistic Improvements Over Time in Patients With Tardive Dyskinesia Following Treatment With INGREZZA® (valbenazine) Capsules\n\n11/04/24\n\n[PDF Version](/node/21426/pdf)\n\n  * Findings Presented at the 2024 Psych Congress Include Data From More Than 300 Patients\n\n\n\nSAN DIEGO, Nov. 4, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- [Neurocrine Biosciences, Inc.](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4293250-1&h=504714819&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.neurocrine.com%2F&a=Neurocrine+Biosciences%2C+Inc.) (Nasdaq: NBIX) presented data from more than 300 patients diagnosed with tardive dyskinesia and treated with [INGREZZA® (valbenazine) capsules](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4293250-1&h=4179331521&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ingrezza.com%2F&a=INGREZZA%C2%AE+\\(valbenazine\\)+capsules). These data showed significant improvements in functional, social, emotional and health-related quality of life measures in Phase 3 and 4 studies and improvements in functional, social, independence, emotional and physical aspects of patients' lives and antipsychotic adherence in real-world practice. This research was shared at the 2024 Psych Congress in Boston.\n\n[ ![\\(PRNewsfoto/Neurocrine Biosciences, Inc.\\)](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/678850/Neurocrine_Biosciences_Logo.jpg) ](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/678850/Neurocrine_Biosciences_Logo.html)\n\n\"Tardive dyskinesia can have a profound impact on patients that extends well beyond the physical symptoms caused by the movement disorder, affecting functional, social and emotional aspects of everyday life,\" said Eiry W. Roberts, M.D., Chief Medical Officer, Neurocrine Biosciences. \"These data, taken together across clinical studies and real-world patient charts, are one of the largest efforts to examine and characterize the overall impact of treating tardive dyskinesia with INGREZZA and show significant improvements in measures that are important to patients and clinicians.\"\n\n_Impact of INGREZZA on Function, Socialization and Emotionality in Phase 3 Studies_\n\nThis analysis (Poster #28) was conducted using combined data from 252 patients (n=71 placebo; n=181 INGREZZA) who completed the Phase 3 KINECT®-3 or KINECT®-4 studies. The 11-item Tardive Dyskinesia Impact Scale (TDIS), a validated patient-reported outcome measure, was used to evaluate tardive dyskinesia (TD) symptom impact at baseline through Week 48. TDIS scores range from 0 to 4 for each item, with higher scores indicating greater impact and decreases in scores indicating improvement. \n\nResults showed consistent improvements across all items, suggesting treatment with INGREZZA improved TDIS scores for both physical and socio-emotional domains. \n\n  * The most impacted items at baseline were self-consciousness (mean score: 1.99), embarrassment (1.89), mouth noises (1.80), unwanted attention (1.74) and writing (1.29). \n  * Improvements of 1 point or more from baseline to Week 48 were observed in self-consciousness (mean change -1.24), embarrassment (-1.19) and mouth noises (-1.05). \n  * Unwanted attention (-1.00) and writing (-0.78) also improved considerably. \n\n\n\n_Impact of INGREZZA on Health-Related Quality of Life in Phase 4 Study_\n\nThis analysis (Poster #27) was conducted using data from 127 patients who participated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized withdrawal Phase 4 study. Following an 8-week treatment period, patients were randomly assigned INGREZZA or placebo for an additional 8 weeks. INGREZZA was then withdrawn for a 4-week washout period. Health-related quality of life (HRQOL) was measured using the EQ-5D-5L, which includes 5 dimensions of health status (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression) each scored as: no problems (1); slight problems (2); moderate problems (3); severe problems (4); unable to/extreme problems (5). Lower scores indicate an improvement in health status. A utility index (UI), ranging from 0 to 1, and visual analog scale (VAS), ranging from 0 to 100, were also reported with higher scores indicating better health status.\n\nAt the end of the treatment period (Week 16, n = 56), scores for each dimension and UI and VAS scores improved significantly, while scores returned to or were near baseline after the washout period (Week 20):\n\n**Measure** |  **Baseline Score** |  **Week 16 Score**  \n---|---|---  \n_Dimensions_  \nMobility  |  1.91 |  1.57  \nSelf-care |  1.69 |  1.34  \nUsual activities |  1.98 |  1.59  \nPain/discomfort  |  2.15 |  1.70  \nAnxiety/depression |  2.03 |  1.80  \n_UI_ |  0.68 |  0.80  \n_VAS_ |  73.82 |  79.57  \n  \n_Real-World_ _Functional, Social, Independence, Emotional, Physical and Antipsychotic Adherence_ _Improvements With INGREZZA_\n\nA web-based survey and chart extraction (Poster #29) was conducted among U.S. physicians, nurse practitioners and physician assistants. Participants characterized the burden of diagnosed TD and improvement following at least two months of treatment with INGREZZA with at least one follow-up visit. This interim analysis included 78 clinicians caring for 164 patients. Most patients (82.9%) had mild to moderate TD severity, while 12.2% had severe TD.\n\nAt the time of the survey, nearly all patients (93.9%) had experienced TD improvement after starting INGREZZA, irrespective of TD severity.\n\n  * TD had an impact on functional ability in 95.1% of patients, with the most commonly impacted areas being emotionality, socialization, activities of daily living and mouth/throat function.\n  * Among those impacted (n = 156), 94.2% improved in overall functional status.\n  * 87.8% of all patients experienced improvement in independence.\n  * For those with available information on antipsychotic adherence (n = 115), more than half (52.2%) experienced improved adherence.\n\n\n\n**Additional Neurocrine Biosciences posters presented at Psych Congress 2024 include:**\n\n  * Remission of Tardive Dyskinesia in Patients Receiving Long-Term Valbenazine Treatment (Poster #98)\n  * Once-Daily Valbenazine for Tardive Dyskinesia or Huntington's Disease Chorea in Patients with Dysphagia or Swallowing Difficulties (Poster #114)\n  * A Multi-Year Survey on United States Psychiatry Clinicians: Trends on Managing Patients with Tardive Dyskinesia (Poster #48)\n  * Treatment Effect Sizes of Once-Daily Valbenazine for Tardive Dyskinesia and for Chorea Associated with Huntington's Disease: A Post Hoc Analysis of Phase 3 Clinical Trial Data (Poster #44)\n\n\n\n**About the KINECT** ®-**3 Phase 3 Study** KINECT-3 is a Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, fixed-dose study, in which 234 participants with moderate to severe TD and underlying schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder or mood disorder (including bipolar disorder or major depressive disorder) received six weeks of once-daily INGREZZA (40 mg or 80 mg capsules) or placebo (participants randomized to 80 mg started on 40 mg for 1 week). Subsequent to the completion of the six-week placebo-controlled dosing, participants receiving INGREZZA continued on their current dose and placebo participants were randomized to receive either once-daily 40 mg or once-daily 80 mg of INGREZZA, through week 48 (42-week blinded treatment extension period; placebo participants randomized to 80 mg started on 40 mg for 1 week), followed by a four-week drug-free washout. Dose reduction to 40 mg was allowed for participants who were unable to tolerate the 80 mg dose. Patients were discontinued if the new dose was not tolerated.\n\nThe study met its primary endpoint of change-from-baseline in AIMS at week six in the 80 mg once-daily dosing group compared to placebo as assessed by expert central blinded video raters. The mean change from baseline to week six in the AIMS rating was -3.2 for the 80 mg once-daily group as compared to -0.1 in the placebo group (P>0.0001). Sustained TD improvements were seen with INGREZZA 40 mg and 80 mg through week 48.\n\nINGREZZA was generally well tolerated throughout 48 weeks of treatment. The most common adverse reactions (≥ five percent and twice the rate of placebo) during the six-week double-blind, placebo-controlled phase was somnolence with the frequency of adverse events being similar among all treatment groups. Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were consistent with those of prior studies. There were no drug-drug interactions identified in participants who were utilizing a wide range of psychotropic and other concomitant medications, and participants generally remained psychiatrically stable throughout the study.\n\n**About the KINECT** ®**-4 Phase 3 Study** KINECT-4 is a Phase 3, open-label study, in which 163 participants with moderate to severe TD and underlying schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder or mood disorder (including bipolar disorder or major depressive disorder) received 48 weeks of open-label treatment with once-daily INGREZZA (40 mg or 80 mg capsules) followed by a four-week washout. Dosing was initiated at 40 mg/day in all participants, with escalation to 80 mg/day at Week 4 based on effectiveness and tolerability. Dose reduction to 40 mg was allowed in participants who could not tolerate the 80 mg dose. Patients were discontinued if the new dose was not tolerated.\n\nParticipants experienced TD improvements during long-term treatment as demonstrated by mean change from baseline to Week 48 in AIMS total score (sum of items 1-7, evaluated by site raters) with INGREZZA 40 mg/day (-10.2) or 80 mg/day (-11.0). Consistent with previous studies, INGREZZA was generally well tolerated. After Week 4, treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) that occurred in ≥5% of all participants (combined dose groups) were urinary tract infection (8.5%) and headache (5.2%). Changes from baseline in psychiatric stability, vital signs, electrocardiogram parameters and laboratory test values were generally small and not clinically significant.\n\n**About Tardive Dyskinesia (TD)** Tardive dyskinesia (TD) is a movement disorder that is characterized by uncontrollable, abnormal and repetitive movements of the face, torso and/or other body parts, which may be disruptive and negatively impact patients. The condition is associated with taking certain kinds of mental health medicines (antipsychotics) that help control dopamine receptors in the brain. Taking antipsychotics commonly prescribed to treat mental illnesses such as major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder and other prescription medicines (metoclopramide and prochlorperazine) used to treat gastrointestinal disorders are associated with TD. In patients with TD, these treatments are thought to result in irregular dopamine signaling in a region of the brain that controls movement. The symptoms of TD can be severe and are often persistent and irreversible. TD is estimated to affect approximately 800,000 people in the U.S.\n\n**About Chorea Associated with Huntington's Disease (HD)** Huntington's disease (HD) is a hereditary progressive neurodegenerative disorder in which the loss of certain neurons within the brain causes motor, cognitive and psychiatric symptoms. Symptoms generally appear between the ages of 30 and 50 years and worsen over a 10- to 25-year period. Most people with HD experience chorea, an abnormal involuntary movement disorder, characterized by irregular and unpredictable movements. Chorea can affect various body parts and interfere with motor coordination, gait, swallowing and speech. HD is estimated to affect approximately 41,000 adults in the U.S., with more than 200,000 at risk of inheriting the disease.\n\n**About INGREZZA ® (valbenazine) Capsules and INGREZZA® SPRINKLE (valbenazine) Capsules**INGREZZA is a selective vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2) inhibitor approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of adults with tardive dyskinesia and the treatment of chorea associated with Huntington's disease (HD). Only INGREZZA offers a therapeutic dose from day one with no required titration.\n\nINGREZZA, developed by Neurocrine Biosciences, selectively inhibits VMAT2 with no appreciable binding affinity for VMAT1, dopaminergic (including D2), serotonergic, adrenergic, histaminergic or muscarinic receptors. While the specific way INGREZZA works to treat TD and HD chorea is not fully understood, INGREZZA is unique in that it selectively and specifically targets VMAT2 to inhibit the release of dopamine, a chemical in the brain that helps control movement. INGREZZA is believed to reduce extra dopamine signaling, which may lead to fewer uncontrollable movements.\n\nINGREZZA is always one capsule, once daily and can be taken together with most stable mental health regimens such as antipsychotics or antidepressants. Only INGREZZA offers the benefit of a sprinkle formulation, INGREZZA® SPRINKLE, for those who experience dysphagia, have difficulty swallowing or prefer not to swallow a pill. INGREZZA and INGREZZA SPRINKLE dosages approved for use are 40 mg, 60 mg and 80 mg capsules.\n\n**Important Information**\n\n**Approved Uses**\n\nINGREZZA® (valbenazine) capsules or INGREZZA® SPRINKLE (valbenazine) capsules are prescription medicines used to treat adults with:\n\n  * movements in the face, tongue, or other body parts that cannot be controlled (tardive dyskinesia).\n  * involuntary movements (chorea) of Huntington's disease. INGREZZA or INGREZZA SPRINKLE do not cure the cause of involuntary movements, and do not treat other symptoms of Huntington's disease, such as problems with thinking or emotions.\n\n\n\nIt is not known if INGREZZA or INGREZZA SPRINKLE is safe and effective in children.\n\n**IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION**\n\n**INGREZZA or INGREZZA SPRINKLE can cause serious side effects in people with Huntington's disease, including: depression, suicidal thoughts, or suicidal actions.** Tell your healthcare provider before you start taking INGREZZA or INGREZZA SPRINKLE if you have Huntington's disease and are depressed (have untreated depression or depression that is not well controlled by medicine) or have suicidal thoughts. Pay close attention to any changes, especially sudden changes, in mood, behaviors, thoughts, or feelings. This is especially important when INGREZZA or INGREZZA SPRINKLE is started and when the dose is changed. Call your healthcare provider right away if you become depressed, have unusual changes in mood or behavior, or have thoughts of hurting yourself.\n\n**Do not take INGREZZA or INGREZZA SPRINKLE if you:**\n\n  * are allergic to valbenazine, or any of the ingredients in INGREZZA or INGREZZA SPRINKLE.\n\n\n\n**INGREZZA or INGREZZA SPRINKLE can cause serious side effects, including:**\n\n  * **Allergic reactions.** Allergic reactions, including an allergic reaction that causes sudden swelling called angioedema can happen after taking the first dose or after many doses of INGREZZA or INGREZZA SPRINKLE. Signs and symptoms of allergic reactions and angioedema include: trouble breathing or shortness of breath, swelling of your face, lips, eyelids, tongue, or throat, or other areas of your skin, trouble with swallowing, or rash, including raised, itchy red areas on your skin (hives). Swelling in the throat can be life-threatening and can lead to death. Stop taking INGREZZA or INGREZZA SPRINKLE and go to the nearest emergency room right away if you develop these signs and symptoms of allergic reactions and angioedema.\n  * **Sleepiness and tiredness that could cause slow reaction times (somnolence and sedation).** Do not drive a car or operate dangerous machinery until you know how INGREZZA or INGREZZA SPRINKLE affects you. Drinking alcohol and taking other medicines may also cause sleepiness during treatment with INGREZZA or INGREZZA SPRINKLE.\n  * **Heart rhythm problems (QT prolongation).** INGREZZA or INGREZZA SPRINKLE may cause a heart rhythm problem known as QT prolongation. You have a higher chance of getting QT prolongation if you also take certain other medicines during treatment with INGREZZA or INGREZZA SPRINKLE. Tell your healthcare provider right away if you develop any signs or symptoms of QT prolongation, including: fast, slow, or irregular heartbeat (heart palpitations), shortness of breath, dizziness or lightheadedness, or fainting or feeling like you are going to faint.\n  * **Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS).** NMS is a serious condition that can lead to death. Call a healthcare provider right away or go to the nearest emergency room if you develop these symptoms and they do not have another obvious cause: high fever, stiff muscles, problems thinking, irregular pulse or blood pressure, increased sweating, or very fast or uneven heartbeat.\n  * **Parkinson-like symptoms.** Symptoms include: body stiffness, drooling, trouble moving or walking, trouble keeping your balance, shaking (tremors), or falls.\n\n\n\n**Before taking INGREZZA or INGREZZA SPRINKLE, tell your healthcare provider about all of your medical conditions including if you:** have liver or heart problems, are pregnant or plan to become pregnant, or are breastfeeding or plan to breastfeed. \n\n**Tell your healthcare provider about all the medicines you take,** including prescription and over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements. Make sure you tell all of your healthcare providers that you are taking INGREZZA or INGREZZA SPRINKLE. Taking INGREZZA or INGREZZA SPRINKLE with certain other medicines may cause serious side effects. Especially tell your healthcare provider if you: take digoxin or take or have taken a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) medicine. You should not take INGREZZA or INGREZZA SPRINKLE if you are taking, or have stopped taking, a MAOI within the last 14 days.\n\n**The most common side effect of INGREZZA or INGREZZA SPRINKLE in people with tardive dyskinesia** **are** sleepiness and tiredness.\n\n**The most common side effects of INGREZZA or INGREZZA SPRINKLE in people with chorea associated with Huntington's disease include **sleepiness and tiredness, raised itchy red areas on your skin (hives), rash, and trouble getting to sleep or staying asleep.\n\nThese are not all of the possible side effects of INGREZZA or INGREZZA SPRINKLE.

Presents New Data on INGREZZA® (valbenazine) Capsules at Psych Congress 2024: Majority of Long-Term Study Participants Achieved Remission of Tardive Dyskinesia\n\n11/04/24\n\n[PDF Version](/node/21421/pdf)\n\nSAN DIEGO, Nov. 4, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- [Neurocrine Biosciences, Inc.](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4293245-1&h=4108826222&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.neurocrine.com%2F&a=Neurocrine+Biosciences%2C+Inc.) (Nasdaq: NBIX) presented data from the long-term KINECT®-4 study demonstrating tardive dyskinesia remission in nearly 60% of participants at Week 48 with once-daily [INGREZZA® (valbenazine) capsules ](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4293245-1&h=1054231918&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ingrezza.com%2F&a=INGREZZA%C2%AE+\\(valbenazine\\)+capsules+)treatment. This research, \"Remission of Tardive Dyskinesia in Patients Receiving Long-Term Valbenazine Treatment\" (Poster #98), was shared at the 2024 Psych Congress in Boston.\n\n[ ![\\(PRNewsfoto/Neurocrine Biosciences, Inc.\\)](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/678850/Neurocrine_Biosciences_Logo.jpg) ](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/678850/Neurocrine_Biosciences_Logo.html)\n\n\"Tardive dyskinesia is persistent and irreversible, and effective treatment over time can have a positive impact for patients who are already living with underlying psychotic and mood disorders,\" said Eiry W. Roberts, M.D., Chief Medical Officer, Neurocrine Biosciences. \"Our clinical studies have shown clinically meaningful and sustained improvement in tardive dyskinesia with INGREZZA, and these remission data add to the body of evidence characterizing the robust impact of INGREZZA treatment.\"\n\nThis post hoc analysis was conducted using data from 103 participants who reached the final Week 48 visit in the open-label KINECT-4 clinical trial.\n\nRemission was defined as having a score of 1 or less (rating of \"none\" or \"minimal\") in each body region (items 1-7) on the Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS). Shifts to remission were defined as a maximum item score of 2 (\"mild\"), 3 (\"moderate\") or 4 (\"severe\") at baseline and each item score of 1 or less at Week 48. \n\nTreatment with INGREZZA resulted in tardive dyskinesia (TD) symptom remission for the majority of patients at Week 48:\n\n  * 59.2% (61/103) of participants had a score of 1 or less in each AIMS item.\n    * 65.0% (13/20) of participants in the 40 mg dose group and 57.8% (48/83) of participants in the 80 mg dose group met this remission threshold.\n  * 10% (10/103) of participants had complete resolution, with a total AIMS score of 0.\n  * Of the 4 participants with a maximum item score of 2 at baseline, 50.0% (2/4) reached the remission threshold.\n  * Of the 56 participants with a maximum item score of 3 at baseline, 64.3% (36/56) reached the remission threshold.\n  * Of the 43 participants with a maximum item score of 4 at baseline, 53.5% (23/43) reached the remission threshold.\n\n\n\n**Additional Neurocrine Biosciences posters presented at Psych Congress 2024 include:**\n\n  * Once-Daily Valbenazine for Tardive Dyskinesia or Huntington's Disease Chorea in Patients with Dysphagia or Swallowing Difficulties (Poster #114)\n  * A Multi-Year Survey on United States Psychiatry Clinicians: Trends on Managing Patients with Tardive Dyskinesia (Poster #48)\n  * Item Response Theory (IRT) Analyses of the Tardive Dyskinesia Impact Scale (TDIS) (Poster #28)\n  * Impact of Valbenazine on Physical, Psychological, and Functional Health in Patients with Tardive Dyskinesia: Results of EQ-5D-5L Health State Scores from 16 Weeks of Valbenazine Treatment (Poster #29)\n  * Real World Improvement in Quality of Life and Functional Status of Valbenazine-Treated Patients With Tardive Dyskinesia From a 2024 Chart Extraction and Clinician Survey of 164 Patients (Poster #27)\n  * Treatment Effect Sizes of Once-Daily Valbenazine for Tardive Dyskinesia and for Chorea Associated with Huntington's Disease: A Post Hoc Analysis of Phase 3 Clinical Trial Data (Poster #44)\n\n\n\n**About the KINECT-4 Phase 3 Study** KINECT®-4 is a Phase 3, open-label study, in which 163 participants with moderate to severe TD and underlying schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder or mood disorder (including bipolar disorder or major depressive disorder) received 48 weeks of open-label treatment with once-daily INGREZZA (40 mg or 80 mg capsules) followed by a four-week washout. Dosing was initiated at 40 mg/day in all participants, with escalation to 80 mg/day at Week 4 based on effectiveness and tolerability. Dose reduction to 40 mg was allowed in participants who could not tolerate the 80 mg dose. Patients were discontinued if the new dose was not tolerated.\n\nParticipants experienced TD improvements during long-term treatment as demonstrated by mean change from baseline to Week 48 in AIMS total score (sum of items 1-7, evaluated by site raters) with INGREZZA 40 mg/day (-10.2) or 80 mg/day (-11.0). Consistent with previous studies, INGREZZA was generally well tolerated. After Week 4, treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) that occurred in ≥5% of all participants (combined dose groups) were urinary tract infection (8.5%) and headache (5.2%). Changes from baseline in psychiatric stability, vital signs, electrocardiogram parameters and laboratory test values were generally small and not clinically significant.\n\n**About Tardive Dyskinesia (TD)** Tardive dyskinesia (TD) is a movement disorder that is characterized by uncontrollable, abnormal and repetitive movements of the face, torso and/or other body parts, which may be disruptive and negatively impact patients. The condition is associated with taking certain kinds of mental health medicines (antipsychotics) that help control dopamine receptors in the brain. Taking antipsychotics commonly prescribed to treat mental illnesses such as major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder and other prescription medicines (metoclopramide and prochlorperazine) used to treat gastrointestinal disorders are associated with TD. In patients with TD, these treatments are thought to result in irregular dopamine signaling in a region of the brain that controls movement. The symptoms of TD can be severe and are often persistent and irreversible. TD is estimated to affect approximately 800,000 people in the U.S.\n\n**About Chorea Associated with Huntington's Disease (HD)** Huntington's disease (HD) is a hereditary progressive neurodegenerative disorder in which the loss of certain neurons within the brain causes motor, cognitive and psychiatric symptoms. Symptoms generally appear between the ages of 30 and 50 years and worsen over a 10- to 25-year period. Most people with HD experience chorea, an abnormal involuntary movement disorder, characterized by irregular and unpredictable movements. Chorea can affect various body parts and interfere with motor coordination, gait, swallowing and speech. HD is estimated to affect approximately 41,000 adults in the U.S., with more than 200,000 at risk of inheriting the disease.\n\n**About INGREZZA ® (valbenazine) Capsules and INGREZZA® SPRINKLE (valbenazine) Capsules**INGREZZA is a selective vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2) inhibitor approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of adults with tardive dyskinesia and the treatment of chorea associated with Huntington's disease (HD). Only INGREZZA offers a therapeutic dose from day one with no required titration.\n\nINGREZZA, developed by Neurocrine Biosciences, selectively inhibits VMAT2 with no appreciable binding affinity for VMAT1, dopaminergic (including D2), serotonergic, adrenergic, histaminergic or muscarinic receptors. While the specific way INGREZZA works to treat TD and HD chorea is not fully understood, INGREZZA is unique in that it selectively and specifically targets VMAT2 to inhibit the release of dopamine, a chemical in the brain that helps control movement. INGREZZA is believed to reduce extra dopamine signaling, which may lead to fewer uncontrollable movements.\n\nINGREZZA is always one capsule, once daily and can be taken together with most stable mental health regimens such as antipsychotics or antidepressants. Only INGREZZA offers the benefit of a sprinkle formulation, INGREZZA® SPRINKLE, for those who experience dysphagia, have difficulty swallowing or prefer not to swallow a pill. INGREZZA and INGREZZA SPRINKLE dosages approved for use are 40 mg, 60 mg and 80 mg capsules.\n\n**Important Information**\n\n**Approved Uses**\n\nINGREZZA® (valbenazine) capsules or INGREZZA® SPRINKLE (valbenazine) capsules are prescription medicines used to treat adults with:\n\n  * movements in the face, tongue, or other body parts that cannot be controlled (tardive dyskinesia).\n  * involuntary movements (chorea) of Huntington's disease. INGREZZA or INGREZZA SPRINKLE do not cure the cause of involuntary movements, and do not treat other symptoms of Huntington's disease, such as problems with thinking or emotions.\n\n\n\nIt is not known if INGREZZA or INGREZZA SPRINKLE is safe and effective in children.\n\n**IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION**\n\n**INGREZZA or INGREZZA SPRINKLE can cause serious side effects in people with Huntington's disease, including: depression, suicidal thoughts, or suicidal actions.** Tell your healthcare provider before you start taking INGREZZA or INGREZZA SPRINKLE if you have Huntington's disease and are depressed (have untreated depression or depression that is not well controlled by medicine) or have suicidal thoughts. Pay close attention to any changes, especially sudden changes, in mood, behaviors, thoughts, or feelings. This is especially important when INGREZZA or INGREZZA SPRINKLE is started and when the dose is changed. Call your healthcare provider right away if you become depressed, have unusual changes in mood or behavior, or have thoughts of hurting yourself.\n\n**Do not take INGREZZA or INGREZZA SPRINKLE if you:**\n\n  * are allergic to valbenazine, or any of the ingredients in INGREZZA or INGREZZA SPRINKLE.\n\n\n\n**INGREZZA or INGREZZA SPRINKLE can cause serious side effects, including:**\n\n  * **Allergic reactions.** Allergic reactions, including an allergic reaction that causes sudden swelling called angioedema can happen after taking the first dose or after many doses of INGREZZA or INGREZZA SPRINKLE. Signs and symptoms of allergic reactions and angioedema include: trouble breathing or shortness of breath, swelling of your face, lips, eyelids, tongue, or throat, or other areas of your skin, trouble with swallowing, or rash, including raised, itchy red areas on your skin (hives). Swelling in the throat can be life-threatening and can lead to death. Stop taking INGREZZA or INGREZZA SPRINKLE and go to the nearest emergency room right away if you develop these signs and symptoms of allergic reactions and angioedema.\n  * **Sleepiness and tiredness that could cause slow reaction times (somnolence and sedation).** Do not drive a car or operate dangerous machinery until you know how INGREZZA or INGREZZA SPRINKLE affects you. Drinking alcohol and taking other medicines may also cause sleepiness during treatment with INGREZZA or INGREZZA SPRINKLE.\n  * **Heart rhythm problems (QT prolongation).** INGREZZA or INGREZZA SPRINKLE may cause a heart rhythm problem known as QT prolongation. You have a higher chance of getting QT prolongation if you also take certain other medicines during treatment with INGREZZA or INGREZZA SPRINKLE. Tell your healthcare provider right away if you develop any signs or symptoms of QT prolongation, including: fast, slow, or irregular heartbeat (heart palpitations), shortness of breath, dizziness or lightheadedness, or fainting or feeling like you are going to faint.\n  * **Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS).** NMS is a serious condition that can lead to death. Call a healthcare provider right away or go to the nearest emergency room if you develop these symptoms and they do not have another obvious cause: high fever, stiff muscles, problems thinking, irregular pulse or blood pressure, increased sweating, or very fast or uneven heartbeat.\n  * **Parkinson-like symptoms.** Symptoms include: body stiffness, drooling, trouble moving or walking, trouble keeping your balance, shaking (tremors), or falls.\n\n\n\n**Before taking INGREZZA or INGREZZA SPRINKLE, tell your healthcare provider about all of your medical conditions including if you:** have liver or heart problems, are pregnant or plan to become pregnant, or are breastfeeding or plan to breastfeed. \n\n**Tell your healthcare provider about all the medicines you take,** including prescription and over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements. Make sure you tell all of your healthcare providers that you are taking INGREZZA or INGREZZA SPRINKLE. Taking INGREZZA or INGREZZA SPRINKLE with certain other medicines may cause serious side effects. Especially tell your healthcare provider if you: take digoxin or take or have taken a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) medicine. You should not take INGREZZA or INGREZZA SPRINKLE if you are taking, or have stopped taking, a MAOI within the last 14 days.\n\n**The most common side effect of INGREZZA or INGREZZA SPRINKLE in people with tardive dyskinesia** **are** sleepiness and tiredness.\n\n**The most common side effects of INGREZZA or INGREZZA SPRINKLE in people with chorea associated with Huntington's disease include **sleepiness and tiredness, raised itchy red areas on your skin (hives), rash, and trouble getting to sleep or staying asleep.\n\nThese are not all of the possible side effects of INGREZZA or INGREZZA SPRINKLE.

When preparing the Non-GAAP financial results and guidance, the Company excludes certain GAAP items that management does not consider to be normal, including recurring cash operating expenses that might not meet the definition of unusual or non-recurring items. In particular, these Non-GAAP financial measures exclude: non-cash stock-based compensation expense, charges associated with convertible senior notes, vacated legacy campus facility costs, net of sublease income, non-cash amortization expense related to acquired intangible assets, acquisition and integration costs, changes in fair value of equity security investments, changes in foreign currency exchange rates and certain adjustments to income tax expense. These Non-GAAP financial measures are provided as a complement to results provided in accordance with GAAP as management believes these Non-GAAP financial measures help indicate underlying trends in the Company's business, are important in comparing current results with prior period results and provide additional information regarding the Company's financial position. Management also uses these Non-GAAP financial measures to establish budgets and operational goals that are communicated internally and externally and to manage the Company's business and evaluate its performance. The Company provides guidance regarding combined R&D and SG&A expenses on both a GAAP and a Non-GAAP basis. A reconciliation of these GAAP financial results to Non-GAAP financial results is included in the attached financial information.\n\n**_Forward-Looking Statements_** In addition to historical facts, this press release contains forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties.

(VMAT2) Inhibitor for the Treatment of Huntington's Disease Chorea \n  * Findings Presented at the 2024 MDS International Congress of Parkinson's Disease and Movement Disorders®\n\n\n\nSAN DIEGO, Sept. 30, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- [Neurocrine Biosciences, Inc.](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4265857-1&h=2705042893&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.neurocrine.com%2F&a=Neurocrine+Biosciences%2C+Inc.) (Nasdaq: NBIX) today announced interim results from the ongoing open-label KINECT®-HD2 study of [INGREZZA® (valbenazine) capsules](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4265857-1&h=1177907791&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ingrezza.com%2F&a=INGREZZA%C2%AE+\\(valbenazine\\)+capsules) for the long-term treatment of adults with chorea associated with Huntington's disease. Robust and sustained improvements in chorea associated with Huntington's disease were observed through Week 104 in patients, irrespective of concomitant antipsychotic therapy use. These results (Poster #1465) will be presented on September 30 during the 2024 MDS International Congress of Parkinson's Disease and Movement Disorders® in Philadelphia.\n\n[ ![\\(PRNewsfoto/Neurocrine Biosciences, Inc.\\)](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/678850/Neurocrine_Biosciences_Logo.jpg) ](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/678850/Neurocrine_Biosciences_Logo.html)\n\n\"The data from this study reinforce the long-term clinical safety of INGREZZA observed to date, showing sustained improvement in chorea regardless of antipsychotic use during the study,\" said Eiry W. Roberts, M.D., Chief Medical Officer, Neurocrine Biosciences. \"This is an important finding given that approximately a third of patients living with Huntington's disease chorea are prescribed antipsychotic medications for neuropsychiatric symptoms without receiving treatment for the chorea that may significantly disrupt daily life.\"\n\nThe effect of INGREZZA on chorea over time was assessed using mean changes from baseline in the Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Scale Total Maximal Chorea (TMC) score and response status (\"much improved\" or \"very much improved\") for Clinical Global Impression of Change and Patient Global Impression of Change.\n\nData from this interim analysis of KINECT-HD2 suggest robust and sustained improvements in Huntington's disease (HD) chorea with INGREZZA treatment:\n\n  * INGREZZA improved HD chorea as early as Week 2 (TMC change from baseline: -3.4) at the starting dose of 40 mg and at Week 4 (-4.6) with doses up to 60 mg. Efficacy was sustained from Week 8 (-5.7) to Week 104 (-5.2) at the maintenance dose of up to 80 mg.\n  * These improvements were consistent regardless of presence or absence of concomitant antipsychotic treatment.\n  * At Week 6 and at each visit thereafter, more than half of participants and investigators rated symptoms as \"much improved\" or \"very much improved.\" At Week 104, this response status was achieved in 75.9% of participants based on self-report and 73.6% of participants based on clinician assessment.\n  * The most common treatment-emergent adverse events at the time of the analysis were consistent with those observed in KINECT-HD, including falls, somnolence and fatigue.\n\n\n\n**Additional presentations by Neurocrine Biosciences include:**\n\n  * Somnolence-Related Events Over Time with Valbenazine Treatment for Chorea Associated with Huntington's Disease (Poster #1445)\n  * Treatment Effect Sizes of Once-Daily Valbenazine for Tardive Dyskinesia and for Chorea Associated with Huntington's Disease: A Post-Hoc Analysis of Phase 3 Clinical Trial Data (Poster #1466)\n\n\n\n**About Chorea Associated with Huntington's Disease** Huntington's disease is a hereditary progressive neurodegenerative disorder in which the loss of certain neurons within the brain causes motor, cognitive and psychiatric symptoms. Symptoms generally appear between the ages of 30 and 50 years and worsen over a 10- to 25-year period. Most people with HD experience chorea, an abnormal involuntary movement disorder, characterized by irregular and unpredictable movements. Chorea can affect various body parts and interfere with motor coordination, gait, swallowing and speech. HD is estimated to affect approximately 41,000 adults in the U.S., with more than 200,000 at risk of inheriting the disease.\n\n**About KINECT ®-HD**KINECT®-HD was a Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study designed to evaluate the efficacy of valbenazine as a once-daily treatment to reduce chorea associated with Huntington's disease (HD) and evaluate the safety and tolerability of valbenazine in patients with HD. The study enrolled 128 adults 18 to 75 years of age who were diagnosed with motor-manifest HD and who had sufficient chorea symptoms to meet study protocol criteria.\n\nKINECT-HD used the Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Scale (UHDRS®) Total Maximal Chorea (TMC) score as the primary efficacy endpoint. The secondary endpoints included Clinical Global Impression of Change (CGI-C) response status and Patient Global Impression of Change (PGI-C) response status for valbenazine treatment. Treatment with valbenazine resulted in a placebo-adjusted mean reduction in the TMC score of 3.2 units (_P_ < 0.0001), indicating a substantial improvement in chorea. Secondary endpoints of CGI-C response status and PGI-C response status were also statistically significant and supported the improvements in TMC score that were seen over the 12-week study period.\n\nTreatment-emergent adverse events in this study were generally consistent with the known safety profile of valbenazine. The most common adverse reactions in patients with HD included somnolence and sedation, urticaria, rash and insomnia.\n\nView the complete study results from the Phase 3 KINECT-HD study published in  _The Lancet Neurology_ [online edition](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4265857-1&h=3809172282&u=https%3A%2F%2Fc212.net%2Fc%2Flink%2F%3Ft%3D0%26l%3Den%26o%3D4008219-1%26h%3D1855037865%26u%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fc212.net%252Fc%252Flink%252F%253Ft%253D0%2526l%253Den%2526o%253D3953154-1%2526h%253D1410081926%2526u%253Dhttps%25253A%25252F%25252Fwww.thelancet.com%25252Fjournals%25252Flaneur%25252Farticle%25252FPIIS1474-4422\\(23\\)00127-8%25252Ffulltext%2526a%253Donline%252Bedition%26a%3Donline%2Bedition&a=online+edition).

Only INGREZZA offers a therapeutic dose from day one.\n\nINGREZZA, developed by Neurocrine Biosciences, selectively inhibits VMAT2 with no appreciable binding affinity for VMAT1, dopaminergic (including D2), serotonergic, adrenergic, histaminergic or muscarinic receptors. While the specific way INGREZZA works to treat TD and HD chorea is not fully understood, INGREZZA is unique in that it selectively and specifically targets VMAT2 to inhibit the release of dopamine, a chemical in the brain that helps control movement. INGREZZA is believed to reduce extra dopamine signaling, which may lead to fewer uncontrollable movements.\n\nINGREZZA can be taken as one capsule, once daily together with most stable mental health regimens such as antipsychotics or antidepressants. Only INGREZZA offers the benefit of a sprinkle formulation, INGREZZA® SPRINKLE, for those who experience dysphagia, have difficulty swallowing or prefer not to swallow a pill. INGREZZA and INGREZZA SPRINKLE dosages approved for use are 40 mg, 60 mg and 80 mg capsules. \n\n**Important Information****Approved Uses** INGREZZA® (valbenazine) capsules or INGREZZA® SPRINKLE (valbenazine) capsules are prescription medicines used to treat adults with:\n\n  * movements in the face, tongue, or other body parts that cannot be controlled (tardive dyskinesia).\n  * involuntary movements (chorea) of Huntington's disease. INGREZZA or INGREZZA SPRINKLE do not cure the cause of involuntary movements, and do not treat other symptoms of Huntington's disease, such as problems with thinking or emotions.\n\n\n\nIt is not known if INGREZZA or INGREZZA SPRINKLE is safe and effective in children.\n\n**IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION**\n\n**INGREZZA or INGREZZA SPRINKLE can cause serious side effects in people with Huntington's disease, including: depression, suicidal thoughts, or suicidal actions.** Tell your healthcare provider before you start taking INGREZZA or INGREZZA SPRINKLE if you have Huntington's disease and are depressed (have untreated depression or depression that is not well controlled by medicine) or have suicidal thoughts. Pay close attention to any changes, especially sudden changes, in mood, behaviors, thoughts, or feelings. This is especially important when INGREZZA or INGREZZA SPRINKLE is started and when the dose is changed. Call your healthcare provider right away if you become depressed, have unusual changes in mood or behavior, or have thoughts of hurting yourself.\n\n**Do not take INGREZZA or INGREZZA SPRINKLE if you:**\n\n  * are allergic to valbenazine, or any of the ingredients in INGREZZA or INGREZZA SPRINKLE.\n\n\n\n**INGREZZA or INGREZZA SPRINKLE can cause serious side effects, including:**\n\n  * **Allergic reactions.** Allergic reactions, including an allergic reaction that causes sudden swelling called angioedema can happen after taking the first dose or after many doses of INGREZZA or INGREZZA SPRINKLE. Signs and symptoms of allergic reactions and angioedema include: trouble breathing or shortness of breath, swelling of your face, lips, eyelids, tongue, or throat, or other areas of your skin, trouble with swallowing, or rash, including raised, itchy red areas on your skin (hives). Swelling in the throat can be life-threatening and can lead to death. Stop taking INGREZZA or INGREZZA SPRINKLE and go to the nearest emergency room right away if you develop these signs and symptoms of allergic reactions and angioedema.\n  * **Sleepiness and tiredness that could cause slow reaction times (somnolence and sedation).** Do not drive a car or operate dangerous machinery until you know how INGREZZA or INGREZZA SPRINKLE affects you. Drinking alcohol and taking other medicines may also cause sleepiness during treatment with INGREZZA or INGREZZA SPRINKLE.\n  * **Heart rhythm problems (QT prolongation).** INGREZZA or INGREZZA SPRINKLE may cause a heart rhythm problem known as QT prolongation. You have a higher chance of getting QT prolongation if you also take certain other medicines during treatment with INGREZZA or INGREZZA SPRINKLE. Tell your healthcare provider right away if you develop any signs or symptoms of QT prolongation, including: fast, slow, or irregular heartbeat (heart palpitations), shortness of breath, dizziness or lightheadedness, or fainting or feeling like you are going to faint.\n  * **Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS).** NMS is a serious condition that can lead to death. Call a healthcare provider right away or go to the nearest emergency room if you develop these symptoms and they do not have another obvious cause: high fever, stiff muscles, problems thinking, irregular pulse or blood pressure, increased sweating, or very fast or uneven heartbeat.\n  * **Parkinson-like symptoms.** Symptoms include: body stiffness, drooling, trouble moving or walking, trouble keeping your balance, shaking (tremors), or falls.\n\n\n\n**Before taking INGREZZA or INGREZZA SPRINKLE, tell your healthcare provider about all of your medical conditions including if you:** have liver or heart problems, are pregnant or plan to become pregnant, or are breastfeeding or plan to breastfeed. \n\n**Tell your healthcare provider about all the medicines you take,** including prescription and over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements. Make sure you tell all of your healthcare providers that you are taking INGREZZA or INGREZZA SPRINKLE. Taking INGREZZA or INGREZZA SPRINKLE with certain other medicines may cause serious side effects. Especially tell your healthcare provider if you: take digoxin or take or have taken a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) medicine. You should not take INGREZZA or INGREZZA SPRINKLE if you are taking, or have stopped taking, a MAOI within the last 14 days.\n\n**The most common side effects of INGREZZA or INGREZZA SPRINKLE in people with tardive dyskinesia** **are** sleepiness and tiredness.\n\n**The most common side effects of INGREZZA or INGREZZA SPRINKLE in people with chorea associated with Huntington's disease include** sleepiness and tiredness, raised itchy red areas on your skin (hives), rash, and trouble getting to sleep or staying asleep.\n\nThese are not all of the possible side effects of INGREZZA or INGREZZA SPRINKLE.

Inc.](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4252873-1&h=2305392745&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.neurocrine.com%2F&a=Neurocrine+Biosciences%2C+Inc.) (Nasdaq: NBIX) today announced that its ERUDITE™ Phase 2 clinical study of investigational compound luvadaxistat (NBI-1065844) failed to meet its primary endpoint as a potential treatment to improve cognitive impairment in patients with schizophrenia.\n\n[ ![\\(PRNewsfoto/Neurocrine Biosciences, Inc.\\)](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/678850/Neurocrine_Biosciences_Logo.jpg) ](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/678850/Neurocrine_Biosciences_Logo.html)\n\nThe ERUDITE study was the second Phase 2 trial for luvadaxistat. It failed to replicate the cognitive endpoints data seen in the earlier INTERACT™ study, due in part to the large variability seen in the cognitive measures across the population studied and a potential imbalance in the baseline characteristics of subjects enrolled across the treatment arms.\n\nIn the INTERACT study, 50 mg luvadaxistat resulted in a statistically significant improvement in measure of cognition on the Brief Assessment of Cognition in Schizophrenia (BACS) and cognitive performance on the Schizophrenia Cognition Rating Scale (SCoRS). The INTERACT study represented the first time statistical significance had been demonstrated for both cognitive measure and function within a single study.\n\n\"While it's disappointing that luvadaxistat did not meet the primary endpoint in this study, we understand the challenges and hurdles that exist in identifying potential medicines for the treatment of cognitive impairment in schizophrenia. We therefore plan to halt further development of luvadaxistat at this time and instead will focus our efforts and resources on the advancement into Phase 3 clinical development of NBI-1117568 for schizophrenia and NBI-1065845 for major depressive disorder,\" said Eiry W. Roberts, M.D., Chief Medical Officer. \"We are excited by the opportunity that lies ahead of us to bring forward potential medicines for patients in these important areas of unmet need in neuropsychiatry.\"\n\n**About Luvadaxistat** Luvadaxistat (NBI-1065844) is an investigational, oral, selective inhibitor with a high binding affinity to d-amino acid oxidase (DAAO), which metabolizes D-Serine, a primary NMDA receptor co-agonist in the limbic region of the brain. In schizophrenia, N-methyl D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor hypofunction on PV+ gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) interneurons results in disinhibition of cortical or hippocampal glutamate neurons projecting to the pyramidal neurons, which are associated with cognitive impairment seen in schizophrenia. \n\nThe ERUDITE™ Phase 2 clinical study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group study to evaluate the efficacy safety and tolerability of luvadaxistat in adults with cognitive impairment associated with schizophrenia (CIAS). For more information about this study, visit [ClinicalTrials.gov](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4252873-1&h=3907131038&u=https%3A%2F%2Fclinicaltrials.gov%2Fstudy%2FNCT05182476%3Fcond%3DSchizophrenia%26term%3Dnbi-1065844%26rank%3D1&a=ClinicalTrials.gov).\n\nNeurocrine Biosciences acquired the rights to develop and commercialize luvadaxistat from Takeda Pharmaceutical Company, Ltd.\n\n**About Schizophrenia** Schizophrenia is a serious and complex syndrome with heterogeneous symptoms. This chronic and disabling mental health condition is thought to result from a complex interplay of genetic and environmental risk factors. The World Health Organization estimates that the disorder impacts more than 20 million people worldwide. Annual associated costs for schizophrenia are estimated to be more than $150 billion in the United States. It is estimated that approximately 80 percent of people living with schizophrenia have cognitive impairment associated with schizophrenia (CIAS).\n\n**About Neurocrine Biosciences** Neurocrine Biosciences is a leading neuroscience-focused, biopharmaceutical company with a simple purpose: to relieve suffering for people with great needs, but few options.

Biosciences, Inc.](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4241394-1&h=1798309732&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.neurocrine.com%2F&a=Neurocrine+Biosciences%2C+Inc.) (Nasdaq: NBIX) today announced positive top-line data for its Phase 2 clinical study of NBI-1117568 (NBI-'568) in adults with schizophrenia. NBI-'568 is the first investigational, oral, muscarinic M4 selective agonist in development for the treatment of schizophrenia.\n\n[ ![\\(PRNewsfoto/Neurocrine Biosciences, Inc.\\)](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/678850/Neurocrine_Biosciences_Logo.jpg) ](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/678850/Neurocrine_Biosciences_Logo.html)\n\nThe NBI-'568-SCZ2028 dose-finding study met its primary endpoint for the once-daily 20 mg dose. It demonstrated a clinically meaningful and statistically significant reduction from baseline in the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) total score at Week 6 with a placebo-adjusted mean reduction of 7.5 points (p=0.011 and effect size of 0.61) and an 18.2-point reduction from baseline. The once-daily 20 mg dose also demonstrated a statistically significant improvement for additional endpoints, including improvement in the Clinical Global Impression of Severity (CGI-S) scale, Marder Factor Score – Positive Symptom Change, and Marder Factor Score – Negative Symptom Change.\n\n\"This Phase 2 dose-finding study delivered on our goal of identifying a once-daily, well tolerated dosing regimen with a compelling and competitive benefit-risk profile,\" said Eiry W. Roberts, M.D., Chief Medical Officer at Neurocrine Biosciences. \"We recognize the significant need for new and innovative medicines to treat schizophrenia and look forward to advancing NBI-'568, the first M4 selective agonist, into Phase 3 development early next year.\"\n\n\"NBI-1117568 demonstrated a clinically meaningful and statistically significant reduction in PANSS scores and was well tolerated, importantly with minimal GI effects and no weight gain relative to placebo,\" said Dr. Maurizio Fava, Psychiatrist-in-Chief at Massachusetts General Hospital of Harvard University. \"As a selective M4 orthosteric agonist, the potential of NBI-1117568 as an option that could reduce symptoms of schizophrenia with fewer side effects would be a welcome alternative to current treatments for patients and caregivers.\"\n\nNBI-'568 was generally safe and well tolerated at all doses studied in the Phase 2 clinical trial. Treatment discontinuation rates due to adverse events were similar between NBI-'568 and placebo. Adverse events with the highest incidence were somnolence, dizziness, and headache. Gastrointestinal adverse events including nausea and constipation were low in frequency and similar to placebo. Cardiovascular-related events were also low in frequency and were not deemed to have clinical relevance at any dose tested. NBI-'568 was not associated with a greater increase in weight than placebo. Few extrapyramidal symptoms adverse events were reported.\n\n**_Primary Endpoint Results Summary_**\n\n**Week 6 (Day 42)** |  **Placebo** **(N=68)** |  **20 mg QD** **(N=35)** |  **40 mg QD** **(N=38)** |  **60 mg QD** **(N=34)** |  **30 mg BID** **(N=26)**  \n---|---|---|---|---|---  \n**PANSS Total Score LS Mean Change from Baseline*** |  -10.8 |  -18.2 |  -12.6 |  -13.7 |  -15.8  \n**LS Mean Difference vs. Placebo*** |  - |  -7.5 (p=0.011) |  -1.9 (p=0.282) |  -2.9 (p=0.189) |  -5.0 (p=0.090)  \n**Effect Size**** |  - |  0.61 |  0.27 |  0.39 |  0.23  \n**_*Least-squares (LS) means are from a MMRM which includes treatment group, visit, and study period as fixed effects; treatment group-by-visit interaction; baseline PANSS total score as a covariate; and subject as a random effect.**Effect size (Cohen's D) is based on observed data_****.**  \n  \n**Next Steps for Neurocrine Biosciences' Muscarinic Portfolio**In addition to NBI-'568, Neurocrine Biosciences has a broad portfolio of assets in clinical development that selectively target muscarinic receptors. The company's muscarinic agonist portfolio also includes NBI-1117567, NBI-1117569, and NBI-1117570, which the company acquired the rights to develop and commercialize from Nxera Pharma (formerly Sosei Heptares). Neurocrine Biosciences is also developing NBI-1076986, a selective M4 antagonist that was discovered and is being developed internally at Neurocrine.\n\n**Compound** |  **Primary Mechanism** **(M1-M4)** |  **Phase** |  **Therapeutic** **Areas** |  **Potential Areas for Development**  \n---|---|---|---|---  \nNBI-1117568  |  M4 agonist  |  2 |  Psychosis Cognition |  Alzheimer's Disease Bipolar Disorder Lewy Body Dementia Parkinson's Disease Schizophrenia   \nNBI-1117567  |  M1 agonist  |  1  \nNBI-1117569  |  M4 agonist  |  1  \nNBI-1117570 |  M1/M4 dual agonist  |  1  \nNBI-1076986  |  M4 antagonist  |  1 |  Movement Disorders |  Dystonia Parkinson's Disease Tremor  \n  \n**Conference Call and Webcast Today at 8:00 AM Eastern Time**Neurocrine Biosciences will hold a live conference call and webcast today at 8:00 a.m. Eastern Time (5:00 a.m. Pacific Time). Participants can access the live conference call by dialing 800-579-2543 (U.S.) or 785-424-1789 (International) using the conference ID: NBIX. The live webcast and accompanying slides can be accessed on the investor relations section of Neurocrine Biosciences' website [here](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4241394-1&h=2270501996&u=https%3A%2F%2Fapp.webinar.net%2FrXYQyqQywGE&a=here). A replay of the webcast will be available on the website approximately one hour after the conclusion of the event and will be archived for approximately one month.\n\n**About NBI-1117568** NBI-'568 is the first and only M4 selective orthosteric agonist in clinical development. There are five muscarinic acetylcholine receptors involved in neurotransmission. Muscarinic receptors are central to brain function and validated as drug targets in psychosis and cognitive disorders. As an M4 selective orthosteric agonist, NBI-'568 offers the potential for a novel mechanism with an improved safety profile without the need of combination therapy to minimize off-target pharmacology-related side effects, while also not being dependent on the presence of acetylcholine for efficacy.\n\n**About the NBI-1117568-SCZ2028 Phase 2 Clinical Study** The Phase 2, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-arm, multi-stage inpatient dose-finding study was designed to assess the efficacy, safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics (PK) of NBI-'568 compared with placebo in adult subjects with a primary diagnosis of schizophrenia who are experiencing an acute exacerbation or relapse of symptoms. The study enrolled 210 participants. For more information about this study, visit [ClinicalTrials.gov](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4241394-1&h=4174355341&u=https%3A%2F%2Fclinicaltrials.gov%2Fct2%2Fshow%2FNCT05545111%3Fterm%3DNeurocrine%26cond%3DSchizophrenia%26draw%3D2%26rank%3D2&a=ClinicalTrials.gov).\n\n**About Schizophrenia** Schizophrenia is a serious and complex syndrome with heterogeneous symptoms. The World Health Organization estimates that the disorder impacts more than 20 million people worldwide. Annual associated costs for schizophrenia are estimated to be more than $150 billion in the United States. As one of the leading causes of disability worldwide, it often results in significant emotional and functional burden for those who experience symptoms, as well as their family and friends. This chronic and disabling mental health condition is thought to result from a complex interplay of genetic and environmental risk factors. Traditional treatment approaches for schizophrenia rely on the use of antipsychotic medications that can lead to considerable short- and long-term health impacts.\n\n**About Neurocrine Biosciences** Neurocrine Biosciences is a leading neuroscience-focused, biopharmaceutical company with a simple purpose: to relieve suffering for people with great needs, but few options.

When preparing the Non-GAAP financial results and guidance, the Company excludes certain GAAP items that management does not consider to be normal, including recurring cash operating expenses that might not meet the definition of unusual or non-recurring items. In particular, these Non-GAAP financial measures exclude: non-cash stock-based compensation expense, charges associated with convertible senior notes, impairment charges associated with leased properties, non-cash amortization expense related to acquired intangible assets, acquisition and integration costs, changes in fair value of equity security investments, changes in foreign currency exchange rates and certain adjustments to income tax expense. These Non-GAAP financial measures are provided as a complement to results provided in accordance with GAAP as management believes these Non-GAAP financial measures help indicate underlying trends in the Company's business, are important in comparing current results with prior period results and provide additional information regarding the Company's financial position. Management also uses these Non-GAAP financial measures to establish budgets and operational goals that are communicated internally and externally and to manage the Company's business and evaluate its performance. The Company provides guidance regarding combined R&D and SG&A expenses on both a GAAP and a Non-GAAP basis. A reconciliation of these GAAP financial results to Non-GAAP financial results is included in the attached financial information.\n\n**_Forward-Looking Statements_** In addition to historical facts, this press release contains forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties.

Launches INGREZZA® SPRINKLE (valbenazine) Capsules to Ease Administration for Patients Experiencing Dysphagia or Difficulty Swallowing\n\n07/18/24\n\n[PDF Version](/node/21241/pdf)\n\nSAN DIEGO, July 18, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- [Neurocrine Biosciences, Inc.](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4212201-1&h=364827490&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.neurocrine.com%2F&a=Neurocrine+Biosciences%2C+Inc.) (Nasdaq: NBIX) today announced the launch of a new sprinkle formulation of [INGREZZA® (valbenazine) capsules](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4212201-1&h=4071623904&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ingrezza.com%2F&a=INGREZZA%C2%AE+\\(valbenazine\\)+capsules), the #1 prescribed vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2) inhibitor indicated for the treatment of adults with tardive dyskinesia and chorea associated with Huntington's disease.1 INGREZZA® SPRINKLE (valbenazine) capsules is now available through the same network of specialty and local affiliated pharmacies that distribute INGREZZA.\n\n[ ![\\(PRNewsfoto/Neurocrine Biosciences, Inc.\\)](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/678850/Neurocrine_Biosciences_Logo.jpg) ](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/678850/Neurocrine_Biosciences_Logo.html)\n\n\"Only INGREZZA offers a sprinkle formulation to ease administration for individuals living with tardive dyskinesia or Huntington's disease chorea, who often have difficulty swallowing pills,\" said Eiry W. Roberts, M.D., Chief Medical Officer, Neurocrine Biosciences. \"We wanted to provide this new option to patients and their caregivers who want the benefit of treatment with INGREZZA without the challenge of swallowing a capsule.\"\n\nINGREZZA and INGREZZA SPRINKLE offer simple dosing that's always one capsule, once daily with no complex dose adjustments to get to an effective dose.1 Only INGREZZA and INGREZZA SPRINKLE offer a therapeutic dose from day one.1 INGREZZA SPRINKLE offers the same three simple and effective dosing options (40 mg, 60 mg and 80 mg) as INGREZZA, which can be adjusted by a healthcare provider based on patient response and tolerability.1\n\nThe INGREZZA SPRINKLE capsule is easy to open and the contents (granules) can be sprinkled on soft food, such as applesauce, yogurt or pudding, for oral administration. Proper preparation and administration of INGREZZA SPRINKLE is described in the [Instructions for Use](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4212201-1&h=2006209141&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.neurocrine.com%2Fingrezzapi&a=Instructions+for+Use). \n\n\"Most people living with chorea associated with Huntington's disease will experience swallowing issues,\" said Katie Jackson, President, Help 4 HD International. \"The availability of a treatment for chorea that can be easily sprinkled onto food is very helpful in reducing the burden of taking a pill for these individuals and their caregivers, especially as the disease progresses.\"\n\nTaking pills can also be difficult for people living with TD.2 In a survey of patients with TD experiencing moderate-to-severe involuntary movement symptoms (n = 250), 37% reported that their movements impacted their ability to eat and drink.2*†\n\nNeurocrine Biosciences received U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval of INGREZZA SPRINKLE on April 30 of this year. The approval was based on chemistry, manufacturing and controls information and data demonstrating the bioequivalence and tolerability of INGREZZA SPRINKLE compared with INGREZZA capsules.\n\nThe cost of INGREZZA SPRINKLE is equivalent to INGREZZA. The INBRACE® Support Program provided by Neurocrine Biosciences helps patients who are prescribed INGREZZA or INGREZZA SPRINKLE by assisting with product support and prescription fulfillment. Patients with commercial insurance may be eligible for copay assistance, and patients with no prescription coverage who also lack the financial resources to pay for their medicine may be eligible for participation in the patient assistance program. Most patients pay $10 or less out-of-pocket for INGREZZA. For more information, patients may visit [INBRACESupportProgram.com/INGREZZAPatient/](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4212201-1&h=2656360034&u=https%3A%2F%2Finbracesupportprogram.com%2Fingrezzapatient%2F&a=INBRACESupportProgram.com%2FINGREZZAPatient%2F).\n\n**About Tardive Dyskinesia (TD)** Tardive dyskinesia (TD) is a movement disorder that is characterized by uncontrollable, abnormal and repetitive movements of the face, torso and/or other body parts, which may be disruptive and negatively impact patients. The condition is associated with taking certain kinds of mental health medicines (antipsychotics) that help control dopamine receptors in the brain. Taking antipsychotics commonly prescribed to treat mental illnesses such as major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder and other prescription medicines (metoclopramide and prochlorperazine) used to treat gastrointestinal disorders are associated with TD. In patients with TD, these treatments are thought to result in irregular dopamine signaling in a region of the brain that controls movement. The symptoms of TD can be severe and are often persistent and irreversible. TD is estimated to affect approximately 600,000 people in the U.S.\n\n**About Chorea Associated with Huntington's Disease (HD)** Huntington's disease (HD) is a hereditary progressive neurodegenerative disorder in which the loss of certain neurons within the brain causes motor, cognitive and psychiatric symptoms. Symptoms generally appear between the ages of 30 and 50 years and worsen over a 10- to 25-year period. Most people with HD experience chorea, an abnormal involuntary movement disorder, characterized by irregular and unpredictable movements. Chorea can affect various body parts and interfere with motor coordination, gait, swallowing and speech. HD is estimated to affect approximately 41,000 adults in the U.S., with more than 200,000 at risk of inheriting the disease.\n\n**About INGREZZA** ® **(valbenazine) Capsules and INGREZZA ® SPRINKLE (valbenazine) Capsules**INGREZZA is a selective vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2) inhibitor approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of adults with tardive dyskinesia and the treatment of chorea associated with Huntington's disease (HD) that is always one capsule, once daily with no complex dose adjustments to get to an effective dose. Only INGREZZA offers a therapeutic dose from day one.\n\nINGREZZA, developed by Neurocrine Biosciences, selectively inhibits VMAT2 with no appreciable binding affinity for VMAT1, dopaminergic (including D2), serotonergic, adrenergic, histaminergic or muscarinic receptors. While the specific way INGREZZA works to treat TD and HD chorea is not fully understood, INGREZZA is unique in that it selectively and specifically targets VMAT2 to inhibit the release of dopamine, a chemical in the brain that helps control movement. INGREZZA is believed to reduce extra dopamine signaling, which may lead to fewer uncontrollable movements.\n\nINGREZZA can be taken as one capsule, once daily together with most stable mental health regimens such as antipsychotics or antidepressants. Only INGREZZA offers the benefit of a sprinkle formulation, INGREZZA® SPRINKLE, for those who experience dysphagia, have difficulty swallowing or prefer not to swallow a pill. INGREZZA and INGREZZA SPRINKLE dosages approved for use are 40 mg, 60 mg and 80 mg capsules.\n\n**Important Information**\n\n**Approved Uses**\n\nINGREZZA® (valbenazine) capsules or INGREZZA® SPRINKLE (valbenazine) capsules are prescription medicines used to treat adults with:\n\n  * movements in the face, tongue, or other body parts that cannot be controlled (tardive dyskinesia).\n  * involuntary movements (chorea) of Huntington's disease. INGREZZA or INGREZZA SPRINKLE do not cure the cause of involuntary movements, and do not treat other symptoms of Huntington's disease, such as problems with thinking or emotions.\n\n\n\nIt is not known if INGREZZA or INGREZZA SPRINKLE is safe and effective in children.\n\n**IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION**\n\n**VMAT2 inhibitors, including INGREZZA and INGREZZA SPRINKLE, can cause serious side effects in people with Huntington's disease, including: depression, suicidal thoughts, or suicidal actions.** Tell your healthcare provider before you start taking INGREZZA or INGREZZA SPRINKLE if you have Huntington's disease and are depressed (have untreated depression or depression that is not well controlled by medicine) or have suicidal thoughts. Pay close attention to any changes, especially sudden changes, in mood, behaviors, thoughts, or feelings. This is especially important when INGREZZA or INGREZZA SPRINKLE is started and when the dose is changed. Call your healthcare provider right away if you become depressed, have unusual changes in mood or behavior, or have thoughts of hurting yourself.\n\n**Do not take INGREZZA or INGREZZA SPRINKLE if you:**\n\n  * are allergic to valbenazine, or any of the ingredients in INGREZZA or INGREZZA SPRINKLE.\n\n\n\n**INGREZZA or INGREZZA SPRINKLE can cause serious side effects, including:**\n\n  * **Allergic reactions.** Allergic reactions, including an allergic reaction that causes sudden swelling called angioedema can happen after taking the first dose or after many doses of INGREZZA or INGREZZA SPRINKLE. Signs and symptoms of allergic reactions and angioedema include: trouble breathing or shortness of breath, swelling of your face, lips, eyelids, tongue, or throat, or other areas of your skin, trouble with swallowing, or rash, including raised, itchy red areas on your skin (hives). Swelling in the throat can be life-threatening and can lead to death. Stop taking INGREZZA or INGREZZA SPRINKLE and go to the nearest emergency room right away if you develop these signs and symptoms of allergic reactions and angioedema.\n  * **Sleepiness and tiredness that could cause slow reaction times (somnolence and sedation).** Do not drive a car or operate dangerous machinery until you know how INGREZZA or INGREZZA SPRINKLE affects you. Drinking alcohol and taking other medicines may also cause sleepiness during treatment with INGREZZA or INGREZZA SPRINKLE.\n  * **Heart rhythm problems (QT prolongation).** INGREZZA or INGREZZA SPRINKLE may cause a heart rhythm problem known as QT prolongation.

The FDA stated it is not currently planning to hold an advisory committee meeting to discuss these applications.\n\nPriority Review designation by the FDA accelerates the review timeline by four months – and means the agency recognizes CAH is a serious condition with high unmet medical need and crinecerfont is a treatment that provides significant benefit over current therapy. Should crinecerfont receive FDA approval, it will enable Neurocrine Biosciences to activate its Rare Pediatric Disease Designation Priority Review Voucher – a designation granted in September 2020.\n\n\"Receipt of a Priority Review reflects the FDA's agreement that CAH is a serious condition and there is an urgent need for patients to have access to new treatments,\" said Eiry W. Roberts, M.D., Chief Medical Officer at Neurocrine Biosciences. \"Crinecerfont's compelling efficacy results and excellent safety profile support our filing, and we look forward to working with the FDA as we head toward the PDUFA dates at the end of 2024.\"\n\nCrinecerfont previously was granted Orphan Drug designation in March 2019 and Breakthrough Therapy designation in December 2023.\n\nOrphan Drug designation means the company will be exempt from paying PDUFA user fees, receive tax credits for qualified clinical trials, and has the potential of seven years of market exclusivity should crinecerfont be approved.\n\nBreakthrough Therapy designation is a process developed by the FDA to expedite development and review of drugs that are intended to treat a serious condition and where clinical evidence indicates that the potential drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over available therapy on a clinically significant endpoint(s). Breakthrough Therapy designation was granted based on the strong results and excellent safety profile seen from the CAHtalyst™ Phase 3 Pediatric and Adult study data announced in fall 2023 and published in June.\n\nCAHtalyst Phase 3 data results in [pediatric](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4202857-1&h=1601359930&u=https%3A%2F%2Fneurocrine.gcs-web.com%2Fnews-releases%2Fnews-release-details%2Fneurocrine-biosciences-announces-publication-primary-0&a=pediatric) and [adult](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4202857-1&h=2705074438&u=https%3A%2F%2Fneurocrine.gcs-web.com%2Fnews-releases%2Fnews-release-details%2Fneurocrine-biosciences-announces-publication-primary-cahtalysttm&a=adult) patients with CAH due to 21-OHD were published in online issues of _The New England Journal of Medicine_ on June 2 and June 1, respectively, and presented at ENDO 2024.\n\n**About Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia** Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) is a rare genetic condition that results in an enzyme deficiency that alters the production of adrenal hormones which are essential for life. Approximately 95% of CAH cases are caused by a mutation that leads to deficiency of the enzyme 21-hydroxylase (21-OHD). Severe deficiency of this enzyme leads to an inability of the adrenal glands to produce cortisol and, in approximately 75% of cases, aldosterone. If left untreated, CAH can result in salt wasting, dehydration, and even death.\n\nGlucocorticoids (GCs) are currently used not only to correct the endogenous cortisol deficiency, but doses used are higher than cortisol replacement needed (supraphysiologic) to lower the levels of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and adrenal androgens. However, glucocorticoid treatment at supraphysiologic doses has been associated with serious and significant complications of steroid excess, including metabolic issues such as weight gain and diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and osteoporosis. Additionally, long-term treatment with supraphysiologic GC doses may have psychological and cognitive impact, such as changes in mood and memory. Adrenal androgen excess has been associated with abnormal bone growth and development in pediatric patients, female health problems such as acne, excess hair growth and menstrual irregularities, testicular rest tumors in males, and fertility issues in both sexes.\n\nTo learn more about CAH, click [here](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4202857-1&h=425904157&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.neurocrine.com%2Fdiseases-and-conditions%2F&a=here).\n\n**About Crinecerfont and the CAHtalyst™ Studies** Crinecerfont is an investigational, oral, selective corticotropin-releasing factor type 1 receptor (CRF1) antagonist being developed to reduce and control excess adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and adrenal androgens through a glucocorticoid-independent mechanism for the treatment of congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency. Antagonism of CRF1 receptors in the pituitary has been shown to decrease ACTH levels, which in turn decreases the production of adrenal androgens and potentially the symptoms associated with CAH. Crinecerfont study data demonstrate that lowering adrenal androgen levels enables lower, more physiologic dosing of glucocorticoids to manage androgen excess and thus could potentially reduce the complications associated with exposure to greater than normal glucocorticoid doses in patients with CAH.\n\nThe CAHtalyst™ Pediatric and Adult Phase 3 global registrational studies are designed to evaluate the safety, efficacy, and tolerability of crinecerfont in children and adolescents, and adults respectively, with congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency. The primary portions of the CAHtalyst Phase 3 studies have completed and enrollment is closed, while the open-label treatment portions of both studies are ongoing. Data from the CAHtalyst Pediatric and CAHtalyst Adult Phase 3 studies supported two New Drug Application submissions to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in April 2024.\n\nTo learn more about crinecerfont and the CAHtalyst studies, click [here](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4202857-1&h=3808185273&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.neurocrine.com%2Fpipeline%2F%23CAH&a=here).\n\n**About Neurocrine Biosciences, Inc.** Neurocrine Biosciences is a leading neuroscience-focused, biopharmaceutical company with a simple purpose: to relieve suffering for people with great needs, but few options.

The findings included:\n\n  * Among 44 pediatric patients, 12 (27.3%) received a high GC dose (>15 mg/m2/day), that was associated with:\n    * Premature adiposity rebound starting at ~2 years of age (usual age is ~6 years)\n    * Early growth acceleration attributed to advanced bone age, followed by blunted pubertal growth\n  * In 69 patients (45 pediatric, 34 adult and 10 in both groups) with available comorbidity-related data, hypertensive diseases and metabolic complications were significantly more prevalent with high versus low GC doses\n    * In pediatric patients, short stature was more common with high versus low GC dose\n  * In 40 patients (27 pediatric, 14 adult and 1 in both groups) with ≥ 3 matched GC-androstenedione records, 92% had ≥ 1 transition in health state over the median 7-year observation period\n    * Higher GC dose with androstenedione < upper limit of normal (ULN) was the most common health state observed at the first recorded datapoint (48%), with only 3% maintaining that health state throughout the observation period\n    * Although 22% of patients presented with lower GC and androstenedione <ULN at the start of the observation period, none sustained this health state throughout the observation period; all patients (100%) had a higher GC dose and/or loss of androstenedione control at some point in their health state patient journey\n    * Limitations included absence of temporal context, variation in observational period and number of records per patient and blood draw timing\n\n\n\n\"Higher rates of overweight/obesity, hypertensive and metabolic comorbidities related to high glucocorticoid dosing and androgen excess were seen across all age groups in this study,\" said Oksana Lekarev, D.O., Associate Professor of Clinical Pediatrics, Co-Medical Director of the Weill Cornell Medicine Comprehensive Care Center for Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia and an Associate Attending Pediatrician at New York-Presbyterian/Weill Cornell Medical Center and member of the CAHtalog Scientific Advisory Board. \"The variability in control of adrenal androgens throughout the observation period underscores the difficulty in reaching a steady state in adrenal control and highlights the challenges that physicians face in managing CAH over a patient's lifetime.\"\n\n**CAHtalog TM Registry—Natural History of CAH**The results of a longitudinal study were presented using medical records from the CAHtalog registry and provided insight into the natural history of classic CAH, including the height and weight trends that carry across pediatric and adult patient groups (Poster# SUN-417). Data were analyzed from 42 pediatric patients (55% female) and 32 adult patients (72% female) enrolled in the registry. Median duration of observation was 9 years in pediatric patients and 13 years in adults. The findings included:\n\n  * Pediatric patients had early growth acceleration followed by blunted pubertal growth. This trend was more pronounced in females, with mean height-for-age generally exceeding the 90th percentile at ages 4–10 years but dropping below 50th percentile at ages 13–17 years.\n  * Mean bone age-to-chronological age ratios were highest in females aged 5 years and males aged 7 years.\n  * The mean body mass index (BMI)-for-age consistently exceeded the 85th percentile (i.e., overweight or obese) in males aged ≥ 5 years and females aged ≥ 6 years.\n  * Across adult age groups in both sexes, median BMI met the threshold for overweight (≥ 25 kg/m2) or obesity (≥30 kg/m2).\n    * 83% of female patients (all ages) and 100% of male patients had a BMI ≥ 25 kg/m2\n    * 74% of female patients and 33% of males had a BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2\n  * Obesity, hypertension, fatigue, acne, and hyperlipidemia were common, particularly among adults. Among adults, the comorbidity of obesity (68%) was more prevalent than in the general population (42%).\n\n\n\nAnalyses of these real-world data highlight the limitations of current conventional GC therapies, which usually require supraphysiologic doses to manage adrenal androgen excess. High rates of comorbidities related to GC treatment and androgen excess indicate the challenges with current GC treatments in maintaining androgen control without causing adverse effects.\n\n\"CAHtalog Registry data reveals a persistent abnormal growth pattern in children, characterized by accelerated growth in early childhood and deceleration in adolescence, along with early obesity that was sustained into adulthood,\" said Perrin C. White, M.D., Chief, Division of Pediatric Endocrinology at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, and a member of the CAHtalog Scientific Advisory Board. \"These patterns along with high frequencies of comorbidities, including hypertension, fatigue, acne, hyperlipidemia, and insomnia and sleep disturbances, demonstrate the need for optimized disease management in patients living with CAH.\"\n\n**Claims-Based Cohort Analysis—Disease- and GC-Related Comorbidities in CAH** A retrospective cohort study was conducted analyzing insurance claims from 2020-2022 within the Merative MarketScan commercial and Medicaid databases (Poster #SUN-437). The frequency of comorbidities related to adrenal androgen excess and/or supraphysiologic GC dosing was captured using International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD-10) codes. Matching between the CAH and general population (GenPop) cohorts was based on age, sex, payer type, region and enrollment duration with a 1:5 ratio (CAH:GenPop). Compared with GenPop, CAH patients had significantly greater rates of multiple chronic conditions related to both excess adrenal androgens and supraphysiologic GC doses, including short stature, anxiety disorders, and diabetes.\n\n  * Top significant comorbidities in adults with CAH versus GenPop:\n    * Anxiety disorders—34% versus 26%\n    * Fatigue—27% versus 18%\n    * Depression—26% versus 19%\n    * Obesity—23% versus 13%\n    * Hirsutism/excess hair (female only)—11% vs 1%\n  * Top significant comorbidities in pediatric patients with CAH versus GenPop\n    * Obesity—14% versus 5%\n    * Fatigue—13% versus 6%\n    * Anxiety disorders—12% versus 8%\n    * Hirsutism/excess hair (female only)—11% versus 1%\n    * Acne—10% versus 6%\n\n\n\n\"These data show a statistically higher clinical burden of CAH compared with a matched control, with patients of all ages suffering comorbidities that result from high adrenal androgens, such as short stature and hirsutism, and from supraphysiologic GC dosing, such as cardiovascular disease, metabolic disorders, and bone loss,\" Dr. Roberts said. \"The data show that many of these comorbidities are chronic, with cardiovascular disease and the associated risk factors such as obesity and hypertension increasing in prevalence as patients age. This amplifies the clinical burden and demonstrates the significant need for a new treatment approach.\"\n\nNeurocrine Biosciences posters presented at ENDO 2024 included:\n\n  * **(OR20-05):** CAHtalyst: Results from the Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Period of a Phase 3 Trial of Crinecerfont, a Corticotropin-Releasing Factor Type 1 Receptor (CRF1) Antagonist, in Adults with Classic Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia\n  * **(Poster #SUN-441):** CAHtalyst: Results from the Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Period of a Phase 3 Trial of Crinecerfont, a Corticotropin-Releasing Factor Type 1 Receptor (CRF1) Antagonist, in Children and Adolescents with Classic Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia\n  * **(Poster #SUN-685):** Negative Impacts of Supraphysiologic Glucocorticoid Dosing in Patients with Classic Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia: An Analysis of Data from the CAHtalog™ Registry\n  * **(Poster #SAT-437):** Disease- and Glucocorticoid-related Comorbidities in Classic Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia: A Claims-Based Retrospective Cohort Analysis\n  * **(Poster #SUN-417):** Natural History of Classic Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia: Results from Pediatric and Adult Patients in the CAHtalog Registry\n  * **(Poster #MON-676, RF36-01):** CHAMPAIN Study: Initial Results from a Phase II Study of Efficacy, Safety and Tolerability of Modified-Release Hydrocortisones: Chronocort® (Efmody®) versus Plenadren, in Primary Adrenal Insufficiency\n  * **(Poster #SAT-427):** Incidence of Adrenal Crisis in Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia (CAH) Patients During a Prospective Monitored Long-Term Study of Modified-Release Hydrocortisone (MRHC) Capsules, (Efmody)\n  * **(Poster #SAT-412):** Morning Cortisol Levels in Patients with Established Primary Adrenal Insufficiency\n\n\n\n**About Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia** Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) is a rare genetic condition that results in an enzyme deficiency that alters the production of adrenal hormones which are essential for life. Approximately 95% of CAH cases are caused by a mutation that leads to deficiency of the enzyme 21-hydroxylase. Severe deficiency of this enzyme leads to an inability of the adrenal glands to produce cortisol and, in approximately 75% of cases, aldosterone. If left untreated, CAH can result in salt wasting, dehydration, and even death.\n\nGlucocorticoids (GCs) are currently used not only to correct the endogenous cortisol deficiency, but doses used are higher than cortisol replacement needed (supraphysiologic) to lower the levels of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and adrenal androgens. However, glucocorticoid treatment at supraphysiologic doses has been associated with serious and significant complications of steroid excess, including metabolic issues such as weight gain and diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and osteoporosis. Additionally, long-term treatment with supraphysiologic GC doses may have psychological and cognitive impact, such as changes in mood and memory. Adrenal androgen excess has been associated with abnormal bone growth and development in pediatric patients, female health problems such as acne, excess hair growth and menstrual irregularities, testicular rest tumors in males, and fertility issues in both sexes.To learn more about CAH, click [here](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4180345-1&h=978140872&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.neurocrine.com%2Fdiseases-and-conditions%2F&a=here).\n\n**About Crinecerfont and the CAHtalyst****TM****Studies** Crinecerfont is an investigational, oral, selective corticotropin-releasing factor type 1 receptor (CRF1) antagonist being developed to reduce and control excess adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and adrenal androgens through a glucocorticoid-independent mechanism for the treatment of congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency. Antagonism of CRF1 receptors in the pituitary has been shown to decrease ACTH levels, which in turn decreases the production of adrenal androgens and potentially the symptoms associated with CAH. Our data demonstrate that lowering adrenal androgen levels enables lower, more physiologic dosing of glucocorticoids and thus could potentially reduce the complications associated with exposure to greater than normal glucocorticoid doses in patients with CAH.\n\nThe CAHtalyst™ Pediatric and Adult Phase 3 global registrational studies are designed to evaluate the safety, efficacy, and tolerability of crinecerfont in children and adolescents, and adults respectively, with congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency. The primary portions of the CAHtalyst Phase 3 studies have completed and enrollment is closed, while the open-label extension treatment portions of both studies are ongoing. Data from the CAHtalyst Pediatric and CAHtalyst Adult Phase 3 studies supported two New Drug Application submissions to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in April 2024.\n\nTo learn more about crinecerfont and the CAHtalyst studies, click [here](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4180345-1&h=3251879276&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.neurocrine.com%2Fpipeline%2F%23CAH&a=here).\n\n**About the CAHtalog****™****Registry** In 2021, the CARES Foundation, Neurocrine Biosciences and PicnicHealth partnered to establish the CAHtalog (**C** ongenital **A** drenal **H** yperplasia: Patien**t** and Clinic**al** **O** utcomes in Real-World Practice Settin**g** s) Registry.

(Nasdaq: NBIX) today announced that the primary study results from its CAHtalyst™ Pediatric Phase 3 study investigating crinecerfont for the treatment of congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency have been published in _The New England Journal of Medicine_ [online edition](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4180737-1&h=1569173031&u=https%3A%2F%2Fc212.net%2Fc%2Flink%2F%3Ft%3D0%26l%3Den%26o%3D4180737-1%26h%3D3281683469%26u%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.nejm.org%252Fstoken%252Fdefault%252Bdomain%252FREPRINTS_36381%252Ffull%253FredirectUri%253D%252Fdoi%252Ffull%252F10.1056%252FNEJMoa2404655%26a%3Donline%2Bedition&a=online+edition) and will appear in a future print issue of the journal. The CAHtalyst Pediatric Phase 3 study met the primary and key secondary endpoints related to androgen reduction (during an initial glucocorticoid-stable period) and glucocorticoid (GC) dose reduction while maintaining androgen control. Favorable trends were observed with endpoints that reflect the consequences of long-term supraphysiologic glucocorticoid therapy and androgen excess. In addition to appearing in _The New England Journal of Medicine_ , CAHtalyst Pediatric Phase 3 data were presented at [ENDO 2024](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4180737-1&h=2234841790&u=https%3A%2F%2Fc212.net%2Fc%2Flink%2F%3Ft%3D0%26l%3Den%26o%3D4180737-1%26h%3D2042925032%26u%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.endocrine.org%252Fmeetings-and-events%252Fendo-2024%26a%3DENDO%2B2024&a=ENDO+2024) (Poster #SUN-441).\n\n\"In treating children with CAH, from the moment they are diagnosed we are challenged with finding a balance between supraphysiologic glucocorticoid dosing and the need to prevent androgen excess. Tipping the scale too far one way or the other can adversely impact growth and pubertal development,\" said Kyriakie Sarafoglou, M.D., Professor, Department of Pediatrics and Department of Experimental and Clinical Pharmacology, Divisions of Endocrinology and Genetics & Metabolism, at the University of Minnesota. \"Based on the CAHtalyst Pediatric study results, crinecerfont represents a potential non-glucocorticoid therapeutic approach to meet this challenge. In addition to meeting primary and key secondary endpoints related to reducing elevated androstenedione and supraphysiologic glucocorticoid dosing during the 28-week study, treatment with crinecerfont also showed favorable trends in ameliorating the consequences of the current treatment paradigm, with reductions in body weight, improved insulin resistance, and reduced hirsutism in females.\"\n\nCrinecerfont is an investigational, oral, selective corticotropin-releasing factor type 1 receptor (CRF1) antagonist being developed to reduce and control excess adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and adrenal androgens through a GC-independent mechanism for the treatment of CAH.\n\n\"The outstanding results achieved in the CAHtalyst Pediatric Phase 3 study demonstrate the ability of crinecerfont to reduce elevated androstenedione levels while also enabling reduction in supraphysiologic glucocorticoid doses to more physiologic level dosing while maintaining androgen control in pediatric participants with CAH,\" said Eiry W. Roberts, M.D., Chief Medical Officer at Neurocrine Biosciences. \"This could potentially enable physicians to fundamentally change their approach to the important task of controlling androgens in pediatric patients with crinecerfont, without the need for long-term supraphysiologic steroid dosing, thus removing the burden that long-term excess glucocorticoid use places on development and outcome for these patients.\"\n\nThe CAHtalyst Pediatric Phase 3 global registrational study was conducted in 103 participants and designed to evaluate the safety, efficacy, and tolerability of crinecerfont in children and adolescents ages 2 to 17 years with CAH due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency. Over 95% of participants completed the 28-week double-blind, placebo-controlled treatment period of the study with minimal missing data.\n\nThe Phase 3 Pediatric study met the primary endpoint of change from baseline in androstenedione (key adrenal androgen) following the initial 4-week GC-stable period.\n\n  * Crinecerfont treatment led to a significantly greater reduction in androstenedione compared to an increase with placebo at Week 4 (least squares mean [LSM] change from baseline of -196.8 ng/dL versus +71.0 ng/dL, with least squares mean difference [LSMD] of -268 ng/dL, P < 0.001). Actual value is P < 0.0001. (Figure A)\n\n\n\nAfter Week 4 and through Week 28, mean androstenedione remained below baseline in the context of reduced GC dose with crinecerfont but increased above baseline in the placebo group despite increased GC dose, highlighting the challenge of maintaining androgen control even with supraphysiologic GC doses in pediatric patients enrolled in this trial.\n\n[![](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2427665/Journal_Figure_A_Sarafoglou_Infographic.jpg)](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2427665/Journal_Figure_A_Sarafoglou_Infographic.html)\n\nThe Phase 3 Pediatric study also met the key secondary endpoint of percent change from baseline in GC dose (while maintaining androstenedione control) and the secondary endpoint of achievement of reduction to a physiologic GC dose (while maintaining androstenedione control) at Week 28:\n\n  * Crinecerfont treatment led to a significantly greater GC dose reduction at Week 28 while maintaining androstenedione control compared to placebo (LSM change from baseline of -18% versus +5.6%, with LSMD of -23.5%; P < 0.001). Actual value is P < 0.0001.

(Figure D)\n\n\n\nDespite the short-term duration of this Phase 3 study, favorable trends were observed for endpoints associated with long-term supraphysiologic GC therapy such as body mass index standard deviation score and insulin resistance that were encouraging considering the relatively short time frame of reduced GC dose. In addition, there was reduction in hirsutism (excessive hair growth) in female participants and improvement in the androstenedione to testosterone ratio in male participants.\n\nCrinecerfont was generally well tolerated, with the most common adverse events being headache, fever and vomiting. There were no adrenal crises in either group. Few serious adverse events occurred, with none assessed as related to crinecerfont, and there were few discontinuations due to adverse events. No events of adrenal crisis were reported during the double-blind period, and the incidence of adverse events leading to glucocorticoid stress dosing was similar in the crinecerfont and placebo groups.\n\nNote: P-values in the text and figures reflect the Journal's convention of calculating to two significant figures.

Approximately 95% of CAH cases are caused by a mutation that leads to deficiency of the enzyme 21-hydroxylase (21-OHD). Severe deficiency of this enzyme leads to an inability of the adrenal glands to produce cortisol and, in approximately 75% of cases, aldosterone. If left untreated, CAH can result in salt wasting, dehydration, and even death.\n\nGlucocorticoids (GCs) are currently used not only to correct the endogenous cortisol deficiency, but doses used are higher than cortisol replacement needed (supraphysiologic) to lower the levels of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and adrenal androgens. However, glucocorticoid treatment at supraphysiologic doses has been associated with serious and significant complications of steroid excess, including metabolic issues such as weight gain and diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and osteoporosis. Additionally, long-term treatment with supraphysiologic GC doses may have psychological and cognitive impact, such as changes in mood and memory. Adrenal androgen excess has been associated with abnormal bone growth and development in pediatric patients, female health problems such as acne, excess hair growth and menstrual irregularities, testicular rest tumors in males, and fertility issues in both sexes.To learn more about CAH, click [here](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4180737-1&h=3590325264&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.neurocrine.com%2Fdiseases-and-conditions%2F&a=here).\n\n**About Crinecerfont and the CAHtalyst™ Studies** Crinecerfont is an investigational, oral, selective corticotropin-releasing factor type 1 receptor (CRF1) antagonist being developed to reduce and control excess adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and adrenal androgens through a glucocorticoid-independent mechanism for the treatment of congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency. Antagonism of CRF1 receptors in the pituitary has been shown to decrease ACTH levels, which in turn decreases the production of adrenal androgens and potentially the symptoms associated with CAH. Our data demonstrate that lowering adrenal androgen levels enables lower, more physiologic dosing of glucocorticoids and thus could potentially reduce the complications associated with exposure to greater than normal glucocorticoid doses in patients with CAH.\n\nThe CAHtalyst™ Pediatric and Adult Phase 3 global registrational studies are designed to evaluate the safety, efficacy, and tolerability of crinecerfont in children and adolescents, and adults respectively, with congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency. The primary portions of the CAHtalyst Phase 3 studies have completed and enrollment is closed, while the open-label extension treatment portions of both studies are ongoing. Data from the CAHtalyst Pediatric and CAHtalyst Adult Phase 3 studies supported two New Drug Application submissions to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in April 2024.\n\nTo learn more about crinecerfont and the CAHtalyst studies, click [here](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4180737-1&h=765364148&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.neurocrine.com%2Fpipeline%2F%23CAH&a=here).\n\n**About Neurocrine Biosciences, Inc.** Neurocrine Biosciences is a leading neuroscience-focused, biopharmaceutical company with a simple purpose: to relieve suffering for people with great needs, but few options.

Glucocorticoid Dose Reduction While Maintaining Androstenedione Control - 62.7% of Crinecerfont Participants Achieved a Physiologic Glucocorticoid Dose while Maintaining Androstenedione Control versus 17.5% of Placebo Participants - Favorable Trends in Endpoints Reflecting Consequences of Supraphysiologic Glucocorticoid Dosing - Crinecerfont was Generally Well Tolerated\n\nSAN DIEGO, June 3, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- [Neurocrine Biosciences, Inc.](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4180736-1&h=3907043378&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.neurocrine.com%2F&a=Neurocrine+Biosciences%2C+Inc.) (Nasdaq: NBIX) today announced that the primary study results from its CAHtalyst™ Phase 3 study investigating crinecerfont for the treatment of adults ages 18 and older with congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency have been published in _The New England Journal of Medicine_ [online edition](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4180736-1&h=915865900&u=https%3A%2F%2Fc212.net%2Fc%2Flink%2F%3Ft%3D0%26l%3Den%26o%3D4180736-1%26h%3D3406517106%26u%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.nejm.org%252Fstoken%252Fdefault%252Bdomain%252FREPRINTS_36381%252Ffull%253FredirectUri%253D%252Fdoi%252Ffull%252F10.1056%252FNEJMoa2404656%26a%3Donline%2Bedition&a=online+edition) and will appear in a future print issue of the journal. The study met the primary and important key secondary endpoints related to androgen reduction (during an initial glucocorticoid-stable period) and glucocorticoid (GC) dose reduction while maintaining androgen control. Favorable trends were observed with endpoints that reflect the consequences of long-term supraphysiologic glucocorticoid therapy. In addition to being published in _The New England Journal of Medicine_ , CAHtalyst Adult Phase 3 data were presented at [ENDO 2024](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4180736-1&h=3229369054&u=https%3A%2F%2Fc212.net%2Fc%2Flink%2F%3Ft%3D0%26l%3Den%26o%3D4180736-1%26h%3D3091877928%26u%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.endocrine.org%252Fmeetings-and-events%252Fendo-2024%26a%3DENDO%2B2024&a=ENDO+2024) in an oral presentation by Dr. Richard Auchus.\n\n\"Since the 1950s, glucocorticoids have been required not only for cortisol replacement, but also to control the excessive amount of adrenal androgens in patients with congenital adrenal hyperplasia. As a result, CAH patients suffer from a higher prevalence of disorders attributable to supraphysiologic GC levels, including osteoporosis, obesity, insulin resistance, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia and hypertension,\" said Dr. Richard Auchus, M.D., Ph.D., Principal Investigator, Professor of Pharmacology and Internal Medicine, Division of Metabolism, Endocrinology, and Diabetes at the University of Michigan. \"The CAHtalyst Adult Phase 3 study demonstrated that crinecerfont achieved a significantly greater GC reduction from Week 4 through Week 24 than placebo while androstenedione was maintained and did so safely. Crinecerfont could be the treatment alternative that we've needed to effectively treat our CAH patients while mitigating the comorbidities found with the existing treatment paradigm.\"\n\nCrinecerfont is an investigational, oral, selective corticotropin-releasing factor type 1 receptor (CRF1) antagonist being developed to reduce and control excess adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and adrenal androgens through a GC-independent mechanism for the treatment of CAH.\n\n\"The CAHtalyst Adult Phase 3 study demonstrated the ability of crinecerfont to substantially reduce glucocorticoid doses to more physiologic levels while maintaining or improving androgen control,\" said Eiry W. Roberts, M.D., Chief Medical Officer at Neurocrine Biosciences. \"This represents a potential paradigm shift in treatment for adult patients living with this disorder over many years, who consistently struggle with the clinical consequences of poor androgen control and/or excess glucocorticoid caused by current inadequate treatment approaches.\"\n\nThe CAHtalyst Adult Phase 3 global registrational study was conducted in 182 participants and designed to evaluate the safety, efficacy, and tolerability of crinecerfont in adults ages 18 years and older with CAH due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency. Over 95% of participants completed the 24-week double-blind, placebo-controlled treatment period of the study with minimal missing data.\n\nThe Phase 3 Adult study met the primary endpoint of percent change from baseline in GC dose (while maintaining androstenedione control) and the key secondary endpoint of achievement of reduction to a physiologic GC dose (while maintaining androstenedione control) at Week 24.\n\n  * Crinecerfont treatment led to a significantly greater GC dose reduction at Week 24 while maintaining androstenedione control compared to placebo (least squares mean [LSM] percent change from baseline of -27.3% versus -10.3%, with LS mean difference [LSMD] of -17.0%, P < 0.001). Actual value is P < 0.0001. (Figure A)\n    * This corresponded to changes of -4.8 and -2.1 mg/m2/day hydrocortisone equivalents for crinecerfont and placebo, respectively\n  * After the initial 4-week GC stable period, mean percent GC reduction (while androstenedione was controlled) was greater with crinecerfont than placebo at all timepoints, and this effect was maintained from Weeks 12 to 24, while GC levels increased from Weeks 12 to 24 for participants on placebo.\n\n\n\n[![](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2427662/Journal_figure_A_Auchus.jpg)](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2427662/Journal_figure_A_Auchus.html)\n\nImportantly, a significantly greater proportion of participants treated with crinecerfont achieved reduction to a physiologic GC dose (≤ 11 mg/m2/day) while maintaining androstenedione control compared to placebo (62.7% vs. 17.5%; P < 0.001). Actual value is P < 0.0001. (Figure B)\n\n[![](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2427663/Journal_Figure_B_Auchus.jpg)](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2427663/Journal_Figure_B_Auchus.html)\n\nThe Phase 3 Adult study also met the key secondary endpoint of change from baseline in androstenedione (key adrenal androgen) following the initial 4-week GC stable period:\n\n  * Crinecerfont treatment led to a significantly greater reduction in androstenedione compared to an increase with placebo at Week 4 (LS mean change from baseline of -299 ng/dL versus +45.5 ng/dL, with LSMD of -345 ng/dL; P < 0.001). Actual value is P < 0.0001.\n  * The significant reduction in androstenedione levels while GC was stable provides clear evidence of the ability of crinecerfont to reduce elevated adrenal androgen levels through a non-GC mechanism.\n\n\n\nAt Week 24, mean androstenedione levels remained below baseline with crinecerfont in the context of substantially reduced GC dose. However, androstenedione levels increased to above baseline with placebo, highlighting the inability to maintain androgen control when GC was reduced in the absence of any other intervention. (Figure C)\n\n[![](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2427664/Journal_Figure_C_Auchus.jpg)](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2427664/Journal_Figure_C_Auchus.html)\n\nDespite the short-term duration of this Phase 3 study, favorable trends were observed for endpoints associated with long-term supraphysiologic GC therapy such as body weight, insulin resistance, and glucose tolerance that were encouraging considering the relatively short time frame of reduced GC dose. In addition, bone resorption and formation markers increased more with crinecerfont, reflecting relief from GC-induced suppression of bone turnover. \n\nCrinecerfont was generally well tolerated, with the most common adverse events being fatigue and headache. Few serious adverse events occurred, with none assessed as related to crinecerfont, and there were few discontinuations due to adverse events. There was no safety concern related to adrenal crisis, with few events reported during the double-blind period and similar incidence of adverse events leading to glucocorticoid stress dosing in the crinecerfont and placebo groups.\n\nNote: P-values in the text and figures reflect the Journal's convention of calculating to two significant figures. Actual P-values to three significant figures are also provided.

Approximately 95% of CAH cases are caused by a mutation that leads to deficiency of the enzyme 21-hydroxylase (21-OHD). Severe deficiency of this enzyme leads to an inability of the adrenal glands to produce cortisol and, in approximately 75% of cases, aldosterone. If left untreated, CAH can result in salt wasting, dehydration, and even death.\n\nGlucocorticoids (GCs) are currently used not only to correct the endogenous cortisol deficiency, but doses used are higher than cortisol replacement needed (supraphysiologic) to lower the levels of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and adrenal androgens. However, glucocorticoid treatment at supraphysiologic doses has been associated with serious and significant complications of steroid excess, including metabolic issues such as weight gain and diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and osteoporosis. Additionally, long-term treatment with supraphysiologic GC doses may have psychological and cognitive impact, such as changes in mood and memory. Adrenal androgen excess has been associated with abnormal bone growth and development in pediatric patients, female health problems such as acne, excess hair growth and menstrual irregularities, testicular rest tumors in males, and fertility issues in both sexes.To learn more about CAH, click [here](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4180736-1&h=395238352&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.neurocrine.com%2Fdiseases-and-conditions%2F&a=here).\n\n**About Crinecerfont and the CAHtalyst™ Studies** Crinecerfont is an investigational, oral, selective corticotropin-releasing factor type 1 receptor (CRF1) antagonist being developed to reduce and control excess adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and adrenal androgens through a glucocorticoid-independent mechanism for the treatment of congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency. Antagonism of CRF1 receptors in the pituitary has been shown to decrease ACTH levels, which in turn decreases the production of adrenal androgens and potentially the symptoms associated with CAH. Our data demonstrate that lowering adrenal androgen levels enables lower, more physiologic dosing of glucocorticoids and thus could potentially reduce the complications associated with exposure to greater than normal glucocorticoid doses in patients with CAH.\n\nThe CAHtalyst™ Pediatric and Adult Phase 3 global registrational studies are designed to evaluate the safety, efficacy, and tolerability of crinecerfont in children and adolescents, and adults respectively, with congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency. The primary portions of the CAHtalyst Phase 3 studies have completed and enrollment is closed, while the open-label treatment portions of both studies are ongoing.

Announces CEO Succession Plan\n\n05/28/24\n\n[PDF Version](/node/21141/pdf)\n\n_Board of Directors appoints Kyle Gano, Ph.D., Chief Business Development and Strategy Officer, as CEO-elect, effective October 11, 2024 _\n\n_Kevin Gorman , Ph.D., to continue to serve on the Neurocrine_  _Board of Directors_\n\nSAN DIEGO, May 28, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Neurocrine Biosciences, Inc. (Nasdaq: NBIX), today announced that Kevin Gorman, Ph.D., will retire as Chief Executive Officer of Neurocrine on October 11, 2024. Kyle Gano, Ph.D., currently Neurocrine's Chief Business Development and Strategy Officer, will succeed him in the CEO role. Dr. Gano will also join the Company's Board of Directors at that time, and Dr. Gorman will continue to serve on the Neurocrine Board.\n\n[ ![\\(PRNewsfoto/Neurocrine Biosciences, Inc.\\)](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/678850/Neurocrine_Biosciences_Logo.jpg) ](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/678850/Neurocrine_Biosciences_Logo.html)\n\nDr. Gorman founded Neurocrine in 1992 and held numerous positions across the Company, including Chief Operating Officer, Chief Business Officer, and Senior Vice President of Business Development, before being appointed CEO in 2008. Under Dr. Gorman's three decades of leadership, Neurocrine has emerged as a fully integrated biopharmaceutical enterprise with a broad, mature pipeline, strong financial position, and highly successful commercial product, INGREZZA® (valbenazine). Dr. Gorman's vision to focus on areas that lack recent innovation or have limited treatment options has provided the Company with meaningful momentum in its mission to discover and develop new medicines that relieve patient suffering. Notably, in late April, Neurocrine submitted to the FDA two New Drug Applications for crinecerfont as a treatment for adult and pediatric patients with classic congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH). In addition, the Company now has 17 clinical development programs in its pipeline focusing on helping patients across neurology, neuroendocrinology, and neuropsychology. With a growing multi-billion-dollar medicine in INGREZZA, a rich and diverse pipeline, and a strong financial profile, Neurocrine is well positioned to execute on a bold vision for future growth and impact.\n\n\"It has been a privilege to lead the Neurocrine team in developing life-changing treatments for patients in need,\" Dr. Gorman said. \"When I took on the role of CEO in 2008, Neurocrine was a clinical stage company with a limited pipeline and no approved products. Together, we have built a diverse pipeline and a leading R&D innovation engine designed to rapidly deliver up to four INDs per year. We successfully launched INGREZZA, which has driven strong financial results while improving the treatment of tardive dyskinesia and chorea associated with Huntington's disease. Importantly, we are working diligently to be prepared to bring crinecerfont to patients with CAH next year, if approved. I couldn't be prouder of all that this team has accomplished, and I have never been more confident in Neurocrine's future.\"\n\nDr. Gorman continued, \"With the foundation of a world-class team, compelling science, and clear vision, it is the right time to initiate this well-planned leadership transition. The Board of Directors is confident Kyle is the ideal CEO to lead Neurocrine's next chapter of growth, as am I. We have worked closely together for more than 20 years. He has been instrumental in Neurocrine's success and is an exceptional leader of the organization. I look forward to supporting him in my continuing role as a member of the Neurocrine Board.\"\n\n\"I believe deeply in Neurocrine's values and mission, and I am honored to take the reins from an amazing leader and mentor,\" Dr. Gano said. \"This is an important year for our organization, as we look to help even more patients with tardive dyskinesia and Huntington's disease through INGREZZA, while potentially bringing crinecerfont to CAH patients in 2025 – all while advancing our pipeline. I look forward to continuing to work closely with our leadership team and the Board to capitalize on our momentum and advance our vision to be a true global leader in neuroscience.\" \n\n\"On behalf of the Board, I thank Kevin for his unwavering dedication to Neurocrine Biosciences over the past three decades and wish him the very best in his well-deserved retirement,\" said William H. Rastetter, Ph.D., Chairman of the Board of Neurocrine Biosciences. \"Having worked closely with Kevin on succession planning, and knowing Kyle well, we're thrilled to appoint Kyle as Neurocrine's CEO-elect and look forward to welcoming him to the Board. We are confident that, with Kyle's deep substantive expertise, broad experience working with functions throughout the Company, and clear vision for the future, Neurocrine will continue to grow and succeed as a leading neuroscience-focused company for the benefit of patients, employees, and shareholders.\"\n\n**About Kyle Gano**Kyle W. Gano, Ph.D., is a proven executive who joined Neurocrine Biosciences more than 23 years ago. After beginning his career at Neurocrine in a market research and analytics role, Dr. Gano has spent the better part of the last two decades focused on business and corporate development, assuming the position of Chief Business Development Officer in 2011 and Chief Business Development and Strategy Officer in 2020. In his current role, Dr. Gano oversees the Company's strategic collaborations across multiple therapeutic areas that bring critical treatments to patients suffering from neurological, neuroendocrine, and neuropsychiatric disorders. During his tenure, he has executed and managed many robust partnerships, including those that are currently active with AbbVie, Idorsia Ltd, Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma, Nxera Pharma (formerly Sosei Heptares), Sanofi S.A., Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited, Voyager Therapeutics, and Xenon Pharmaceuticals. He also led the acquisition of Diurnal Group Plc in 2021, expanding Neurocrine's presence to the United Kingdom and European Union. Beyond his business development and strategy portfolio, Dr. Gano has led numerous high-impact operational and business priorities. These include having been the lead inventor on the patent to the valbenazine molecule, having served as Team Lead for both the elagolix development program and VMAT2 Franchise Team, and currently holding oversight responsibility for all muscarinic development teams and activities. He also played key leadership roles in the development of three FDA-approved medicines – INGREZZA® (valbenazine), ORILISSA® (elagolix), and ORIAHNN® (elagolix, estradiol, and norethindrone).\n\nDr. Gano serves on the Board of Directors of California Life Sciences (CLS). He received his B.S. in Chemistry from the University of Oregon, B.S. in Biochemistry from the University of Washington, and his Ph.D. in Organic Chemistry and M.B.A from the University of California, Los Angeles.\n\n**About Neurocrine Biosciences, Inc.**Neurocrine Biosciences is a neuroscience-focused, biopharmaceutical company with a simple purpose: to relieve suffering for people with great needs, but few options.

While the specific way INGREZZA works to treat TD and HD chorea is not fully understood, INGREZZA selectively targets VMAT2 to inhibit the release of dopamine, a chemical in the brain that helps control movement. INGREZZA is believed to reduce extra dopamine signaling, which may lead to fewer uncontrollable movements. Additionally, INGREZZA can be taken as one capsule, once daily together with most psychiatric medications such as antipsychotics or antidepressants. INGREZZA dosages approved for use are 40 mg, 60 mg and 80 mg capsules. INGREZZA is not approved in any other dosage form.\n\n**Important Information**\n\n**Approved Uses** INGREZZA® (valbenazine) capsules or INGREZZA® SPRINKLE (valbenazine) capsules are prescription medicines used to treat adults with:\n\n  * movements in the face, tongue, or other body parts that cannot be controlled (tardive dyskinesia).\n  * involuntary movements (chorea) of Huntington's disease. INGREZZA or INGREZZA SPRINKLE do not cure the cause of involuntary movements, and do not treat other symptoms of Huntington's disease, such as problems with thinking or emotions.\n\n\n\nIt is not known if INGREZZA or INGREZZA SPRINKLE is safe and effective in children.\n\n**IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION**\n\n**VMAT2 inhibitors, including INGREZZA and INGREZZA SPRINKLE, can cause serious side effects in people with Huntington's disease, including: depression, suicidal thoughts, or suicidal actions.** Tell your healthcare provider before you start taking INGREZZA or INGREZZA SPRINKLE if you have Huntington's disease and are depressed (have untreated depression or depression that is not well controlled by medicine) or have suicidal thoughts. Pay close attention to any changes, especially sudden changes, in mood, behaviors, thoughts, or feelings. This is especially important when INGREZZA or INGREZZA SPRINKLE is started and when the dose is changed. Call your healthcare provider right away if you become depressed, have unusual changes in mood or behavior, or have thoughts of hurting yourself.\n\n**Do not take INGREZZA or INGREZZA SPRINKLE if you:**\n\n  * are allergic to valbenazine, or any of the ingredients in INGREZZA or INGREZZA SPRINKLE.\n\n\n\n**INGREZZA or INGREZZA SPRINKLE can cause serious side effects, including:**\n\n  * **Allergic reactions.** Allergic reactions, including an allergic reaction that causes sudden swelling called angioedema, can happen after taking the first dose or after many doses of INGREZZA or INGREZZA SPRINKLE. Signs and symptoms of allergic reactions and angioedema include: trouble breathing or shortness of breath, swelling of your face, lips, eyelids, tongue, or throat, or other areas of your skin, trouble with swallowing, or rash, including raised, itchy red areas on your skin (hives). Swelling in the throat can be life-threatening and can lead to death. Stop taking INGREZZA or INGREZZA SPRINKLE and go to the nearest emergency room right away if you develop these signs and symptoms of allergic reactions and angioedema.\n\n\n  * **Sleepiness and tiredness that could cause slow reaction times (somnolence and sedation).** Do not drive a car or operate dangerous machinery until you know how INGREZZA or INGREZZA SPRINKLE affects you. Drinking alcohol and taking other medicines may also cause sleepiness during treatment with INGREZZA or INGREZZA SPRINKLE.\n\n\n  * **Heart rhythm problems (QT prolongation).** INGREZZA or INGREZZA SPRINKLE may cause a heart rhythm problem known as QT prolongation. You have a higher chance of getting QT prolongation if you also take certain other medicines during treatment with INGREZZA or INGREZZA SPRINKLE. Tell your healthcare provider right away if you develop any signs or symptoms of QT prolongation, including: fast, slow, or irregular heartbeat (heart palpitations), shortness of breath, dizziness or lightheadedness, or fainting or feeling like you are going to faint.\n\n\n  * **Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS).** NMS is a serious condition that can lead to death. Call a healthcare provider right away or go to the nearest emergency room if you develop these symptoms and they do not have another obvious cause: high fever, stiff muscles, problems thinking, irregular pulse or blood pressure, increased sweating, or very fast or uneven heartbeat.\n\n\n  * **Parkinson-like symptoms.** Symptoms include: body stiffness, drooling, trouble moving or walking, trouble keeping your balance, shaking (tremors), or falls.\n\n\n\n**Before taking INGREZZA or INGREZZA SPRINKLE, tell your healthcare provider about all of your medical conditions including if you:** have liver or heart problems, are pregnant or plan to become pregnant, or are breastfeeding or plan to breastfeed.\n\n**Tell your healthcare provider about all the medicines you take,** including prescription and over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements. Make sure you tell all of your healthcare providers that you are taking INGREZZA or INGREZZA SPRINKLE. Taking INGREZZA or INGREZZA SPRINKLE with certain other medicines may cause serious side effects. Especially tell your healthcare provider if you: take digoxin or take or have taken a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) medicine. You should not take INGREZZA or INGREZZA SPRINKLE if you are taking, or have stopped taking, a MAOI within the last 14 days.\n\n**The most common side effects of INGREZZA or INGREZZA SPRINKLE in people with tardive dyskinesia** **are** sleepiness and tiredness.\n\n**The most common side effects of INGREZZA or INGREZZA SPRINKLE in people with chorea associated with Huntington's disease include **sleepiness and tiredness, raised itchy red areas on your skin (hives), rash, and trouble getting to sleep or staying asleep.\n\nThese are not all of the possible side effects of INGREZZA or INGREZZA SPRINKLE.

Data from both studies supported two New Drug Application submissions to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in April 2024.\n\n**About Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia**\n\nCongenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) is a rare genetic condition that results in an enzyme deficiency that alters the production of adrenal hormones which are essential for life. Approximately 95% of CAH cases are caused by a mutation that leads to deficiency of the enzyme 21-hydroxylase. Severe deficiency of this enzyme can lead to an inability of the adrenal glands to produce cortisol and, in approximately 75% of cases, aldosterone. If left untreated, CAH can result in salt wasting, dehydration and even death.\n\nGlucocorticoids (GCs) are currently used not only to correct the endogenous cortisol deficiency, but doses used are higher than cortisol replacement needed (supraphysiologic) to lower the levels of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and adrenal androgens. However, glucocorticoid treatment at supraphysiologic doses has been associated with serious and significant complications of steroid excess, including metabolic issues, such as weight gain and diabetes, cardiovascular disease and osteoporosis. Additionally, long-term treatment with supraphysiologic GC doses may have psychological and cognitive impact, such as changes in mood and memory. Adrenal androgen excess has been associated with abnormal bone growth and development in pediatric patients, female health problems, such as acne, excess hair growth and menstrual irregularities, testicular rest tumors in males and fertility issues in both sexes. To learn more about CAH, click [here](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4173385-1&h=397317391&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.neurocrine.com%2Fdiseases-and-conditions%2F&a=here).\n\n**About Crinecerfont and the CAHtalyst Studies** Crinecerfont is an investigational, oral, selective corticotropin-releasing factor type 1 receptor (CRF1) antagonist being developed to reduce and control excess adrenal androgens through a glucocorticoid-independent mechanism for the treatment of congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency. Antagonism of CRF1 receptors in the pituitary has been shown to decrease adrenocorticotropic hormone levels, which in turn decreases the production of adrenal androgens and potentially the symptoms associated with CAH. Our data demonstrate that lowering adrenal androgen levels enables lower, more physiologic dosing of glucocorticoids and thus could potentially reduce the complications associated with exposure to greater than normal glucocorticoid doses in patients with CAH.\n\nThe CAHtalyst™ Pediatric and Adult Phase 3 global registrational studies are designed to evaluate the safety, efficacy, and tolerability of crinecerfont in children and adolescents, and adults respectively, with congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency. The primary portions of the CAHtalyst Phase 3 studies have completed and enrollment is closed, while the open-label treatment portions of both studies are ongoing. \n\nTo learn more about crinecerfont and the CAHtalyst studies, click [here](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4173385-1&h=3962574507&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.neurocrine.com%2Fpipeline%2F%23CAH&a=here).\n\n**About Primary Adrenal Insufficiency** Primary adrenal insufficiency is a chronic endocrine condition that occurs when the body does not make enough of certain adrenal hormones, including cortisol and often aldosterone. Glucocorticoids, such as hydrocortisone, are used to replace the missing cortisol, but typical dosing regimens do not match the natural diurnal rhythm of the body's cortisol production.\n\n**About Modified-Release Hydrocortisone** Diurnal Ltd. developed modified-release hydrocortisone, a preparation of hydrocortisone that has been specifically designed to replicate the natural circadian rhythm of cortisol, when given in a twice-a-day \"toothbrush\" regimen, (administered last thing at night before sleep and first thing in the morning on waking). In 2021, modified-release hydrocortisone (EFMODY®) received marketing authorization for the treatment of congenital adrenal hyperplasia from the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) in Great Britain (England, Wales, and Scotland) and from the European Commission in the European Union. Neurocrine Biosciences acquired Diurnal Group plc. in November 2022. A new drug application for the modified-release hydrocortisone formulation has not been submitted to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.\n\n**About CHAMPAIN Study in Adrenal Insufficiency** The CHAMPAIN Phase 2 clinical study compared the efficacy, safety and tolerability of twice daily DNL0200 (Chronocort®), a modified-release hydrocortisone, with once daily Plenadren, a combination of immediate- and delayed-release hydrocortisone (authorized for use in the European Union), over a treatment period of up to 2 months in participants ≥18 years of age and diagnosed with primary adrenal insufficiency.\n\n**About the Phase 3 Extension Study for MRHC in CAH (DIUR-006)** The DIUR-006 Phase 3 open-label extension study assessed the long-term efficacy, safety and tolerability of twice-daily DNL0200 (Chronocort®), a modified-release hydrocortisone in adults with CAH. The study was performed to build on the results of feeder studies DIUR-003 (Phase 2 in adults with CAH) and DIUR-005 (EU Phase 3 Registrational Open-Label Study of Chronocort compared to standard of care in adults with CAH) and evaluate the long-term safety of Chronocort, and also its long-term efficacy in improving control of serum androgen levels (using 17-OHP and A4 as biomarkers).\n\n**About Neurocrine Biosciences, Inc.** Neurocrine Biosciences is a leading neuroscience-focused, biopharmaceutical company with a simple purpose: to relieve suffering for people with great needs, but few options.

Announces Publication of Phase 3 KINECT®-4 Post Hoc Analysis Demonstrating Clinically Meaningful and Sustained Improvement in Tardive Dyskinesia With Long-Term Use of INGREZZA® (valbenazine) Capsules\n\n05/21/24\n\n[PDF Version](/node/21046/pdf)\n\nSAN DIEGO, May 21, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- [Neurocrine Biosciences, Inc.](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4172298-1&h=4167612278&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.neurocrine.com%2F&a=Neurocrine+Biosciences%2C+Inc.) (Nasdaq: NBIX) today announced the publication of data from a post hoc analysis of the Phase 3 KINECT®-4 study of INGREZZA® (valbenazine) capsules in the _[Journal of Clinical Psychopharmacology](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4172298-1&h=60423063&u=https%3A%2F%2Fjournals.lww.com%2Fpsychopharmacology%2Ffulltext%2F9900%2Fsustained_treatment_response_and_global.255.aspx&a=Journal+of+Clinical+Psychopharmacology)_ _._ The analysis assessed long-term outcomes relevant to the real-world management of tardive dyskinesia (TD) and demonstrated that nearly all study participants met the threshold for clinically meaningful improvements in TD symptom severity by Week 48.\n\n[ ![\\(PRNewsfoto/Neurocrine Biosciences, Inc.\\)](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/678850/Neurocrine_Biosciences_Logo.jpg) ](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/678850/Neurocrine_Biosciences_Logo.html)\n\n\"TD is a persistent, debilitating disorder requiring continuous treatment to effectively and sustainably improve symptoms over time,\" said Eiry W. Roberts, M.D., Chief Medical Officer at Neurocrine Biosciences. \"This post hoc analysis, along with previous long-term analyses, demonstrate the reliable, long-term efficacy and tolerability of one-capsule, once-daily INGREZZA to help inform use of this treatment in clinical practice.\"\n\nThe KINECT-4 study implemented an open-label design and on-site assessments of TD severity. The analysis included 103 participants from the Phase 3 KINECT-4 study who completed 48 weeks of treatment with INGREZZA. KINECT-4 was designed to be representative of clinical practice to provide insight into real-world management of TD with INGREZZA.\n\nKey highlights include:\n\n  * At Week 4, 55% of participants experienced clinically meaningful improvement in TD symptom severity on the lowest starting dose (40 mg). A clinically meaningful improvement was defined as a reduction of at least 2 points in the Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS) total score used to assess the severity of involuntary movements in different body regions. Ninety-five percent of participants reached this threshold as soon as Week 24, with 97% achieving it by Week 48. TD improvement was sustained throughout treatment, with an AIMS mean total score reduction from baseline to Week 48 of 10.5.\n  * Eighty-six percent of participants met the response threshold of at least 50% AIMS improvement, and 52% met the higher threshold of at least 70% AIMS improvement at Week 48.\n  * More than 88% of patients and healthcare professionals rated participants' symptoms as \"much improved\" or \"very much improved\" at Week 48, as measured by the Patient Global Impression of Change and Clinical Global Impression of Change-TD, respectively.\n\n\n\nOverall, INGREZZA was generally well tolerated. The most common treatment emergent adverse events reported from Weeks 4 to 48 included urinary tract infection (8.5%) and headache (5.2%).\n\n**About the KINECT** -**4 Phase 3 Study** KINECT®-4 is a Phase 3, open-label study, in which 163 participants with moderate to severe TD and underlying schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder or mood disorder (including bipolar disorder or major depressive disorder) received 48 weeks of open-label treatment with once-daily INGREZZA (40 mg or 80 mg capsules) followed by a four-week washout. Dosing was initiated at 40 mg/day in all participants, with escalation to 80 mg/day at Week 4 based on effectiveness and tolerability. Dose reduction to 40 mg was allowed in participants who could not tolerate the 80 mg dose. Patients were discontinued if the new dose was not tolerated.\n\nParticipants experienced TD improvements during long-term treatment as demonstrated by mean change from baseline to Week 48 in AIMS total score (sum of items 1-7, evaluated by site raters) with INGREZZA 40 mg/day (-10.2) or 80 mg/day (-11.0). Consistent with previous studies, INGREZZA was generally well tolerated. After Week 4, treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) that occurred in ≥ 5% of all participants (combined dose groups) were urinary tract infection (8.5%) and headache (5.2%). Changes from baseline in psychiatric stability, vital signs, electrocardiogram parameters and laboratory test values were generally small and not clinically significant.\n\n**About Tardive Dyskinesia (TD)** Tardive dyskinesia (TD) is a movement disorder that is characterized by uncontrollable, abnormal and repetitive movements of the face, torso and/or other body parts, which may be disruptive and negatively impact patients. The condition is associated with taking certain kinds of mental health medicines (antipsychotics) that help control dopamine receptors in the brain. Taking antipsychotics commonly prescribed to treat mental illnesses such as major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder, and other prescription medicines (metoclopramide and prochlorperazine) used to treat gastrointestinal disorders are associated with TD. In patients with TD, these treatments are thought to result in irregular dopamine signaling in a region of the brain that controls movement. The symptoms of TD can be severe and are often persistent and irreversible. TD is estimated to affect approximately 600,000 people in the United States.\n\n**About INGREZZA** ® **(valbenazine) Capsules** INGREZZA is the only one-capsule, once-daily selective vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2) inhibitor approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of adults with tardive dyskinesia and the treatment of chorea associated with Huntington's disease (HD). INGREZZA, developed by Neurocrine Biosciences, selectively inhibits VMAT2 with no appreciable binding affinity for VMAT1, dopaminergic (including D2), serotonergic, adrenergic, histaminergic or muscarinic receptors. While the specific way INGREZZA works to treat TD and HD chorea is not fully understood, INGREZZA selectively targets VMAT2 to inhibit the release of dopamine, a chemical in the brain that helps control movement. INGREZZA is believed to reduce extra dopamine signaling, which may lead to fewer uncontrollable movements. Additionally, INGREZZA can be taken as one capsule, once daily together with most psychiatric medications such as antipsychotics or antidepressants. INGREZZA dosages approved for use are 40 mg, 60 mg and 80 mg capsules. INGREZZA is not approved in any other dosage form.\n\n**Important Information**\n\n**Approved Uses** INGREZZA® (valbenazine) capsules or INGREZZA® SPRINKLE (valbenazine) capsules are prescription medicines used to treat adults with:\n\n  * movements in the face, tongue, or other body parts that cannot be controlled (tardive dyskinesia).\n  * involuntary movements (chorea) of Huntington's disease. INGREZZA or INGREZZA SPRINKLE do not cure the cause of involuntary movements, and do not treat other symptoms of Huntington's disease, such as problems with thinking or emotions.\n\n\n\nIt is not known if INGREZZA or INGREZZA SPRINKLE is safe and effective in children.\n\n**IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION**\n\n**VMAT2 inhibitors, including INGREZZA and INGREZZA SPRINKLE, can cause serious side effects in people with Huntington's disease, including: depression, suicidal thoughts, or suicidal actions.** Tell your healthcare provider before you start taking INGREZZA or INGREZZA SPRINKLE if you have Huntington's disease and are depressed (have untreated depression or depression that is not well controlled by medicine) or have suicidal thoughts. Pay close attention to any changes, especially sudden changes, in mood, behaviors, thoughts, or feelings. This is especially important when INGREZZA or INGREZZA SPRINKLE is started and when the dose is changed. Call your healthcare provider right away if you become depressed, have unusual changes in mood or behavior, or have thoughts of hurting yourself.\n\n**Do not take INGREZZA or INGREZZA SPRINKLE if you:**\n\n  * are allergic to valbenazine, or any of the ingredients in INGREZZA or INGREZZA SPRINKLE.\n\n\n\n**INGREZZA or INGREZZA SPRINKLE can cause serious side effects, including:**\n\n  * **Allergic reactions.** Allergic reactions, including an allergic reaction that causes sudden swelling called angioedema, can happen after taking the first dose or after many doses of INGREZZA or INGREZZA SPRINKLE. Signs and symptoms of allergic reactions and angioedema include: trouble breathing or shortness of breath, swelling of your face, lips, eyelids, tongue, or throat, or other areas of your skin, trouble with swallowing, or rash, including raised, itchy red areas on your skin (hives). Swelling in the throat can be life-threatening and can lead to death. Stop taking INGREZZA or INGREZZA SPRINKLE and go to the nearest emergency room right away if you develop these signs and symptoms of allergic reactions and angioedema.\n  * **Sleepiness and tiredness that could cause slow reaction times (somnolence and sedation).** Do not drive a car or operate dangerous machinery until you know how INGREZZA or INGREZZA SPRINKLE affects you. Drinking alcohol and taking other medicines may also cause sleepiness during treatment with INGREZZA or INGREZZA SPRINKLE.\n  * **Heart rhythm problems (QT prolongation).** INGREZZA or INGREZZA SPRINKLE may cause a heart rhythm problem known as QT prolongation. You have a higher chance of getting QT prolongation if you also take certain other medicines during treatment with INGREZZA or INGREZZA SPRINKLE. Tell your healthcare provider right away if you develop any signs or symptoms of QT prolongation, including: fast, slow, or irregular heartbeat (heart palpitations), shortness of breath, dizziness or lightheadedness, or fainting or feeling like you are going to faint.\n  * **Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS).** NMS is a serious condition that can lead to death. Call a healthcare provider right away or go to the nearest emergency room if you develop these symptoms and they do not have another obvious cause: high fever, stiff muscles, problems thinking, irregular pulse or blood pressure, increased sweating, or very fast or uneven heartbeat.\n  * **Parkinson-like symptoms.** Symptoms include: body stiffness, drooling, trouble moving or walking, trouble keeping your balance, shaking (tremors), or falls.\n\n\n\n**Before taking INGREZZA or INGREZZA SPRINKLE, tell your healthcare provider about all of your medical conditions including if you:** have liver or heart problems, are pregnant or plan to become pregnant, or are breastfeeding or plan to breastfeed. \n\n**Tell your healthcare provider about all the medicines you take,** including prescription and over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements. Make sure you tell all of your healthcare providers that you are taking INGREZZA or INGREZZA SPRINKLE. Taking INGREZZA or INGREZZA SPRINKLE with certain other medicines may cause serious side effects. Especially tell your healthcare provider if you: take digoxin or take or have taken a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) medicine. You should not take INGREZZA or INGREZZA SPRINKLE if you are taking, or have stopped taking, a MAOI within the last 14 days.\n\n**The most common side effects of INGREZZA or INGREZZA SPRINKLE in people with tardive dyskinesia** **are** sleepiness and tiredness.\n\n**The most common side effects of INGREZZA or INGREZZA SPRINKLE in people with chorea associated with Huntington's disease include** sleepiness and tiredness, raised itchy red areas on your skin (hives), rash, and trouble getting to sleep or staying asleep.\n\nThese are not all of the possible side effects of INGREZZA or INGREZZA SPRINKLE.

/PRNewswire/ -- [Neurocrine Biosciences, Inc.](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4165357-1&h=1691963482&u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.neurocrine.com%2F&a=Neurocrine+Biosciences%2C+Inc.) (Nasdaq: NBIX) and Diurnal Ltd., a Neurocrine Biosciences company, presented baseline data from the CAHtalyst™ Phase 3 studies of crinecerfont in adult and pediatric patients with congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH), and modified-release hydrocortisone (Chronocort®) data for a Phase 2 clinical study (CHAMPAIN) in participants with primary adrenal insufficiency and in a Phase 3 extension study in CAH. These data, along with several additional posters were presented at the [European Congress of Endocrinology 2024](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4165357-1&h=2339240394&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ese-hormones.org%2Feducation-and-training%2Feuropean-congress-of-endocrinology%2Fece-2024%2F&a=European+Congress+of+Endocrinology+2024) meeting in Stockholm.\n\n[ ![\\(PRNewsfoto/Neurocrine Biosciences, Inc.\\)](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/678850/Neurocrine_Biosciences_Logo.jpg) ](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/678850/Neurocrine_Biosciences_Logo.html)\n\n_CAHtalyst Phase 3 Pediatric and Adult Studies— Baseline Characteristics_ Baseline characteristics of the subjects who enrolled in the CAHtalyst Pediatric Phase 3 study were presented (Poster# P225). The study enrolled 103 subjects 4 to 17 years of age with a medically confirmed diagnosis of CAH due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency, with 52% male, mean age 12 years old, and majority in Tanner stages 3-5. There was evidence indicating inadequate adrenal androgen control in many of these patients despite supraphysiologic glucocorticoid dosing. At baseline, more than a third of the participants reported comorbidities of advanced bone age, early puberty, and obesity. Hirsutism (excessive hair growth, 12%) and irregular menses (12%) were reported in females, and testicular adrenal rest tumors were identified in more than a third of males.\n\nBaseline characteristics of 182 adults with CAH enrolled in the CAHtalyst Adult Phase 3 study were also presented (Poster# P423). Despite supraphysiologic GC dosing, levels of adrenocorticotropic hormone, 17-hydroxyprogesterone and androstenedione (A4) were elevated at baseline, with levels of testosterone (females) and A4/testosterone (males) also elevated. Common comorbidities included anxiety, osteopenia, depression, hypertension and hyperlipidemia. Overall, close to half of participants were overweight. Forty-seven percent of females reported a history of hirsutism (excessive hair growth) and acne (23%), and testicular adrenal rest tumors were identified in 66% of male participants.\n\n\"At baseline, many participants in the CAHtalyst Pediatric study showed clinical evidence of elevated glucocorticoid doses and adrenal androgen excess. Many exhibited obesity, advanced bone age, and early puberty, all of which can negatively impact development in childhood and adolescence,\" said Eiry W. Roberts, M.D., Chief Medical Officer at Neurocrine Biosciences. \"Baseline characteristics in the CAHtalyst Phase 3 study in adults saw this trend continue. Despite being in their 30s, many of the CAHtalyst Adult study participants have been diagnosed with disorders that are more common in people twice their age, including osteopenia, hypertension and hyperlipidemia. In both studies, adrenal androgen and other steroid markers were elevated at baseline despite supraphysiologic doses of glucocorticoids, demonstrating the need for novel glucocorticoid-independent approaches to reducing adrenal androgens and supraphysiologic glucocorticoid dosing in CAH patients at all ages.\"\n\nIn 2023, Neurocrine Biosciences announced top-line data from the CAHtalyst Pediatric and CAHtalyst Adult Phase 3 clinical studies evaluating the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of crinecerfont in adult and pediatric patients with CAH due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency. Data from both studies supported two New Drug Application submissions to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in April 2024.\n\n_Phase 2 Data of Modified-Release Hydrocortisone (Chronocort ®) in Primary Adrenal Insufficiency_The Phase 2 data of modified-release hydrocortisone (MRHC) in adults with primary adrenal insufficiency (CHAMPAIN study) demonstrated that participants receiving MRHC achieved a physiological morning cortisol level after four weeks of treatment (Abstract #4275, RC3.4). In the study, twice daily MRHC developed by Diurnal was compared with once-daily Plenadren (modified-release hydrocortisone) in patients aged ≥ 18 years with confirmed primary adrenal insufficiency (defined as morning pre-dose cortisol <50 nmol/L).\n\nOf the 49 evaluable participants in the CHAMPAIN Phase 2 study with primary adrenal insufficiency, 45 achieved a physiological morning cortisol level after four weeks on MRHC compared to 2 participants after four weeks on Plenadren (P < 0.0001). The mean (standard deviation) waking cortisol was 422.85 (203.50) versus 36.98 (113.87) nmol/L, respectively.\n\n\"Treatment with modified-release hydrocortisone resulted in a greater proportion of patients with a physiological morning cortisol level than treatment with Plenadren in patients with primary adrenal insufficiency,\" said Eiry W. Roberts, M.D., Chief Medical Officer at Neurocrine Biosciences. \"Further analyses will test the hypothesis that waking with physiological cortisol levels improves fatigue and quality of life in these patients.\"\n\n_Phase 3 Extension Study_ _of Modified-Release Hydrocortisone (Chronocort ®) in Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia_MRHC also demonstrated potential value in improving control of CAH compared to current glucocorticoid treatment (Abstract #4271, RC3.1). In a 48-month Phase 3 extension study, MRHC-treated participants showed a reduction in the median daily hydrocortisone dose from 30mg to 20mg. Participants were considered responders when their 9:00 a.m. 17-hydroxyprogesterone level was ≤ 36 nmol/L or their androstenedione level was ≤7 nmol/L while receiving MRHC ≤ 25 mg/day.\n\n\"The number of participants achieving responder status increased after four years in the MRHC Phase 3 extension study in patients with CAH. MRHC demonstrated improved control of CAH, with an ability to closely replicate cortisol diurnal rhythm when compared to current glucocorticoid treatment,\" Dr. Roberts added.\n\nNeurocrine Biosciences abstracts presented at ECE 2024 included:\n\n  * Baseline Characteristics of Children and Adolescents with Classic Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia Enrolled in CAHtalyst Pediatric, a Phase 3 Study of Crinecerfont, a Corticotropin-Releasing Factor Type 1 Receptor Antagonist (Poster #P225)\n  * Baseline Characteristics of Adults with Classic Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia Enrolled in CAHtalyst Adult, a Phase 3 Study of Crinecerfont, a Corticotropin-Releasing Factor Type 1 Receptor Antagonist (Poster #P423)\n  * CHAMPAIN study: Initial Results from a Phase II Study of Efficacy, Safety and Tolerability of Modified-Release Hydrocortisones: Chronocort® (Efmody®) versus Plenadren, in Primary Adrenal Insufficiency (Abstract #4275, Rapid Communication #RC3.4)\n  * Biochemical Control with Dose Reduction in Chronic Glucocorticoid Therapy over 4 Years: A Phase III Extension Study of Chronocort (Efmody®) in the Treatment of Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia (CAH) (Abstract #4271, Rapid Communication #RC3.1)\n  * Incidence of Adrenal Crisis in Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia (CAH) Patients During a Prospective Monitored Long-Term study of Modified-Release Hydrocortisone (MRHC) Capsules, (Efmody) (Poster #P215)\n  * Morning Cortisol Levels in Patients with Established Primary Adrenal Insufficiency (Poster #P13)\n\n\n\n**About Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia** Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) is a rare genetic condition that results in an enzyme deficiency that alters the production of adrenal hormones which are essential for life. Approximately 95% of CAH cases are caused by a mutation that leads to deficiency of the enzyme 21-hydroxylase (21-OHD). Severe deficiency of this enzyme leads to an inability of the adrenal glands to produce cortisol and, in approximately 75% of cases, aldosterone. If left untreated, CAH can result in salt wasting, dehydration, and even death.\n\nGlucocorticoids (GCs) are currently used not only to correct the endogenous cortisol deficiency, but doses used are higher than cortisol replacement needed (supraphysiologic) to lower the levels of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and adrenal androgens. However, glucocorticoid treatment at supraphysiologic doses has been associated with serious and significant complications of steroid excess, including metabolic issues such as weight gain and diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and osteoporosis. Additionally, long-term treatment with supraphysiologic GC doses may have psychological and cognitive impact, such as changes in mood and memory. Adrenal androgen excess has been associated with abnormal bone growth and development in pediatric patients, female health problems such as acne, excess hair growth and menstrual irregularities, testicular rest tumors in males, and fertility issues in both sexes.

Antagonism of CRF1 receptors in the pituitary has been shown to decrease adrenocorticotropic hormone levels, which in turn decreases the production of adrenal androgens and potentially the symptoms associated with CAH. Our data demonstrate that lowering adrenal androgen levels enables lower, more physiologic dosing of glucocorticoids and thus could potentially reduce the complications associated with exposure to greater than normal glucocorticoid doses in patients with CAH.\n\nThe CAHtalyst™ Pediatric and Adult Phase 3 global registrational studies are designed to evaluate the safety, efficacy, and tolerability of crinecerfont in children and adolescents, and adults respectively, with congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency. The primary portions of the CAHtalyst Phase 3 studies have completed and enrollment is closed, while the open-label treatment portions of both studies are ongoing. \n\nTo learn more about crinecerfont and the CAHtalyst studies, click [here](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4165357-1&h=1808416474&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.neurocrine.com%2Fpipeline%2F%23CAH&a=here).\n\n**About Primary Adrenal Insufficiency** Primary adrenal insufficiency is a chronic endocrine condition that occurs when the body does not make enough of certain adrenal hormones, including cortisol and often aldosterone. Glucocorticoids such as hydrocortisone are used to replace the missing cortisol, but typical dosing regimens do not match the natural diurnal rhythm of the body's cortisol production.\n\n**About Modified-Release Hydrocortisone (MRHC)** Diurnal Ltd. developed modified-release hydrocortisone, a preparation of hydrocortisone that has been specifically designed to replicate the natural circadian rhythm of cortisol, when given in a twice-a-day \"toothbrush\" regimen, (administered last thing at night before sleep and first thing in the morning on waking). In 2021, modified-release hydrocortisone (EFMODY®) received marketing authorization for the treatment of congenital adrenal hyperplasia from the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) in Great Britain (England, Wales, and Scotland) and from the European Commission in the European Union. Neurocrine Biosciences acquired Diurnal Group plc. in November 2022. A new drug application for the modified-release hydrocortisone formulation has not been submitted to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.\n\n**About MRHC Phase 2 Study in Adrenal Insufficiency (CHAMPAIN)** The CHAMPAIN Phase 2 clinical study compared the efficacy, safety and tolerability of twice daily DNL0200 (Chronocort), a modified-release hydrocortisone, with once daily Plenadren, a combination of immediate- and delayed-release hydrocortisone (authorized for use in the European Union), over a treatment period of up to 2 months in participants ≥18 years of age and diagnosed with primary adrenal insufficiency.\n\n**About the Phase 3 Extension Study for MRHC in CAH (DIUR-006)** The DIUR-006 Phase 3 open-label extension study assessed the long-term efficacy, safety and tolerability of twice-daily DNL0200 (Chronocort®), a modified-release hydrocortisone in adults with CAH. The study was performed to build on the results of feeder studies DIUR-003 (Phase 2 in adults with CAH) and DIUR-005 (EU Phase 3 Registrational Open-Label Study of Chronocort compared to standard of care in adults with CAH), to evaluate the long-term safety of Chronocort and also its long-term efficacy in improving control of serum androgen levels (using 17-OHP and A4 as biomarkers).\n\n**About Neurocrine Biosciences, Inc.** Neurocrine Biosciences is a leading neuroscience-focused, biopharmaceutical company with a simple purpose: to relieve suffering for people with great needs, but few options.

Inc._](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4161919-1&h=498687960&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.neurocrine.com%2F&a=Neurocrine+Biosciences%2C+Inc.) (Nasdaq: NBIX) today announced that it will present CAHtalyst™ Adult Phase 3 clinical study baseline characteristics for adults with congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) enrolled in the study, as well as data from a comprehensive literature review assessing the impact of supraphysiologic glucocorticoid (GC) doses on psychiatric disorders and cognition in patients with CAH.\n\n[ ![\\(PRNewsfoto/Neurocrine Biosciences, Inc.\\)](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/678850/Neurocrine_Biosciences_Logo.jpg) ](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/678850/Neurocrine_Biosciences_Logo.html)\n\nThe CAHtalyst Adult study baseline data demonstrate the potential long-term consequences of current CAH treatments, with many patients in young adulthood experiencing disorders found more commonly in people decades older, including osteopenia, hypertension and hyperlipidemia. In addition, the results of a comprehensive literature review showed that many CAH patients receiving supraphysiologic GC doses had an increased risk of psychiatric and cognitive symptoms. These new data were presented at oral presentations and poster sessions at the [American Association of Clinical Endocrinology 2024 Annual Meeting](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4161919-1&h=2506527026&u=https%3A%2F%2Fpro.aace.com%2Fevents%2F2024%2Fannual-meeting&a=American+Association+of+Clinical+Endocrinology+2024+Annual+Meeting) in New Orleans.\n\n_CAHtalyst Phase 3 Adult Study Baseline Characteristics_ Baseline characteristics of 182 adults with CAH enrolled in the CAHtalyst Adult Phase 3 study were summarized in an oral presentation at the conference by Oksana Hamidi, M.D., Associate Professor in the Division of Endocrinology and Metabolism at UT Southwestern Medical Center.\n\nDespite supraphysiologic GC dosing, levels of adrenocorticotropic hormone, 17-hydroxyprogesterone and androstenedione (A4) were elevated at baseline, with levels of testosterone (females) and A4/testosterone (males) also elevated. Common comorbidities included anxiety, osteopenia, depression, hypertension and hyperlipidemia. Overall, close to half of participants were overweight. Forty-seven percent of females reported a history of hirsutism (excessive hair growth) and acne (23%), and testicular adrenal rest tumors were identified in 66% of male participants.\n\n\"In the CAHtalyst Phase 3 study in adults, we're seeing the consequence of decades of living with CAH and the clinical consequences of the current treatment paradigm in the baseline characteristics,\" said Eiry W. Roberts, M.D., Chief Medical Officer at Neurocrine Biosciences. \"Despite being in their 30s, many of the CAHtalyst Adult study participants have been diagnosed with disorders that are more common in people twice their age, including osteopenia, hypertension and hyperlipidemia. As we saw in the CAHtalyst Pediatric study baseline data [presented at PES2024](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4161919-1&h=1369986128&u=https%3A%2F%2Fneurocrine.gcs-web.com%2Fnews-releases%2Fnews-release-details%2Fneurocrine-biosciences-presented-cahtalysttm-pediatric-study&a=presented+at+PES2024), adrenal androgen and other steroid markers were also elevated despite supraphysiologic doses of glucocorticoids, demonstrating the need for novel glucocorticoid-independent approaches to reducing adrenal androgens and supraphysiologic glucocorticoid dosing in CAH patients at all ages.\"\n\nIn 2023, Neurocrine Biosciences announced top-line data from the CAHtalyst Pediatric and CAHtalyst Adult Phase 3 clinical studies evaluating the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of crinecerfont in children, adolescents, and adults with CAH due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency. The data from both studies supported two New Drug Applications submitted to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in April 2024.\n\n_Literature Review: Psychological and Cognitive Impact of Supraphysiologic Glucocorticoids_ Neurocrine Biosciences also presented the results of a comprehensive review of available literature between 1996–2023 focusing on the use of supraphysiologic doses of hydrocortisone and their effect on psychiatric disorders and cognition in patients with CAH (Poster# 05). The review identified mood and psychotic disorders as the most consistent psychiatric disorders seen. Brain morphology in patients with CAH was altered (white matter microstructure abnormalities), suggesting an increased risk of cognitive impairment with use of supraphysiologic doses of GCs in these patients.\n\n\"Glucocorticoids administered at supraphysiologic doses can lead to a spectrum of psychiatric and cognitive symptoms, with the severity correlating with the glucocorticoid dosage given,\" said Amy Wisniewski, M.D., Research Professor, Psychology at Oklahoma State University. \"As a result, increased awareness among healthcare providers is necessary to monitor CAH patients receiving supraphysiologic doses of glucocorticoids for signs of psychiatric and cognitive symptoms. More research is needed to identify the multiple factors, including prolonged exposure to adrenal androgen excess and glucocorticoid-induced deterioration of brain regions, that may determine the cognitive impairment of patients with CAH.\"\n\n_Neurocrine Biosciences abstracts to be presented at the meeting include:_\n\n  * Baseline Characteristics of Adults with Classic Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia Enrolled in CAHtalyst, a Phase 3 Study of Crinecerfont, a Corticotropin-Releasing Factor Type 1 Receptor Antagonist, **Oral Presentation—Dr. Oksana Hamidi, May 10; 11:00-11:15 a.m.**\n  * The Psychological and Cognitive Impact of Supraphysiological Glucocorticoids in Patients with Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia: A Comprehensive Review, May 11; 7:30–7:45 a.m. (Poster #05)\n  * Glucocorticoid Treatment Patterns in Pediatric and Adult Patients with Classic Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia: Results from the CAHtalog™ Registry, May 10; 10:10–10:25 a.m. (Poster #14)\n\n\n\n**About Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia** Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) is a rare genetic condition that results in an enzyme deficiency that alters the production of adrenal hormones which are essential for life. Approximately 95% of CAH cases are caused by a mutation that leads to deficiency of the enzyme 21-hydroxylase. Severe deficiency of this enzyme leads to an inability of the adrenal glands to produce cortisol and, in approximately 75% of cases, aldosterone. If left untreated, CAH can result in salt wasting, dehydration, and even death.\n\nGlucocorticoids (GCs) are currently used not only to correct the endogenous cortisol deficiency, but doses used are higher than cortisol replacement needed (supraphysiologic) to lower the levels of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and adrenal androgens. However, glucocorticoid treatment at supraphysiologic doses has been associated with serious and significant complications of steroid excess, including metabolic issues such as weight gain and diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and osteoporosis. Additionally, long-term treatment with supraphysiologic GC doses may have psychological and cognitive impact, such as changes in mood and memory. Adrenal androgen excess has been associated with abnormal bone growth and development in pediatric patients, female health problems such as acne, excess hair growth and menstrual irregularities, testicular rest tumors in males, and fertility issues in both sexes.

Antagonism of CRF1 receptors in the pituitary has been shown to decrease adrenocorticotropic hormone levels, which in turn decreases the production of adrenal androgens and potentially the symptoms associated with CAH. Our data demonstrate that lowering adrenal androgen levels enables lower, more physiologic dosing of glucocorticoids and thus could potentially reduce the complications associated with exposure to greater than normal glucocorticoid doses in patients with CAH.\n\nTo learn more about crinecerfont, click _[here](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4161919-1&h=424265630&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.neurocrine.com%2Fpipeline%2F%23CAH&a=here)_.\n\n**About the CAHtalyst ™ Phase 3 Studies**The CAHtalyst™ Pediatric and Adult Phase 3 global studies are the largest registrational studies conducted to date to evaluate the safety, efficacy, and tolerability of crinecerfont in children and adolescents, and adults respectively, with congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency.

(Nasdaq: NBIX) today announced the initiation of its Phase 1 first-in-human clinical study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of investigational compound NBI-1076986 in healthy adult participants. NBI-1076986 is an investigational, oral, M4 subtype-selective muscarinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist for the potential treatment of movement disorders that was discovered and developed by Neurocrine Biosciences.\n\n[ ![\\(PRNewsfoto/Neurocrine Biosciences, Inc.\\)](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/678850/Neurocrine_Biosciences_Logo.jpg) ](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/678850/Neurocrine_Biosciences_Logo.html)\n\n\"This compound is an important part of our muscarinic portfolio, which enters the clinic as a potential treatment for movement disorders,\" said Eiry W. Roberts, M.D., Chief Medical Officer at Neurocrine Biosciences. \"Selectively targeting M4 receptors could benefit a broad range of motor coordination disorders, including Parkinson's disease tremor and dystonia.\"\n\n**About Muscarinic Pipeline and NBI-1076986** Muscarinic receptors are fundamental to activating signaling pathways in the brain. There are five muscarinic acetylcholine receptors involved in neurotransmission (M1–M5), with M4 receptors associated with motor coordination and certain central nervous system pathologies. M1 receptors play a role in higher cognitive processes such as learning and memory and are thought to be associated with the memory/cognitive side effects associated with non-selective antimuscarinic agents.\n\nIdentified and developed by Neurocrine Biosciences, NBI-1076986 is an investigational, oral, M4 subtype-selective muscarinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist for the potential treatment of certain movement disorders, including Parkinson's disease tremor and dystonia. It is hypothesized that an M4 subtype-selective antagonist may impact regulation of motor symptoms and movements while minimizing off-target effects.\n\nNeurocrine Biosciences has a broad portfolio of programs that selectively target muscarinic receptors. In addition to NBI-1076986, the portfolio includes several small molecule M1, M1/M4 and M4 agonists that Neurocrine Biosciences acquired the rights to develop and commercialize from Nxera Pharma (formerly Sosei Heptares). \n\n**About Neurocrine Biosciences** Neurocrine Biosciences is a leading neuroscience-focused, biopharmaceutical company with a simple purpose: to relieve suffering for people with great needs, but few options.

Announces Initiation of Phase 1 Clinical Study Evaluating Effects of NBI-1117567 in Healthy Adults\n\n05/08/24\n\n[PDF Version](/node/20981/pdf)\n\nSAN DIEGO, May 8, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- [Neurocrine Biosciences, Inc.](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4159262-1&h=2215513145&u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.neurocrine.com%2F&a=Neurocrine+Biosciences%2C+Inc.) (Nasdaq: NBIX), today announced the initiation of its Phase 1 first-in-human clinical study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of investigational compound NBI-1117567 in healthy adult participants. NBI-1117567 is an investigational, oral, M1/M4 (M1 preferring) selective muscarinic agonist for the potential treatment of neurological and neuropsychiatric conditions.\n\n[ ![\\(PRNewsfoto/Neurocrine Biosciences, Inc.\\)](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/678850/Neurocrine_Biosciences_Logo.jpg) ](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/678850/Neurocrine_Biosciences_Logo.html)\n\n\"Neurocrine Biosciences has the largest muscarinic portfolio in the industry, with compounds in development for psychiatric and neurological disorders,\" said Eiry W. Roberts, M.D., Chief Medical Officer at Neurocrine Biosciences. \"As an M1 preferring M1/M4 agonist, NBI-1117567 has the potential to treat symptoms of cognition in patients with neurological and neuropsychiatric conditions where psychosis might also be present.\"\n\n**About NBI-1117567** NBI-1117567 is an investigational, oral, M1/M4 (M1 preferring) selective muscarinic agonist. Muscarinic receptors are fundamental to activating signaling pathways in the brain. There are five muscarinic acetylcholine receptors involved in neurotransmission, two of which are selectively targeted by NBI-1117567 (M1 preferring and M4), with M1 validated as a potential drug target in cognition and M4 in psychosis. Neurocrine Biosciences acquired the rights to develop and commercialize NBI-1117567 from Nxera Pharma (formerly Sosei Heptares). \n\n**About Neurocrine Biosciences** Neurocrine Biosciences is a leading neuroscience-focused, biopharmaceutical company with a simple purpose: to relieve suffering for people with great needs, but few options. We are dedicated to discovering and developing life-changing treatments for patients with under-addressed neurological, neuroendocrine and neuropsychiatric disorders. The company's diverse portfolio includes FDA-approved treatments for tardive dyskinesia, chorea associated with Huntington's disease, endometriosis* and uterine fibroids*, as well as a robust pipeline including multiple compounds in mid- to late-phase clinical development across our core therapeutic areas. For three decades, we have applied our unique insight into neuroscience and the interconnections between brain and body systems to treat complex conditions. We relentlessly pursue medicines to ease the burden of debilitating diseases and disorders, because you deserve brave science.

Approximately 95% of CAH cases are caused by a mutation that leads to deficiency of the enzyme 21-hydroxylase (21-OHD). Severe deficiency of this enzyme leads to an inability of the adrenal glands to produce cortisol and, in approximately 75% of cases, aldosterone. If left untreated, CAH can result in salt wasting, dehydration, and even death.\n\nGlucocorticoids (GCs) are currently used not only to correct the endogenous cortisol deficiency, but doses used are higher than cortisol replacement needed (supraphysiologic) to lower the levels of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and adrenal androgens. However, glucocorticoid treatment at supraphysiologic doses has been associated with serious and significant complications of steroid excess, including metabolic issues such as weight gain and diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and osteoporosis. Additionally, long-term treatment with supraphysiologic GC doses may have psychological and cognitive impact, such as changes in mood and memory. Adrenal androgen excess has been associated with abnormal bone growth and development in pediatric patients, female health problems such as acne, excess hair growth and menstrual irregularities, testicular rest tumors in males, and fertility issues in both sexes.

Antagonism of CRF1 receptors in the pituitary has been shown to decrease adrenocorticotropic hormone levels, which in turn decreases the production of adrenal androgens and potentially the symptoms associated with CAH. Our data demonstrate that lowering adrenal androgen levels enables lower, more physiologic dosing of glucocorticoids and thus could potentially reduce the complications associated with exposure to greater than normal glucocorticoid doses in patients with CAH.\n\nThe CAHtalyst™ Pediatric and Adult Phase 3 global registrational studies are designed to evaluate the safety, efficacy, and tolerability of crinecerfont in children and adolescents, and adults respectively, with congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency. The primary portions of the CAHtalyst Phase 3 studies have completed and enrollment is closed, while the open-label treatment portions of both studies are ongoing. \n\nTo learn more about crinecerfont and the CAHtalyst studies, click [here](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4159249-1&h=953101920&u=https%3A%2F%2Fc212.net%2Fc%2Flink%2F%3Ft%3D0%26l%3Den%26o%3D4159249-1%26h%3D1141341026%26u%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.neurocrine.com%252Fpipeline%252F%2523CAH%26a%3Dhere&a=here).\n\n**About Primary Adrenal Insufficiency** Primary adrenal insufficiency is a chronic endocrine condition that occurs when the body does not make enough of certain adrenal hormones, including cortisol and often aldosterone. Glucocorticoids such as hydrocortisone are used to replace the missing cortisol, but typical dosing regimens do not match the natural diurnal rhythm of the body's cortisol production.\n\n**About Modified-Release Hydrocortisone** Diurnal Ltd. developed modified-release hydrocortisone, a preparation of hydrocortisone that has been specifically designed to replicate the natural circadian rhythm of cortisol, when given in a twice-a-day \"toothbrush\" regimen, (administered last thing at night before sleep and first thing in the morning on waking). In 2021, modified-release hydrocortisone (EFMODY®) received marketing authorization for the treatment of congenital adrenal hyperplasia from the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) in Great Britain (England, Wales, and Scotland) and from the European Commission in the European Union. Neurocrine Biosciences acquired Diurnal Group plc. in November 2022. A new drug application for the modified-release hydrocortisone formulation has not been submitted to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.\n\n**About MRHC Phase 2 Study in Adrenal Insufficiency (CHAMPAIN)** The CHAMPAIN Phase 2 clinical study compared the efficacy, safety and tolerability of twice daily DNL0200 (Chronocort), a modified-release hydrocortisone, with once daily Plenadren, a combination of immediate- and delayed-release hydrocortisone (authorized for use in the European Union), over a treatment period of up to 2 months in participants ≥18 years of age and diagnosed with primary adrenal insufficiency.\n\n**About the Phase 3 Extension Study for MRHC in CAH (DIUR-006)** The DIUR-006 Phase 3 open-label extension study assessed the long-term efficacy, safety and tolerability of twice-daily DNL0200 (Chronocort®), a modified-release hydrocortisone in adults with CAH. The study was performed to build on the results of feeder studies DIUR-003 (Phase 2 in adults with CAH) and DIUR-005 (EU Phase 3 Registrational Open-Label Study of Chronocort compared to standard of care in adults with CAH) and evaluate the long-term safety of Chronocort, and also its long-term efficacy in improving control of serum androgen levels (using 17-OHP and A4 as biomarkers).\n\n**About Neurocrine Biosciences, Inc.** Neurocrine Biosciences is a leading neuroscience-focused, biopharmaceutical company with a simple purpose: to relieve suffering for people with great needs, but few options.

(Nasdaq: NBIX) today renewed its commitment to increasing awareness and advancing care for people living with TD during Tardive Dyskinesia Awareness Week, May 5-11. TD is a persistent, involuntary movement disorder associated with the use of antipsychotic medication that may be necessary to treat individuals living with mental illness, such as bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder.1,5-7\n\n[ ![\\(PRNewsfoto/Neurocrine Biosciences, Inc.\\)](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/678850/Neurocrine_Biosciences_Logo.jpg) ](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/678850/Neurocrine_Biosciences_Logo.html)\n\nFor seven consecutive years, TD Awareness Week – which occurs each year during Mental Health Awareness Month – has brought together the mental health advocacy community and states across the country to recognize the approximately 600,000 people in the U.S. living with TD.1,2 This year, Neurocrine is joining participants of TD Awareness Week to conduct initiatives nationwide to decrease stigma, improve recognition and increase routine screenings, diagnosis and awareness of appropriate treatment of TD.\n\n\"TD Awareness Week increases dialogue around the physical, social and emotional consequences the uncontrollable movements of TD can have on individuals who are trying to manage their mental health,\" said Josie Cooper, Executive Director of the Movement Disorders Policy Coalition. \"It's important that we continue to work together to acknowledge and increase support for people living with TD and to ensure they receive the diagnosis and care they deserve.\"\n\nTD is a chronic condition that is unlikely to improve without treatment.1,4 The uncontrollable movements can affect one's ability to work, drive, walk, button a shirt or eat and drink and cause worry, frustration and self-consciousness.2,8-10 It is critical that people taking antipsychotic medication for mental illness be monitored by a healthcare provider for drug-induced movement disorders, such as TD.4,6 Routine screenings are essential for detection, proper diagnosis and appropriate management to help improve therapeutic outcomes.4\n\n\"The majority of people living with TD remain undiagnosed, reinforcing the importance of proactive recognition and treatment of the condition,\" said Eiry W. Roberts, M.D., Chief Medical Officer, Neurocrine Biosciences. \"We are committed to partnering with all stakeholders during TD Awareness Week and beyond to advocate for routine screenings for patients at risk for TD.\"\n\nThe Meadows Mental Health Policy Institute, which provides nonpartisan, data-driven and program guidance to improve mental health services, released a recent _[report](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4157884-1&h=2473119372&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmmhpi.org%2Fproject%2Fincreasing-measurement-based-assessment-and-care-for-people-with-serious-mental-illness%2F&a=report),_ in collaboration with Neurocrine Biosciences, highlighting the importance of measurement-based care (MBC) for people with a serious mental illness who are treated with antipsychotics. MBC involves the systematic use of validated rating scales to assess the effectiveness of treatment and make adjustments as needed to improve outcomes.11 For TD, MBC provides an effective mechanism for earlier detection and the ability to develop and routinely monitor an appropriate treatment plan for patients to help improve outcomes.11 The full report can be accessed at _[https://mmhpi.org/project/increasing-measurement-based-assessment-and-care-for-people-with-serious-mental-illness/](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4157884-1&h=3815018148&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmmhpi.org%2Fproject%2Fincreasing-measurement-based-assessment-and-care-for-people-with-serious-mental-illness%2F&a=https%3A%2F%2Fmmhpi.org%2Fproject%2Fincreasing-measurement-based-assessment-and-care-for-people-with-serious-mental-illness%2F)_.\n\nThe 2020 American Psychiatric Association Practice Guideline for the Treatment of Patients With Schizophrenia recommends screening for TD at least every six months in high-risk patients and at least every 12 months for others at risk of developing TD.4\n\nTo learn more about TD, living with TD and how to treat TD, visit _[TalkAboutTD.com](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4157884-1&h=4038967247&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.talkabouttd.com%2F&a=TalkAboutTD.com)_.\n\n**About Tardive Dyskinesia Awareness Week** Since it began in 2018, all 50 states, Washington, D.C., and various mental health advocacy organizations have recognized the first full week of May as Tardive Dyskinesia (TD) Awareness Week, which acknowledges the approximately 600,000 Americans living with TD, an involuntary movement disorder associated with taking antipsychotic medication commonly prescribed to treat mental illnesses.

The condition is associated with taking certain kinds of mental health medicines (antipsychotics) that help control dopamine receptors in the brain. Taking antipsychotics commonly prescribed to treat mental illnesses such as major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder, and other prescription medicines (metoclopramide and prochlorperazine) used to treat gastrointestinal disorders are associated with TD. In patients with TD, these treatments are thought to result in irregular dopamine signaling in a region of the brain that controls movement. The symptoms of TD can be severe and are often persistent and irreversible. TD is estimated to affect approximately 600,000 people in the United States. \n\n**About Neurocrine Biosciences, Inc.** Neurocrine Biosciences is a leading neuroscience-focused, biopharmaceutical company with a simple purpose: to relieve suffering for people with great needs, but few options.

Inc.](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4157267-1&h=891355965&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.neurocrine.com%2F&a=Neurocrine+Biosciences%2C+Inc.) (Nasdaq: NBIX), today presented the CAHtalyst™ Pediatric Phase 3 clinical study baseline characteristics data for children and adolescents with congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency enrolled in the study, along with CAHtalog™ Registry data assessing glucocorticoid treatment patterns in pediatric and adult patients with CAH.\n\n[ ![\\(PRNewsfoto/Neurocrine Biosciences, Inc.\\)](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/678850/Neurocrine_Biosciences_Logo.jpg) ](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/678850/Neurocrine_Biosciences_Logo.html)\n\nThese data demonstrate the limitations of current CAH treatment approaches in pediatric patients, comorbidities associated with the condition and/or current treatment, including obesity, advanced bone age, and early puberty, and the difficulty in managing the disease effectively as CAH patients age into adults. These new data were presented at the [Pediatric Endocrine Society 2024 Annual Meeting](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4157267-1&h=1984622052&u=https%3A%2F%2Fpedsendo.org%2Feducation-events%2Fpes-2024-annual-meeting%2F&a=Pediatric+Endocrine+Society+2024+Annual+Meeting) in Chicago.\n\n_CAHtalyst Phase 3 Pediatric Study Baseline Characteristics_ Baseline characteristics of the subjects who enrolled in the CAHtalyst Pediatric Phase 3 study were presented (Poster# 56). The study enrolled 103 subjects 4 to 17 years of age with a medically confirmed diagnosis of CAH due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency, with 52% male, mean age 12 years old, and majority in Tanner stages 3-5. There was evidence indicating inadequate adrenal androgen control in many of these patients despite supraphysiologic glucocorticoid dosing. At baseline, more than a third of the participants reported comorbidities of advanced bone age, early puberty, and obesity. Hirsutism (excessive hair growth, 12%) and irregular menses (12%) were reported in females, and testicular adrenal rest tumors were identified in more than a third of males.\n\n\"At baseline, many participants in the CAHtalyst Pediatric study showed clinical evidence of elevated glucocorticoid doses and adrenal androgen excess. Many exhibited obesity, advanced bone age, and early puberty, all of which can negatively impact development in childhood and adolescence, and lead to further harm in adulthood,\" said Eiry W. Roberts M.D., Chief Medical Officer at Neurocrine Biosciences. \"With adrenal androgen levels elevated despite supraphysiologic glucocorticoid doses, it's clear that there is a significant need for a new approach to treat this condition.\"\n\nIn 2023, Neurocrine Biosciences announced positive top-line data from the CAHtalyst Pediatric and CAHtalyst Adult Phase 3 clinical studies evaluating the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of crinecerfont in pediatric and adult patients with CAH due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency. The data from both studies supported two New Drug Applications that were submitted to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in April 2024. \n\n_CAHtalog Patient Registry: Glucocorticoid Treatment Patterns_ Neurocrine Biosciences also presented glucocorticoid treatment patterns from a recent cohort of pediatric and adult patients participating in the CAHtalog Registry (Poster# 51). Data from 42 pediatric and 32 adult patients with median duration of observation between 10 to 13 years of age were analyzed.\n\nGlucocorticoid treatment patterns seen in the CAHtalog Registry data indicate patients are being treated with GC doses that are at or above the upper end of the ranges recommended in the Endocrine Society Guidelines.\n\n\"The CAHtalog Registry data showed that a vast majority of patients had higher GCs and/or a loss of androstenedione control at some point, or multiple points, in their journey living with CAH,\" said Oksana Lekarev, D.O., Associate Professor of Clinical Pediatrics, Co-Medical Director of the Weill Cornell Medicine Comprehensive Care Center for Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia and an Associate Attending Pediatrician at New York-Presbyterian/Weill Cornell Medical Center and member of the CAHtalog Scientific Advisory Board. \"These analyses underscore that disease control can vary widely and highlights the difficulty in achieving optimal adrenal androgen control in many patients despite supraphysiologic GC dosing.\"\n\nNeurocrine Biosciences abstracts presented at the meeting included:\n\n  * Baseline Characteristics of Children and Adolescents with Classic Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia Enrolled in CAHtalyst Pediatric, a Phase 3 Study of Crinecerfont, a Corticotropin-Releasing Factor Type 1 Receptor Antagonist, May 3; 12:15–1:45pm (Poster# 56)\n  * Glucocorticoid Treatment Patterns in Pediatric and Adult Patients with Classic Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia: Results from the CAHtalog Registry, May 3; 12:15–1:45pm (Poster# 51)\n  * Natural History of Classic Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia: Results from Pediatric and Adult Patients in the CAHtalog Registry, May 3; 12:15–1:45pm (Poster# 60)\n\n\n\n**About Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia** Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) is a rare genetic condition that results in an enzyme deficiency that alters the production of adrenal hormones which are essential for life. Approximately 95% of CAH cases are caused by a mutation that leads to deficiency of the enzyme 21-hydroxylase. Severe deficiency of this enzyme can lead to an inability of the adrenal glands to produce cortisol and, in approximately 75% of cases, aldosterone. If left untreated, CAH can result in salt wasting, dehydration and even death.\n\nGlucocorticoids (GCs) are currently used not only to correct the endogenous cortisol deficiency, but doses used are higher than cortisol replacement needed (supraphysiologic) to lower the levels of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and adrenal androgens. However, glucocorticoid treatment at supraphysiologic doses has been associated with serious and significant complications of steroid excess, including metabolic issues, such as weight gain and diabetes, cardiovascular disease and osteoporosis. Additionally, long-term treatment with supraphysiologic GC doses may have psychological and cognitive impact, such as changes in mood and memory. Adrenal androgen excess has been associated with abnormal bone growth and development in pediatric patients, female health problems, such as acne, excess hair growth and menstrual irregularities, testicular rest tumors in males and fertility issues in both sexes.

Antagonism of CRF1 receptors in the pituitary has been shown to decrease adrenocorticotropic hormone levels, which in turn decreases the production of adrenal androgens and potentially the symptoms associated with CAH. Our data demonstrate that lowering adrenal androgen levels enables lower, more physiologic dosing of glucocorticoids and thus could potentially reduce the complications associated with exposure to greater than replacement glucocorticoid doses in patients with CAH.\n\nTo learn more about crinecerfont, click [here](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4157267-1&h=835820411&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.neurocrine.com%2Fpipeline%2F%23CAH&a=here).\n\n**About the CAHtalyst ™ Phase 3 Studies **The CAHtalyst™ Pediatric and Adult Phase 3 global studies are the largest registrational studies conducted to date to evaluate the safety, efficacy, and tolerability of crinecerfont in children and adolescents, and adults respectively, with congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency. The double-blind portions of the CAHtalyst Phase 3 studies have completed enrollment and are closed, while open-label treatment in both studies is ongoing.\n\nFor more information about the CAHtalyst Pediatric Phase 3 study, please visit [ClinicalTrialsPediatric.gov](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4157267-1&h=604330051&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.clinicaltrials.gov%2Fct2%2Fshow%2FNCT04806451%3Fcond%3DCAH%2B-%2BCongenital%2BAdrenal%2BHyperplasia%26age%3D0%26draw%3D2%26rank%3D2&a=ClinicalTrialsPediatric.gov).\n\nFor more information about the CAHtalyst Phase 3 study in adults (ages 18 years of age and older), please visit [ClinicalTrialsAdult.gov](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4157267-1&h=3764107363&u=https%3A%2F%2Fclassic.clinicaltrials.gov%2Fct2%2Fshow%2FNCT04490915%3Fterm%3DCAH3003%26cond%3DCAH%2B-%2BCongenital%2BAdrenal%2BHyperplasia%26draw%3D2%26rank%3D1&a=ClinicalTrialsAdult.gov).\n\n**About the CAHtalog****™****Registry** In 2021, the CARES Foundation, Neurocrine Biosciences and PicnicHealth partnered to establish the CAHtalog (**C** ongenital **A** drenal **H** yperplasia: Patien**t** and Clinic**al** **O** utcomes in Real-World Practice Settin**g** s) Registry.

When preparing the non-GAAP financial results and guidance, the Company excludes certain GAAP items that management does not consider to be normal, including recurring cash operating expenses that might not meet the definition of unusual or non-recurring items. In particular, these non-GAAP financial measures exclude: non-cash stock-based compensation expense, loss on extinguishment of convertible senior notes, charges associated with convertible senior notes, non-cash interest expense related to convertible debt, non-cash amortization expense related to acquired intangible assets, acquisition and integration costs, changes in fair value of equity security investments, changes in foreign currency exchange rates and certain adjustments to income tax expense. These non-GAAP financial measures are provided as a complement to results provided in accordance with GAAP as management believes these non-GAAP financial measures help indicate underlying trends in the Company's business, are important in comparing current results with prior period results and provide additional information regarding the Company's financial position. Management also uses these non-GAAP financial measures to establish budgets and operational goals that are communicated internally and externally and to manage the Company's business and evaluate its performance. The Company provides guidance regarding combined R&D and SG&A expenses on both a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis.

Announces U.S. FDA Approval of INGREZZA® SPRINKLE (valbenazine) Capsules\n\n04/30/24\n\n[PDF Version](/node/20941/pdf)\n\nSAN DIEGO, April 30, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- [Neurocrine Biosciences, Inc.](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4154817-1&h=126331215&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.neurocrine.com%2F&a=Neurocrine+Biosciences%2C+Inc.) (Nasdaq: NBIX) today announced the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved INGREZZA® SPRINKLE (valbenazine) capsules, a new oral granules formulation of INGREZZA® (valbenazine) capsules prescribed for the treatment of adults with tardive dyskinesia and chorea associated with Huntington's disease.1 INGREZZA SPRINKLE provides an alternative administration option for those who experience dysphagia or have difficulty swallowing.\n\n[ ![\\(PRNewsfoto/Neurocrine Biosciences, Inc.\\)](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/678850/Neurocrine_Biosciences_Logo.jpg) ](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/678850/Neurocrine_Biosciences_Logo.html)\n\nLike the original formulation of INGREZZA capsules, INGREZZA SPRINKLE offers simple dosing that's always one capsule, once daily with no complex titration.1 INGREZZA is the only selective vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2) inhibitor that offers three effective dosages (40 mg, 60 mg and 80 mg) that can be adjusted by the healthcare provider based on patient response and tolerability.1 INGREZZA SPRINKLE offers the same dosage strengths, and the contents of the capsules can be easily sprinkled on soft food for oral administration.\n\n\"We developed INGREZZA SPRINKLE to make administration easier for patients who have difficulty swallowing or prefer not to take a capsule,\" said Eiry W. Roberts, M.D., Chief Medical Officer at Neurocrine Biosciences. \"We are pleased to offer the proven efficacy of INGREZZA in reducing uncontrollable movements in a new formulation.\"\n\nTaking pills can be difficult for people experiencing chorea associated with Huntington's disease (HD) in addition to those living with tardive dyskinesia (TD)2:\n\n  * In a survey of patients with chorea associated with HD and their caregivers (n = 78), 62% reported difficulty swallowing because of their involuntary movements. ‡,†\n  * In a survey of patients with TD experiencing moderate-to-severe involuntary movement symptoms (n = 250), 37% reported that their movements impacted their ability to eat and drink.*,§\n\n\n\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval was based on chemistry, manufacturing, and controls information and data demonstrating the bioequivalence and tolerability of INGREZZA SPRINKLE compared to INGREZZA capsules.\n\n**About Tardive Dyskinesia (TD)** Tardive dyskinesia (TD) is a movement disorder that is characterized by uncontrollable, abnormal and repetitive movements of the face, torso and/or other body parts, which may be disruptive and negatively impact patients. The condition is associated with taking certain kinds of mental health medicines (antipsychotics) that help control dopamine receptors in the brain. Taking antipsychotics commonly prescribed to treat mental illnesses such as major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder and other prescription medicines (metoclopramide and prochlorperazine) used to treat gastrointestinal disorders are associated with TD. In patients with TD, these treatments are thought to result in irregular dopamine signaling in a region of the brain that controls movement. The symptoms of TD can be severe and are often persistent and irreversible. TD is estimated to affect approximately 600,000 people in the U.S.\n\n**About Chorea Associated with Huntington's Disease (HD)** Huntington's disease (HD) is a hereditary progressive neurodegenerative disorder in which the loss of certain neurons within the brain causes motor, cognitive and psychiatric symptoms. Symptoms generally appear between the ages of 30 and 50 years and worsen over a 10- to 25-year period. Most people with HD experience chorea, an abnormal involuntary movement disorder, characterized by irregular and unpredictable movements. Chorea can affect various body parts and interfere with motor coordination, gait, swallowing and speech. HD is estimated to affect approximately 41,000 adults in the U.S., with more than 200,000 at risk of inheriting the disease.\n\n**About INGREZZA** ® **(valbenazine) Capsules** INGREZZA is the only one-capsule, once-daily selective vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2) inhibitor approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of adults with tardive dyskinesia and the treatment of chorea associated with Huntington's disease (HD).\n\nINGREZZA, developed by Neurocrine Biosciences, selectively inhibits VMAT2 with no appreciable binding affinity for VMAT1, dopaminergic (including D2), serotonergic, adrenergic, histaminergic or muscarinic receptors. While the specific way INGREZZA works to treat TD and HD chorea is not fully understood, INGREZZA selectively targets VMAT2 to inhibit the release of dopamine, a chemical in the brain that helps control movement. INGREZZA is believed to reduce extra dopamine signaling, which may lead to fewer uncontrollable movements. Additionally, INGREZZA can be taken as one capsule, once daily together with most psychiatric medications such as antipsychotics or antidepressants. INGREZZA dosages approved for use are 40 mg, 60 mg and 80 mg capsules. INGREZZA is not approved in any other dosage form.\n\n**Important Information**\n\n**Approved Uses**\n\nINGREZZA® (valbenazine) capsules or INGREZZA® SPRINKLE (valbenazine) capsules are prescription medicines used to treat adults with:\n\n  * movements in the face, tongue, or other body parts that cannot be controlled (tardive dyskinesia).\n  * involuntary movements (chorea) of Huntington's disease. INGREZZA or INGREZZA SPRINKLE do not cure the cause of involuntary movements, and do not treat other symptoms of Huntington's disease, such as problems with thinking or emotions.\n\n\n\nIt is not known if INGREZZA or INGREZZA SPRINKLE is safe and effective in children.\n\n**IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION**\n\n**VMAT2 inhibitors, including INGREZZA and INGREZZA SPRINKLE, can cause serious side effects in people with Huntington's disease, including: depression, suicidal thoughts, or suicidal actions.** Tell your healthcare provider before you start taking INGREZZA or INGREZZA SPRINKLE if you have Huntington's disease and are depressed (have untreated depression or depression that is not well controlled by medicine) or have suicidal thoughts. Pay close attention to any changes, especially sudden changes, in mood, behaviors, thoughts, or feelings. This is especially important when INGREZZA or INGREZZA SPRINKLE is started and when the dose is changed. Call your healthcare provider right away if you become depressed, have unusual changes in mood or behavior, or have thoughts of hurting yourself.\n\n**Do not take INGREZZA or INGREZZA SPRINKLE if you:**\n\n  * are allergic to valbenazine, or any of the ingredients in INGREZZA or INGREZZA SPRINKLE.\n\n\n\n**INGREZZA or INGREZZA SPRINKLE can cause serious side effects, including:**\n\n  * **Allergic reactions.** Allergic reactions, including an allergic reaction that causes sudden swelling called angioedema can happen after taking the first dose or after many doses of INGREZZA or INGREZZA SPRINKLE. Signs and symptoms of allergic reactions and angioedema include: trouble breathing or shortness of breath, swelling of your face, lips, eyelids, tongue, or throat, or other areas of your skin, trouble with swallowing, or rash, including raised, itchy red areas on your skin (hives). Swelling in the throat can be life-threatening and can lead to death. Stop taking INGREZZA or INGREZZA SPRINKLE and go to the nearest emergency room right away if you develop these signs and symptoms of allergic reactions and angioedema.\n  * **Sleepiness and tiredness that could cause slow reaction times (somnolence and sedation).** Do not drive a car or operate dangerous machinery until you know how INGREZZA or INGREZZA SPRINKLE affects you. Drinking alcohol and taking other medicines may also cause sleepiness during treatment with INGREZZA or INGREZZA SPRINKLE.\n  * **Heart rhythm problems (QT prolongation).** INGREZZA or INGREZZA SPRINKLE may cause a heart rhythm problem known as QT prolongation. You have a higher chance of getting QT prolongation if you also take certain other medicines during treatment with INGREZZA or INGREZZA SPRINKLE. Tell your healthcare provider right away if you develop any signs or symptoms of QT prolongation, including: fast, slow, or irregular heartbeat (heart palpitations), shortness of breath, dizziness or lightheadedness, or fainting or feeling like you are going to faint.\n  * **Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS).** NMS is a serious condition that can lead to death. Call a healthcare provider right away or go to the nearest emergency room if you develop these symptoms and they do not have another obvious cause: high fever, stiff muscles, problems thinking, irregular pulse or blood pressure, increased sweating, or very fast or uneven heartbeat.\n  * **Parkinson-like symptoms.** Symptoms include: body stiffness, drooling, trouble moving or walking, trouble keeping your balance, shaking (tremors), or falls.\n\n\n\n**Before taking INGREZZA or INGREZZA SPRINKLE, tell your healthcare provider about all of your medical conditions including if you:** have liver or heart problems, are pregnant or plan to become pregnant, or are breastfeeding or plan to breastfeed. \n\n**Tell your healthcare provider about all the medicines you take,** including prescription and over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements. Make sure you tell all of your healthcare providers that you are taking INGREZZA or INGREZZA SPRINKLE. Taking INGREZZA or INGREZZA SPRINKLE with certain other medicines may cause serious side effects. Especially tell your healthcare provider if you: take digoxin or take or have taken a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) medicine. You should not take INGREZZA or INGREZZA SPRINKLE if you are taking, or have stopped taking, a MAOI within the last 14 days.\n\n**The most common side effect of INGREZZA or INGREZZA SPRINKLE in people with tardive dyskinesia** **are** sleepiness and tiredness.\n\n**The most common side effects of INGREZZA or INGREZZA SPRINKLE in people with chorea associated with Huntington's disease include** sleepiness and tiredness, raised itchy red areas on your skin (hives), rash, and trouble getting to sleep or staying asleep.\n\nThese are not all of the possible side effects of INGREZZA or INGREZZA SPRINKLE. Call your doctor for medical advice about side effects. You are encouraged to report negative side effects of prescription drugs to the FDA.

Launches WHAT THE C@H?! Educational Initiative to Support Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia Community\n\n04/24/24\n\n[PDF Version](/node/20936/pdf)\n\n  * _WHAT THE C@H?! provides a platform for_ _the_ _congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) community to find educational information, share experiences and learn about current research._\n\n\n\nSAN DIEGO, April 24, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Neurocrine Biosciences, Inc. (Nasdaq: NBIX) today announced the launch of [WHAT THE C@H?!](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4148495-1&h=3837675622&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwhatthecah.com%2F&a=WHAT+THE+C%40H%3F!)_,_ an educational initiative that aims to close the gap in the need for helpful information about congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) and acknowledges the frustrations and challenges experienced by the community in managing the condition.\n\n[ ![\\(PRNewsfoto/Neurocrine Biosciences, Inc.\\)](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/678850/Neurocrine_Biosciences_Logo.jpg) ](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/678850/Neurocrine_Biosciences_Logo.html)\n\n\"We are proud to introduce this effort to recognize the significant physical and emotional burden individuals and their families experience living with CAH,\" said Eiry W. Roberts, M.D., Chief Medical Officer, Neurocrine Biosciences. \"We hope this educational initiative, which was informed by insights from the community, is helpful to those navigating and managing this difficult condition.\"\n\nWHAT THE C@H?! was created for adults and adolescents living with CAH, parents of children with CAH and providers who treat the condition. Through a form on the website, people can submit their WHAT THE C@H?! moment, a challenging experience of living with or managing the condition. The website features educational information and offers patients and caregivers a space to share their CAH stories with others. \n\nCAH is a rare, genetic condition that results in an enzyme deficiency that alters the production of adrenal hormones which are essential for life.1 CAH is typically identified at or soon after birth and is associated with adrenal insufficiency that can lead to life-threatening adrenal crises and androgen excess.1 People with CAH seek to achieve balance between cortisol deficiency and androgen excess through treatment with glucocorticoids, which have remained the standard for the past 70 years.1 However, side effects of treatment can be difficult to detect or distinguish from the symptoms of CAH itself, making it challenging to determine an appropriate treatment plan throughout various stages of life.\n\n\"For over 70 years, treating the symptoms of CAH has presented challenges not only for people living with the condition and their families, but for healthcare providers who are often balancing trade-offs of treatment with high-dose steroids to improve care for their patients,\" said Dimitri E. Grigoriadis, Ph.D., Distinguished Scholar, Neurocrine Biosciences. \"Neurocrine has a deep history in advancing research in CAH and is proud to launch this educational initiative as part of our ongoing commitment to supporting the community.\"\n\n\"WHAT THE C@H?! provides an empowering and supportive website for individuals living with CAH and parents of children with the condition where they can express themselves, share their stories and learn about other people's experiences,\" said Dina Matos, Executive Director at CARES Foundation. \"It's a unique educational platform that we feel will encourage the community to be their own best advocates by having active and ongoing conversations with their healthcare providers about their symptoms and treatment plan.\"\n\nThe WHAT THE C@H?! healthcare provider-facing website includes interactive educational resources on current CAH monitoring and management practices, in addition to an overview of the potential of corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF1) receptors in CAH.\n\nDozens of interviews were conducted with people living with CAH, their family members and healthcare providers, in addition to extensive market research, including 63 patients and 124 healthcare providers, to inform the educational initiative.\n\nFor more information and to share your WHAT THE C@H?! moment, visit [WhatTheCAH.com](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4148495-1&h=2481613617&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwhatthecah.com%2F&a=WhatTheCAH.com) and follow the initiative on Facebook: [What The CAH?!](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4148495-1&h=2386221097&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2FWhatTheCAH%2F&a=What+The+CAH%3F!).\n\n**About Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia**\n\nCongenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) is a rare genetic condition that results in an enzyme deficiency that alters the production of adrenal hormones which are essential for life. Approximately 95% of CAH cases are caused by a mutation that leads to deficiency of the enzyme 21-hydroxylase (21-OHD). Severe deficiency of this enzyme can lead to an inability of the adrenal glands to produce cortisol and, in approximately 75% of cases, aldosterone. If left untreated, CAH can result in salt wasting, dehydration and even death.\n\nGlucocorticoids (GCs), the current standard of care, are used not only to correct the endogenous cortisol deficiency but doses used are higher than cortisol replacement needed (supraphysiologic) to lower the levels of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and androgens. However, glucocorticoid treatment at supraphysiologic doses has been associated with serious and significant complications of steroid excess, including metabolic issues, such as weight gain and diabetes, cardiovascular disease and osteoporosis. Additionally, long-term treatment with supraphysiologic GC doses may have psychological and cognitive impact, such as changes in mood and memory. Androgen excess has been associated with abnormal bone growth and development in pediatric patients, female health problems, such as acne, excess hair growth and menstrual irregularities, testicular rest tumors in males and fertility issues in both sexes.

The neuropeptide was discovered, isolated and identified by the late Wylie W. Vale, PhD., a founder of Neurocrine Biosciences who led the Clayton Foundation Laboratories for Peptide Biology and was the Helen McLoraine Chair in Molecular Neurobiology at the Salk Institute. Dr. Vale mapped the key role CRF plays in the regulation of the stress response. In the 95% of CAH cases caused by a mutation in the 21-hydroxylase enzyme, severe enzyme deficiency results in little or no production of the stress hormone cortisol, which can lead to adrenal crisis. The lack of cortisol production also causes a break in the feedback loop that would normally regulate the body's secretion of CRF, and as a result ACTH, which maintains adrenal androgen production within normal ranges.\n\n**About CARES Foundation **\n\nCARES Foundation is the only organization in the United States solely dedicated to the congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) community. Founded in 2000, CARES represents approximately 8,000 affected individuals, families and healthcare professionals in the U.S. and more than 70 countries.

Reports Positive Phase 2 Data for NBI-1065845 in Adults with Major Depressive Disorder\n\n04/23/24\n\n[PDF Version](/node/20931/pdf)\n\n  * **_SAVITRI ™ Study Met Primary Endpoint with Statistically Significant Reduction in Montgomery Åsberg Depression Rating Scale_** (**_MADRS) Total Score at Day 28_**\n  * **_Met Key Secondary Endpoints, Including Statistically Significant Reduction in MADRS Score at Day 56_**\n  * **_NBI-1065845 Was Generally Well-Tolerated_**\n\n\n\nSAN DIEGO, April 23, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Neurocrine Biosciences, Inc. (Nasdaq: NBIX), today announced positive topline data for its Phase 2 SAVITRI™ study. This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled dose-finding study assessed the efficacy and safety of NBI-1065845 in adult subjects with major depressive disorder (MDD). NBI-1065845 is an investigational alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid (AMPA) positive allosteric modulator (PAM) in development as a potential treatment for patients with MDD who have not benefited from treatment with at least one antidepressant in their current episode of depression.\n\n[ ![\\(PRNewsfoto/Neurocrine Biosciences, Inc.\\)](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/678850/Neurocrine_Biosciences_Logo.jpg) ](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/678850/Neurocrine_Biosciences_Logo.html)\n\nThe study met its primary and key secondary endpoints, demonstrating that once-daily, oral administration of NBI-1065845 produced a statistically significant change from baseline in Montgomery Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) total score at both Day 28 (primary) and Day 56 (secondary). In the full analysis data set, the least squares (LS) mean differences from baseline in MADRS total score for NBI-1065845 were:\n\n  * One of the doses demonstrated an improvement over placebo of -4.3 (p-value = 0.0159) and -7.5 (p-value = 0.0016) at Day 28 and Day 56, respectively.\n  * The other dose also demonstrated a trend toward improvement over placebo of -3.0 (p-value = 0.0873) and -3.6 (p-value = 0.1082) at Day 28 and Day 56, respectively.\n\n\n\nNBI-1065845 was generally well tolerated. The most common adverse event was headache. The adverse event profile for both doses of NBI-1065845 were comparable to placebo. There were no deaths or serious adverse events. The discontinuation rates were low throughout the study.\n\n\"Many millions of people living with major depressive disorder do not benefit fully from currently available treatments and experience persistent debilitating symptoms,\" said Eiry W. Roberts, M.D., Chief Medical Officer at Neurocrine Biosciences. \"NBI-1065845 has the potential to be a first-in-class treatment to alleviate many of these symptoms of MDD. The Phase 2 data from the SAVITRI study are very encouraging, and we look forward to meeting with the FDA to discuss a path into Phase 3 studies.\"\n\nAdditional data from the SAVITRI study will be shared at a future scientific conference.\n\n**About the Phase 2 SAVITRI™ Study** The Phase 2 SAVITRI™ study is a double-blind, placebo-controlled study designed to assess the efficacy and safety of investigational NBI-1065845 in adult subjects with major depressive disorder (MDD). The study enrolled 183 adults with a primary diagnosis of MDD and who had inadequate response to current antidepressant treatment.\n\n**About NBI-1065845** NBI-1065845 is a potential first-in-class, investigational alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid (AMPA) positive allosteric modulator (PAM) in development as a potential treatment for patients with inadequate response to treatment in MDD. \n\n**About the Collaboration with Takeda** In 2020, Neurocrine Biosciences and Takeda (TSE:4502/NYSE:TAK) entered into a strategic collaboration to develop and commercialize compounds in Takeda's early-to-mid-stage psychiatry pipeline, including an exclusive license to NBI-1065845 (TAK-653). Under the terms of the agreement, Neurocrine Biosciences is responsible for developing and commercializing all compounds included in the collaboration and for compounds other than NBI-1065845 and NBI-1065846, Takeda is eligible to receive development or commercial milestone payments and royalties. For NBI-1065845 and NBI-1065846, Takeda may elect to opt out of a 50:50 profit share at certain development events on a program-by-program basis. Until such time Takeda elects to opt out of either profit share arrangement, it will not be eligible to receive development or commercial milestone payments.\n\n**About Major Depressive Disorder** Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a mental health disorder characterized by a persistently depressed mood, loss of interest, lack of enjoyment in daily activities, poor concentration, and decreased energy. MDD is one of the leading causes of disability. More than 21 million people in the U.S. live with major depressive disorder. It is estimated that roughly 1/3 of people living with major depressive disorder do not respond to available antidepressants.\n\n**About Neurocrine Biosciences** Neurocrine Biosciences is a leading neuroscience-focused, biopharmaceutical company with a simple purpose: to relieve suffering for people with great needs, but few options. We are dedicated to discovering and developing life-changing treatments for patients with under-addressed neurological, neuroendocrine and neuropsychiatric disorders.

When preparing the non-GAAP financial results and guidance, the Company excludes certain GAAP items that management does not consider to be normal, including recurring cash operating expenses that might not meet the definition of unusual or non-recurring items. In particular, these non-GAAP financial measures exclude: non-cash stock-based compensation expense, loss on extinguishment of convertible senior notes, non-cash interest expense related to convertible debt, non-cash amortization expense related to acquired intangible assets, acquisition and integration costs, changes in fair value of equity security investments, changes in foreign currency exchange rates and certain adjustments to income tax expense. These non-GAAP financial measures are provided as a complement to results provided in accordance with GAAP as management believes these non-GAAP financial measures help indicate underlying trends in the Company's business, are important in comparing current results with prior period results and provide additional information regarding the Company's financial position. Management also uses these non-GAAP financial measures to establish budgets and operational goals that are communicated internally and externally and to manage the Company's business and evaluate its performance. The Company provides guidance regarding combined R&D and SG&A expenses on both a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis. A reconciliation of these GAAP financial results to non-GAAP financial results is included in the attached financial information.\n\n**_Forward-Looking Statements_** In addition to historical facts, this press release contains forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties.
