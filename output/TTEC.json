We are executing against our top strategic priorities alongside taking the necessary profit improvement actions to strengthen our balance sheet and return the company to long-term revenue growth and increased profitability,\" Tuchman concluded.\n\n**THIRD QUARTER 2024 FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS**\n\n**Revenue**\n\n  * Third quarter 2024 GAAP revenue decreased 12.2 percent to $529.4 million compared to $603.0 million in the prior year.\n  * Foreign exchange had a $0.5 million negative impact on revenue in the third quarter of 2024.\n\n\n\n**Income (Loss) from Operations**\n\n  * Third quarter 2024 GAAP income from operations was $12.9 million, or 2.4 percent of revenue, compared to income from operations of $25.4 million, or 4.2 percent of revenue, in the prior year.\n  * Non-GAAP income from operations, excluding restructuring and impairment charges, equity-based compensation expenses, amortization of purchased intangibles, and other items, was $34.1 million, or 6.4 percent of revenue, compared to $47.3 million, or 7.8 percent, for the prior year.\n  * Foreign exchange had a $2.6 million positive impact on Non-GAAP income from operations in the third quarter of 2024.\n\n\n\n**Adjusted EBITDA**\n\n  * Third quarter 2024 Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA was $50.3 million, or 9.5 percent of revenue, compared to $63.9 million, or 10.6 percent of revenue, in the prior year.\n\n\n\n**Net Income (Loss)**\n\n  * Third quarter 2024 GAAP net loss was $19.0 million, or negative 3.6 percent of revenue, compared to net income of $1.8 million, or 0.3 percent of revenue, in the prior year.\n  * Non-GAAP net income was $5.4 million, or 1.0 percent of revenue, compared to Non-GAAP net income of $22.9 million, or 3.8 percent of revenue, in the prior year.\n\n\n\n**Net Income (Loss) Per Share**\n\n  * Third quarter 2024 GAAP fully diluted net loss per share was $0.40 compared to net income per share of $0.04 in the prior year.\n  * Non-GAAP fully diluted net income per share was $0.11 compared to Non-GAAP net income per share of $0.48 in the prior year.\n\n\n\n**CASH FLOW AND BALANCE SHEET**\n\n  * Cash flow from operations in the third quarter of 2024 was a negative $91.4 million compared to a negative $31.7 million for the third quarter of 2023.\n  * Free cash flow in the third quarter of 2024 was a negative $100.2 million compared to a negative $53.5 million in the prior year. The decline was primarily related to the impact of the accounts receivable factoring facility discontinuation in the quarter. This discontinuation negatively impacted our cash flow from operations by $81.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and $101.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Excluding the factoring facility impact, free cash flow in the third quarter of 2024 was negative $18.4 million. The year-over-year improvement reflects improved working capital conversion and lower capital expenditures, partially offset by lower profitability.\n  * Capital expenditures in the third quarter of 2024 were $8.8 million compared to $21.8 million for the third quarter of 2023.\n  * As of September 30, 2024, TTEC had cash and cash equivalents of $96.9 million and debt of $1,028.4 million, resulting in a net debt position of $931.5 million. This compares to a net debt position of $815.7 million for the same period in 2023. The increase in net debt is also primarily explained by the discontinuation of the accounts receivable factoring facility.\n  * As of September 30, 2024, TTEC's remaining borrowing capacity under its revolving credit facility was approximately $140 million compared to $215 million for the same period in 2023.\n  * On November 4, 2024, the Board of Directors of the Company suspended the Company's semi-annual cash dividend as part of its ongoing shift to prioritize debt reduction associated with strategic acquisitions and other investments in the business. The Board expects to review the dividend suspension in the future to determine, in light of facts and circumstances at that time, whether and when to reinstate a semi-annual cash dividend.\n\n\n\n**SALE OF MATERIAL ASSET NOT USED IN OPERATIONS**\n\nOn November 5, 2024, the Company closed the transaction of a real estate asset held for sale in Englewood, Colorado for $45.5 million dollars, subject to customary adjustments. Prior to the COVID pandemic, the building was used as the Company's principal place of business. The Company intends to use the proceeds from the sale to reduce its outstanding balance under the revolving line of credit.\n\n**SEGMENT REPORTING & COMMENTARY**\n\nTTEC reports financial results for TTEC Digital and TTEC Engage business segments. Financial highlights for the two business segments are provided below.\n\n**TTEC Digital – Design, build and operate tech-enabled, insight-driven CX solutions**\n\n  * Third quarter 2024 GAAP revenue for TTEC Digital decreased 13.2 percent to $115.7 million from $133.3 million for the year ago period. Income from operations was $7.5 million, or 6.5 percent of revenue, compared to income from operations of $11.9 million, or 8.9 percent of revenue, in the prior year. The year-over-year reduction primarily relates to a large one-time on-premise sale in the prior year period. Excluding on-premise sales, TTEC Digital's professional services and recurring revenue together increased by 5.9 percent year over year in the third quarter. \n  * Non-GAAP income from operations was $14.4 million, or 12.5 percent of revenue, compared to Non-GAAP income from operations of $19.4 million, or 14.5 percent of revenue, in the prior year.\n\n\n\n**TTEC Engage – Digitally-enabled customer care, acquisition, and fraud mitigation services**\n\n  * Third quarter 2024 GAAP revenue for TTEC Engage decreased 11.9 percent to $413.8 million from $469.7 million for the year ago period. Income from operations was $5.4 million, or 1.3 percent of revenue, compared to income from operations of $13.5 million, or 2.9 percent of revenue, in the prior year.\n  * Non-GAAP income from operations was $19.7 million, or 4.8 percent of revenue, compared to Non-GAAP income from operations of $27.9 million, or 5.9 percent of revenue, in the prior year.\n  * Foreign exchange had a $0.6 million negative impact on revenue and a $2.6 million positive impact on income from operations.\n\n\n\n**BUSINESS OUTLOOK**\n\n\"We are achieving many of the key objectives that we set forth during this transitional year,\" commented Kenny Wagers, chief financial officer of TTEC. \"In TTEC Digital, we are diversifying our CX technology partnerships and broadening our expertise and capabilities across Contact Center, CRM, AI and analytics solutions. In TTEC Engage, we are launching new client programs across our expanded geographic footprint, working through the previously mentioned headwinds, and executing upon our profit optimization initiatives. \n\nWagers continued, \"At the company level, we are re-iterating full year 2024 guidance near the lower end of the range that we provided last quarter. At the segment level, the appropriate contribution adjustments were made to reflect our third-quarter actual results and updated fourth-quarter forecasts. As we prepare to transition into 2025, we remain focused on our strategic priorities and resolute in our ability to return TTEC to long-term organic growth and increased profitability.\"\n\n**TTEC Full Year 2024 Outlook**  \n---  \n**Full Year 2024****Guidance** |  **Full Year 2024****Mid-Point**  \nRevenue |  $2,210M — $2,260M |  $2,235M  \nNon-GAAP adjusted EBITDA |  $201M — $217M |  $209M  \nNon-GAAP adjusted EBITDA margins |  9.1% — 9.6% |  9.3 %  \nNon-GAAP operating income |  $134M — $150M |  $142M  \nNon-GAAP operating income margins |  6.1% — 6.6% |  6.3 %  \nInterest expense, net |  ($82M) — ($84M) |  ($83M)  \nNon-GAAP adjusted tax rate |  40% — 46% |  43 %  \nDiluted share count |  47.6M — 47.8M |  47.7M  \nNon-GAAP earnings per a share |  $0.64 — $0.83 |  $0.73  \n**Engage Full Year 2024 Outlook**  \n**Full Year 2024****Guidance** |  **Full Year 2024****Mid-Point**  \nRevenue |  $1,737M — $1,767M |  $1,752M  \nNon-GAAP adjusted EBITDA |  $137M — $147M |  $142M  \nNon-GAAP adjusted EBITDA margins |  7.9% — 8.3% |  8.1 %  \nNon-GAAP operating income |  $81M — $91M |  $86M  \nNon-GAAP operating income margins |  4.7% — 5.2% |  4.9 %  \n**Digital Full Year 2024 Outlook**  \n**Full Year 2024****Guidance** |  **Full Year 2024****Mid-Point**  \nRevenue |  $473M — $493M |  $483M  \nNon-GAAP adjusted EBITDA |  $63M — $69M |  $66M  \nNon-GAAP adjusted EBITDA margins |  13.4% — 14.1% |  13.8 %  \nNon-GAAP operating income |  $52M — $58M |  $55M  \nNon-GAAP operating income margins |  11.1% — 11.8% |  11.5 %  \n  \nThe Company has not quantitatively reconciled its guidance for Non-GAAP operating income, Non-GAAP operating income margins, Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA, Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA margins, Non-GAAP adjusted tax rate, or Non-GAAP earnings per share to their respective most comparable GAAP measures because certain of the reconciling items that impact these metrics, including restructuring and impairment charges, equity-based compensation expense, changes in acquisition contingent consideration, depreciation and amortization expense, and provision for income taxes are dependent on the timing of future events outside of the Company's control or cannot be reliably predicted. Accordingly, the Company is unable to provide reconciliations to GAAP operating income, operating income margins, EBITDA margins, and diluted earnings per share without unreasonable effort. Please note that the unavailable reconciling items could significantly impact the Company's 2024 financial results as reported under GAAP.\n\n**NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES**\n\nThis press release contains a discussion of certain Non-GAAP financial measures that the Company includes to allow investors and analysts to measure, analyze and compare its financial condition and results of operations in a meaningful and consistent manner. A reconciliation of these Non-GAAP financial measures can be found in the tables accompanying this press release.\n\n  * **GAAP** metrics are presented in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.\n  * **Non-GAAP** - As reflected in the attached reconciliation table, the definition of Non-GAAP may exclude from operating income, EBITDA, net income and earnings per share restructuring and impairment charges, equity-based compensation expenses, amortization of purchased intangibles, among other items.\n\n\n\n**EARNINGS WEBCAST/CONFERENCE CALL**\n\nThe Company will host a live webcast and conference call at 8:30 a.m. ET on Thursday, November 7, 2024.
