Announces that it has recently received an order for fifteen of its new generation F280® GNSS Aided Inertial Navigation Systems \\(“GNSS Aided INS”\\) for Contract Value of $576,000\")\n\nNovember 12, 2024\n\n**ORLANDO, FL, Nov. 12, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --** Coda Octopus Group, Inc. (“CODA” or the “Company”) (Nasdaq: CODA), a global market leader in 3D/4D/5D/6D imaging sonar technology for real time subsea intelligence and cutting-edge diving technology, today announced that its Marine Technology Business Unit (“Products Business”) received an order for fifteen (15) of its new generation F280® GNSS Aided INS systems (“Motion products”) valued at approximately $576,000 and which will be used in a foreign Navy Program.\n\nAnnmarie Gayle, CODA’s Chairman and CEO, commented: “We are very pleased to have received this order for this new foreign Navy Program. The F180 Series® (the predecessor product to our new F280 Series®) formed part of the staple of Motion products sold by the Products Business for over 20 years and historically has contributed to up to 10% of the Products Business annual revenue. In 2020, we initiated the development of our new generation of Motion Products with a focus on delivering accuracy and precision of motion data to the marine surveying and measurement markets. This program is likely to expand as the customer brings on additional vessels, and we are therefore very pleased that our F280 Series® GNSS Aided inertial navigation system was selected for this program, with the possibility of repeat multiple orders during the life of the program. The F280 Series® instruments are used to provide very high accuracy positioning, heading, pitch, roll, yaw and heave measurement data at sea. We sell these as standalone systems and they are also paired with the Echoscope® to form our Underwater Inspection System (UIS) Solution”.\n\n**About Coda Octopus Group, Inc.**\n\nThe Company, founded in 1994, is an established supplier to the Underwater/Subsea market. It supplies a range of hardware and software solutions to this market which includes key proprietary real time 4D/5D/6D imaging sonars, marketed under the name Echoscope® and Echoscope PIPE® addressing the underwater imaging sensor market along with new generation diving technology, Diver Augmented Vision Display (DAVD) system. The Company’s Echoscope PIPE® sonar generates real-time 3D/4D/5D images of moving objects underwater including in zero visibility water conditions. The Echoscope® technology is used globally for numerous applications in both the commercial offshore market and defense underwater markets. Applications for the Echoscope® technology include complex mapping underwater, subsea intervention, subsea asset placements, salvage and recovery, search and rescue, offshore renewables cable installations and surveys, marine construction, subsea infrastructure installation, mining applications, robotics (3D Perception and Depth), breakwater construction and monitoring, decommissioning, diving applications and port and harbor security.\n\nThe recently launched new generation of diving technology, DAVD, has the potential to change the way global diving operations are performed (both in the Defense and Commercial space) because it is a fully integrated singular system for topside control and fully connected diver HUD system, allowing both the topside and diver to share a range of critical information and visualize the same underwater scene. Furthermore, the DAVD integrates the Company’s sonar technology, which allows dive operations to be performed in zero visibility conditions, a common problem that besets these operations.\n\nThe Company also includes two discrete Defense engineering businesses Coda Octopus Martech Ltd (UK based) and Coda Octopus Colmek, Inc. (US based) whose primary business model is to supply sub-assemblies into broader mission critical programs in the capacity of sub-contractors to the Prime Defense Contractors. Their scope of supply under these programs typically includes concept, design, prototype, manufacturing, and post-sale support. This gives them the opportunity to have repeat orders for these sub-assemblies through the life of these programs.\n\nFor further information, please visit [http://www.codaoctopusgroup.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=XENunB5XKvtYs8hD1BrFh_3WbK3kGrjCu5DPzTC-3mhK24njsRN50_SSby1KRnQVrvirCZJ67VRlirvWHM-8G90AEfmWlXwcRfJ3zKN2fhXdt4Adfwz9OQxU6vc35J09) or contact us at [coda@codaoctopusgroup.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=xd4kJsSj7sFAIfdjzZfkg6DokNmoSBN15WD1IivEX6_ZEV793HutL_mDLsMw8cPD8LlDwtnIHorCk8-1bgSBAeeI-fl0UL1WQYD01g_4rUAf2qNY044cspg0ooMdBqpk).\n\n**Forward Looking Statement**\n\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements concerning Coda Octopus Group, Inc. within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

Operating income increased by 61.2% and was $1.4\nmillion in TQ2024 versus $0.9 million. The increase in operating income is attributed to the\nincrease in our revenue in conjunction with higher gross profit margins driven by the mix of\nsales including a higher utilization of our rental assets during the TQ2024.\nThe numbers below have been rounded to one decimal point (unless 2 decimal places\nrequired to differentiate). The full TQ2024 and YTD financials can be found in CODA’s\nForm 10-Q filed with the SEC.\nIn the TQ2024 and the TQ2023:\nTotal revenue was $5.5 million compared to $4.9 million, representing an increase in\nthe TQ2024 of 12.0%.\nRevenues from the Marine Technology Business (Products) were $3.1 million\ncompared to $2.9 million, representing a 6.5% increase in the TQ2024.\nRevenues from the Marine Engineering Business (Services) were $2.4 million\ncompared to $2.0 million, representing an increase of 19.8% in the TQ2024.\nThe Company generated gross profit of $4.0 million compared to $3.4 million. Gross\nmargin was 73.9% compared to 68.8%. The increase in margins is attributable to the\nmix of sales which included increased utilization of our rental assets and associated\nservices.\nOperating income increased and was $1.4 million compared to $0.9 million. Operating\nmargin was 25.4% compared to 17.6%.\nIncome before taxes increased and was $1.6 million compared to $1.1 million. Net\nincome after taxes was $1.3 million compared to $1.0 million.\nDiluted earnings per share increased and was $0.11 compared to $0.09 in TQ2023.\nCODA’s balance sheet continued to strengthen in TQ2024. Total Liabilities and\nStockholders’ Equity improved over the end of fiscal year 2023 by $4.1 million to $55.9\nmillion. The quarter-end cash balance of $25.2 million represents a $0.3 million\nincrease over TQ2023 and an increase of $0.8 million over the end of fiscal year 2023.\nYTD2024 Financial Summary:\nIn the YTD2024 and the YTD2023:\nTotal revenue for the YTD2024 period was $15.3 million compared to $15.8 million in\nYTD2023, a decrease of 3.3%.\nYear to date, the Company generated gross profit of $10.9 million compared to $10.7\nmillion in YTD2023. Gross margin in YTD2024 was 71.3% compared to 68.0% in\nYTD2023.\nOperating income in YTD2024 was $3.3 million compared to $3.1 million in YTD2023\nand operating margin was 21.6% compared to 19.4% in the same period last year.\nIncome before taxes in the YTD2024 period was $4.1 million compared to $3.5 million\nin YTD2023. Net income after taxes was $3.3 million in the YTD2024 compared to\n$3.4 million in YTD2023 period.\nYear to date diluted earnings per share were $0.29 compared to $0.31 in FY2023.\nNet profit before tax as a percentage of revenues for the YTD2024 was 26.6%\ncompared to 22.0% for YTD2023. Research and Development expenditures for the\nYTD2024 were $1.52 million compared to $1.54 million in YTD2023, a decrease of\n0.9%. SG&A for the YTD2024 was $6.05 million compared to $6.14 million, a reduction\nof 1.4%.\nManagement Commentary\n“Management continues to focus on growing the Company while continuing to demonstrate\nthat we run a solid and profitable business year-on-year,” said Annmarie Gayle, CODA’s\nChairman and CEO.\n“In our TQ2024, order intake from US Defense Programs was down, as a result of funding\ngaps created by the upcoming Presidential election. It is not unusual during a Presidential\nelection period that decisions on some programs are postponed until the outcome is\ndecided. Notwithstanding, we were able to increase sales outside the US, and we believe\nthat we have delivered a solid set of results in TQ2024 including increasing revenue, gross\nprofit margin, income and earnings per share.\nWithin the business model of our Marine Technology Business, we have outright sales of\nour technology and rentals with associated support services. In TQ2024 rentals and\nassociated services increased for this segment and contributed to our gross margin for this\nsegment increasing to 82.9% from 82.1% in TQ2023. We however continued to be affected\nby funding gaps on some of the US Defense Programs which we rely on and in the TQ2024\nthe Marine Technology Business sales from US were $0.7 million compared to $1.3 million\nand this has affected funding for ongoing programs such as the DAVD tethered system\nwhere commands are waiting for budget for new acquisitions and DAVD untethered system\n(Hardening Program) where anticipated funding has been delayed.\nThe Engineering segment relies on Defense Programs for funding, and it also suffered from\nweak order intake in the TQ2024. Notwithstanding, this segment’s revenue in the TQ2024\nincreased by 19.8% along with its gross profit margins which increased from 50.0% in the\nTQ2023 to 62.6% in the TQ2024 as a result of the mix of its sales in the TQ2024.\nAs we enter the final quarter of the fiscal year 2024, our priority continues to be making\nprogress with our growth strategy to increase our efforts to have more penetration in the\nDefense market with our key technologies - Echoscope® and DAVD technology - and to\nreturn our Engineering Business to a solid $10 million revenue profile”. We also continue our\nefforts to identify acquisition targets under our M&A Strategy with the goal of adding value\naccretive technologies and capabilities to our portfolio.\nConference Call\nCODA will host a conference call today, September 16, 2024 at 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time\n(7:00 a.m. Pacific Time) to discuss its results for the third fiscal quarter ended July 31, 2024.\nCODA management will provide prepared remarks, followed by a question-and-answer\nperiod.\nDate: Monday, September 16, 2024\nTime: 10:00 a.m. Eastern time (7:00 a.m. Pacific time)\nU.S. dial-in number: 1-877-451-6152 or 1-201-389-0879\nInternational number: 1-201-389-0879 or 1-201-389-0879\nConference ID: 13748467\nThe conference call will broadcast live and available for replay here.\nPersons interested in attending are required to call the conference telephone number\napproximately 10 minutes before the start time.

(“CODA” or the “Company”) (Nasdaq: CODA), a global market leader in real-time 4D/5D/6D imaging sonar technology for real-time subsea intelligence and cutting-edge diving technology, today reported its unaudited financial results for its fiscal third quarter ended July 31, 2024 (TQ2024) and the nine months then ended (YTD2024).\n\nFor TQ2024 revenues increased by 12.0% and we generated revenues of $5.5 million versus $4.9 million during the TQ2023. Operating income increased by 61.2% and was $1.4 million in TQ2024 versus $0.9 million. The increase in operating income is attributed to the increase in our revenue in conjunction with higher gross profit margins driven by the mix of sales including a higher utilization of our rental assets during the TQ2024.\n\n**_The numbers below have been rounded to one decimal point (unless 2 decimal places required to differentiate). The full TQ2024 and YTD financials can be found in CODA’s Form 10-Q filed with the SEC._**\n\n_In the TQ2024 and the TQ2023:_\n\n  * Total revenue was $5.5 million compared to $4.9 million, representing an increase in the TQ2024 of 12.0%.\n  * Revenues from the Marine Technology Business (Products) were $3.1 million compared to $2.9 million, representing a 6.5% increase in the TQ2024.\n  * Revenues from the Marine Engineering Business (Services) were $2.4 million compared to $2.0 million, representing an increase of 19.8% in the TQ2024.\n  * The Company generated gross profit of $4.0 million compared to $3.4 million. Gross margin was 73.9% compared to 68.8%. The increase in margins is attributable to the mix of sales which included increased utilization of our rental assets and associated services.\n  * Operating income increased and was $1.4 million compared to $0.9 million. Operating margin was 25.4% compared to 17.6%.\n  * Income before taxes increased and was $1.6 million compared to $1.1 million. Net income after taxes was $1.3 million compared to $1.0 million. \n  * Diluted earnings per share increased and was $0.11 compared to $0.09 in TQ2023.\n  * CODA’s balance sheet continued to strengthen in TQ2024. Total Liabilities and Stockholders’ Equity improved over the end of fiscal year 2023 by $4.1 million to $55.9 million. The quarter-end cash balance of $25.2 million represents a $0.3 million increase over TQ2023 and an increase of $0.8 million over the end of fiscal year 2023. \n\n\n\n**YTD2024 Financial Summary:**\n\n_In the YTD2024 and the YTD2023:_\n\n  * Total revenue for the YTD2024 period was $15.3 million compared to $15.8 million in YTD2023, a decrease of 3.3%.\n  * Year to date, the Company generated gross profit of $10.9 million compared to $10.7 million in YTD2023. Gross margin in YTD2024 was 71.3% compared to 68.0% in YTD2023.\n  * Operating income in YTD2024 was $3.3 million compared to $3.1 million in YTD2023 and operating margin was 21.6% compared to 19.4% in the same period last year. \n  * Income before taxes in the YTD2024 period was $4.1 million compared to $3.5 million in YTD2023. Net income after taxes was $3.3 million in the YTD2024 compared to $3.4 million in YTD2023 period. \n  * Year to date diluted earnings per share were $0.29 compared to $0.31 in FY2023.\n  * Net profit before tax as a percentage of revenues for the YTD2024 was 26.6% compared to 22.0% for YTD2023. Research and Development expenditures for the YTD2024 were $1.52 million compared to $1.54 million in YTD2023, a decrease of 0.9%. SG&A for the YTD2024 was $6.05 million compared to $6.14 million, a reduction of 1.4%. \n\n\n\n**Management Commentary**\n\n“Management continues to focus on growing the Company while continuing to demonstrate that we run a solid and profitable business year-on-year,” said Annmarie Gayle, CODA’s Chairman and CEO.\n\n“In our TQ2024, order intake from US Defense Programs was down, as a result of funding gaps created by the upcoming Presidential election. It is not unusual during a Presidential election period that decisions on some programs are postponed until the outcome is decided. Notwithstanding, we were able to increase sales outside the US, and we believe that we have delivered a solid set of results in TQ2024 including increasing revenue, gross profit margin, income and earnings per share.\n\nWithin the business model of our Marine Technology Business, we have outright sales of our technology and rentals with associated support services. In TQ2024 rentals and associated services increased for this segment and contributed to our gross margin for this segment increasing to 82.9% from 82.1% in TQ2023. We however continued to be affected by funding gaps on some of the US Defense Programs which we rely on and in the TQ2024 the Marine Technology Business sales from US were $0.7 million compared to $1.3 million and this has affected funding for ongoing programs such as the DAVD tethered system where commands are waiting for budget for new acquisitions and DAVD untethered system (Hardening Program) where anticipated funding has been delayed.\n\nThe Engineering segment relies on Defense Programs for funding, and it also suffered from weak order intake in the TQ2024. Notwithstanding, this segment’s revenue in the TQ2024 increased by 19.8% along with its gross profit margins which increased from 50.0% in the TQ2023 to 62.6% in the TQ2024 as a result of the mix of its sales in the TQ2024.\n\nAs we enter the final quarter of the fiscal year 2024, our priority continues to be making progress with our growth strategy to increase our efforts to have more penetration in the Defense market with our key technologies - Echoscope® and DAVD technology - and to return our Engineering Business to a solid $10 million revenue profile”. We also continue our efforts to identify acquisition targets under our M&A Strategy with the goal of adding value accretive technologies and capabilities to our portfolio.\n\n**Conference Call**\n\nCODA will host a conference call today, September 16, 2024 at 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time (7:00 a.m. Pacific Time) to discuss its results for the third fiscal quarter ended July 31, 2024.\n\nCODA management will provide prepared remarks, followed by a question-and-answer period.\n\nDate: Monday, September 16, 2024Time: 10:00 a.m. Eastern time (7:00 a.m. Pacific time)U.S. dial-in number: 1-877-451-6152 or 1-201-389-0879\n\nInternational number: 1-201-389-0879 or 1-201-389-0879Conference ID: 13748467\n\nThe conference call will broadcast live and available for replay [here](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=udZIbCqJt8oVO8uayQOwXTY0j8oZwfaRYm5T9ha5aOSgAt3tsnOpSXHUFE5U8v3gHLzs6A9HmMr78EmZi8Dg3XXgiZkBFGhArvcvfMAdCjqW-kTN2iPhzJehxzsLQUChlM2yRCXDQ_LFhtLbbZ2GhOMnt_PM-_sR4uDBhRvG5zuyggcb-gg4mq2Ro8di2NftW2PycC3yFGmb3mtWvzq8WvT71RhtssdSylxbFswWwCZoKleTfiLBR6Mo9quCpwpQMddUFSCO7cWr3lcnLT_5GkzzvwGK2Wd2mCoppVgy5E4=).\n\nPersons interested in attending are required to call the conference telephone number approximately 10 minutes before the start time.

It supplies a range of hardware and software solutions to this market which includes key proprietary real-time 4D/5D/6D imaging sonars, marketed under the name Echoscope® and Echoscope PIPE® addressing the underwater imaging sensor market along with new generation diving technology, Diver Augmented Vision Display (DAVD) system. The Company’s Echoscope PIPE® sonar generates real-time 3D/4D/5D/6D images of moving objects underwater including in zero visibility water conditions. The Echoscope® technology is used globally for numerous applications in both the commercial offshore market and defense underwater markets. Applications for the Echoscope® technology include complex mapping underwater, subsea intervention, subsea asset placements, salvage and recovery, search and rescue, offshore renewables cable installations and surveys, marine construction, subsea infrastructure installation, mining applications, robotics (3D Perception and Depth), breakwater construction and monitoring, decommissioning, diving applications and port and harbor security.\n\nThe recently launched new generation of diving technology, DAVD, has the potential to change the way global diving operations are performed (both in the Defense and Commercial space) because it is a fully integrated singular system for topside control and fully connected diver HUD system, allowing both the topside and diver to share a range of critical information and visualize the same underwater scene. Furthermore, the DAVD integrates the Company’s sonar technology, which allows dive operations to be performed in zero visibility conditions, a common problem that besets these operations.\n\nThe Company also includes two discrete Defense engineering businesses Coda Octopus Martech Ltd (UK based) and Coda Octopus Colmek, Inc. (US based) whose primary business model is to supply sub-assemblies into broader mission critical programs in the capacity of sub-contractors to the Prime Defense Contractors. Their scope of supply under these programs typically includes concept, design, prototype, manufacturing, and post-sale support. This gives them the opportunity to have repeat orders for these sub-assemblies through the life of these programs.\n\nFor further information, please visit [http://www.codaoctopusgroup.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=5I0QUx0Cy6ImO6HawWGb757WyTKod52HqmIQYd93LNbtOn5bVabE_I-w_8F7UMoCA2GMx4g4Sd-XkzHN0wgWd5M6tcOyKlzSYpv0gUzKY4Zg8U-1jK4iZOUREtOZSYWy) or contact us at [coda@codaoctopusgroup.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=NfJE19mKWBb3mTPffuXnhhGtOIqx06JlKCQ03JXzcitGoHv-xH7uQeAPUyL7XEKFrAu4MCJmCvEv3o1caUlcIhn7QSKQu5J4RNskygaGEef7TbUmxjJdDRTeBMmjlIWh).\n\n**Forward Looking Statement**\n\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements concerning Coda Octopus Group, Inc. within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

BUSINESS\nCorporate Information\nOur principal executive offices are located at 3300 S. Hiawassee Rd, Orlando, FL 32835. Our telephone number is +1 (407) 735-2406. We maintain a corporate website at\nwww.codaoctopusgroup.com. (the Company’s website). The reference to the Company’s website address does not constitute incorporation by reference in this Form 10-K of\nthe information contained on the Company’s website.\nOverview\nCoda Octopus Group, Inc. (“Coda” “the Company” or “we”), through its wholly owned subsidiaries, operates two distinct businesses:\n● the Marine Technology Business (also referred to in this Form 10-K as “Products Business”, “Products Operations” or “Products Segment”); and\n● the Marine Engineering Business (also referred to in this Form 10-K as “Engineering Business”, “Engineering Operations”, or “Services Segment”).\nAn overview organization chart showing the subsidiaries within each operating segment is set out in this Item 1 (Business) of the Form 10-K.\nThroughout this Form10-K we use certain terminologies in the context of our Echoscope® underwater imaging technology such as 2D, 3D, 4D, 5D and 6D which have\nparticular meaning. In this Form 10-K the meanings of these terminologies are set out below.\nIn geometry, a three-dimensional space (3D) is a space in which a set of three coordinates are required to define the position of a point. These coordinates are in our industry\nreferred to as X, Y and Z, where:\nX This is range in front of the sonar computed from time\nY This is the position horizontally in front of the sonar computed by directionality of the point in space\nZ This is depth of the point in space relative to the sonar\nConversely, a two-dimensional space (2D) is where all points are placed on a flat plane or surface and only comprise of two coordinates being X and Y with no knowledge\nof the depth of the point in 3D space.\n2D Two-Dimension:\nGenerates a slice of data (2D image) in front of the sonar in X (range) and Y (horizontally) but with no knowledge of the Depth of the point\nTraditional in space\nSonar 3D Three-Dimension:\nGenerates a single profile of 3D data (3D profile) containing XY&Z coordinates but where multiple 3D profiles must be taken\nconsecutively to complete a volume in front of the sonar\nUnique to Coda 4D (or 3D Real- Four-Dimension:\nOctopus Time Generates a true 3D Volume Image (depth map) in a single capture and therefore is analogous to a video versus a picture enabling the\nImaging) aggregation of multiple 4D images to the map and also to visualize moving objects in the scene\n5D Five-Dimension:\nThe ability to return multiple detected 3D Volume Images (depth maps) in a single capture, known as full time series data and provides the\nbenefit to equally detect targets at farther ranges (background) as well as near targets (foreground)\n6D Six-Dimension:\nThe ability to generate multiple 4D images using different filtering and beamforming parameters from the same capture. This allows\ndifferent treatment of the detected targets to allow easier interpretation and real-time decision making.\nOur Marine Technology Business is a technology solution provider to the subsea and underwater market. It owns key proprietary technology comprising its real time volumetric\nimaging sonar technology (Echoscope® technology) and diving technology (“DAVD” or Diver Augmented Vision Display), both of which are applicable to the underwater\ndefense and commercial markets. All innovations, design, development and manufacturing of our technology and solutions are performed within the Company with the\nexception of sub-component assemblies. We endeavor to actively protect our innovations by seeking patent protection. This is a part of our strategy to maintain our competitive\nlead in the areas in which we specialize.\nOur imaging sonar technology products and solutions marketed under the name of Echoscope® and Echoscope PIPE® are used primarily in the underwater construction\nmarket, offshore renewables, and offshore oil and gas, complex underwater mapping, salvage operations, dredging, bridge inspection, navigation of underwater hazard, port and\nharbor security, mining, fisheries, commercial and defense diving, marine sciences sectors and more broadly applications for real time 3D monitoring, inspection and\nvisualization underwater. Uniquely, the Echoscope® technology is a single sensor for multiple underwater applications (which sets it apart from competing technologies). Our\ndiving technology marketed under the name “CodaOctopus® DAVD” addresses the global defense and commercial diving markets. It has the potential to radically change how\ndiving operations are performed globally because it delivers real time information simultaneously to the divers underwater and their surface-based dive supervisors. It also\nallows diving operations to be performed in zero visibility water conditions which is a safety challenge for many diving operations. DAVD’s concept of using a pair of glasses\ninside the face mask, helmet or other diving suits is protected by patent. The Company has an exclusive license to exploit this utility patent.\nThe Marine Technology Business operates thorough our wholly owned subsidiaries Coda Octopus Products, Inc (Orlando), Coda Octopus Products Ltd (UK), Coda Octopus\nProducts A/S (Denmark and branch office Coda Octopus Products A/S in The Netherlands), and Coda Octopus Products (India) Private Limited (India).\nOur Marine Engineering Businesses are suppliers of embedded solutions and sub-assemblies which they design and manufacture and sell into mission critical integrated\ndefense systems. The Services Segment established its business in 1977 and has been supporting a number of significant defense programs of record for over 40 years,\nincluding Raytheon’s CIWS and Northrop Grumman’s Mine Hunting Systems Program. The Services Segment’s business model entails designing sub-assembly prototypes\nwhich are utilized in broader defense programs. These prototypes contracts typically lead to contracts for the manufacture, repair and upgrade of these sub-assemblies for the\nlife of the program. We enjoy sole source status for the parts that we design and supply into these programs. This business model ensures recurring and long tail revenues since\nwe continue to supply these parts, typically for the life of the program, which can span decades. Coda Octopus Colmek, Inc. and Coda Octopus Martech Ltd, qualify as small\nbusinesses. This opens opportunities under state requirements to collaborate with Prime Defense Contractors on these programs. A significant part of the revenues generated by\nthe Marine Engineering Business is highly concentrated and are usually derived from a small number of prime defense contractors such as Raytheon or Northrop. In any one\nfinancial year, between 20% to 30% of our consolidated revenues may be derived from these customers either alone or collectively.\n4\nThe Services Segment operates through our wholly owned subsidiaries, Coda Octopus Colmek, Inc (“Colmek”) which we acquired by the Company in 2007, based in Salt Lake\nCity, Utah, and Coda Octopus Martech Limited (“Martech”) which was acquired by the Company in 2006, based in Portland, United Kingdom.\nCross-Group Synergies\nOur Marine Technology Business and Marine Engineering Services Business have established synergies in terms of customers and specialized engineering skills for robust,\nrugged, and repeated engineering solutions relating to data acquisition, data computation and display of the data. Increasingly drawing on each part of the business strengths,\nthe Marine Technology Business and Marine Engineering Business work jointly on projects including responding jointly for responding to invitations to tender for new projects\nwith broader scope. We believe the Services Business is important to our overall growth strategy as it brings significant engineering depth for the development of the\ntechnology solutions offered by the Marine Technology Business. This also ensures tighter control over our intellectual property rights, which are important for our market\nposition.\nKey Pillars for our Growth Plans\nOur Echoscope® and DAVD technologies are our most promising products and solutions for the Company’s near-term growth.\nWe believe that our real time 3D/4D/5D/6D imaging sonars are the only acoustic imaging sonars which are capable of providing real time 3D/4D/5D/6D imaging of moving\nobjects in zero visibility water conditions and also providing users with the capability to make real time 3D physical measurements of objects underwater. Competing acoustic\nimaging sonars such as the multibeam sonars are primarily seabed mapping tools which are not designed to perform complex seabed mapping or imaging of moving objects in\n3D underwater. The Echoscope® technology therefore is a key sensor for underwater inspection and monitoring in real time 3D. We also believe that our new generation of\nEchoscope PIPE® is the only sonar that can generate multiple real time 3D/4D/5D/6D acoustic images using different acoustic parameters in real time such as field of view,\npulse length, filters, beam density and various beamforming modes. This has the potential to reduce the number of underwater sensors that are required on a project at any one\ntime.\nIn our industry we are widely considered the leading solution providers for underwater real time 3D visualization.\nWe also believe that the DAVD tethered system is poised to radically change the way diving operations are performed globally by providing a fully integrated suite of sensor\ndata shared in real time by the dive supervisor on the surface and the diver. Current diving is done largely by poor analog voice command missions from the topside using a\ndisparate suite of systems for video data, communications, and positioning. Furthermore, by combining the DAVD with our real time 3D sonars it allows diving to be\nperformed in difficult water conditions (turbidity or zero visibility issues) and thus addresses the common problem of underwater operations having to be aborted due to\nvisibility issues.\nThe DAVD tethered version is now in early-stage adoption by different teams within the US Navy, such as the underwater construction and salvage teams and has been moved\nfrom the customer’s R&D phase to their operational phase. This means that the DAVD tethered version is now a standard item available for purchase and for which budget lines\nare established within the various user commands within the Navy. To support the continued transfer of the DAVD system to field operations, we are involved in training the\nusers.\nIn the Current FY we continued our global marketing campaigns for the adoption of the DAVD tethered system outside of the US Navy. We believe we have made significant\nprogress with these campaigns. For example, we completed successful field trials of the DAVD and our Echoscope® with a major European Offshore Service Provider, who is\na part of the “Big Four” Dredging companies (these four account for approximately 80% of the global dredging capacity).\nThe major European Offshore Provider conclusion from their final trial assessment report provided to the Company is that:\n“The advantage of the DAVD alone (compass, depth, taking snapshots and presenting graphical information for diver and supervisor) or combined with a 3D live sonar video\nstream is clear and increases safety and efficiency. The 3D sonar fits well within our scope of work and our survey division is aware of this. We think that the combination of\nDAVD and 3D sonar has potential within our organization….”.\nWe also completed successful trials with the Spanish Navy and a number of Japanese Offshore Service Providers.\nWe believe there is momentum around the DAVD solution, and we continue to work with our customer base on adoption plans, including models for adoption. Adoption is a\nprocess because it requires customers intending to take on the DAVD technology, to change their current method and workflow. These and other considerations will impact the\npace at which the transition to the DAVD technology occurs.\nThe DAVD untethered prototype variant (“DUS)” was delivered to our Navy customer for evaluation during fiscal 2023. In the third quarter we received joint funding of\n$750,000 for the delivery of 8 DUS evaluation systems and further customization work for their application and workflow. We have delivered the 8 systems which will\nfacilitate early customer trials. The total funding for this scope is expected to be $2m. This is the first time we have had firm commitment concerning an adoption path by a\nforeign NATO country. We believe the DUS variant represents the biggest market opportunity for the DAVD technology in the USA addressing the defense, law-enforcement,\nand first-responders market.\n5\nThe concept of utilizing a pair of transparent glasses in the Head Up Display (HUD) underwater for this purpose, is protected by patent. All component parts of the DAVD\nsystem are proprietary to the Company and include software (4G USE® DAVD Edition), Diver Processing Pack – telemetry system (DPP), topside Supervisor Console\nController and real time 3D Sonar. The Company benefits from the exclusive license from the U.S. Department of the Navy at Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City\nDivision to utilize the utility patent covering the concept of using the pair of transparent glasses as a data hub underwater. The DAVD tethered variant is an “Approved Navy\nUse” item. The untethered variant is currently going through validation process.\nOur corporate structure is as follows:\nCorporate History\nThe Company began as Coda Technologies Limited. This company now operates under the name Coda Octopus Products Limited, a United Kingdom corporation formed in\n1994 as a start-up company with its origins as a research group at Herriot-Watt University, Edinburgh, Scotland. Initially, its operations consisted primarily of developing\nsoftware for subsea mapping and visualization using sidescan sonar (a technology widely used in commercial offshore geophysical survey and naval mine-hunting to detect\nobjects on, and textures of, the surface of the seabed).\n6\nIn June 2002, we acquired Octopus Marine Systems Ltd, a UK corporation, and changed our name to Coda Octopus Limited. At the time of its acquisition, Octopus Marine\nSystems was producing geophysical products broadly similar to those of Coda, but targeted at the less sophisticated, easy-to-use, “work-horse” market. The Octopus Marine\nSystems acquisition led to the introduction of the Motion product (F180® series) into the Products Segment.\nIn December 2002, Coda Octopus Ltd acquired OmniTech AS, a Norwegian corporation, which became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, and which subsequently\nchanged its name to Coda Octopus R&D AS. At the time of acquisition, this company had been engaged for over ten years in developing a revolutionary imaging sonar\ntechnology capable of producing real time three-dimensional (“3D”) underwater images for use in subsea activities. Coda Octopus Products Limited (Edinburgh based) then\ndeveloped our visualization software (Underwater Survey Explorer) to control and display the images from the real time 3D sonar device. This patented technology is now\nmarketed by us under the brand name “Echoscope®” and Echoscope PIPE®. All activities of this now-defunct Norwegian subsidiary, Coda Octopus R&D AS, have been\ntransferred to Coda Octopus Products Limited (Edinburgh).\nOn July 13, 2004, the Company effected a reverse merger pursuant to the terms of a share exchange agreement between The Panda Project, Inc. (“Panda”), a Florida\ncorporation, and a now defunct entity affiliated with Coda Octopus Ltd. (“Coda Parent”). Panda acquired the shares of Coda Octopus Limited, a UK corporation and a wholly-\nowned subsidiary of Coda Parent, in consideration for the issuance of a total of 1,432,143 shares of common stock to Coda Parent and other shareholders of Coda Octopus\nLimited. The shares issued represented approximately 90.9% of the issued and outstanding shares of Panda. The share exchange was accounted for as a reverse acquisition of\nPanda by Coda. Subsequently, Panda was reincorporated in Delaware and changed its name to Coda Octopus Group, Inc.\nIn June 2006, we acquired Coda Octopus Martech Limited which is part of our Services Segment or Marine Engineering Business. This is an English corporation.\nIn April 2007, we acquired Coda Octopus Colmek, Inc. which is part of our Services Segment or Marine Engineering Business. This is a Utah corporation.\nBoth Martech and Colmek largely have the same business model, provide similar engineering services and sell to a similar customer base (Martech is UK focused and Colmek\nis US focused).\nIn December 2013 Coda Octopus Products Limited established Coda Octopus Products Pty Ltd (Australia) to grow our presence in Australia and New Zealand. These activities\nwere interrupted by the Coronavirus Pandemic in 2020 and since then has been slow to regain momentum.\nIn 2017 Coda Octopus Products Limited established a subsidiary Coda Octopus Products A/S in Denmark as part of the mitigation strategy relating to the UK withdrawal from\nthe European Union.\nIn November 2021 Coda Octopus Products Limited established a subsidiary Coda Octopus Products (India) Private Limited intended to gain access to this market and to recruit\ncritical resources for software development.\nCoda Octopus Group, Inc., is organized under the laws of the State of Delaware as a holding company that conducts its business through subsidiaries, several of which are\norganized under the laws of foreign jurisdictions, including England, Scotland, Denmark, The Netherlands, Australia and recently India. This may have an adverse impact on\nthe ability of U.S. investors to enforce a judgment obtained in U.S. courts against these entities, or to effect service of process on the officers and directors managing the foreign\nsubsidiaries. These companies’ operations must comply with the laws of the countries under which they are incorporated and are likely to be different from the equivalent laws\nof the United States.\n7\nMarine Technology Business (“Products Segment”)\nOur Marine Technology Business develops proprietary solutions for both the commercial and defense subsea market. The range of our solutions are complementary and\ninclude:\nType of Systems Description\nGeophysical Systems Comprising Hardware and Software;\nGNSS-Aided Navigation Systems (Attitude and Positioning Systems) Comprising Hardware and Software\nReal Time Volumetric Imaging Sonar Comprising Hardware and Software\nDiver Augmented Vision Display System Comprising Hardware and Software\nThese products are sold, leased or rented into various marine sectors and include:\n● Marine geophysical survey\n● Offshore Renewables (“Wind Energy”)\n● Underwater construction, inspection and monitoring\n● Diving Companies\n● Commercial and Defense Diving\n● Salvage and decommissioning\n● Oil and Gas (“O&G”)\n● Commercial fisheries\n● Environmental, mammal and habitat monitoring\n● Underwater Defense Applications\n● Marine vehicles and robotics\n● Port and Harbor Security, law enforcement and first responders\n● Research and education\n1. Geophysical Range of Products\nGeophysical Hardware and Software\nWe started our business in 1994 designing and developing the GeoSurvey® software and hardware package for acquisition and processing of sidescan sonar and sub-bottom\nprofiler data. For over two decades, our GeoSurvey has been an industry leading software package in the market for data acquisition and interpretation and provides feature rich\nsolutions and productivity enhancing tools for the most exacting survey requirements. Designed specifically for sidescan and sub-bottom data acquisition, GeoSurvey has been\npurchased by numerous leading survey companies throughout the world and has been for many years the workhorse for processing data for Oil & Gas companies.\nThe Geophysical range of products marketed under the brands DA4G and GeoSurvey® are important for both Offshore Renewables and O&G. We therefore believe that with\nthe expansion of the markets into Offshore Renewables, we will see an increase in the take-up of this product suite, particularly in the global rental market. Our GeoSurvey®\nand DA4G ranges are strong brands in these markets and consists of a range of hardware and software products for acquisition and post-processing of sidescan sonar and sub-\nbottom profiler data, which includes analog and digital interfaces compatible with all geophysical survey systems.\nOur Survey Engine® software product offers a more advanced post-processing solution for sidescan sonar and sub-bottom profiler data. Designed to streamline processing of\nvery large data it offers comprehensive processing, interpretation, visualization, reporting and exporting functionality.\nWe continue to advance this range of products and in 2018 we launched our first product based on Artificial Intelligence techniques which allows us to automatically identify\nboulders on the seabed – SEADP – “Survey Engine Automatic Object Detection”. This new product presents a real opportunity to radically change workflow process for post-\nprocessing and analyzing side scan sonar data to assess, among other things, the suitability of an area for exploration and construction activities (O&G installations, pipeline\nand cable laying activities).\n2. Inertial Positioning and Attitude Measurement Systems (“Motion Products”)\nOur Motion Products are Global Navigational Satellite System (referred to in the industry as “GNSS” Aided Inertial Measurement Units) that provide measurement data on the\nposition and attitude of a vessel (heading, pitch, roll and yaw of the vessel). This device provides real-time data on these measurements which are applied to compensate for\nvessel movement in order to align sonar data and remove motion blur. We have had our F180® series on the market for over 15 years and due to the advancement of technology\nand the increasing demand for more precise GNSS Aided instruments, we have now developed our new generation of Motion Products, our F280 Series®.\nWe have now completed the ground up development of our new generation of Motion Products F280 Series® for accurate position, heading, pitch, roll and yaw at sea. The new\nF280 Series® is based on more advanced technology and is more accurate than our previous generation of F180® products. The new technology is much more scalable towards\nfuture development of new product variants. The F280 Series® is highly complementary to our real time Echoscope® sonar series and they are packaged together to provide a\nmore comprehensive solution. The F280® can be sold with or without our Echoscope®.\n3. Real Time Volumetric Imaging Sonars (ranging from 3D/4D, 5D and 6D)\nWe design, develop and supply what we believe is the world’s most advanced series of real time volumetric imaging sonar. This is the culmination of over 25 years of research\nand development. This technology is protected by multiple patents. Furthermore, we continue to file patents relating to our new and revolutionary 5D and 6D real time\nvolumetric imaging sonars (marketed under the name Echoscope PIPE® (Parallel Intelligent Processing Engine). Our sonar innovations are multi-tiered and extend to hardware,\nfirmware and software, all of which co-exist and are co-dependent on each other. In other words, hardware, firmware and software operate as sub-systems to each other. We\nbelieve that the highly complex nature of this new technology will make it extremely difficult to reverse engineer our products. Pioneering this unique technology gives us a\nsignificant advantage over our competitors in the subsea real time 3D imaging sonar market sectors. We also believe that our three-tier product development capability of\nhardware, software and solution delivery adds to our competitive lead.\nWe believe that this technology is superior to the other imaging sonars in the market as it generates real time 3D, 4D, 5D and 6D images of the underwater environment\nirrespective of low or zero visibility conditions and, unlike conventional sonars, can image a volume (as opposed to a slice of data) and provide real time 3D inspection and\nmonitoring capability underwater. The capability of our volumetric imaging sonars covers a broad breadth of activities underwater particularly for any form of underwater\nconstruction, salvaging, placements, decommissioning, obstacle avoidance, complex underwater mapping and real time 3D navigation in zero visibility conditions. Uniquely\nalso, using a single sensor (our Echoscope PIPE®) range we can provide different outputs to the various parts of the survey team, thus reducing the number of different sensors\nrequired on these underwater projects and thus the costs associated with these underwater operations.\n8\nAbout the Company’s 5D and 6D Sonars Innovations\n5D and 6D imaging sonars are new to the subsea market and constitute an innovation by the Company. We have several patent applications pending for these innovations.\n5D Sonars (Echoscope PIPE®)\nThe advancement that the Company has made with its 5D Sonars is the ability to process and utilize much more of the data that is acquired by our volumetric imaging sonars.\nDue to the state of the art of processing generally, there was an upper limit to the quantity of the acquired data that could be processed and displayed by our antecedent sonars.\nThis meant that in the previous generation of sonars when a signal was emitted, it returned a single range and intensity value per beam. In the 5D Sonars we return multiple\nrange and intensity values per beam (Full Time Series data). This new capability provides more information about the underwater environment. For example, it will give the\nuser the ability to see multiple layers of soft target areas underwater such as gas leaks and suspended sediment above the seabed all concurrently (not one or the other) or\nconcurrent imagery of marine life, sea growth on installations and the installations themselves. Our 5D capability is protected by recently granted patents.\n6D Sonars (Echoscope PIPE®)\nThe Company’s 6D Sonars process and utilize much more of the data acquired by the sonar. 6D Sonars generate multiple real time 3D Full Time Series Images. In the previous\ngeneration of sonar, we could image and display one 3D Image in real time. Our PIPE technology generates multiple 3D images simultaneously in real time using different\nsonar/acoustic parameters (such as different beamforming methods, frequency, range, field of view, pulse length and other acoustic filters or shading). This allows for different\ndata sets to be provided to different parts of the survey team in real time (thus consolidating the sensors and the associated costs and effectiveness of the solution). We are not\naware of any sonars that offer either 5D or 6D Capability.\nIn summary, our previous generation of real time 3D sonar was capable of providing only single acoustic images of underwater objects in real time 3D whereas the PIPE family\nof sonars is capable of providing multiple acoustic images of underwater objects in real time 3D/4D thus providing significantly more benefits to our customers.\nEchoscope® Sonar Hardware\nDuring fiscal 2019, we completed critical innovation and advancement milestones around our core volumetric real time sonar technology. We have now introduced the world’s\nfirst 5D and 6D series of volumetric imaging sonar technology. This new series of sonars are marketed under the brand name Echoscope PIPE® (an acronym for Parallel\nIntelligent Processing Engine). We believe our 5D and 6D series of sonars herald a significant leap forward in real time subsea imaging as this inventive capability allows a\nsingle sonar to provide different parts of the survey operations with multiple real time data sets (as opposed to one 3D dataset) for each part of the survey teams’ requirements.\nA summary of some of the differences between our standard Echoscope® sonar series and our newly launched Echoscope PIPE® series of sonars are set out below:\nDescription Echoscope4G® Echoscope PIPE® Sonars\nReal Time Capability Yes, 4D Images Yes, 4D, 5D and 6D\n90°x44° (triple frequency only), 100°x44° - 76°x33° (triple frequency only)\nAngular Cover Dual Frequency\n50ox50o 54ox54o - 46ox46o\n24ox24o 33ox33o - 25ox25o\nAdaptive Frequency Band Capability No Yes\nPing Rate Up to 20Hz Up to 40Hz\nMultiple Real Time 4D Images No, one single Real Time Image Capable of Multiple Real Time Images\nNumber of Beams and Values per Beam 128x128x1 Value 180x180x up to 2,500 Values (depending on viewing range)\nMultiple Sequential Configuration Files to capture and No Capability Up to 10 Configuration sets for real time capture and display\ndisplay data using different parameters\nFull Time Series Raw Data Capture No Capability Capture of Raw Data Capture\nFull Time Series Raw Data Offline Processing No Capability Capable of Raw Data Offline Processing\nMultiple Parallel Beamformed Data Output No Capability Capable of Multiple Parallel Beamformed Data Outputs\nSmart Ping Manager using Frequency, Field of View, No Capability Capable\nFiltering in Real-Time\nAdvanced Beamforming Mode No Capability Capable (allowing dynamic change of FoV and number of beams on target\n(Beam Density), in- creasing resolution and definition of underwater target.\nVarious Types include:\nDifferent Dynamic Form of Beamforming None\n(1) Coefficient Beamforming\n(2) FFT Beamforming\n(3) Split Aperture Beamforming\nEnhanced Resolution 3D Images Capability None Our new technique for processing results in enhanced imaging. Using our\npatented Split Aperture Processing Technique results in higher resolution 3D\nsonar Images with higher level of accuracy.\n9\nWe believe that our Echoscope® technology will shepherd in the new generation of underwater real time 3D imaging sonar which will evolve into a real time information\nplatform and gain market share through the increased adoption of real time 3D volumetric imaging sonar technology. Current competing imaging technologies such as the\nsingle beam, multibeam and scanning sonars are either 2D real time imaging sonars or 3D imaging sonars which are not capable of real time 3D imaging, that is to generate a\n3D image underwater of moving objects. The competing 3D technology, the multibeam, which is the current standard bearer for imaging sonars in the market is for mapping of\nthe seabed. The Echoscope® technology can also map the seabed (and is superior to the multibeam for complex mapping and inspection of complex underwater structures) but\ncan also image in real time 3D moving objects underwater. The Echoscope® is therefore the primary tool of choice for inspecting and monitoring in real time 3D all types of\nunderwater operations and is the only choice in poor visibility conditions. In addition, the Echoscope® in many instances enables the user to monitor underwater operations\nfrom a surface vessel replacing the Remotely Operated Vehicles (ROVs) thus bringing considerable cost savings to our customers.\nPrior to January 2018, we were selling our third generation (3G) sonar series. In January 2018 we launched the first product within our fourth generation series of sonars (“4G\nsonar series”). The 4G sonar series was an important development milestone for the Company since it removed several barriers to market adoption. Since its introduction we\nhave seen an increased number of units being sold or rented. Due to the form factor of our previous generation of 3G sonar series this limited the types of underwater vehicles\nthis generation of sonar could be integrated on (and therefore be used for) due to (i) size; (ii) weight and (iii) power requirements (“form factor barriers”). With the launch of\nour 4G sonar series we have removed these form factor barriers and can now integrate on the majority of underwater vehicles in the market including the new and fast emerging\nsmaller underwater vehicles such as autonomous surface vehicles (ASVs) and unmanned underwater vehicles (UUVs) which are propelling growth in the underwater market,\nthus opening potentially new market opportunities for the Company’s technology. For example, we are now able to integrate on the Videoray Defender which is the US Navy\nselected platform for small manned portable vehicles. Our antecedent sonars due to their form factors would not be able to operate on this class of vehicles. The 4G sonar series\ndevelopment is therefore this is a very significant milestone in the Company’s progress and opens the potential to grow its market share of imaging sonars.\nThe 4G sonar series developments were largely form factor driven as opposed to being based on performance and capability advancements. In the fiscal years 2019 and 2020\nwe continued to build on our initial 4G innovations with a renewed focus on performance and capability advancements, particularly on the beamforming and the data\nprocessing capability of our sonar series. In the antecedent generation of our sonars, due to limitations in processing technology there were restrictions on how much of the\ncaptured Echoscope® sonar data could be processed by us. Our previous generations of sonar processed 16,384 pieces of data per sonar ping (compared to around 256 pieces of\ndata per sonar ping for competing technology such as the multibeam). Under our new Echoscope PIPE® sonar series for each signal that is generated by the sonar we receive\nback up to 40 million pieces of information which we can now process. In this context, we have two recent patents which cover “a method of compressing beamforming sonar\ndata” and “a method of compressing sonar data”. We believe that this allows us to deliver to the market the first 5-Dimensional (5D) sonar and 6-Dimensional (6D) sonar\ncapabilities and significantly builds on our 4G sonar series which radically changed the form factor and power requirements which were previously barriers to increased\nadoption. We started selling Echoscope PIPE® in the market in March 2020. We are also seeing increased interest in Echoscope PIPE® technology in the market especially with\nOEM underwater vehicle manufacturers from the defense space.\nThe release of the Echoscope PIPE® hardware is a further significant milestone for the Company. We are now focused on delivering additional competitive value to our\nimaging sonar technology via firmware and software capability. The finalization of this development now gives the Company a real opportunity to pursue its strategy to\nstandardize this technology in the underwater imaging sonar market. We believe that in order to make the subsea and underwater market more efficient, it is mandatory that the\nstandard moves to a real time 3D information platform. Many underwater operations are stalled due to poor visibility water conditions, preventing the remotely operated\nvehicles (ROVs) from flying and also the lack of ability to utilize the sonar data immediately because it requires post processing, which represents a significant challenge and\ncosts. The subsea market is experiencing high structural and technological transitional changes including the introduction of the new generation of smaller and lighter vessels\n(both surface and underwater). This creates a demand for new sensors and solutions for real time 3D imaging. We believe that our lead in this area gives us a real opportunity to\nincrease our market share and we continue to see significant interest in the Defense/Naval market for our Echoscope PIPE® technology.\nEchoscope® Software\nThe Echoscope® technology works in conjunction with our internally developed software (USE, Construction Monitoring System (CMS), 4G US® and 4G USE® DAVD\nEdition). The software is a critical component of the capabilities and features of our sonar series.\nOur software development capability is an important part of our strategy to maintain our lead in designing, manufacturing, and selling state-of-the-art real time volumetric\nimaging sonars and our DAVD System. It also allows us to be responsive to our customers’ requirements for new features and capabilities around our solutions.\nWe have now launched our fourth-generation multi-sensor software platform which is marketed under the name “4G USE®”. We have also filed several provisional patents\naround our 4G USE® which is a multi-sensor platform allowing users to bring in and utilize a variety of sensor data including sonar, positioning, camera, lidar, video\nprocessing and other sources of point cloud data and seamlessly merging above and below the water data captured from the sonar and camera. It is also the platform for our\nDAVD software, and this module is marketed under the brand 4G USE® DAVD Edition.\nDiver Augmented Vision Display (DAVD) System – Diving Technology\nFunded by the Office of Naval Research (“ONR”) through its Future Naval Capabilities (FNC) program, and in close collaboration with NAVSEA 00C3 and Naval Surface\nWarfare Center, Panama City Division (“NSWC PCD”) we have developed a diver see-through integrated information display system (DAVD).\nDAVD is a complete end-to-end diver management solution incorporating as a key element a high-resolution, fully transparent glass head-up display (HUD) integrated directly\ninside the diving helmet (for hard hat surface air supply diving) or full-facemask (for tethered and untethered defense, commercial and recreational diving applications) or\ndiving suits. The DAVD HUD is currently deployed in the world leading and most widely used Kirby Morgan® range of dive helmets and is currently being released in the\nindustry standard Interspiro “AGA”, OTS Guardian and the Divator and Dräger Panorama Nova Dive full-face masks. However, the DAVD HUD technology is not limited to\nthese products and/or applications.\n10\nProblem In Context\nThe concept of using a pair of transparent glasses in the HUD to render real time information for underwater applications is protected by patent and Coda Octopus has an\nexclusive license from United States Department of the Navy at NSWC PCD to exploit this patent for all underwater diving activities.\nThe US Government as represented by Secretary of the Navy (Arlington, VA), describes the challenge for divers in their patent application as follows:\n“By their very nature, underwater dive missions are difficult and inherently dangerous. Furthermore, the complexity of underwater missions can make it difficult or impossible\nfor a diver to retain all pre-mission briefing information. For these reasons, it is critical for underwater divers to have access to environmental data and mission data while in\nthe water. However, in low visibility water environments, divers can rarely see handheld displays or gauges. Accordingly, divers are generally supplied with audio-\ncommunicated information from a topside location. The topside-supplied information can include descriptions of sonar images, blueprints, maps, pictures, etc. Unfortunately, it\ncan be very difficult and confusing for a diver to interpret a topside personnel’s audio description of the topside personnel’s visual interpretation. Combining this with\nunreliable audio communication can lead to mission failures or disasters.”\nIt further describes the objective of the Invention as:\n“Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide an underwater diver with real-time visual information available to topside personnel.\nAnother object of the present invention is to provide real-time visual information to an underwater diver for viewing in water environments irrespective of water visibility levels.\nOther objects and advantages of the present invention will become more obvious hereinafter in the specification and drawings.”\nHow does DAVD Change this?\nThe DAVD system addresses all the challenges described above including removing the interpretation of the underwater scene to the topside by providing the diver with real\ntime data and first-person interpretation. The DAVD technology benefits not only the diver and direct supervisor on the surface, but also engineers, end-clients, rescue workers\nand support personnel who all have vested interest in a successful and safe mission. DAVD provides the location of the diver, the dive support vessel, work site assets and any\nhazards that are known or discovered in real-time. Real-time compass and depth are also displayed to the diver to reduce disorientation. Visibility for diver and team is\nsignificantly enhanced with both real-time camera and 3D sonar data (providing underwater night-vision) and also high-resolution maps and models of the entire work site and\nsurroundings. Communication is transformed from low quality audio speech to high quality digital audio and video, text messaging, visual alerts and automated navigation\nguidance. The safety of the diver and team is paramount. DAVD ensures the Diver and Supervisor are visually synchronized and can safely coordinate movement, tasks and\ninstructions with full health monitoring and logging of the entire mission. Data and information sharing traditionally ends when the diver leaves the surface.\nThe DAVD is a significant technology for both defense and commercial underwater diving applications, and we believe that Coda Octopus has the opportunity to standardize\nthis technology globally. The DAVD comprises both hardware comprising the HUD, Diver Processing Pack (DPP), Cables and Topside Control Unit along with 4G USE®\nDAVD Edition real time visualization software. All these developments and products have been performed by the Company.\nThe DAVD is currently in early-stage adoption with the US Navy and enjoys the benefit of an Approved Navy Use (ANU) product. DAVD also is certified for CE markings for\ncompliance with the European Union and the United Kingdom health and environmental requirements.\nWe are marketing the DAVD (through live demonstrations) to Navies globally and also to the commercial diving market. We have significant interest from a number of\nreputable global commercial offshore service providers and are working with them for early adoption of the technology and also a number of European friendly Navies\nincluding the UK Ministry of Defense (MOD).\nSales and Marketing\nWe market our products primarily through our internal sales team, website, industry events such as trade shows, webinars, industry relationships and agents in foreign countries\nsuch as Japan, China and Korea. In addition, we have a network of non-exclusive independent global sales agents.\nCoda Octopus Products Limited has the requisite accreditations for its business including being Lloyds Register accredited to ISO 9001:2015 and Cyber Essentials certification.\n11\nMarine Engineering Businesses (“Services Segment”)\nOur Marine Engineering Businesses comprise Coda Octopus Colmek, Inc. based in Salt Lake City and Coda Octopus Martech Limited based in the United Kingdom.\nThey supply engineered sub-assembly solutions which typically form part of broader mission critical integrated defense systems, test equipment, instrumentation, and the like.\nThey largely operate as sub-contractors to prime defense contractors, and their engineering solutions are typically designed for integration into broader defense programs of\nrecord where high levels of reliability and quality are essential pre-requisites for securing and maintaining these agreements with their customers. Typically, they prototype\nsubassemblies for their customers and after going through various acceptance tests, including first article inspection approvals, they are then awarded the manufacturing\ncontracts. Many of these manufacturing contracts have a repeat orders profile which typically follows the life cycle of the defense program that is using the subassembly.\nThese arrangements often give the Marine Engineering Business long term preferred/sole supplier status for the parts they supply into these programs, technology refresh and\nobsolescence management opportunities with these customers and they generally use these long-standing relationships to win more contracts with these customers.\nIn order to grow, the Marine Engineering Business relies on increasing the number of new programs it attracts annually.\nIn addition, we are increasingly combining our engineering capabilities with our product offerings. This enables us to offer systems which are complete with installation and\nsupport to maximize the utilization of our collective expertise to advance our technologies.\nCoda Octopus Martech Limited (“Martech”)\nMartech which is UK-based, operates in the specialized niche of bespoke design and manufacturing services mainly to the United Kingdom defense and subsea industries. Its\nservices are provided on a custom subcontract basis where high quality and high integrity devices are required in small quantities. Their skills set includes both hardware and\nsoftware design.\nMartech enjoys pre-approvals to allow it to be short-listed for certain types of government contracts. Much of the more significant business secured by Martech is through the\nformal government or government contractor tendering process. Martech has the requisite accreditations for its business including being Lloyds Register accredited to ISO\n9001:2015 and Cyber Essentials certification.\nCoda Octopus Colmek, Inc. (“Colmek”)\nColmek, which is USA-based, are suppliers of embedded solutions and sub-assemblies which they design and manufacture and sell into mission critical integrated defense\nsystems such as the Close-In-Weapons System (CIWS). This business was established 1977 and has been supporting several significant US defense programs for over 40 years,\nincluding Raytheon’s CIWS and Northrop Grumman’s Mine Hunting Systems Program (AQS-24). Colmek’s business model entails designing sub-assembly prototypes for\ndefense programs which typically lead to contracts for the manufacture, repair and upgrade of these sub-assemblies. Colmek are the sole source for the parts that they supply\ninto these programs. This business model ensures recurring and long tail revenues since we continue to supply parts, typically for the life of the program, which can span\ndecades. Their skills set includes both hardware and software design.\nColmek has the requisite accreditations for its business including being Lloyds Register accredited to ISO 9001:2015 and Cyber Essentials certification.\nCompetition\nIn our Marine Technology Business (Products Business), we are exposed to the following competitive challenges:\nData Acquisition Products (GEO Products)\nThe industry for data acquisition and processing systems for sidescan and sub-bottom profiler data is fragmented with several companies occupying niche areas, and we face\ncompetition from different companies with respect to our different products.\nIn the field of geophysical products, Triton Imaging Inc., a US-based company, now part of the ECA Group (Toulon, France), Chesapeake, a US-based company, and Oceanic\nImaging Consultants, Hawaii, USA, dominate the market.\n12\nGNSS Aided Inertial Positioning and Attitude Measurement Systems (“Motion Products”)\nIn the field of GNSS-aided inertial positioning and attitude sensing equipment, where our product addresses a small segment of the overall market, we believe that we have\nseveral principal competitors: Teledyne Technologies Inc.; Kongsberg Gruppen, iXblue, Applanix and SBG Systems. We believe that our market share in this market segment\nof motion sensing equipment is relatively small. We sell our MOTION range as part of our equipment suite to complement our Echoscope® real time 3D sonar range as well as\nsupplying it individually. The development and introduction of our F280 Series® of GNSS Aided Inertial Positioning and Attitude Measurement System® constitutes our new\ngeneration of Motion Products and gives us the opportunity to increase our market share.\nReal Time 3D/4D/5D and 6D Volumetric Sonar\nIn the field of Real Time 3D/4D/5D imaging, we are unaware of other companies offering a similar product. In this context it is important to understand some of the intellectual\nproperty including know how and capabilities we bring to this field include:\n- Acoustic Projector/Transmitter design, manufacturing, and testing\n- Acoustic Receiver Array design, manufacturing, and testing\n- Acoustic encapsulation and sensitivity measurement\n- Acoustic Projector/Transmitter beam pattern and sensitivity measurement\n- Pressure housing Design and Manufacture (sonar systems)\n- 3D/5D/6D Real-Time digital beamforming (on-device)\n- 1D and 2D Digital Beamforming\n- Broadband Beamforming\n- Signal Processing\n- Active High Frequency Sonar Systems\n- Passive Mid Frequency Sonar Systems\n- Data acquisition and recording hardware and software\n- Real-time 2D and 3D sonar visualization rendering and processing software\nAny entry into this market depends upon specialized marine electronics, acoustic and software development skills. The learning curve, which has resulted in the advancement\nof our real time 3D sonar device, is the culmination of two decades of research and development in this field.\nCompanies such as Kongsberg Gruppen, R2Sonic, LLC, Tritech International Ltd., United Kingdom, BlueView Technologies Inc., USA (now a part of Teledyne Technologies\nIncorporated), and Norbit Group AS Norway are examples of companies offering imaging sonar solutions (such as multibeam sonars and/or 2D scanning sonars), but none of\nthese sonar offerings are directly comparable or competitors to our real time volumetric 3D/4D/5D and 6D sonar solutions as their scanning sonar, single beam or multibeam\nsonars are not real time 3D imaging sonars and therefore cannot image moving targets underwater.\nSpecifically, we believe that they do not have the same capabilities as our Echoscope® technology in terms of real time inspection and monitoring by generating 3D, 4D, 5D\nand 6D images of moving objects underwater including in environments in low or zero visibility conditions. Nor do they have the ability to use a single sonar for multiple real\ntime 3D/4D images simultaneously. Notwithstanding it should be noted that Teledyne has acquired a significant number of substantial subsea companies (examples are Reson\nand BlueView). Teledyne has much greater resources, liquidity and market reach than our Company and has many operating verticals. We therefore can give no assurance that\ncompanies such as these will not enter this market. Furthermore, companies such as Kongsberg Gruppen and Teledyne can expend significantly more in any one fiscal year on\nR&D and Business Development, key pillars for increasing market share of underwater imaging sonars, than the Company. Notwithstanding, we believe that our recent\ndevelopment and introduction of 5D/6D - Echoscope PIPE®) sonar capability in conjunction with our software (4G USE® a multi-sensor platform) further distinguishes our\nvolumetric sonars and significantly extends our lead in real time 3D/4D/5D and 6D Imaging of moving objects underwater over competitors in the subsea imaging market. We\nare not aware of any other imaging sonars in the market capable of generating real time 5D and 6D imagery underwater, which are Coda Octopus inventions. The innovations\naround Echoscope PIPE® are the subject of numerous patent applications. We have been awarded US 10,718,865 and US 10,816,652 which concerns a method of compressing\nbeamformed data and method of compressing sonar data, respectively.\n13\nWe seek to compete on the basis of producing high quality products employing cutting edge technology that is easy to use by the operators without specialized skills in sonar\ntechnology. We intend to continue our research and development activities to continually improve our products, seek new applications for our existing products, develop new\ninnovative products and grow the market for our products and expertise.\nDiver Augmented Vision Display System (“DAVD”)\nThere are various diving systems in the market that provide a combination of different aspects of our DAVD system but no systems that directly compete in the form of\nembedded fully transparent glasses mounted internally within the diver helmet or mask and on which various types of images, data and augmented reality information can be\ndisplayed. This concept is protected by US Patent 10,877,282.\nThe DAVD system provides a unique diver centric system with localized and external sensors to provide increased safety, scene awareness and vital communication in the form\nof Digital Audio, Ultra-Low-Light Video, Text and technical instruction and access to a complete media hub for effective communication between diver and supervisor. The\nDAVD system provides the following capabilities:\n● Fully Transparent High-Definition Head-Up Display mounted internally within supported Dive Helmets and Dive Masks, including Kirby Morgan KM37, KM37SS,\nKM97 and SL17 Helmets, as well as the Interspiro Divator MK II, OTS Guardian and Dräger Panorama Nova Dive\n● Fully integrated 1st person perspective digital low-light camera with advanced video processing and real-time edge enhancement for Diver and Dive Supervisor\n● Fully integrated noise-cancelling Digital Audio at source, replacing legacy communications\n● Integrated Diver Head Tracking for accurate 3D scene visualization with full support for subsea positioning systems for accurate Diver positioning\n● Telemetry Information on demand including Dive Timers, Depth and Compass Heading, Live position Lat/Long (when connected to external diving positioning\nsystem), Waypoint Range and Bearing as well as external Dive Computer data\n● Instant Digital Voice and Text Communication between Dive Supervisor and Diver, including auto and pre-defined messaging\n● Transmit unlimited on-demand media to Diver including Images, Instructional Videos, Technical Drawings and other assets to assist in live operations\n● Creation and transfer of unlimited step-by-step mission instructions with text, video and image support for common diver tasks and operations\n● Full Mixed-Reality 3D Display for Diver using live Sonar, pre-surveyed Sonar data and 3D models\n● Divers HUD Display fully adjustable between 2D Mode, and 3D Mode with 1st person and 3rd person perspective\nThere are several diver related products and sensors that can be worn by the diver such as telemetry systems, navigational aids, dive computers, video and sonar systems and\nprobes and sensors such as magnetic and thickness. Each of these systems typically have an independent display, typically on the device or wrist worn.\nVideo systems generally provide no direct benefit to the diver and are intended for top-side visualization. The DAVD provides video data to the diver directly.\nMore recent advances in technology have introduced head mounted display (HMD) as either replacement or as additional display close to the divers’ eyes. These are typically\npresented in the form of a monocular display mounted externally to the divers’ mask in which the diver must look at this display through a single eye. These are not intended\nfor long term use and more for occasional glance at data for reference. Dual HMDs are also provided in certain products to replace what the diver can see through the mask\nwith a computer display.\nThe drawback of such HMD is that the diver loses all sense of the natural surrounding and the real environment is placed using the computer display. Examples of monocular\nand dual lens HMD include Shearwater Nerd 2, Tritech DMD (Diver Mounted Display) and Blueprint Subsea Artemis HMD.\nFurthermore, a significant challenge for diving is the operating environment where zero visibility conditions typically prevail. Combining our DAVD with our Echoscope®\nremoves this barrier for diving operations.\nIn our Services Segment, we are exposed to the following competitive challenges:\nMarine Engineering Businesses\nThrough our marine engineering operations, Coda Octopus Colmek, Inc. and Coda Octopus Martech Limited, we are involved in custom engineering for the defense industry in\nthe United States and in the United Kingdom and are dependent on subcontract from the major prime contractors. Martech and Colmek compete with larger contractors, such as\nthe primes, in the defense industry. Typical among these are Ultra Electronics, BAE Systems, Thales, Raytheon and Northrop Grumman, all of whom are also partners on\nvarious projects. The strongest competitors are often the prime contractors themselves as they predominantly have the option to execute the work package internally as opposed\nto subcontracting these.\nIntellectual Property\nWe operate in an industry in which innovation, investment in new ideas and protection of our intellectual property rights are critical for our continued success. When we can we\nprotect our innovations and inventions through a variety of means, including, but not limited to, applying for patent, copyright, and trademark protection domestically and\ninternationally, and protecting our trade secrets. We incentive our employees to innovate through our Patent Reward Scheme. In the last 3 years we have advanced our existing\nsonar technology and have filed several significant patents applications pertaining to these inventions including covering our newly innovated 5D and 6D sonars. Furthermore,\nwe have recently been awarded a patent which concerns a method of predicting and adjusting the laying of cable using sonar imaging. This is a significant patent for the\nOffshore Renewables Market, which as the world makes the energy transition is set to expand globally. The Offshore Renewables sector is important for our growth strategy.\nOur Echoscope® technology is used for real time monitoring of cable installations for some of these offshore renewable projects. This recent patent covers a method which\nautomatically predicts the cable touchdown point and removes the need for the Echoscope® operator to manually determine and log the cable touchdown point.\nPatents\nOur patented inventions along with our strategy to enhance these inventions are at the heart of the Company’s strategy for growth and development. We expend a material part\nof our cash resources in building our Patent Portfolio. We also incentivize our staff to contribute to our Patent Portfolio by having in place a competitive Patent Reward\nScheme. In the 2023 FY we added four new patents to our portfolio.\n14\nOur patent portfolio consists of the following:\nPatent No. Description Expiration Date\nUS 7,466,628 Concerns a method of constructing mathematical representations of objects from reflected January 1, 2027\nsonar signals\nUS 7,489,592 Concerns a method of automatically performing a patch test for a sonar system, where data March 5, 2027\nfrom a plurality of overlapping three-dimensional (3D) sonar scans of a surface, as the\nplatform is moved, are used to compensate for biases in mounting the sonar system on the\nplatform\nUS 7,898,902 Concerns a method of representation of sonar images allowing 3D sonar data to be represented June 13, 2028\nby a two-dimensional image\nUS 8,059,486 Concerns a method of rendering volume representation of sonar images.

The main costs that are incurred in this area\nare wages and salaries and prototyping. The recent crystallization of several significant hardware development projects by the Company, has seen R&D expenditures\ndecreasing.\nOur products are complex and therefore we can give no assurance that even with spending a significant part of our resources on R&D, we will be successful in our development\ngoals or realize significant monetization of these developments. Furthermore, even following the launch of any product we may not succeed. Moreover, we may incur\nsignificant research and development expenditures without realizing viable products.\n15\nGovernment Regulation\nBecause of the nature of some of our products, they may be subject to export control regimes including in the United States, United Kingdom, Denmark, and Australia where\nwe conduct business operations. Where our products are subject to such export control requirements, they may only be exported to our customers if there is a valid export\nlicense granted by the relevant government body. Moreover, these regulations may change from time to time in these jurisdictions, including the United States, depending on\nthe existing relationship with the country to which the goods are exported.\nWe are also required to maintain certain accreditations such as ISO 900 accreditation, cyber security certifications including Cyber Essentials and NIST, approvals to hold\ngovernment items or materials and/or certain personnel or facility clearances.\nIn addition, as a provider for the US Government, we may be subject to numerous laws and regulations relating to the award, administration, Defense Federal Acquisition\nRegulations (“DFARS”) and performance of US Government contracts, including the False Claims Act. Non-compliance found by any one agency could result in fines,\npenalties, debarment, or suspension from receiving additional contracts with all US Government agencies. Given our dependence on US Government business, suspension or\ndebarment could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. In addition, the costs of complying with some of the regulations including DFARS\nmay be prohibitive.\nEmployees\nAs of the date hereof, we employ approximately 83 employees worldwide, of which 10 hold management positions. A large majority of our employees have a background in\nscience, technology, software and hardware engineering, with a substantial part being educated to a degree level. None of our employees are employed under a collective\nagreement and we have not experienced any organized labor difficulties in the past.\nAvailable Information\nOur internet address is www.codaoctopusgroup.com, where we make available, free of charge, our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current\nreports on Form 8-K and any amendments to those reports, as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such material with, or furnish it to, the Securities\nExchange Commission (“SEC”).

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OPERATIONS\nForward-Looking Statements\nThe following discussion is intended to promote understanding of the results of operations and financial condition and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated\nfinancial statements and notes thereto. This discussion may contain forward-looking statements that reflect the plans, estimates and beliefs of Coda. The words “plans,”\n“expects,” “will,” “anticipates,” “believes,” “intends,” “projects,” “estimates” or other words of similar meaning and similar expressions, among others, generally identify\n“forward-looking statements,” which speak only as of the date the statements were made. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-\nlooking statements as a result of a variety of factors and we disclaim and do not undertake any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement, except as required\nby applicable law.\nThis section of this Form 10-K generally discusses fiscal 2023 and 2022 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2023 and 2022. Discussions of 2021 items and year-to-\nyear comparisons between 2022 and 2021 that are not included in this Form 10-K can be found in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results\nof Operations” in our Form 10-K, filed with the SEC on January 30, 2023, which is available free of charge on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov and our Investor Relations\nwebsite at codaoctopusgroup.com.\nGeneral Overview\nThe Company operates two distinct businesses. These are:\n● the Marine Technology Business (also referred to in this Form 10-K as “Products Business”, or “Products Segment”); and\n● the Marine Engineering Business (also referred to in this Form 10-K as “Engineering Business”, or “Services Business” or “Services Segment”).\nOur Marine Technology Business has operations in the USA, UK and Denmark – see organization chart set out in the Section Item 1 (Business). This business is an established\ntechnology solution provider to the subsea and underwater imaging, surveying and diving market. It has been operating as a supplier of solutions comprising both hardware and\nsoftware products for close to 30 years to this market and it owns key proprietary technology including its Echoscope® and DAVD technology, that are used in both the\nunderwater defense and commercial markets. All design, development and manufacturing of our technology and solutions are performed within the Company. We sell our\nproducts and solutions globally and have a combination of direct sales and indirect sales (via our agents’ network). In Asia and Africa, we largely sell via agents, in the USA,\nEurope and the Middle East we sell directly. We also rent our products and solutions, particularly to tier-one offshore service providers who prefer accounting for offshore\nequipment as an operating expense rather than capital expense.\nOur imaging sonar technology products and solutions marketed under the name of Echoscope® and Echoscope PIPE® are used primarily in the underwater construction market,\noffshore renewables, offshore oil and gas, forward looking obstacle avoidance, complex underwater mapping, salvage operations, dredging, bridge inspection, underwater\nhazard detection, port and harbor security, mining, mine counter measures, ship hull scanning, real time threat detection, fisheries, commercial and defense diving, and marine\nsciences sectors. Uniquely the Echoscope® technology is a single sensor for multiple underwater applications which allows the market operators to consolidate their\nunderwater sensor requirements.\nOur novel diving technology is distributed under the name “CodaOctopus® DAVD” to the global defense and commercial diving markets and is relatively new to the market.\nThe DAVD system which embeds a pair of transparent glasses in the Head up Display (HUD) is used as the data hub for displaying comprehensive real time data to the diver\nunderwater. This also allows both the diver and the dive supervisor to visualize in real time the same underwater scene and data. We believe that the DAVD system has the\npotential to radically transform how diving operations are performed globally because it provides a fully integrated singular system for topside control and a fully connected\nHUD system for the diver allowing both the topside and diver to share a range of critical information including depth (pressure and temperature), compass and head tracking,\nreal time dive timers and alerts, diver position and navigation, ultra-low light enhanced video system and enhanced digital voice communications. Limitations of current diving\noperations are that the diver only shares analog voice communications with the topside, is subject to the topside verbally describing information, and there is no real time\ninformation including real time navigation, tracking and mapping of the dive area available to the diver. The topside must also manage several independent systems for video,\ncommunications, and positioning. The Company’s solution addresses these deficiencies. Another critical part of our solution is that by using the Company’s Echoscope®\ntechnology, diving can be performed in zero visibility conditions, a common problem which besets these operations and can result in significant costs to the offshore service\nprovider.\n19\nAlthough we generate most of our revenues from our real time 3D sonar which includes both proprietary hardware and software and the DAVD, we have a number of other\nproducts which we supply to the marine offshore market such as our inertial navigation systems (F280 Series®) and our geophysical hardware (DA4G) and software solutions\n(GeoSurvey which is widely used in the Oil & Gas sector and Survey Engine®, which include artificial intelligence based automatic detection systems). Our customers include\noffshore service providers to major oil and gas companies, renewable energy companies, underwater construction companies, law enforcement agencies, ports, mining\ncompanies, defense bodies, prime defense contractors, navies, research institutes and universities and diving companies. We also provide customization of services of our\ntechnology, particularly in the defense market and around our DAVD solutions where this is tailored for particular applications.\nThe Services Business has operations in the USA and UK. It is a trusted long-term Department of Defense (DoD) supplier. Its central business model consists of working with\nPrime Defense Contractors to design and manufacture sub-assemblies for utilization into larger defense mission critical integrated systems (“MCIS”). An example of such\nMCIS is the US Close-In-Weapons Support (CIWS) Program for the Phalanx radar-guided cannon used on combat ships. These proprietary sub-assemblies, once approved\nwithin the MCIS program, afford the Services Business the status of preferred supplier. Such status permits it to supply these sub-assemblies and upgrades in the event of\nobsolescence or advancement of technology for the life of the MCIS program. Customers include prime defense contractors such as Raytheon, Northrop Grumman, Thales\nUnderwater and BAE Systems. The typical scope of services provided by this business extends to concept, design, prototype, manufacture, and post-sale support including\nmaintenance and obsolescence management.\nWe have long-standing relationships with prime defense contractors, and we use these credentials to secure more business. We support some significant defense programs of\nrecord by supplying and maintaining proprietary parts (or parts for which we are preferred suppliers) through obsolescence management programs. These services provide\nrecurring stream of revenues for our Services segment.\nBoth the Marine Technology Business and Marine Engineering Business have established synergies in terms of customers and specialized engineering skill sets (hardware,\nfirmware, and software) encompassing capturing, computing, processing and displaying data in harsh environments.\nFactors Affecting our Business.\nOur business is affected by a number of factors including those set out below:\nA. United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the European Union (EU) – Commonly referred to as “Brexit”\nThis has affected our Business in several important areas:\nØ It has reduced the availability of the pool of highly skilled workers in the fields in which we operate. This has made recruitment for skills challenging and\nconstrains our ability to innovate rapidly.\nØ Our Technology requires training and support of customers deployments. UK employees are unable to freely work in the European Union and they now\nrequire work permits which are only available in limited circumstances including demonstrating that no other European national is available to perform the\nservices. This is virtually impossible to demonstrate and therefore this impacts our ability to service our European Union customer requirements and directly\nimpacts on revenue.\nØ Our shipments from the UK to the EU member states are subject to custom process. This results in increased costs and delays in the processing of shipments.\nThis is a further impediment for our customers and makes selling into these markets more challenging.\nØ Because we have to set up various offices in the European Union member state countries to gain seamless access to these markets, it increases the cost of our\noperations and therefore our overheads without any corollary increase in sales to defray these costs.\n20\nB. Currency Risks:\nThe Company’s operations are split between the United States, United Kingdom, Denmark, and the Netherlands. Item 1 (Business) of this Form 10-K sets out an\noverview of the entities within the Company’s group and their location. A significant proportion of our consolidated revenues (51.4% in 2023 FY compared to 53.9%\nin the 2022 FY) are generated outside of the United States by our foreign subsidiaries in the United Kingdom (“UK”) and Denmark. In addition, a significant part of\nour assets and liabilities (both current and fixed) is held in British Pounds, Danish Kroner and Euros by these foreign subsidiaries. Foreign Currency Translations as\nthey pertain to our assets and liabilities are translated at the prevailing exchange rate at the balance sheet date and related revenue and expenses are translated at\nweighted average exchange rates in effect during the 12-month reporting period. Significant currency fluctuations (particularly the British Pound and/or the Danish\nKroner, Euros, versus the US Dollar) may affect our financial results including our profit and loss account and the value of our assets and therefore we are subject to\nforeign currency fluctuation risks. In the Current 2023 FY, there were less adverse movements of these foreign currencies against the USD and therefore our foreign\nsubsidiaries revenues when translated into USD were only marginally impacted when applying the Constant Rate (which is the 12-month period in the previous\nfinancial year exchange rate).\nC. Inflation\nInflation measured as the Consumer Price Index has since calendar year 2022 been volatile in the countries in which we operate. Recently inflation has been falling in\nthese countries and in the twelve months to October 31, 2023, these were:\nØ Denmark 0.1% - source: Statistics Denmark,\nØ UK 4.7% - source: Office of National Statistics (ONS); and\nØ USA 3.2% - source: U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.\nDespite the decrease in inflation, the geopolitical landscape (such as the war in Ukraine which impacts on the price of commodities including oil) makes it highly\nprobable that inflation will continue to be volatile in the countries in which we operate and therefore is likely to impact the costs of our operations. Inflation affects our\nbusiness in several areas including the costs of our operations (such as wages and salaries, which has seen an average increase of 10% in the reporting period) and the\ncosts of raw materials for our products. The increase in the bill of materials (“BOM”) costs of our products is not easily transferable to our customers and therefore\nthere is a risk that our margins may be adversely impacted and/or that we become less competitive. Furthermore, inflation has a knock-on effect on revenue, since in a\nhigh inflation environment our customers are less likely to invest in technology.\nD. Political Landscape/Exporting to China\nWe sell our products globally and increasingly to Asia. Asia is the fastest growing economies for our technology and solutions. The recent change in both the US and\nUK Governments’ political stance (and to a lesser extent the European Union Member States) towards trade with China, directly affects the sale of our products to\ncustomers based in China. Our real time 3D sonars which are depth rated above 300 meters along with our inertial navigation and attitude measurement sensors\n(F280® series) are subject to export control for certain countries, including China and therefore requires an export license. Although DAVD is not subject to export\ncontrol under Export Administration Regulation (EAR) or International Trade in Arms Regulations (ITAR), we are not allowed to promote our DAVD technology in\nChina.\nOn March 2023, the US Government Department of Commerce (Bureau of Industry and Security, Commerce) amended the Export Administration Regulations (EAR)\nto add a significant number of entities “determined ….to be acting contrary to the national security or foreign policy interests of the United States”. The amended EAR\nin general states that there is a “presumption of denial” of grant of export licenses to these entities and their affiliates. This is another indication that the US\nGovernment policy and disposition towards China continues to harden and companies in the technology space will increasingly find it difficult to sell to China due to\ngovernment restrictions.\nThe UK Government is generally in lock step with the US Government’s position and has refused to grant export licenses for several of the Company’s applications\nfor end users in China for the first time in 25 years of our dealing with the UK Export Control Organization. The curtailment of access to this market due to refusal to\nissue export licenses is likely to significantly impact our revenues from Asia.\nFurthermore, even though our sonars which are depth rated at 250m or less do not require export licenses for China, and our other products such as our geophysical\nproducts and Pan & Tilt devices, the recent change in the UK Export Control Regulations vis-à-vis China now encompasses an “all catch” provision under which any\nitem intended for export to China may be seized by UK Border Control “if there is a risk that an item may be intended or diverted for purposes connected with\nweapons of mass destruction or their means of delivery”. The interpretation of this provision has seen almost all exports to China from the UK being detained by UK\nBorder Control. In 2023 FY we realized significantly less in sales to China, and we believe a direct result of the political environment.\nThe removal of China as a trading partner is likely to have a significant negative impact on our revenues and growth strategy. China has one of the largest planned and\nfunded investment programs for offshore renewables, the market for which most of our technology is used for in China. After significant business development in\nChina, we had started to see persistent and credible growth for our products in this market. However, with the ongoing geopolitical climate, we do not expect to see\nincreased sale in China.\n21\nE. Significant Increase in the Price of Raw Materials\nWhile there have been improvements in lead time for supply of raw materials and components in the Supply Chain during the reporting period, there is significant\ninflation which impacts the costs of raw materials which we are unlikely to be able to pass on to our customers due to the extent of these increases. These increases\nmay make the cost of making our products uncompetitive and may also affect our margins.\nF. Shortage of Key Skills/Resourcing Levels and significant increase in cost of operations due to inflation\nWe are experiencing skill shortages in areas that are critical to our growth strategy including experienced sales and marketing personnel, software developers and\nskilled electronic technicians. The inflationary conditions and shortage of skilled workers in the countries in which we operate (US, the UK, Denmark, and India)\nmake it difficult for us to compete for these skills as there is extreme pressure on wages. It was widely reported in the UK press recently that “annual average total pay\ngrowth for the private sector was 7.9% in April to June 2023, the largest annual total growth rate since comparable records began in 2001 [The Economist August 19th-\n25th 2023 Edition]”. Furthermore, as a small business, we do not have resilience built into our workforce. As a result, there is a risk in the face of global skills\nshortages coupled with a higher demand for skills that we could lose skills that are essential for our business including the manufacture of our products or continuation\nof our engineering services. For our engineering business, it is crucial that they can offer competitive pricing to their Prime Defense Contractors who generally have\nthe option to retain the subcontract inhouse with their engineering teams and therefore pricing is an important deciding factor for being awarded a subcontract by these\ncustomers.\nAs a small business, we are hindered in our ability to compete for certain specialized electronic engineering skills or technology skills, as our remuneration package is\nnot as competitive as those offered by bigger companies which are competing for the same skills.\nG. Government Spending for Defense\nWe are dependent on the timely allocation of funds to defense procurement by governments in the United States and the United Kingdom. A large part of our revenues\nin the Services Segment derives from government funding in the defense sector. In general, where there is a change of government, spending priorities may change\nfrom those priorities of the previous Administration. This may adversely impact on our revenues. Furthermore, during calendar year 2024, the US Federal Defense\nBudget is dependent on the New Administration being able to secure approval in Congress for the defense budget. The slim majority on which the current\nAdministration operates is likely to hinder future spending on new defense projects. Currently with the US Election season almost open, the Federal Government is\nusing continuing resolutions to fund existing programs as there is no agreement on budget. This is likely to further postpone approval of budgets and apportionments\nof funds, which is likely to affect our business.\nH. Technological Advancement\nA significant part of our growth strategy is predicated on our flagship real time volumetric imaging sonar technology, the Echoscope® and our Diver Augmented\nVision Display (DAVD) solution. The technology space is inherently uncertain due to the fast pace of innovations and therefore we can give no assurance that we can\nmaintain our leading position in these areas or that innovations in other areas may not surpass our solutions that we currently supply to the subsea market. An example\nof new technology entering the subsea market is LIDAR technology. However, unlike our sonar technology, LIDAR technology cannot be employed in zero visibility\nconditions and cannot generate a volume pulse or image moving objects required for real time inspection and monitoring underwater.\nI. Concentration of Business Opportunities Where the Sales Cycle is Long and Unpredictable\nThe Services Business revenues are highly concentrated and are largely generated from subcontracts with a small number of Prime Defense Contractors. The sales\ncycle is generally protracted which may affect our revenues. It is also dependent on the US federal government appropriating budget for defense projects and where\nthe federal government is unable to find consensus in the US Congress, this affects the timely award of sub-contracts from Prime Defense Contractors to our Services\nBusiness, which is reliant on these awards. Furthermore, the Marine Technology Business key opportunities which are critical to its growth strategy are in the Defense\nMarket for both its imaging sonars and the DAVD, both of which are key pillars of the Company’s growth strategy. Due to the protracted nature of the government\nprocurement process and cycle for defense spending under federal and/or state budgets, the sales cycle can be long and unpredictable, thus affecting timing of orders\nand thus revenues and our overall growth plans.\n22\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe Management’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements. These financial statements\nhave been prepared in conformity with GAAP in the United States which requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities,\nrevenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. By their nature, these estimates and judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty.\nWe evaluate our estimates based on our historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. These estimates relate to\nrevenue recognition, the assessment of recoverability of goodwill and intangible assets, recognition and measurement of deferred income tax assets and liabilities, the\nassessment of unrecognized tax benefits, and others. Actual results could differ from those estimates, and material effects on our operating results and financial position may\nresult.\nWe believe the following accounting estimates are most critical to understanding our consolidated financial statements. See “Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting\nPolicies” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a full description of our accounting policies.\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenues are earned under formal contracts with our customers and are derived from both sales and rental of underwater technologies and equipment for imaging, mapping,\ndefense and survey applications, diving technology and from the engineering services that we provide. Our contracts do not include the possibility for additional contingent\nconsideration so that our determination of the contract price does not involve having to consider potential variable additional consideration. Our product sales do not include a\nright of return by the customer.\nRegarding our Products Segment, all our products are sold on a stand-alone basis and those market prices are evidence of the value of the products. To the extent that we also\nprovide services (e.g., installation, training, etc.), those services are either included as part of the product or are subject to written contracts based on the stand-alone value of\nthose services. Revenue from the sale of services is recognized when those services have been provided to the customer and evidence of the provision of those services exists.\nFor further discussion of our revenue recognition accounting policies, refer to “Note 4 Revenue Recognition” in our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nStock-based Compensation\nWe recognize the expense related to the fair value of stock-based compensation awards within the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income. The fair value\nof stock-based compensation is determined as of the date of the grant or the date at which the performance of the services is completed (measurement date) and is recognized\nover the periods in which the related services are rendered.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification Topic 740, Income Taxes (ASC 740). Under ASC 740, deferred income tax\nassets and liabilities are recorded for the income tax effects of differences between the bases of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and their bases for income\ntax reporting. The Company’s differences arise principally from the use of various accelerated and modified accelerated cost recovery system lives for income tax purposes\nversus straight line depreciation used for book purposes and from the utilization of net operating loss carry-forwards.\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are the amounts by which the Company’s future income taxes are expected to be impacted by these differences as they reverse. Deferred tax\nassets are based on differences that are expected to decrease future income taxes as they reverse. Correspondingly, deferred tax liabilities are based on differences that are\nexpected to increase future income taxes as they reverse. “Note 10 Income Taxes” to the Consolidated Financial Statements discusses the amounts of deferred tax assets and\nliabilities, and also presents the impact of significant differences between financial reporting income and taxable income.\n23\nFor income tax purposes, the Company uses the percentage of completion method of recognizing revenues on long-term contracts which is consistent with the Company’s\nfinancial reporting under U.S. GAAP.\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets\nGoodwill and intangible assets consist principally of the excess of cost over the fair value of net assets acquired (i.e., goodwill), customer relationships, non-compete\nagreements and licenses. Goodwill was allocated to our reporting units based on the original purchase price allocation. Goodwill is not amortized and is evaluated for\nimpairment annually or more often if circumstances indicate impairment may exist. Customer relationships, non-compete agreements, patents and licenses are being amortized\non a straight-line basis over periods of 2 to 15 years. The Company amortizes its intangible assets using the straight-line method over their estimated period of benefit. We\nannually evaluate the recoverability of goodwill and intangible assets and carefully consider events or circumstances that warrant revised estimates of useful lives or that\nindicate that impairment exists.\nStep 1 of the goodwill impairment test used to identify potential impairment compares the fair value of the reporting unit with its’ carrying amount, including goodwill. If the\nfair value, which is based on future discounted cash flows, exceeds the carrying amount, goodwill is not considered impaired. The Company has adopted Accounting Standards\nCodification 2017 – 04, Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment, which permits the Company to impair the difference between the carrying amount in excess of the fair\nvalue of the reporting unit as the reduction in goodwill.\nAt the end of each year, we evaluate goodwill on a separate reporting unit basis to assess recoverability, and impairments, if any, are recognized in earnings. An impairment loss\nwould be recognized in an amount equal to the excess of the carrying amount of the reporting unit compared to the fair value of the reporting unit. To date, the Company has\nnot had any goodwill impairments.\nFiscal Year 2023 Consolidated Results of Operations\nIn this Form 10-K, the following meanings are ascribed to the terminologies set out immediately below:\nFY Means Fiscal Year\n2023 FY Means the Fiscal Year ended October 31, 2023\n2022 FY Means the Fiscal Year ended October 31, 2022\nCurrent FY Means the Fiscal Year ended October 31, 2023\nPrevious FY Means the Fiscal Year ended October 31, 2022\nIn the Current FY our overall consolidated financial results were down when compared to the Previous FY. Our consolidated results include the results of the Company’s\nforeign subsidiaries. Our Foreign subsidiaries’ results are translated from their respective functional currencies into United States Dollar (USD) for reporting purposes.\nCurrency fluctuations can therefore impact on our consolidated results including revenue and our profitability. In the Current FY our consolidated revenue was $19,352,088\ncompared to $22,225,803 in the Previous FY, representing a decrease of 12.9%. The foreign currency impact in the Current FY was immaterial and when applying the Constant\nRate (Previous FY exchange rate), our revenue would have been marginally higher in the Current FY by 0.4% or $84,901. During the Current FY Gross Profit Margins\nmoderately decreased by 1.0%. Total operating expenses increased by 1.0% and were $10,291,503 compared to $10,186,624 in the Previous FY. Income from operations\ndecreased by 45.3% and was $2,739,552 compared to $5,004,064 in the 2022 FY. Net income before taxes decreased by 33.3% and was $3,421,228 compared to $5,132,335 in\nthe Previous FY.\nThe main factors for the decrease in our overall financial results are global economic factors including inflation which has directly resulted in some significant offshore projects\nstalling in the Current FY. Many offshore operators (which constitute our customers) have existing fixed priced contracts that were entered into several years prior and which\nare now substantially “out-of-the-money” due to inflation. Some reports indicate that some of these offshore projects saw costs rising in excess of 40% against a backdrop of\nfixed price contracts previously agreed. Consequently, many of these projects were not executed in the Current FY. Many of the prime contractors (Orsted, Vattenfall, Siemens)\nhave announced either project costs write down or shelving of projects until further notice. These factors have affected our Marine Technology Business and was further\ncompounded by slower order-take in the 2023 FY from key strategic markets in Asia due to macro-economic factors. The UK Engineering Operations have also been affected\nby slow order take as during the 2023 FY their defense customers prioritize land-based applications relating to supporting the Ukraine efforts over naval-based solutions,\nrelevant for this business.\n24\nSegment Summary\nMarine Technology Business\nIn the 2023 FY, the Marine Technology Business generated $12,119,066 or 62.6% of our consolidated revenues compared to $14,724,688 or 66.3% in the 2022 FY, representing\na decrease of 17.7%. Gross Profit Margin was lower at 76.7% in the 2023 FY compared to 80.0% in the 2022 FY, representing a decrease of 3.3%. The decrease in gross profit\nmargin is attributed to a combination of factors including higher agents’ commission costs of $794,427 compared to $596,426, in the 2022 FY, representing an increase of\n33.2%, and less units of rentals, software and customization services sold, all of which yield a higher gross profit margin. Total operating expenses increased in the Marine\nTechnology Business by 8.0% and were $5,153,456, compared to $4,771,054 in the 2022 FY. This is largely due to exchange rate variance (a non-cash item within SG&A).\nIncome from operations in the Marine Technology Business was $4,145,814.\nThe overall decrease in the Marine Technology Business financial results is due to the decrease in revenue caused by weak demand from key strategic markets such as offshore\nrenewables and construction projects in Asia.\nThe business model for our Marine Technology Business includes both outright sales of our technology and rentals with associated services. Rentals requirements and usage\nemanate mainly from Europe and are largely used by Tier One Offshore Service Providers. Rentals and associated services are a significant part of our business model and\ngrowth strategy, since these Tier One Service Providers generally rent equipment as opposed to purchase. In addition, a significant part of these revenues comprises associated\nservices which encompass our field engineers providing support in the mobilization of the equipment and providing training to users.\nDuring the Current FY we saw a sharp fall in our rental and associated services revenues and contrary to our business plan for the Current FY, a lack of growth in rentals\nrevenues. In the Current FY rental revenue was $1,264,804 compared to $1,844,755 in the Previous FY, representing a decrease of 31.4%. We believe this is largely due to the\noffshore renewable industry experiencing rising costs, interest rates hikes and supply chain issues, which have seen the major operators in this market shelving development\nprojects and seeking to reset contract prices. The offshore renewable energy market is an important sector for our technology and success in this market is important for our\ngrowth strategy. It is reported that the slowdown in Europe in the offshore renewable market is attributable to the factors below:\n● Operators have seen a 40% increase in the costs of installations (against a backdrop of fixed price contracts negotiated in previous years). This has caused many of\nthese offshore developments/projects to become unviable. Many of the major operators in this sector have now shelved or cancelled projects. Many of these projects\nare now open to either re-tendering or price reset negotiations (source www.windeurope.org, Bloomberg, Financial Times).\n● Delays in European offshore providers entering the US Market due to contractual hurdles, inflation, high interest rates – all of which have caused these contracts to\nbecome unattractive to execute against. By way of example, Orsted (the world’s biggest developer of offshore wind) in the Current FY warned that several of its\noffshore wind projects are being hurt by suppliers’ delays which could lead to a significant write down relating to US Projects (such as, Ocean Wind`, Sunrise Wind\nand Revolution Wind) and more recently headlined in the Financial Times that BP and Equinor have scrapped New York offshore wind contract due to rising costs,\ninterests rates and supply chain problems (source Bloomberg and Financial Times).\nAsia is a key strategic market for our growth. During the Current FY we also saw a sharp fall in outright sales (as opposed to rentals) of equipment from the Asia-region. In the\nCurrent FY we had sales from Asia of $4,607,786 compared to $5,723,970 in the Previous FY. This is attributed to the slow pace of conversion of our proposals into orders\nfrom Asia including Japan, South Korea and China. We continue to believe that these are important markets for our technology and, although in the Current FY sales from that\nregion fell, we do not believe this relates to any systemic problems with our technology or solutions offered but relate to broader macro-economic factors which impacts on\ninvestment decisions.\nServices Business\nIn the 2023 FY, the Services Business generated $7,233,022 or 37.4% of our consolidated revenues compared to $7,501,115 or 33.7% in the 2022 FY, representing a decrease\nof 3.6%. Gross Profit Margin was higher at 51.6% in the 2023 FY compared to 45.4% in the Previous FY, representing an increase of 6.2%. This increase reflects the mix of\nengineering work during the 2023 FY (more units of manufacturing compared to design work). Total operating expenses fell in the Services Business by 6.3% and were\n$2,515,664 compared to $2,684,985 in the Previous FY. This is largely related to the reduction in staff headcount. Income from operations was $1,216,121 compared to\n$722,584 in the 2022 FY. Our Services Segment is comprised of the UK Operations (Martech) and the US Operations (Colmek). During the 2023 FY, the UK Operations has\nexperienced significant delays in securing orders from its UK customers. While we still expect to receive these orders, this delay has impacted significantly on the revenue from\nthe UK Operations of our Services Business and has contributed to the overall fall in our consolidated financial results in the Current FY. We believe the reason for this delay is\nthat some of our customers’ priorities have temporarily shifted to supporting requirements for Ukraine which are land-based solutions and are not, for example, mine-hunting or\nother naval applications. We do not believe these opportunities have gone away but have, instead, been postponed.\nComparison of fiscal year ended October 31, 2023, to fiscal year ended October 31, 2022\nThe information provided below pertains to the Company’s consolidated financial results. For information on the performance of each Segment including the disaggregation of\nrevenues and geographical split, see “Note 14 Segment Analysis” and “Note 15 Disaggregation of Revenue” of our audited Consolidated Financial Statements as of October 31,\n2023, and 2022.\n25\nRevenue:\nYear Ended October 31, 2023 Year Ended October 31, 2022 Percentage Change\n$ 19,352,088 $ 22,225,803 Decrease of 12.9%\nWe realized a decrease in our consolidated revenues of 12.9% in the 2023 FY compared to the 2022 FY. In the 2023 FY revenue decreased in both business segments which did\nnot meet their respective revenue plans. In the 2023 FY the main factors affecting the Marine Technology Business revenue plan are global economic factors such as inflation\nwhich has upended growth projections in a number of sectors including Offshore Renewables. In the 2023 FY we realized significantly less units of rentals than our business\nplan projections due to a number of significant projects being either postponed or shelved because inflation has made these unviable, thus requiring pricing renegotiations\nbetween the prime contractors and offshore service providers (the latter being our customers). This is discussed more fully above. This Business segment also realized less sales\nin key strategic markets such as Asia due to the slow pace of conversion of orders reflecting economic factors in that region. In the Current FY sales in Asia fell by 19.5% and\nwere $4,607,786 compared to $5,723,970 in the 2022 FY. The UK Operations of the Services Business also had reduced order take caused by its defense customers priorities\ntemporarily shifting to land-based assets applications (as opposed to Naval assets-applications) to support the Ukrainian efforts.\nGross Margin:\nYear Ended October 31, 2023 Year Ended October 31, 2022 Percentage Change\n67.3% 68.3%\n(Gross profit of $13,031,055) (Gross profit of $15,190,688) Decrease of 1.0%\nOur consolidated gross profit margins reported in our financial results may vary according to several factors. These include:\n● The percentage of our consolidated sales that is attributable to the Marine Technology Business versus the Services Business. The Gross Profit Margin yielded by the\nProducts Business is generally higher than that of the Engineering Business.\n● The percentage of our consolidated sales that is attributable to the Services Business. The Services Business yields a lower gross profit margin on generated sales\nwhich are largely based on time and materials for our Department of Defense subcontracts.\n● The mix of engineering projects performed by our Services Business (Design prototyping versus manufacturing).\n● The mix of sales generated by the Marine Technology Business during the reporting period. The Marine Technology sales in general comprise of:\n● Outright sales versus rentals.\n● Hardware related sales versus Software related sales (Software is generally a higher margin).\n● Custom Engineering around its technology (“services”) versus Field Services (where we as our customers with training and mobilization support; and\nservices relating to repairing and servicing customers’ products.\n● Levels of commission on sales.\nBoth the Marine Technology Business and our Services Business work with a global network of sales agents. Most of the sales made by the Marine Technology\nBusiness from Asia or South Africa attract commission as those are typically sales via our agents/distributors network. Although the Services Business works with\nsales agents this is on a lesser scale than the Marine Technology Business and typically commission costs incurred by the Services Business are very low.\nSee “Note 2 Summary of Accounting Policies” (Cost of Revenue), “Notes 14 Segment Analysis” and “Note 15 Disaggregation of Revenue” of our audited\nConsolidated Financial Statements as of October 31, 2023, for more information covering commissions as a component of Cost of Revenues, segment reporting and\nthe disaggregation of our revenues by type and geography, respectively.\n● Level of assets in the rental pool and Cost of Revenue associated with these rental assets – see “Note 2 Summary of Accounting Policies” (Cost of Revenue). The\nassets utilized for our rental offering are subject to depreciation, a portion of which is allocated to Cost of Revenue.\nIn the 2023 FY gross profit margins for the Marine Technology Business were 76.7% compared to 80.0% in the 2022 FY. For the Engineering Business, these were 51.6% in\nthe 2023 FY compared to 45.4% in the 2022 FY.\nThe main factor for the fall in the gross profit margin for the Marine Technology Business is the mix of sales. In particular, there were less units of rentals and customization of\ntechnology services work compounded by higher commissions paid in the 2023 FY. The Marine Technology Business incurred commission costs of $794,427 compared to\n$596,426 in the 2022 FY, representing an increase of 33.2%.\nSince there are more variable factors affecting Gross Profit Margins in the Marine Technology Business, a table showing a summary break-out of sales generated by the Marine\nTechnology Business in the 2023 FY compared to the 2022 FY is set out below:\n2023 FY 2022 FY\nProducts Products Percentage Change\nEquipment Sales $ 8,444,305 $ 8,771,050 (3.7)%\nEquipment Rentals 1,264,804 1,844,775 (31.4)%\nSoftware Sales 851,976 1,014,867 (16.1)%\nServices 1,557,981 3,093,996 (49.6)%\nTotal Net Sales $ 12,119,066 $ 14,724,688 (17.7)%\nFor more detailed information on the composition and disaggregation of our revenues, please refer to “Note 15 Disaggregation of Revenue” of our audited Consolidated\nFinancial Statements of October 31, 2023, and 2022.\n26\nResearch and Development (R&D):\nYear Ended October 31, 2023 Year Ended October 31, 2022 Percentage Change\n$ 2,096,467 $ 2,237,920 Decrease of 6.3%\nResearch and Development costs are, in general, an inherent ongoing cost for the Marine Technology Business operations since it will need to either maintain the products it\nhas in the market or continue to advance these products and its core technology to keep them competitive (both in price and performance) and to expand the product offerings\nwhich we have in the market.\nAccordingly, we continue to invest in research and development to further our business goals including maintaining our lead in the real time volumetric imaging sonar sector\n(Marine Technology Business) and our new-to-market diving technology (DAVD).\nIn addition, the Services Business incurs research and development expenses on advancing its Thermite® Octal range of mission computer products with the strategic goals of\nincreasing and diversifying its revenues and improving gross profit margins.\nIn the 2023 FY this category of expenditure decreased by 6.3%. This is largely due to the Marine Technology Business shifting its focus from R&D to other business goals such\nas marketing, brand building and business development.\nChanges in this category by Segment are set out immediately below:\nDescription Amount % increase / (decrease)\nMarine Technology Business (Products Segment) 2023 FY $ 2,043,890 Decrease 7.4%\nMarine Technology Business (Products Segment) 2022 FY $ 2,207,500\nEngineering Business (Services Segment) 2023 FY $ 52,577 Increase 72.8%\nEngineering Business (Services Segment) 2022 FY $ 30,420\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses (SG&A):\nYear Ended October 31, 2023 Year Ended October 31, 2022 Percentage Change\n$ 8,195,036 $ 7,948,704 Increase of 3.1%\nThe increase in SG&A is largely due to the increase in the category of Legal and Professional fees resulting from an increase in costs incurred for tax specialists’ fees, increase\nin board of directors’ fees, increase in our marketing expenses and exchange rate variances.\nNotable factors in our SG&A 2023 FY are:\nWithin the category of SG&A we have transactions which are cash charges and non-cash charges. The non-cash charges comprise Depreciation, Amortization, Stock-based\ncompensation charges and Exchange Rate Variance. In 2023 FY and 2022 FY, respectively non-cash items as a percentage of SGA expenses were 15.6% and 15.1%,\nrespectively.\nStock Based Compensation Expenses (Non-Cash Item). In the 2023 FY we expensed $645,196 for stock-based compensation as compared to $1,130,917 in the corresponding\n2022 FY, representing a decrease of 42.9%.\nExchange Rate Variance (Non-Cash Item) We expensed $190,073 in the 2023 FY compared to recording a gain of ($431,314) in the 2022 FY.\nFurther discussions on SG&A are set out immediately below.\n27\nKey Areas of SG&A Expenditure across the Group for the year ended October 31, 2023, compared to the year ended October 31, 2022\nPercentage\nExpenditure October 31, 2023 October 31, 2022 Change\nWages and Salaries $ 3,499,542 $ 3,752,524 Decrease of 6.7%\nLegal and Professional Fees (including accounting, audit, tax and investor relations) $ 1,809,604 $ 1,419,013 Increase of 27.5%\nRent for our various locations $ 50,767 $ 64,637 Decrease of 21.5%\nMarketing $ 216,403 $ 197,258 Increase of 9.7%\nIn the 2023 FY compared to the 2022 FY:\nWages and Salaries decreased by 6.7%. This decrease reflects a reduction in staff count. This category of expenditure is susceptible to significant increases due to inflationary\npressures in this area. Post-Pandemic it is widely reported that the workforce has changed with a significant percentage of employees in a certain age bracket have left the\nworkforce. In the countries in which we operate, USA, UK and Denmark there is a high percentage of skills shortage. This makes competition for employees very fierce –\ncausing high mobility within workforces and wage pressures. In the financial year 2024, we anticipate that this area will increase to reflect inflationary pressure and also new\nhires for replacement staff and the creation of new strategic positions in the area of business development and marketing. We also will have our new Chief Financial Officer in\nplace in the first quarter of the 2024 financial year and would therefore expect that this area will be significantly higher in the 2024 financial year.\nLegal and Professional Fees increased by 27.5% which reflects the increase in fees associated with tax specialists’ services and increased board fees. We recorded $130,767 for\ntax specialists’ services in the Current FY compared to zero in the Previous FY.\nRent expenditures decreased by 21.5% compared to FY 2022. Rent is not a material expenditure in the Group as most of our premises are owned by the Company, except for\npremises used in Denmark.\nMarketing increased by 9.7%. This is in keeping with our strategy to shift our focus to business development, marketing, and brand building. Expenditures in this area are spent\non industry-related trade shows and events, demonstrations particularly on the DAVD market adoption and technology awareness campaigns, marketing events and customer\nvisits. As part of our Brand building endeavors, we have also established a “Digitalization Team” whose focus is on digitalizing the Company’s media content etc. As we\ncontinue to ramp up our marketing campaign around the DAVD and our newly developed standalone Digital Audio Communications system (Voice_HUB-4) a derivative from\nthe DAVD technology, we anticipate this category of expenditures will increase in the 2024 financial year.\nOverhead related costs as a percentage of revenue for the year ended October 31, 2023, compared to the year ended October 31, 2022\nOur overhead SG&A expenditures are constituted of general corporate administrative costs.\nOverhead SG&A as a percentage of revenue increased 1.2% largely due to the increase in professional fees resulting from an increase in costs incurred for tax specialists’ fees,\naccounting and audit-related expenses and other public company-related costs.\n28\nOperating Income:\nYear Ended October 31, 2023 Year Ended October 31, 2022 Percentage Change\n$ 2,739,552 $ 5,004,064 Decrease of 45.3%\nIn the 2023 FY Operating Income decreased by 45.3%. This is due to the decrease in our consolidated revenue and gross profit for the reasons earlier discussed combined with\na modest increase in our total operating expenses.\nOther Income:\nYear Ended October 31, 2023 Year Ended October 31, 2022 Percentage Change\n$ 681,676 $ 128,271 Increase of 431.4 %\nIn the 2023 FY, we had “Other Income” of $681,676 compared to $128,271, representing an increase of 431.4% from the 2022 FY. In the 2023 FY $642,530 of this amount\nrepresents interest income earned on our certified deposit accounts. In February 2023, the Company established certified deposit accounts with its existing bankers. These\naccounts are for fixed 3-month rolling periods and constitute “cash equivalents” in our current audited Consolidated Financial Statements for period ended October 31, 2023.\nWe anticipate that the interest earned on these certified deposit accounts will be material in the future if interest rates remain the same or continue to rise. See “Note 6 -\nComposition of Certain Financial Statement Captions” (Other Income) to the audited Consolidated Financial Statements for period ended October 31, 2023, where this is\ndiscussed further.\nIncome before Income Tax Expense for the year ended October 31, 2023, compared to the year ended October 31, 2022\nYear Ended October 31, 2023 Year Ended October 31, 2022 Percentage Change\n$ 3,421,228 $ 5,132,335 Decrease of 33.3%\nIn the 2023 FY, we had income before income taxes of $3,421,228 as compared to $5,132,335 in the 2022 FY, representing a decrease of 33.3%. Net income before income\ntaxes decreased largely due to a decrease in our consolidated revenues and gross profit in the 2023 FY attributable to the reasons discussed earlier combined with a modest\nincrease in total operating expense.\nNet Income for the year ended October 31, 2023, compared to the year ended October 31, 2022\nYear Ended October 31, 2023 Year Ended October 31, 2022 Percentage Change\n$ 3,124,149 $ 4,301,221 Decrease of 27.4%\nIn the 2023 FY we had Net Income of $3,124,149 compared to $4,301,221 in the 2022 FY, representing a decrease of 27.4%. This is a reflection of the decrease in our\nconsolidated revenues and gross profit in the 2023 FY along with an increase in total operating expense for the reasons discussed earlier. In the 2023 FY we recorded a Current\nTax Expense of $248,655 compared to $1,005,140 in the 2022 FY and a Deferred Tax Expense of $48,424 compared to a Deferred Tax Benefit in $174,026 in the 2022 FY. Our\ntax expenses depend on the composition of our consolidated income, and in particular the percentage that is attributable to the Company and its US subsidiaries together versus\nthe percentage attributable to the Company’s foreign subsidiaries. It also depends on the availability of carryforwards losses and R&D tax credits in the UK subsidiaries. In the\n2023 FY, the Company and its US subsidiaries had a lower percentage of taxable income than the Company’s foreign subsidiaries, while the Company’s UK and Danish\nsubsidiaries had taxable income in their respective tax jurisdictions. The Company’s UK subsidiaries have carryforward losses and research and development (R&D) tax credits\nin their tax jurisdiction which has been applied to offset a portion of the 2023 FY tax liability. For 2023 FY, a current provision of $2,930 and deferred provision of $60,970 has\nbeen made for tax liability of the UK subsidiaries. Our Danish subsidiary has no carryforwards or other tax relief in its tax jurisdiction and therefore we have recorded current\ntax provision of $207,371 for 2023 FY.\nComprehensive Income for the year ended October 31, 2023, compared to the year ended October 31, 2022\nYear Ended October 31, 2023 Year Ended October 31, 2022 Percentage Change\n$ 4,418,724 $ 1,231,156 Increase of 258.9%\nIn the 2023 FY Comprehensive income was $4,418,724 compared to $1,231,156 for the 2022 FY. This category is affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange\ntransactions both relating to our profit and loss expenses and our assets and liabilities on our balance sheet and are largely paper losses or gains, as may be applicable, in the\nreporting period. In the 2022 FY we recorded a loss of $3,070,065 on foreign currency translation adjustment transactions compared to a gain of $1,294,575 in the 2023 FY. A\nsignificant part of the Company’s operations is based in the UK and Denmark, and therefore a major part of the Company’s assets and liabilities recorded in its consolidated\nbalance sheet and profit and loss expenses are translated from the functional currencies of these subsidiaries into USD for reporting purposes, thus accounting for the changes.\nSee Table under the section of the MD&A which concerns “Foreign Currency & Inflation”, and which shows the impact of the currency adjustments on our Income Statement\nand Balance Sheet in 2023 FY compared to 2022 FY.\n29\nSegment Analysis\nWe operate in two reportable segments, (“Products Business” and “Service Business”) which are managed separately based upon fundamental differences in their operations.\nSegment operating income is total Segment revenue reduced by cost of revenues and operating expenses (research and development and Selling, General & Administrative)\nidentifiable with the reporting business segment.

For the year then\nended, the Company generated cash flow from operations of $2,389,876.\nWe believe that our current level of cash and cash generation will be sufficient to meet our short and medium-term liquidity needs. As of October 31, 2023, we had cash and\ncash equivalents on hand of $24,448,841 and both billed and unbilled receivables of $3,537,712. Our current cash balance represents approximately 36 months of Selling,\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses. The Company continues to critically evaluate the level of expenses that it incurs and reduces its expenses as may be appropriate within\nits business priorities.\nWe also have access to a revolving line of credit of $4 million from HSBC NA. This line of credit is available to the Company for short-term working capital purposes. All\namounts under the Revolving Line of Credit are payable at the end of each financial year. The facility was renewed for another year until November 2024. To date, the\nCompany has not had reason to borrow any funds for its operations under this credit line.\nOur main liquidity issues are forward buying components and inventory for our products which encompass specialized electronics for which there is no after-market except for\nthe products to which they are designed for, funding our research and development program (“R&D”) which requires significant expenditures in attracting engineering skills\nand incurring non-recoverable costs for researching, developing and prototyping products and managing our currency exposure and business development and marketing costs\nrequired for the success of our business.\nOperating Activities\nNet cash generated from operating activities for the year ended October 31, 2023, was $2,389,876. We recorded net income for the period of $3,124,149. Other items in uses\nand sources of funds from operations included non-cash charges related to depreciation of fixed assets, amortization of intangible assets, deferred tax asset and stock-based\ncompensation, which collectively totaled $1,361,452. Changes in operating assets decreased net cash from operating activities by $1,538,896 and changes in current liabilities\ndecreased net cash from operating activities by $556,829.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities for the year ended October 31, 2023, was $1,520,775.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash used in financing activities for the year ended October 31, 2023, was $17,963.\nForeign Currency and Inflation\nThe Company and its subsidiaries maintain their accounts in the native currencies of their operations, and which are:\nUS Dollars For US Operations\nBritish Pound For United Kingdom Operations\nDanish Kroner For Danish Operations\nAustralian Dollars For Australian Operations (operations are currently dormant)\nIndian Rupees For Indian Operations (operations are currently dormant)\nThe Company’s consolidated financial results therefore include the translation of its subsidiaries functional currencies into U.S Dollar. See “Note 2 Summary of Accounting\nPolicies” (Foreign Currency Translation) of our audited Consolidated Financial Statements as of October 31, 2023, for more information on the applicable rates used for our\nBalance Sheet transactions and Statement of Income and Comprehensive Income.\nThe Company’s consolidated results are a combination of its US operations and foreign operations and these companies maintain their accounts in the functional currencies of\ntheir jurisdictions which are noted above. The various entities within the Company’s group are detailed in the overview organization chart in Part 1 (Business) of this Form 10-\nK. Fluctuations in currency exchange rates can directly impact on the Company’s sales, profitability and financial position when the transactions of the foreign subsidiaries are\ntranslated from their functional currencies into USD for financial reporting. In addition, the Company is also subject to currency fluctuation risk with respect to certain foreign\ncurrency denominated receivables and payables incurred in the ordinary course of its business operations (cross-border transactions such as inventory purchasing). In general,\nthe Company’s subsidiaries perform financial transactions in their native currencies. Exceptionally, a subsidiary may perform financial transactions in currencies other than its\nnative or functional currency (purchasing inventory from a foreign supplier, for example, in foreign currency). Furthermore, the Company holds significant cash balances in\nforeign currencies, such as British Pound, Euro and Danish Kroner. The Company cannot predict the extent to which currency fluctuations may affect its business and financial\nposition, and there is a risk that such fluctuations may have an adverse impact on the Company’s sales, profits and financial position.\n32\nApplying the Constant Rate (as the term is defined immediately below), the impact of currency fluctuations in the 2023 FY compared with the 2022 FY, is shown below.\nFor Revenue and Expenses (Income Statement Transactions) for the Current FY, the The “prevailing weighted average” exchange rate in the current 12-month period for\nConstant Rate means: the Current FY compared to the “prevailing weighted average” exchange rate in the\n12-month period for the Previous Year.\nFor Balance Sheet Transactions Constant Rate means: The prevailing exchange rate as of October 31, 2023, when compared to prevailing\nexchange rate as of October 31, 2022.\nThese are the values we have used in the calculations below which show the impact of these currency fluctuations on our operations in the 2023 FY:\nBased British Pounds Based Australian Dollar Based Danish Kroner Total USD\nActual Constant Actual Constant Actual Constant Actual Constant Total\nResults Rates Results Rates Results Rates Results Rates Effect\n($) ($) ($) ($) ($) ($) ($) ($) ($)\nRevenues 6,974,071 7,079,773 - - 2,982,348 2,961,547 9,956,419 10,041,320 (84,901)\nCosts 7,801,725 7,919,971 8,132 8,570 733,666 728,549 8,586,487 8,704,324 (117,837)\nNet profit (losses) (827,654) (840,198) (8,132) (8,570) 2,248,682 2,232,998 1,369,932 1,336,996 32,936\nAssets 20,988,136 19,918,726 19,921 20,118 3,452,620 3,236,531 24,514,452 23,235,143 1,279,309\nLiabilities (975,129) (925,443) (577) (583) (331,214) (310,484) (1,307,519) (1,237,176) (70,343)\nNet assets 20,013,007 18,993,283 19,344 19,535 3,121,406 2,926,047 23,206,933 21,997,967 1,208,966\nThis table shows that the effect of Constant Rate versus the exchange rate applied for the Current FY, increased net income for the year by $32,936 and increased net assets by\n$1,208,966.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements.\nInflation\nInflation affects our Business in several ways including:\nØ Cost of Operations (including wages, salaries, utilities)\nØ Bill of Material (BOM) Costs of our Products\nØ Our revenue – as an inflationary environment reduces demand for our goods and services.\nHigh inflation affects our business in a number of areas including costs of operations, including wages and salaries which have increased in relation to the number of staff in the\nCurrent FY (which has reduced) compared to the number of staff in the Previous FY. In addition, our general costs of operations have increased along with raw material costs\nfor our products and solutions.\nInflation is also an inherently destabilizing factor for both retaining staff and recruiting staff and therefore impacts on our business plans and the effectiveness of our workforce.\nFurthermore, our revenue was affected in strategic markets and geographies due to inflationary pressures which reduced the demand for our technology and solutions.\n33\nITEM 7A.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nAttached as exhibits to this Form 10-K are certifications of the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, which are required in accordance with Rules\n13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act.\nThis “Controls and Procedures” section includes information concerning the controls and controls evaluation referred to in the certifications and it should be read in conjunction\nwith the certifications, for a more complete understanding of the topics presented.\nDisclosure controls and procedures are controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or\nsubmit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the\nSecurities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that\ninformation required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal\nexecutive and financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nManagement’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, a public company’s principal executive and principal financial\nofficers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the\nreliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with US generally accepted accounting principles (“US GAAP”)\nincluding those policies and procedures that: (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of\nthe assets of the company, (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with US\nGAAP, and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company, and (iii) provide reasonable\nassurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial\nstatements.\nManagement is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive\nOfficer and Chief Financial Officer, has assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of October 31, 2023. In making this assessment, our\nmanagement used the criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission\n(COSO 2013 Framework). Based on its assessment, our management believes that, as of October 31, 2023, our internal control over financial reporting was effective based on\nthose criteria.\nIn the fiscal year ended October 31, 2022, the Company’s management, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and the\nChief Financial (and principal accounting) Officer, carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company’s disclosure controls and\nprocedures (as defined in Rule 13a15€ and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) as of October 31, 2022 (the “Evaluation Date”). Based upon that evaluation the Company concluded\nthat as of October 31, 2022 (the Previous FY), the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as a result of the existence of the material weaknesses in\nthe Company’s internal controls over financial reporting described in Item 9A of the Company’s Annual Report filed on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2022.\nIn the Form 10-K, we disclosed that we identified material weaknesses concerning a lack of adequate processes and procedures regarding the identification and review and\nelimination of relevant intercompany entries in the consolidation of our financial reporting, thus representing a material weakness in the Company’s internal control over\nfinancial reporting. Management and the Company’s Board of Directors are committed to improving the Company’s overall system of internal controls over financial reporting.\nConsequently, the Company implemented a comprehensive remediation plan in the first quarter of the FY 2023 designed to address the identified material weakness. This\nincluded:\n● Management identification of the root cause for the elimination errors.\n● Management introduction of a new control which extended to identification of all intercompany transactions by using designated codes in the financial system\ndesigned to identify and assess the nature of the intercompany transactions and their impact on the consolidation elimination process.\n● Management designing and implementing a standalone “Elimination Workbook” designed to identify all intercompany transactions in all entities, their nature and as\nsuch their accounting treatment. This standalone workbook is then used as a cross-verification tool when the Consolidation of the entities is performed within the\nindependent Consolidation Financial System.\n● Management introducing an Error Log designed to record errors and omissions during all financial closing procedures. The error log is used as part of our testing of\nthe effectiveness of the Company’s internal controls and is used by senior management as part of its review process. The Error Log also records all corrective actions\ntaken if required.\n● These remediation controls and procedures were reviewed and approved by the Audit Committee.\nSince filing our Form 10-K for the year ended October 31, 2022, management and the Audit Committee monitored in each the effectiveness of the aforementioned controls\nduring the closing procedures relating to each of these subsequent periodic reporting periods (first, second and third FY 2023 reporting quarters) and concluded that the\nremediation actions identified above are effective to address the material weaknesses identified in our Form 10-K for the year ended October 31, 2022. We therefore believe\nthat as of October 31,2023 the material weaknesses reported on our Form 10-K for the year ended October,31, 2022 have been remediated and the associated risks have been\neliminated through application of our new process described above.\nThis annual report does not include an attestation report of the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting.\nUnder SEC rules, the management’s report was not subject to attestation by the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nFor the fiscal year commencing November 1, 2022, management designed additional controls to remediate the previous material weaknesses in Item 9A on Form 10-K covering\nthe fiscal year ended October 31, 2022 and in Item 4 on Form 10-Q for each of the quarters of fiscal year 2023. Given the remediation actions described above, the oversight of\nour Audit Committee in this area, and the testing of the applicable controls in each of the quarters of fiscal year 2023 completed during the said periods and the determination in\neach of those subsequent fiscal quarters that the controls that were designed and implemented have addressed the material weakness identified on our Form 10-K for the fiscal\nyear October 31, 2022 are operating effectively, management has concluded that the material weakness in Item 9A on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2022 has\nbeen remediated as of October 31, 2023.\nITEM 9B.

The Company believes that combining the positions of Chief\nExecutive Officer and Chairman of the Board of Directors helps to ensure that the Board of Directors and management act with a common purpose. Integrating the positions of\nChief Executive Officer and Chairman can provide a clear chain of command to execute the Company’s strategic initiatives. The Company also believes that it is advantageous\nto have a chairman with an extensive history with, and knowledge of, the Company. Notwithstanding the combined role of Chief Executive Officer and Chairman, key strategic\ninitiatives and decisions involving the Company are discussed and approved by the entire Board of Directors. The Company believes that the current leadership structure and\nprocesses maintain an effective oversight of management and independence of the Board of Directors as a whole without separate designation of a lead independent director.\nHowever, the Board of Directors will continue to monitor its functioning and will consider appropriate changes to ensure the effective independent function of the Board of\nDirectors in its oversight responsibilities.\nIndependence of the Board of Directors and its Committees\nAfter review of all relevant transactions or relationships between each director, or any of his or her family members, and the Company, its senior management and its\nIndependent Registered Public Accounting Firm, the Board of Directors has determined that all the Company’s directors are independent within the meaning of the applicable\nNASDAQ listing standards, except Ms. Gayle, the Company’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.

The Nominating Committee met\nthree times during the fiscal year ended October 31, 2023. The Nominating Committee Charter is available on the Company’s website at www.codaoctopusgroup.com.\nThe Nominating Committee has not established any specific minimum qualifications that must be met for recommendation for a position on the Board of Directors. Instead, in\nconsidering candidates for director the Nominating Committee will generally consider all relevant factors, including among others the candidate’s applicable education,\nexpertise and demonstrated excellence in his or her field, the usefulness of the expertise to the Company, the availability of the candidate to devote sufficient time and attention\nto the affairs of the Company, the candidate’s reputation for personal integrity and ethics and the candidate’s ability to exercise sound business judgment. Other relevant factors,\nincluding diversity, experience, and skills, will also be considered. Candidates for director are reviewed in the context of the existing membership of the Board of Directors\n(including the qualities and skills of the existing directors), the operating requirements of the Company and the long-term interests of its stockholders.\n38\nThe Nominating Committee considers each director’s executive experience and his or her familiarity and experience with the various operational, scientific and/or financial\naspects of managing companies in our industry.\nWith respect to diversity, the Nominating Committee seeks a diverse group of individuals who have executive leadership experience and a complementary mix of backgrounds\nand skills necessary to provide meaningful oversight of the Company’s activities.

Pursuant to its charter, the Nominating Committee will\nconsider, but not necessarily recommend to the Board of Directors, potential director candidates recommended by stockholders.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial\nposition of the Company as of October 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of their operations and cash flows for the years then ended in conformity with accounting principles\ngenerally accepted in the United States of America.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s consolidated\nfinancial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”) and are\nrequired to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and\nExchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about\nwhether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to\nperform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but\nnot for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures\nthat respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our\naudits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated\nfinancial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nCritical audit matters are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the\naudit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective,\nor complex judgments. We determined that there are no critical audit matters.\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2014.\nFrazier & Deeter\nAtlanta, Georgia\nJanuary 29, 2024\nF-1\nCODA OCTOPUS GROUP, INC.\nConsolidated Balance Sheets\nOctober 31, 2023 and 2022\n2023 2022\nASSETS\nCURRENT ASSETS\nCash and Cash Equivalents $ 24,448,841 $ 22,927,371\nAccounts Receivable 2,643,461 2,870,600\nInventory 11,685,525 10,027,111\nUnbilled Receivables 894,251 602,115\nPrepaid Expenses 181,383 240,464\nOther Current Assets 1,034,626 343,061\nTotal Current Assets 40,888,087 37,010,722\nFIXED ASSETS\nProperty and Equipment, net 6,873,320 5,832,532\nOTHER ASSETS\nGoodwill 3,382,108 3,382,108\nIntangible Assets, net 486,615 442,286\nDeferred Tax Asset 211,386 259,810\nTotal Other Assets 4,080,109 4,084,204\nTotal Assets $ 51,841,516 $ 46,927,458\nF-2\nCODA OCTOPUS GROUP, INC.\nConsolidated Balance Sheets (Continued)\nOctober 31, 2023 and 2022\n2023 2022\nLIABILITIES AND STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY\nCURRENT LIABILITIES\nAccounts Payable $ 1,308,201 $ 793,247\nAccrued Expenses and Other Current Liabilities 995,630 1,731,706\nDeferred Revenue 975,537 943,569\nTotal Current Liabilities 3,279,368 3,468,522\nLONG TERM LIABILITIES\nDeferred Revenue, less current portion 133,382 76,127\nTotal Liabilities 3,412,750 3,544,649\nCommitments and contingencies\nSTOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY\nCommon Stock, $.001 par value;

(“Coda,” “the Company,” or “we”) operates two operating business units. These are the Marine Technology Business (“Products Business,” or\n“Products Segment”) and the Marine Engineering Business (“Services Business,” “Engineering Business” or “Services Segment”).\nThe Marine Technology Business is an established supplier of underwater technology and solutions, to the underwater/subsea market. Its products and solutions comprise both\nhardware and software for which it is the innovator, developer, manufacturer and distributor. It has key proprietary 3D/4D/5D/6D imaging sonar technology marketed under the\nname of Echoscope® and Echoscope PIPE® and diving technology marketed under the name of CodaOctopus® DAVD (Diver Augmented Vision Display). The Echoscope®\nsonar series is the only sonar that can generate multiple real time 3D images of moving objects underwater in zero visibility conditions. This business also launched the DAVD\nsystem in 2021 which emanated from the requirements of the Office of Naval Research as part of its Future Naval Requirements Program. The DAVD embeds inside of the\ndiver Head up Display (HUD) a pair of transparent glasses which is used as the data hub for displaying real time data to the diver. It allows both the diver underwater and the\ndive supervisor on the surface to see the same data or underwater scene. In addition, by combining the DAVD with the Echoscope®, dive operations can be performed in zero\nvisibility conditions. These conditions are a common barrier which impinges on the ability to perform these activities and therefore the DAVD combined with the Echoscope®\nis a real requirement for these operations.\nThe Engineering Business is an established sub-contractor to prime defense contractors and generally supplies proprietary sub-assemblies for incorporation into broader\nmission critical defense systems. These sub-assemblies are typically supplied for the life of the program. The Marine Engineering Business’ scope of services for these defense\nprograms typically extends to concept, design, prototype, manufacture, and post-sale support. The manufacturing contracts for these sub-assemblies can run over many years.\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Coda Octopus Group, Inc. and its wholly owned domestic and foreign subsidiaries. All significant intercompany\ntransactions and balances have been eliminated in the consolidated financial statements.\nNOTE 2 - SUMMARY OF ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nBasis of Presentation\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting\nprinciples (“GAAP”) in the United States (“U.S.”) and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) and the Public Company\nAccounting Oversight Board (“PCAOB”).\nThe Company’s fiscal year ends on October 31. The Company employs a calendar month-end reporting period for its quarterly reporting.\nEstimates\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the\nconsolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. The accounting estimates and assumptions that require management’s most significant, challenging, and subjective\njudgment include estimates related to the percentage of completion method used to account for contracts including costs and earnings in excess of billings, billings in excess of\ncosts and estimated earnings, the valuation of the deferred tax asset, and the valuation of goodwill. Actual results realized by the Company may differ from management’s\nestimates.\nReclassifications\nCertain amounts included in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets, Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income, and Consolidated Statements of\nCash Flows for the year ended October 31, 2022, have been reclassified to conform to the October 31, 2023, presentation.\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenue is recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to a customer in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to receive\nin exchange for those goods or services, which may include various combinations of goods and services which are generally capable of being distinct and accounted for as\nseparate performance obligations. See “Note 4 – Revenue” for a detailed discussion on revenue and revenue recognition.\nCost of Revenue\nOur Cost of Revenues includes the cost of materials and related direct costs. With respect to sales made through the Company’s sales agents distribution network, we include in\nour costs of revenues the commissions paid to agents for the specific sales they make. All other sales-related expenses, including those related to unsuccessful bids, are included\nin selling, general and administrative costs. Commissions included as a component of Cost of Revenues were $826,719 and $631,471 for the years ended October 31, 2023 and\n2022, respectively.\nF-7\nCODA OCTOPUS GROUP, INC.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nOctober 31, 2023 and 2022\nForeign Currency Translation\nThe Company’s operations are split between the United States, United Kingdom, Denmark, and the Netherlands. The foreign subsidiaries’ functional currencies are those of\ntheir respective local jurisdictions and are translated into U.S dollar for the purpose of reporting the Company’s consolidated financial results. The translation of assets and\nliabilities into U.S. dollars for subsidiaries with a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar is performed using exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date.\nStockholders’ equity, fixed assets and long-term investments are recorded at historical exchange rates. The translation of revenues and expenses into U.S. dollars for\nsubsidiaries with a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar is performed using the average exchange rate for the respective period. Gains or losses from cumulative\ntranslation adjustments, net of tax, are included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company records net foreign\nexchange transaction gains and losses in the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income.\nFor the years ended October 31, 2023, and October 31, 2022, the Company recorded an aggregate transaction (loss) gain of $(190,073) and $431,314, respectively. The\naggregate transaction losses were recorded as a component of Selling, General & Administrative (“SG&A”).\nTreasury Stock\nRepurchases of Restricted Stock Awards or common stock are classified as treasury stock on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. We account for treasury stock under the cost\nmethod. When treasury stock is re-issued at a price higher than its cost, the difference is recorded as a component of additional paid-in-capital in our Consolidated Balance\nSheet. When treasury stock is re-issued at a price lower than its cost, the difference is recorded as a reduction of retained earnings in our Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nSegment Reporting\nOperating segments are defined as components of an enterprise for which separate financial information is available and that is evaluated on a regular basis by the chief\noperating decision-maker (“CODM”) in deciding how to allocate resources to an individual segment and in assessing performance. The Company’s operations are organized\ninto two reportable segments: Marine Technology Business and the Marine Engineering Business. The Company’s organizational structure is based on many factors that the\nCODM uses to evaluate, view and run the business operations, which include, but are not limited to, customer base and homogeneity of products and technology. The segments\nare based on this organizational structure and information reviewed by the Company’s CODM to evaluate segment results. The CODM uses several metrics to evaluate the\nperformance of the overall business, including revenue and earnings from operations, and uses these results to allocate resources to each of the segments.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nThe Company considers all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents. The Company did not\nhave any cash equivalents as of October 31, 2022. Cash and cash equivalents are maintained with various financial institutions. As of October 31, 2023, approximately $23.3\nmillion may be in excess of federal deposit insurance limits.\nFinancial Instruments\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject the Company to significant concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash, accounts receivable, trade and other payables,\nand deferred revenue. The carrying amounts of the Company’s cash equivalents, accounts receivables, unbilled receivables, accounts payables, accrued liabilities and deferred\nrevenue, as reflected in the consolidated financial statements approximate fair value due to the short-term maturity of these items. Fair value is defined as the price that would\nbe received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The long-term deferred revenue\napproximates their carrying amounts as assessed by management. The Company’s financial instruments are exposed to certain financial risks, primarily concentration risk.\nConcentration risk is the risk of financial loss to the Company if the counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations and arises principally from\nthe Company’s cash, cash equivalents and trade receivables. The carrying amount of the financial assets represents the maximum credit exposure. The Company limits its\nexposure to concentration risk on cash by placing these financial instruments with high-credit, quality financial institutions and only investing in liquid, investment grade\nsecurities. The Company’s bank deposits are held with financial institutions both in and outside the United States. At times, such amounts may be in excess of applicable\ngovernment mandated insurance limits. The Company has not experienced any losses in such accounts or lack of access to its cash. The Company’s accounts receivables are\nsubject to potential concentrations of credit risk, since a significant part of the Company’s sales are to a small number of companies and, even though these are generally\nestablished businesses, market fluctuations such as the price of oil may affect our customers’ ability to meet their obligations to us. Furthermore, trade disputes may result in\nimpairment or delays in receivables.\nAccounts Receivable\nThe timing of revenue recognition may differ from the timing of invoicing to customers. The Company records a receivable when revenue is recognized prior to cash\ncollection.\nPayment terms and conditions vary by contract type, location of customer and the products or services offered, although terms generally require payment from a customer\nwithin 30 days for our Marine Technology Business and between 45-60 days from our Services Business. When the timing of revenue recognition differs from the timing of\ncash collection, an evaluation is performed to determine whether the contract includes a significant financing component. Accounts Receivable was $2,643,461, $2,870,600 and\n$4,207,996 as of October 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nF-8\nCODA OCTOPUS GROUP, INC.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nOctober 31, 2023 and 2022\nAllowance for Credit Losses\nThe allowance for credit losses, which includes the allowance for accounts receivable and unbilled accounts receivable, represents the Company’s best estimate of lifetime\nexpected credit losses inherent in those financial assets. The Company’s lifetime expected credit losses are determined using relevant information about past events (including\nhistorical experience), current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect collectability. The Company monitors its credit exposure through ongoing credit\nevaluations of its customers’ financial condition and limits the amount of credit extended when deemed necessary. In addition, the Company performs routine credit\nmanagement activities such as timely account reconciliations, dispute resolution, and payment confirmations. The Company may employ collection agencies and legal counsel\nto pursue recovery of defaulted receivables. The Allowance for Bad Debt was $0 for the years ended October 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nInventory\nInventories consist primarily of raw materials and finished goods and are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value on an aggregate basis. Cost is computed using the\naverage of actual cost, on a first-in, first-out basis. Adjustments to reduce the carrying amount of inventory to the lower of cost or net realizable value are made, if required, for\nexcess or obsolete goods, which includes a review of, among other factors, demand requirements and market conditions.\nBusiness Combinations\nThe Company accounts for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with ASC 805, “Business Combinations.” Identifiable assets\nacquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at their acquisition date fair values. The excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable\nassets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred. Upon acquisition, the accounts and results of operations are consolidated as of\nand subsequent to the acquisition date. When determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, management makes significant estimates and assumptions,\nespecially with respect to intangible assets. The Company utilizes commonly accepted valuation techniques, such as the income approach and the cost approach, as appropriate,\nin establishing the fair value of intangible assets. Typically, key assumptions include projections of cash flows that arise from identifiable intangible assets of acquired\nbusinesses as well as discount rates based on an analysis of the weighted average cost of capital, adjusted for specific risks associated with the assets.\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets\nGoodwill is recorded as the difference, if any, between the aggregate consideration paid for an acquisition and the fair value of the net tangible and identified intangible assets\nacquired under a business combination. Goodwill also includes acquired assembled workforce, which does not qualify as an identifiable intangible asset. The Company reviews\nimpairment of goodwill annually in the fourth quarter, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that the goodwill might be impaired. Triggering events for\nimpairment reviews may be indicators such as adverse industry or economic trends, restructuring actions, lower projections of profitability, or a sustained decline in the\nCompany’s market capitalization. The Company first assesses qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test. If,\nafter assessing the totality of events or circumstances, the Company determines that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its’ carrying\namount, then the quantitative goodwill impairment test is unnecessary. If, based on the qualitative assessment, it is determined that it is more likely than not that the fair value\nof a reporting unit is less than its’ carrying amount, then the Company proceeds to perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test. The Company first determines the fair\nvalue of a reporting unit using a Level 1 input which estimates the fair value of the Company’s equity by utilizing the Company’s trading price as of the end of the reporting\nperiod. The Company then compares the derived fair value of a reporting unit with the carrying amount. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an\nimpairment loss will be recognized in an amount equal to that excess, limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.\nAs of October 31, 2023, the Company determined it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit was less than its’ carrying amount and as a result\nquantitative goodwill impairment test was unnecessary and there was no impairment charge.\nF-9\nCODA OCTOPUS GROUP, INC.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nOctober 31, 2023 and 2022\nFinite-lived intangible assets consist of acquired patents, customer relationships, and non-compete agreements resulting from business combinations. The Company’s intangible\nassets are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, ranging from 2 to 15 years. The Company makes judgments about the recoverability of finite-lived\nintangible assets whenever facts and circumstances indicate that the useful life is shorter than originally estimated or that the carrying amount of assets may not be recoverable.\nIf such facts and circumstances exist, the Company assesses recoverability by comparing the projected undiscounted net cash flows associated with the related asset or group of\nassets over their remaining lives against their respective carrying amounts. Impairments, if any, are based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of those\nassets. If the useful life is shorter than originally estimated, the Company would accelerate the rate of amortization and amortize the remaining carrying value over the new\nshorter useful life. The Company evaluates the carrying value of indefinite-lived intangible assets on an annual basis, and an impairment charge would be recognized to the\nextent that the carrying amount of such assets exceeds their estimated fair value.\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Expenditures for minor replacements, maintenance and repairs which do not increase the useful lives\nof the property and equipment are charged to operations as incurred. Major additions and improvements are capitalized.\nDepreciation and amortization are computed using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives:\nBuildings 50 years\nOffice machinery and equipment 3-5 years\nRental assets 3-7 years\nFurniture, fixtures, and improvements 3-5 years\nDepreciation expense is presented as a component of Selling, General and Administrative expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income.\nDepreciation expense related to the Products Business “Rental Assets” used for generating rental income is allocated 70% to Cost of Goods Sold and the remaining 30% as a\ncomponent of Selling, General and Administration expense.\nLeases\nThe Company owns substantially all its facilities and as a result the effect of Accounting Standards Codification 842, “Leases”, is immaterial.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nManagement reviews long-lived assets, including property and equipment and intangible assets, for possible impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances\nindicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable. Such events and changes may include: a significant decrease in market value, changes in asset use,\nnegative industry or economic trends, and changes in the Company’s business strategy. The Company measures recoverability of these assets by comparing the carrying\namounts to the future undiscounted cash flows that the assets or the asset group are expected to generate. If the carrying value of the assets is not recoverable, an impairment\ncharge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the assets.\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development costs are comprised primarily of employee-related costs, stock-based compensation expense, engineering consulting expenses associated with new\nproduct and technology development, product commercialization, quality assurance and testing costs, as well as costs related to information technology, patent applications and\nexaminations, materials, supplies, and an allocation of facilities costs. All research and development costs are expensed as they are incurred.\nStock-Based Compensation\nThe Company accounts for stock-based compensation expense in accordance with the authoritative guidance on stock-based payments. Under the provisions of the guidance,\nstock-based compensation expense is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the option using a Black-Scholes option pricing model and is recognized as expense\non a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period.\nThe authoritative guidance also requires that the Company measure and recognize stock-based compensation expense upon modification of the term of a stock award. The\nstock-based compensation expense for such modification is the sum of any unamortized expense of the award before modification and the modification expense. The\nmodification expense is the incremental amount of the fair value of the award before the modification and the fair value of the award after the modification, measured on the\ndate of modification. In the event the modification results in a longer requisite period than in the original award, the Company has elected to apply the pool method where the\naggregate of the unamortized expense and the modification expense is amortized over the new requisite period on a straight-line basis. In addition, any forfeiture will be based\non the original requisite period prior to the modification.\nCalculating stock-based compensation expense requires the input of highly subjective assumptions, including the expected term of the stock-based awards, stock price\nvolatility, and the pre-vesting option forfeiture rate. The Company estimates the expected life of options granted based on historical exercise patterns, which are believed to be\nrepresentative of future behavior. The Company estimates the volatility of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant based on historical volatility. The assumptions\nused in calculating the fair value of stock-based awards represent the Company’s best estimates, but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of\nmanagement judgment. As a result, if factors change and the Company uses different assumptions, its stock-based compensation expense could be materially different in the\nfuture. In addition, the Company is required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and only recognize expense for those shares expected to vest. The Company estimates the\nforfeiture rate based on historical experience of its stock-based awards that are granted, exercised and cancelled. If the actual forfeiture rate is materially different from the\nestimate, stock-based compensation expense could be significantly different from what was recorded in the current period.\nF-10\nCODA OCTOPUS GROUP, INC.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nOctober 31, 2023 and 2022\nThe Company may grant restricted stock units (“RSUs”) to employees or consultants. RSU awards vest upon grant or fixed term, generally 36 months. The Company uses the\nclosing trading price of its common stock on the date of grant as the fair value of awards of restricted stock units. Stock-based compensation from RSU awards is recognized on\na straight-line basis over the RSU awards’ vesting period.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification 740, Income Taxes (ASC 740). Under ASC 740, deferred income tax assets and\nliabilities are recorded for the income tax effects of differences between the bases of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and their bases for income tax\nreporting. The Company’s differences arise principally from the use of various accelerated and modified accelerated cost recovery systems for income tax purposes versus\nstraight line depreciation used for book purposes and from the utilization of net operating loss carry-forwards.\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are the amounts by which the Company’s future income taxes are expected to be impacted by these differences as they reverse. Deferred tax\nassets are based on differences that are expected to decrease future income taxes as they reverse. Correspondingly, deferred tax liabilities are based on differences that are\nexpected to increase future income taxes as they reverse. Note 10 Income Taxes discloses the amounts of deferred tax assets and liabilities, and also presents the impact of\nsignificant differences between financial reporting income and taxable income.\nFor income tax purposes, the Company uses the percentage of completion method of recognizing revenues on long-term contracts which is consistent with the Company’s\nfinancial reporting under GAAP.\nFrom time to time, the Company engages in transactions in which the tax consequences may be subject to uncertainty. Significant judgment is required in assessing and\nestimating the tax consequences of these transactions. Accruals for unrecognized tax benefit liabilities, which represent the difference between a tax position taken or expected\nto be taken in a tax return and the benefit recognized for financial reporting purposes, are recorded when the Company believes it is not more-likely-than-not that the tax\nposition will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position. Adjustments to unrecognized tax benefits are recognized when\nfacts and circumstances change, such as the closing of a tax audit, notice of an assessment by a taxing authority or the refinement of an estimate. Income tax benefit includes\nthe effects of adjustments to unrecognized tax benefits, as well as any related interest and penalties.\nComprehensive Income\nComprehensive income is defined to include all changes in equity except those resulting from investments by owners and distributions to owners. Comprehensive income\nincludes gains and losses on foreign currency translation adjustments and is included as a component of stockholders’ equity.\nAdvertising\nAdvertising costs are expenses as incurred and are presented as a component of Selling, General and Administrative expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income and\nComprehensive Income, Advertising expenses for the years ended October 31, 2023, and October 31, 2022, were $0 for both periods.\nContingencies\nFrom time to time, the Company may be involved in legal and administrative proceedings and claims of various types. The Company records liability in its consolidated\nfinancial statements for these matters when a loss is known or considered probable, and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Management reviews these estimates in each\naccounting period as additional information becomes known and adjusts the loss provision when appropriate. If the loss is not probable or cannot be reasonably estimated, a\nliability is not recorded in the consolidated financial statements. If a loss is probable but the amount of loss cannot be reasonably estimated, the Company discloses the loss\ncontingency and an estimate of possible loss or range of loss (unless such an estimate cannot be made). The Company does not recognize gain contingencies until they are\nrealized. Legal costs incurred in connection with loss contingencies are expensed as incurred.\nNOTE 3 – RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\nAccounting Pronouncements to be Adopted\nOn October 27, 2023, the FASB issues ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures. ASU 2023-07 will affect how we\nreport segment information, starting with our Form 10-K for the year ended October 31, 2025, and our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q starting with our quarterly report for the\nquarter ended January 31, 2026. The ASU requires that we provide disclosures of significant segment expenses and other segment items that are regularly provided to our\nCODM and included in each reported measure of segment profit or loss. We will also have to disclose other segment items by reportable segment (i.e., the difference between\nreported segment revenues less the significant segment expenses (which are disclosed) less reported segment profit or loss). We will identify the CODM and their position\nwithin the company and details about the information that they regularly review to make capital allocation and other operating decisions about each segment, as well as an\nexplanation of how the CODM uses the reported measures and other disclosures. The information needed for these disclosures is available, but we will need to determine the\nbest way to provide that information for these required segment disclosures.\nOn December 13, 2023, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2023-08 entitled Accounting and Disclosure for Crypto Assets (ASU 2023-08,) which changes the\naccounting model for crypto assets from the existing impairment model to a fair value model. This is a significant change since the impairment model accounted for diminution\nin value of crypto assets by writing down the crypto asset without the ability to increase the value if prices improved in the future. Under the fair value model, crypto assets will\nbe marked to market at each financial reporting date such that subsequent increases in value of the crypto assets can be recorded. ASU 2023-08 also requires enhanced\ndisclosures about crypto asset transactions. The Company plans to adopt this new standard on November 1, 2025, reserving the option to early adopt ASU 2023-08 if its\ncustomers begin to pay for the Company’s products and services with crypto assets. To date, the Company has neither accepted payment for its products and/or services in\ncrypto assets, nor has it received or invested in this class of assets.\nOn December 14, 2023, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2023-09 entitled Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures (ASU 2023-09), which is primarily\napplicable to public companies and requires a significant expansion of the granularity of the income tax rate reconciliation as well as an expansion of other income tax\ndisclosures. The majority of the disclosures will only be made on an annual basis, although there is a modest expansion of required quarterly income tax disclosures. The\namendments in ASU 2023-09 require disclosure of specific income tax categories in the rate and reconciliation and provide additional information for reconciling items that\nmeet a quantitative threshold (if the effect of those reconciling items is equal to or greater than 5 percent of the amount computed by multiplying pretax income (or loss) by the\napplicable statutory income tax rate. There are also additional disclosures related to taxes paid to local jurisdictions, and to income taxes paid. This information is currently\navailable to the Company but was not a required disclosure. The Company expects to adopt ASU 2023-09 on November 1, 2025.\nNOTE 4 – REVENUE\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company recognizes revenue under the Financial Accounting Standards Board’s Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (“Topic 606”).\nF-11\nCODA OCTOPUS GROUP, INC.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nOctober 31, 2023 and 2022\nTopic 606 has established a five-step process to determine the amount of revenue to record from contracts with customers. The five steps are:\n● Determine if we have a contract with a customer;\n● Determine the performance obligations in that contract;\n● Determine the transaction price;\n● Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations; and\n● Determine when to recognize revenue.\nRevenues are earned under formal contracts with our customers and are derived from both sales and rental of underwater technologies and equipment for real time 3D imaging,\nmapping, defense, and survey applications and from the engineering services which we provide primarily to prime defense contractors. Our contracts do not include the\npossibility for additional contingent consideration so that our determination of the contract price does not involve having to consider potential additional variable consideration.\nOur sales do not include a right of return by the customer.\nFor the Marine Technology Business, all of our products are sold on a stand-alone basis and those market prices are evidence of the value of the products. To the extent that we\nalso provide services (e.g., installation, training, post-sales technical support etc.), those services are either included as part of the product or are subject to written contracts\nbased on the stand-alone value of those services. Revenue from the sale of services is recognized when those services have been provided to the customer and evidence of the\nprovision of those services exists.\nRevenue derived from either our subscription package offerings or rental of our equipment is recognized when performance obligations are met, in particular, on a daily basis\nduring the subscription or rental period.\nFor arrangements with multiple performance obligations, we recognize product revenue by allocating the transaction revenue to each performance obligation based on the\nrelative fair value of each deliverable and recognize revenue when performance obligations are met including when equipment is delivered, and for rental of equipment, when\ninstallation and other services are performed.\nOur contracts sometimes require customer payments in advance of revenue recognition and are recognized as revenue when the Company has fulfilled its obligations under the\nrespective contracts. Until such time, we recognize this prepayment as deferred revenue.\nFor software license sales for which any services rendered are not considered distinct to the functionality of the software, we recognize revenue upon delivery of the software.\nF-12\nCODA OCTOPUS GROUP, INC.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nOctober 31, 2023 and 2022\nWith respect to revenues related to our Services Business, there are contracts in place that specify the fixed hourly rate and other reimbursable costs to be billed based on\nmaterial and direct labor hours incurred and, revenue is recognized on these contracts based on material and the direct labor hours incurred. Revenues from fixed-price\ncontracts are recognized on the percentage-of-completion method, measured by the percentage of costs incurred (materials and direct labor hours) to date to estimated total\nservices (materials and direct labor hours) for each contract. This method is used as we consider expenditures for direct materials and labor hours to be the best available\nmeasure of progress on these contracts.\nOn a quarterly basis, we examine all our fixed-price contracts to determine if there are any losses to be recognized during the period. Any such loss is recorded in the quarter in\nwhich the loss first becomes apparent based upon costs incurred to date and the estimated costs to complete as determined by experience from similar contracts. Variations from\nestimated contract performance could result in adjustments to operating results.\nRecoverability of Deferred Costs\nIn accordance with Topic 606, we defer costs on projects for service revenue. Deferred costs consist primarily of incremental direct costs to customize and install systems, as\ndefined in individual customer contracts, including costs to acquire hardware and software from third parties and payroll costs for our employees and other third parties. The\npricing of these service contracts is intended to provide for the recovery of these types of deferred costs over the life of the contract.\nWe recognize such costs in accordance with our revenue recognition policy by contract. For revenue recognized under the percentage of completion method, costs are\nrecognized as products are delivered or services are provided in accordance with the percentage of completion calculation. For revenue recognized over time, costs are\nrecognized ratably over the term of the contract, commencing on the date of revenue recognition. At each quarterly balance sheet date, we review deferred costs, to ensure they\nare ultimately recoverable.\nAny anticipated losses on uncompleted contracts are recognized when evidence indicates the estimated total cost of a contract exceeds its estimated total revenue.\nF-13\nCODA OCTOPUS GROUP, INC.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nOctober 31, 2023 and 2022\nOther Revenue Disclosures\nSee Note 15 – “Disaggregation of Revenue” for a breakdown of revenues from external customers and cost of those revenues between our Product Segment and Services\nSegment including information on the split of revenues by geography.\nContracts in Progress (Unbilled Receivables and Deferred Revenue)\nUnbilled Receivables includes earned revenue in excess of billings on incomplete contracts representing accumulated project expenses plus fees which have not been invoiced\nto customers as of the date of the balance sheet. The amount of unbilled contracts receivable may not exceed their net realizable value. Unbilled Receivables were $894,251 and\n$602,115 as of October 31, 2023, and October 31, 2022, respectively.\nSales of equipment include a provision for warranty or through life support (TLS) services and is treated as deferred revenue, along with extended warranty sales or TLS, which\nmay be purchased by customers. These amounts are amortized over the relevant warranty or TLS period (12 months is our standard warranty contract obligation or for TLS 24,\n36 or 60 months) from the date of sale.\nDeferred Revenue (current) includes paid customer invoices prior to delivery of the agreed service, customer prepaid support to be delivered within twelve months and\nprovision for warranty services to be provided within twelve months. Deferred Revenue was $975,537 and $943,569 as of October 31, 2023, and October 31, 2022,\nrespectively.\nDeferred Revenue (current) consisted of the following as of October 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021:\n2023 2022 2021\nDeferred Revenue $ 420,611 $ 430,962 $ 604,049\nCustomer Technical Support Obligations 324,218 283,369 1,117,855\nProduct Warranty 230,708 229,238 277,937\nTotal Deferred Revenue (Current) $ 975,537 $ 943,569 $ 1,999,841\nDeferred Revenue (current) includes customer prepaid support, TLS, to be delivered past the initial twelve months and provision for extended warranty services to be provided\npast the initial twelve months.\nDeferred Revenue (non-current) was $133,382 and $76,127 as of October 31, 2023, and October 31, 2022, respectively.\nF-14\nCODA OCTOPUS GROUP, INC.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nOctober 31, 2023 and 2022\nNOTE 5 – FAIR VALUE\nThe Company follows the authoritative guidance for fair value measurement and the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities. The Company carries its\nfinancial instruments at fair value. Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability, or an exit price, in the principal\nor most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. The established fair value hierarchy\nrequires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. There are three levels of inputs that may be\nused to measure fair value:\nLevel 1 Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets.\nLevel 2 Observable market-based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data.\nLevel 3 Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets. Level 3 assets and liabilities\ninclude financial instruments whose value is determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies, or similar techniques, as well as\ninstruments for which the determination of fair value requires significant management judgment or estimation.\nWhen applying fair value principles in the valuation of assets, the Company is required to maximize the use of quoted market prices and minimize the use of unobservable\ninputs. The Company calculates the fair value of its Level 1 and Level 2 instruments based on the exchange traded price of similar or identical instruments, where available, or\nbased on other observable inputs.\nThere were no marketable securities required to be measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of October 31, 2023, or October 31, 2022.\nNOTE 6 – COMPOSITION OF CERTAIN FINANCIAL STATEMENT CAPTIONS\nCertified Deposit Interest Bearing Accounts\nThe Company established certified deposit interest-bearing accounts with its current bankers HSBC NA and Jyske Bank in February 2023.

As a result, the Company’ foreign\nderived income is subject to GILTI tax in the United States. The Company has elected to treat GILTI inclusions as period costs.\nThe Company has filed tax returns for federal, state, and foreign jurisdictions. The Company’s evaluation of uncertain tax matters was performed for the tax years ended\nOctober 31, 2023, and October 31, 2022. The Company has elected to retain its existing accounting policy with respect to the treatment of interest and penalties attributable to\nincome taxes and continues to reflect interest and penalties attributable to income taxes, to extent they arise, as a component of its income tax provision or benefit as well as its\noutstanding income tax assets and liabilities. The Company believes that its income tax positions and deductions would be sustained on an audit and does not anticipate any\nadjustments to result in a material change to its financial position.\nThe Company’s UK Operations, under the applicable UK tax rules, have certain carryforward trading losses (referred to in this Form 10-K disclosure as “NOL carryforwards”).\nUnder the applicable UK tax rules, any trading tax losses incurred from 2017 up to and including the current fiscal year can be surrendered for UK group relief to offset or\nreduce current year profits and tax liability in any of the Company’s UK Operations. Any tax losses before 2017 in a UK subsidiary can only be used by the subsidiary to which\nit pertains. The benefit of these tax losses benefit are available indefinitely unless the nature of the business with the tax benefit changes substantially. Under UK tax rules, the\nUK entities are also eligible for research and development (R&D) Tax Credit. The UK Products Business in any one financial year performs significant R&D work due to the\nnature of its business (researching and developing products and solutions). In the 2023 FY, this subsidiary was eligible to deduct £174,771 (an equivalent of 158,883 USD) as\nR&D tax expenses from its taxable income, thus negating any tax liability of the UK Operations in the Current FY. Our UK Operations have the equivalent of $477,271 in NOL\ncarryforwards, $397,874 of which can be used by the UK entity in which the trading loss was created and $79,397 can be used by any of the UK entities under Group Relief.\nThis applies indefinitely unless the business activities undertaken change substantially.\nA valuation allowance is required for deferred tax assets, if based on available evidence, it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the asset will not be realized due to\nthe inability to generate sufficient taxable income in the future. The valuation allowance was zero and $324,719 as of October 31, 2023, and 2022, respectively. The deferred\ntax losses refer to timing of asset allowance in the UK. As we are generally able to offset most taxes with brought forward trading losses, R&D tax credit to offset profits\nexpected to be ongoing and ability to utilize such reliefs within between entities then we do not foresee being able to utilize those deferred tax assets in the near future.\nF-20\nCODA OCTOPUS GROUP, INC.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nOctober 31, 2023 and 2022\nNOTE 11 – LINE OF CREDIT\nThe Company entered into a $4,000,000 revolving line of credit facility with HSBC NA on November 27, 2019, with the interest rate established as the applicable prime rate.\nThis revolving line of credit facility is subject to annual renewal and has been extended to November 2024.

The plan allows the Company to make matching contributions of 4% of employee compensation, subject\nto IRS contribution limits. U.S. employees who have at least six months of service with the Company are eligible. In addition, the Company’s UK subsidiaries operate statutory\npension schemes which provide for the payment of certain contributions by the Company and the Employee. These schemes in the UK operate on a defined contribution money\npurchase basis and the contributions are charged to operations as they arise. Finally, the Company is obligated to provide pension funding according to the laws in which it\noperates including in both Denmark, Australia and India. The Company has an arrangement that fulfills this requirement.

(“Coda,” “the Company,” or “we”) operates two discrete operating business units. These are the Marine Technology Business (“Products Business,” or “Products Segment”) and the Marine Engineering Business (“Services Business,” “Engineering Business” or “Services Segment”).\n\nThe Marine Technology Business is an established supplier of underwater technologies and solutions to the underwater and diving markets. Its products and solutions include both hardware and software for which it is the patent holder, innovator, developer, manufacturer and distributor. It has key proprietary 4D/5D/6D imaging sonar technology marketed under the name of Echoscope® and Echoscope PIPE® and diving technology marketed under the name of CodaOctopus® DAVD (Diver Augmented Vision Display). We believe that the Echoscope® sonar series is the only sonar that can generate multiple real time 3D images of moving objects underwater in zero visibility conditions. In 2021, the Marine Technology Business started marketing the DAVD tethered system. The requirements for the DAVD solution emanated from the Office of Naval Research as part of its Future Naval Requirements Program. The DAVD embeds inside of the diver’s head-up display (HUD) a pair of transparent glasses which is used as the data hub for displaying real time data used for the diving mission to the diver. Amongst other things, it allows both the diver underwater and the dive supervisor on the surface to share the same data or visualize the underwater scene. In addition, by combining the DAVD solution with the Echoscope®, dive operations can be performed in zero visibility conditions. These conditions are a common barrier which impinges on the ability to perform these activities and therefore the DAVD solution combined with the Echoscope® is a real requirement for these operations. In addition, in fiscal year 2023 we were contracted by the US Navy and an allied foreign navy to develop the untethered version of the DAVD technology, for the target market of special forces (referred to as “DAVD Hardening Program”). Under the DAVD Hardening Program, we supplied in fiscal year 2023 eight untethered systems to these customers for their ongoing evaluation and have since been working on and supplying further hardening features for the DAVD untethered system which arise from the ongoing field evaluation by our customers under the DAVD Hardening Program.\n\nThe Engineering Business is an established sub-contractor to the prime defense contractors and generally supplies proprietary sub-assemblies for incorporation into broader mission critical defense systems. These sub-assemblies are typically supplied for the life of the program. The Marine Engineering Business’ scope of services for these defense programs typically covers: “concept, design, prototype, manufacture, and post-sale support”. The manufacturing contracts for these sub-assemblies can run over many years.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Coda Octopus Group, Inc. and its wholly owned domestic and foreign subsidiaries. All of its subsidiaries are wholly owned by the Company. All significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in the consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues including unbilled and deferred revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Significant estimates include estimates related to the percentage of completion method used to account for contracts including costs and earnings in excess of billings, billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings and the valuation of goodwill.\n\nNOTE 2 – REVENUE RECOGNITION\n\nThe Company recognizes revenue in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board’s Topic 606, _Revenue from Contracts with Customers_(“Topic 606”).\n\nTopic 606 has established a five-step process to determine the amount of revenue to record from contracts with customers. The five steps are:\n\n● | Identify the contract with the customer;  \n---|---  \n● | Identify the performance obligations in the contract with customer;  \n● | Determine the transaction price;  \n● | Allocate the transaction price to performance obligations; and  \n● | Recognize revenue when (or as) a performance obligation is satisfied.  \n  \nOur revenues are earned under written contracts with our customers. The Marine Technology Business model includes both rentals with associated services and outright sales of underwater technologies which are utilized for a wide range of subsea applications along with technical support services. The Engineering Business supplies engineering services to mainly the prime defense contractors which may include concept, design, prototyping, and contract manufacturing. Our contracts do not include the possibility for additional consideration as the determination for the contract price does not involve having to consider potential additional variable consideration. Our sales do not include a right of return by the customer. Where there are contractual failures giving rise to post-sale obligations these are addressed under our warranty or through life support provisions.\n\n8  \n---  \n  \n**CODA OCTOPUS GROUP, INC.**\n\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nJuly 31, 2024 and October 31, 2023\n\nNOTE 2 – REVENUE RECOGNITION (Continued)\n\nRegarding our Marine Technology Business, all our products are sold on a stand-alone basis and those market prices are evidence of the value of the products. To the extent that we also provide services (e.g., installation, training, post-sales technical support, customization of our technology for bespoke application, etc.), those services are either included as part of the product or are subject to written contracts based on the stand-alone value of those services. Revenue from the sale of services is recognized when those services have been performed.\n\nRevenue derived by the Marine Technology Business from subscription package offerings or equipment rental is recognized when performance obligations are met, in particular, on a daily basis during the subscription or rental period.\n\nFor arrangements with multiple performance obligations, we recognize product revenue by allocating the transaction revenue to each performance obligation based on a relative standalone selling price basis and recognize revenue when performance obligations are met including when equipment is delivered, and for rental of equipment, when installation, training and other services prescribed by the contract are performed.\n\nOur contracts sometimes require customer payments in advance of revenue recognition. These are recognized as revenue when the Company has fulfilled its obligations under the respective contracts. Until such time, we recognize these prepayments as deferred revenue.\n\nFor software license sales for which any services rendered are not considered distinct to the functionality of the software, we recognize revenue upon delivery of the software by the provision of the software installers and activation codes to the software.\n\nWith respect to revenues related to our Services Business, there are contracts in place that specify the fixed hourly rate and other reimbursable costs to be billed based on material and direct labor hours incurred and revenue is recognized on these contracts based on material and the direct labor hours incurred. Revenues from fixed-price contracts are recognized on the percentage of completion method, measured by the percentage of costs incurred (materials and direct labor hours) to date to estimated total cost (materials and direct labor hours) for each contract. This method is used as we consider expenditures for direct materials and labor hours to be the best available measure of progress on these contracts.\n\nOn a quarterly basis, we examine all our fixed-price contracts to determine if there are any losses to be recognized during the period. Any such loss is recorded in the quarter in which the loss first becomes apparent based upon costs incurred to date and the estimated costs to complete as determined by experience from similar contracts. Variations from estimated contract performance could result in adjustments to operating results.\n\n_Recoverability of Deferred Costs_\n\nIn accordance with Topic 606, we defer certain costs on projects for service revenue. Deferred costs consist primarily of incremental direct costs to customize and install systems, as defined in individual customer contracts, including costs to acquire hardware and software from third parties and payroll costs for our employees and other third parties. The pricing of these service contracts is intended to provide for the recovery of these types of deferred costs over the life of the contract.\n\n9  \n---  \n  \n**CODA OCTOPUS GROUP, INC.**\n\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nJuly 31, 2024 and October 31, 2023\n\nNOTE 2 – REVENUE RECOGNITION (Continued)\n\nWe recognize such costs in accordance with our revenue recognition policy by contract. For revenue recognized under the percentage of completion method, costs are recognized as contract deliverables are provided in accordance with the percentage of completion calculation. For revenue recognized over time, costs are recognized ratably over the term of the contract, commencing on the date of revenue recognition. At each quarterly balance sheet date, we review deferred costs, to ensure they are ultimately recoverable.\n\nAny anticipated losses on uncompleted contracts are recognized when evidence indicates the estimated total cost of a contract exceeds its estimated total revenue.\n\n_Other Revenue Disclosures_\n\nSee Notes 12 and 13 – Segment Analysis and Disaggregation of Revenue. These Notes provide disclosure of our revenue by segment (Products Business versus Services Business); revenues from external customers and cost of those revenues; and split of revenue by geography including in and outside the USA.\n\nNOTE 3 – COST OF GOODS SOLD\n\nOur cost of goods sold includes the cost of materials and related direct costs. With respect to sales made through the operating segments’ sales agents distribution network, we include in our costs of goods sold commissions paid to agents for the specific sales they make. Without using agents, we would not be eligible to participate in the Request for Proposals (“RFP”) for these sales on which we incur commission costs. All other sales-related expenses, including those related to unsuccessful bids, are included in selling, general and administrative (SG&A) costs. As a component of cost of goods sold, sales commission costs in the three month period ended July 31, 2024, and 2023 were $100,290 and $120,724, respectively. Commission costs in the nine month period ended July 31, 2024, and 2023 were $525,696 and $728,552 respectively.\n\nNOTE 4 – FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS\n\nThe Company’s financial instruments include cash, cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and accrued expenses. The carrying amounts of cash, cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate their fair values because of the short-term nature of these instruments.\n\nNOTE 5 – FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION\n\nAssets and liabilities are translated at the prevailing exchange rates at the balance sheet dates. Related revenues and expenses are translated at average exchange rates in effect during the reporting period. Stockholders’ equity is recorded at historical exchange rates. Resulting translation adjustments are recorded as a separate component in stockholders’ equity as part of accumulated other comprehensive income or (loss) as may be appropriate. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are included in the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income.\n\n10  \n---  \n  \n**CODA OCTOPUS GROUP, INC.**\n\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nJuly 31, 2024 and October 31, 2023\n\nNOTE 6 – COMPOSITION OF CERTAIN FINANCIAL STATEMENT CAPTIONS\n\nCertified Deposit Interest Bearing Accounts as of July 31, 2024 and October 31, 2023.\n\nThe Company has certified deposit interest-bearing accounts with its current bankers HSBC NA and HSBC UK.

ASU 2023-07 will affect how we report segment information, starting with our Form 10-K for the year ended October 31, 2025, and our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q starting with our quarterly report for the quarter ended January 31, 2026. The ASU requires that we provide disclosures of significant segment expenses and other segment items that are regularly provided to our Chief Operating Decision Maker (“the CODM”) and included in each reported measure of segment profit or loss. We will also have to disclose other segment items by reportable segment (i.e., the difference between reported segment revenues less the significant segment expenses (which are disclosed) less reported segment profit or loss). The information needed for these disclosures is available, but we are determining the best way to provide that information for these required segment disclosures.\n\nOn December 14, 2023, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2023-09 entitled Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures (ASU 2023-09), which is primarily applicable to public companies and requires a significant expansion of the granularity of the income tax rate reconciliation as well as an expansion of other income tax disclosures. The majority of the disclosures will only be made on an annual basis, although there is a modest expansion of required quarterly income tax disclosures. The amendments in ASU 2023-09 require disclosure of specific income tax categories in the rate and reconciliation and provide additional information for reconciling items that meet a quantitative threshold (if the effect of those reconciling items is equal to or greater than 5 percent of the amount computed by multiplying pretax income (or loss) by the applicable statutory income tax rate. There are also additional disclosures related to taxes paid to local jurisdictions, and to income taxes paid. This information is currently available to the Company but was not a required disclosure. The Company expects to adopt ASU 2023-09 on November 1, 2025.\n\nNOTE 10 – EARNINGS PER SHARE\n\nSCHEDULE OF EARNINGS PER SHARE BASIC AND DILUTED\n\nThree Months | Three Months | Nine Months | Nine Months  \n---|---|---|---  \nEnded | Ended | Ended | Ended  \nJuly 31, | July 31, | July 31, | July 31,  \nFiscal Period | 2024 | 2023 | 2024 | 2023  \nNumerator:  \nNet Income | $| 1,274,658 | $| 1,038,780 | $| 3,319,784 | $| 3,445,114  \nDenominator:  \nBasic weighted average common shares outstanding | 11,173,819 | 11,092,420 | 11,157,799 | 11,044,624  \nUnexercised portion of options and restricted stock awards | 137,417 | 191,717 | 137,417 | 191,717  \nDiluted outstanding shares | 11,311,236 | 11,284,137 | 11,295,216 | 11,236,341  \nNet income per share  \nBasic | $| 0.11 | $| 0.09 | $| 0.30 | $| 0.31  \nDiluted | $| 0.11 | $| 0.09 | $| 0.29 | $| 0.31  \n  \nNOTE 11 – 2017 STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN\n\n**2017 Stock Incentive Plan**\n\nOn December 6, 2017, the Board of Directors adopted the 2017 Stock Incentive Plan (the “2017 Plan”). The purpose of the Plan is to advance the interests of the Company and its stockholders by enabling the Company and its subsidiaries to attract and retain qualified individuals through opportunities for equity participation in the Company, and to reward those individuals who contribute to the Company’s achievement of its economic objectives. The Plan was adopted subject to stockholders’ approval and was approved by Stockholders at the Company’s Annual General Meeting held on July 24, 2018.\n\nThe maximum number of shares of Common Stock allocated for issuance under the 2017 Plan is 913,612. The shares allocated for issuance under the 2017 Plan may, at the election of the Compensation Committee, be either treasury shares or shares authorized but unissued, and, if treasury shares are used, all references in the 2017 Plan to the issuance of shares will, for corporate law purposes, be deemed to mean the transfer of shares from treasury.\n\nDuring the three month period ended July 31, 2024, the Company granted 18,700 restricted stock awards pursuant to the terms of the 2017 Plan, 12,546 restricted stock awards matured but were not issued as of July 31, 2024 and 2,500 stock awards which had previously matured were issued.

Our effective consolidated tax rate for the three-months ended July 31, 2024, is higher than the U.S. statutory Federal tax rate of 21.0% resulting from the composition of our taxable income from each jurisdiction. We pay Danish tax at a tax rate of 22% in respect of our Danish subsidiary. We also pay Global Intangible Low Taxed Income (GILTI) tax in the United States based upon our foreign operations, which tax is over and above the statutory tax rate. We get to offset a portion of the Danish tax we pay against the U.S. GILTI tax. Regarding our U.K. subsidiaries, we have R&D tax credits that currently completely offset our income tax liabilities in the U.K. We accrue both Federal and state income taxes in the U.S., as well as our liability for the GILTI tax. The composition of our taxable income in the various jurisdictions affects the calculation of our global tax liabilities. In addition, the timing of recognizing revenues and expenses for income tax purposes affects our effective tax rates.\n\n22  \n---  \n  \n**ITEM 2.

This discussion should not be construed to imply that the results discussed herein will necessarily continue into the future, or that any conclusion reached herein will necessarily be indicative of actual operating results in the future. Such discussion represents only the best present assessment of our management.\n\n**General Overview**\n\nThroughout these discussions, the following terms shall have the meanings set forth below:\n\n“Current Quarter” | Three month period ended July 31, 2024  \n---|---  \n“Previous Quarter” | Three month period ended July 31, 2023  \n“Current Nine Month Period” | Nine month period ended July 31, 2024  \n“Previous Nine Month Period” | Nine month period ended July 31, 2023  \n  \nThe Company operates two distinct businesses:\n\n● | the Marine Technology Business (also referred to in this Form 10-Q as “Products Business”, or “Products Segment”); and  \n---|---  \n● | the Marine Engineering Business (also referred to in this Form 10-Q as “Engineering Business”, or “Services Business” or “Services Segment”).  \n  \nOur Marine Technology Business is an established technology solution provider to the subsea and underwater imaging, surveying, diving market and underwater communications market. It has been operating as a supplier of underwater solutions which include both hardware and software products for over 30 years. It owns key proprietary patented technology including real time volumetric 4D/5D and 6D imaging sonar technology and cutting-edge diving technology, that are used in both the underwater defense and commercial markets. It recently launched its new AI based underwater digital communications system which advances the offering in the market from analog voice communications underwater to digital voice communications underwater. All design, development and manufacturing of our technology and solutions are performed within the Company.\n\nOur imaging sonar technology products and solutions marketed under the name of Echoscope® and Echoscope PIPE® are used primarily in the underwater construction market, offshore renewables, offshore oil and gas, forward looking obstacle avoidance, complex underwater mapping, salvage operations, dredging, bridge inspection, underwater hazard detection, port & harbor security, mining, fisheries, real time 3D monitoring and inspection, commercial and defense diving, and marine sciences sectors. Uniquely our Echoscope® technology is a single sensor for multiple underwater applications and therefore serves a number of discrete market verticals such as breakwater construction, dredging, salvage, landing operations, complex survey and mapping, commissioning and decommissioning of underwater assets.\n\nOur novel diving technology is distributed under the name “CodaOctopus® DAVD” (Diver Augmented Vision Display) to the global defense and commercial diving markets. The DAVD embeds inside of the diver’s head up display (HUD) a pair of transparent glasses which is used as the data hub for displaying real time diving mission data to the diver. We believe that the DAVD system has the potential to radically transform how diving operations are performed globally because it provides a fully integrated singular system for topside control and a fully connected HUD system for the diver allowing both the topside and diver to share a range of critical information including depth (pressure and temperature), compass and head tracking, real time dive timers and alerts, diver position and navigation, ultra-low light enhanced video system and enhanced digital voice communications. Current diving operations are limited in that the diver only shares analog voice communications with the topside without real time information including real time navigation, tracking and mapping of the dive area. The topside must also manage several independent systems for video, communications, and positioning. The Company’s solution addresses these deficiencies. Also, using our sonar technology, diving can be performed in zero visibility conditions, a common problem which besets these operations thereby impacting the ability to perform diving operations when these conditions prevail, safety and the costs of these operations.\n\n23  \n---  \n  \nOur digital audio communications system, (marketed under the name “Voice-HUB 4”), offers a digital audio communications system which advances the market from analog underwater communications to digital and provides much clearer underwater communications, thereby removing the risk of miscommunication.\n\nAlthough we generate most of our revenues from our real time 3D sonar which includes proprietary hardware and software, we have several other products such as our inertial navigation systems (F280 Series®) and our geophysical hardware (DA4G) and software solutions (GeoSurvey and Survey Engine®, which include artificial intelligence based automatic detection systems), DAVD and our digital audio communications system (Voice-HUB- 4).\n\nOur customers include offshore service providers, major oil and gas companies, renewable energy companies, underwater construction companies, law enforcement agencies, ports, mining companies, defense bodies (such as navies), prime defense contractors, research institutes and universities and diving companies.\n\nThe Services Business has operations in the USA and UK. Its central business model is working with the prime defense contractors to design and manufacture sub-assemblies for utilization into larger defense mission critical integrated systems (“MCIS”). Examples of such MCIS are the US Close-In-Weapons Support (CIWS) Program for the Phalanx radar-guided cannon used on combat ships and the AN/AQS24 Mine Hunting System Program, both of these being programs of record. These proprietary sub-assemblies, once approved within the MCIS program, afford the Services Business the status of preferred supplier. Such status permits it to supply these sub-assemblies and upgrades in the event of obsolescence or advancement of technology for the life of the MCIS program. Clients include prime defense contractors such as Raytheon, Northrop Grumman, Thales Underwater and BAE Systems. The scope of services provided by the Services Business for the subassemblies they supply extends to concept, design, prototype, contract manufacturing and post-sale support.\n\n**_Key Pillars for our Growth Plans_**\n\nOur volumetric real time imaging sonar technology, Echoscope PIPE®, and DAVD are the most promising products for the Company’s near-term growth. We are widely regarded as the leading solution providers for underwater real time 3D visualization.\n\nOur real time 4D/5D/6D Imaging sonars are the only underwater imaging sonars which are capable of providing complex seabed mapping, real time inspection and monitoring and providing 4D/5D/6D data of moving underwater objects irrespective of water conditions including in zero visibility (which is a common and costly problem in underwater operations). Competing products such as the multibeam sonar can perform mapping (but not complex mapping) without the ability to perform real time inspection and monitoring of moving objects underwater. We also believe our Echoscope PIPE® is the only technology that can generate multiple real time 4D/5D/6D acoustic images using different acoustic parameters such as frequency, field of view, pulse length, filters and different beamforming modes allowing users to increase the efficiency of their operations.\n\nWe also believe that the DAVD system is poised to radically change the way diving operations are performed globally by providing a fully integrated suite of sensor data shared in real time by the dive supervisor on the surface and the diver. Current diving is done largely by voice command missions from the topside using disparate suite of systems for video data, communications, and positioning. The DAVD technology changes this and offers the market an integrated suite of sensors providing real time mission critical information to both the diver and the dive supervisor on the surface and also allow both of them to visualize the same underwater scene.\n\nThe DAVD tethered variant is now in early-stage adoption by different teams within the US Navy. The DAVD which is included on the Approved Navy Use (“ANU”) list is a standard item available for purchase within the Navy community and some of these commands are now requesting this solution for their operations. We have also started realizing sales of the DAVD in the offshore commercial market and have sold our first DAVD tethered system to a significant offshore service provider in Asia.\n\nThe DAVD untethered variant (“DUS”) is going through evaluation, and we are contracted under a program designed to “harden” the technology for fast adoption by special forces (“DAVD Hardening Program”). Under the DAVD Hardening Program, since fiscal year 2023, we have received $1.25 million in funding and, have supplied eight DUS systems which are currently used by the Program Sponsor for ongoing field evaluation. We have also continued to provide feature upgrades under this DAVD Hardening Program. We are expecting to receive another $700,000 in funding under the ongoing Hardening Program. Funding is currently delayed due to the upcoming Presidential Elections which have impacted funding under many defense programs. This is not unusual during a Presidential election year. The DUS system represents our most significant market opportunity for the DAVD technology, and we continue to advance the technology based on customer feedback. We continue to receive positive feedback on the DUS from the ongoing field trials by this user community and will reach a significant milestone in the DAVD Hardening Program later this year when we deliver the newly designed optical engines and HUD designed for face masks used by the special forces.\n\nThe concept of utilizing a pair of transparent glasses in the HUD underwater, is protected by patent. All component parts of the DAVD system are proprietary to the Company and include overall systems designs, software (4G USE® DAVD Edition), Diver Processing Pack – telemetry system (DPP), Top Side Controller and real time 3D Sonar. The Company benefits from the exclusive license from the United States Department of the Navy at Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City Division to exploit the utility patent covering the concept of using the pair of transparent glasses as a data hub underwater. The DAVD is an “Approved Navy Use” item and benefits from CE Marking required under UK and European Union safety regulations.\n\nBoth the Marine Technology Business and Engineering Business have established synergies in terms of customers and specialized engineering skill sets (hardware, firmware and software) encompassing capturing, computing, processing and displaying data in harsh environments. Both businesses jointly bid for projects for which their common joint skills provide competitive advantage and make them eligible for such projects.\n\n**Factors Affecting our Business in the Current Quarter**\n\nThe following is a brief summary of the most critical factors that affect our business. For a more detailed discussion of these and additional factors, refer to our Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2023.\n\n24  \n---  \n  \n**_Inflation_**\n\nInflation measured as the Consumer Price Index has been significant and volatile in the countries in which we operate. Recent trends indicate that inflation is falling. For the 12-month period preceding July 2024, this was:\n\n➢ | Denmark 1.1% - source: Statistics Denmark,  \n---|---  \n➢ | UK 3.1% - source: Office of National Statistics; and  \n➢ | USA 2.9% - source: U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.  \n  \nAlthough inflation is falling, prices which have increased due to inflation over the last year including cost of material and wages have remained at their inflationary-inspired level and have become the base price.\n\nInflation affects our business in a number of areas including increasing our cost of operations and materials and therefore our overall financial results. See “Inflation and Foreign Currency” section of this Form 10-Q.\n\n**_Interest Rates_**\n\nThe change in monetary policy vis-à-vis interest rates has in general affected some of our key sectors such as offshore renewables and underwater construction. The increase in interest rates has impacted on the viability of a number of underwater projects resulting in increased operational costs, which in turn has reduced the demand for our underwater solutions.\n\n**_Geopolitical tensions_**\n\nThe ongoing war in Ukraine impacts our Services Business as most defense spending is now directed toward land-based applications rather than naval based applications. In addition, the ongoing political tension with China reduces demand for our product in in that country where we understand from our agent network that there is a “Buy-China” policy in place. Furthermore, the ongoing addition of Chinese Suppliers on the US Bureau of Industry and Security (“BIS”) list may affect supply of components which are relevant for our products, making these obsolete and subject to significant re-engineering costs.\n\n**_Currency Fluctuations_**\n\nThe Company has operations in the UK, USA and Denmark. Our consolidated results include the Company’s foreign subsidiaries’ results which are transacted in their native functional currency and translated into USD for reporting purposes. Unfavorable currency fluctuations may adversely affect our financial results. Revenue and expenses are translated using the average exchange rates in effect during the reporting period. In the Current Quarter, for the purpose of reporting revenue and expenses, the value of the British Pound when compared to the Previous Quarter increased against the USD by 0.7% and the Danish Kroner decreased by 0.8%, respectively. For the purpose of reporting assets and liabilities, the British Pound and the Danish Kroner both increased by 5.8% and 2.4% respectively. The impact of currency fluctuations is discussed more fully below under Item 2 - “Inflation and Foreign Currency”. See also Note 5 (Foreign Currency Translation) to the unaudited consolidated financial statements.\n\n**_Skills/Resource Shortages and Pressure on Salaries and Wages_**\n\nWe are experiencing skill shortages in areas that are critical to our growth strategy including experienced sales and marketing personnel, software developers, skilled electronic engineers and production technicians and various management positions.\n\n**_Concentration of Business Opportunities Where the Sales Cycle is Long and Unpredictable_**\n\nThe Services Business revenues are highly concentrated and are mainly generated from sub-contracts with prime defense contractors. The sales cycle is generally protracted, and this may affect quarterly revenues. It is also dependent on the federal government approving and appropriating budget for defense projects and where the federal government is unable to find consensus in the US Congress, this affects the timely award of sub-contract from the prime defense contractors to our Services Business, which is reliant on these awards. Furthermore, the Products Business key opportunities which are critical to its growth strategy are in the Defense Market for both its imaging sonars and the DAVD, both of which are key pillars of the Company’s growth strategy. Due to the protracted nature of the government procurement process and cycle for defense spending under federal and/or state budgets, the sales cycle can be long and unpredictable, thus affecting timing of orders and thus quarterly revenues.\n\n**_Limitations caused by the use of Continuing Resolutions to authorize ongoing spending under Defense Programs_**\n\nYear to date, we have been affected by funding delays under Defense Programs in the USA including the DAVD Hardening Program. The upcoming Presidential election has resulted in funding gaps and slow down in procurement under Defense Programs. This is not unusual and generally the convention is to postpone new acquisitions until the outcome of the election is decided. This has adversely impacted on order intake and sales emanating from the Americas. As a result, we believe that this has impacted on our year to date sales in the Americas which was $4,688,741 compared to $7,315,039 in the previous year to date period. See Note 13 (Disaggregation of Revenue) for more information on this impact on our Business.\n\n**_Impact on Revenues and Earnings_**\n\nWe are uncertain as to the extent of the impact the factors disclosed above and in our Form 10-K covering fiscal year ended October 31, 2023 and those disclosed in our Form 10-Qs for the first and second quarters of this fiscal year, are likely to have on our future financial results.\n\n25  \n---  \n  \n**_Impact on Liquidity, Balance Sheet and Assets_**\n\nThese factors may adversely impact on our availability of free cash flow, working capital and business prospects. As of July 31, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of $25,217,965 and cash provided by operating activities was $458,013 in the nine months to July 31, 2024. Based on our outstanding obligations and our cash balances, we believe we have sufficient working capital to effectively continue our business operations for the foreseeable future.\n\n**Critical Accounting Policies**\n\nThis discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements that have been prepared under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”). The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported values of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported levels of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates.\n\nBelow is a discussion of accounting policies that we consider critical to an understanding of our financial condition and operating results and that may require complex judgment in their application or require estimates about matters which are inherently uncertain. A discussion of our significant accounting policies, including further discussion of the accounting policies described below, can be found in Note 2, “Summary of Accounting Policies” of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2023.\n\n_Revenue Recognition_\n\nOur revenues are earned under formal contracts with our customers and are derived from both sales and rental of underwater solutions for imaging, mapping, defense, survey and diving applications and from the engineering services that we provide. Our contracts do not include the possibility for additional contingent consideration so that our determination of the contract price does not involve having to consider potential variable additional consideration. Our product sales do not include a right of return by the customer.\n\nRegarding our Products Business, all our products are sold on a stand-alone basis and those market prices are evidence of the value of the products. To the extent that we also provide services (e.g., installation, training, etc.), those services are either included as part of the product or are subject to written contracts based on the stand-alone value of those services. Revenue from the sale of services is recognized when those services have been provided to the customer and evidence of the delivery of those services exists.\n\nFor further discussion of our revenue recognition accounting policies, refer to Note 2 – “Revenue Recognition” in these unaudited consolidated financial statements and Note 2 “Summary of Accounting Policies” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2023.\n\n_Recoverability of Deferred Costs_\n\nIn respect of our Services Segment, we defer costs on projects for service revenue. Deferred costs consist primarily of direct and incremental costs to customize and install systems, as defined in individual customer contracts, including costs to acquire hardware and software from third parties and payroll costs for our employees and other third parties.\n\nWe recognize such costs on a contract by contract basis in accordance with our revenue recognition policy. For revenue recognized under the completed contract method, costs are deferred until the products are delivered, or upon completion of services or, where applicable, customer acceptance. For revenue recognized under the percentage of completion method, costs are recognized as products are delivered or services are provided in accordance with the percentage of completion calculation. For revenue recognized ratably over the term of the contract, costs are also recognized ratably over the term of the contract, commencing on the date of revenue recognition. At each balance sheet date, we review deferred costs, to ensure they are ultimately recoverable. Any anticipated losses on uncompleted contracts are recognized when evidence indicates the estimated total cost of a contract exceeds its estimated total revenue.\n\n26  \n---  \n  \n_Income Taxes_\n\nThe Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification 740, Income Taxes (ASC 740). Under ASC 740, deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recorded for the income tax effects of differences between the bases of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and their bases for income tax reporting. The Company’s differences arise principally from the use of various accelerated and modified accelerated cost recovery systems for income tax purposes versus straight line depreciation used for book purposes; the restricted stock awards differences between stock award price at the date of award and the fair value price at the date of issuance and from the utilization of net operating loss carry-forwards.\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are the amounts by which the Company’s future income taxes are expected to be impacted by these differences as they reverse. Deferred tax assets are based on differences that are expected to decrease future income taxes as they reverse. Correspondingly, deferred tax liabilities are based on differences that are expected to increase future income taxes as they reverse.\n\nFor income tax purposes, the Company uses the percentage of completion method of recognizing revenues on long-term contracts which is consistent with the Company’s financial reporting under GAAP.\n\n_Intangible Assets_\n\nIntangible assets consist principally of the excess of cost over the fair value of net assets acquired (or goodwill) and customer relationships. Goodwill was allocated to our reporting units based on the original purchase price allocation. Goodwill is not amortized and is evaluated for impairment annually or more often if circumstances indicate impairment may exist. Customer relationships are being amortized on a straight-line basis over periods of 2 to 15 years. The Company amortizes its limited lived intangible assets using the straight-line method over their estimated period of benefit. Annually, or sooner if there is indication of a loss in value, we evaluate the recoverability of intangible assets and consider events or circumstances that warrant revised estimates of useful lives or that indicate that impairment exists. There were no impairment charges during the periods presented.\n\nThe first step of the goodwill impairment test, used to identify potential impairment, compares the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the fair value, which is based on future cash flows, exceeds the carrying amount, goodwill is not considered impaired. If the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, goodwill is reduced by the excess of the carrying amount of the reporting unit over that reporting unit’s fair value. Goodwill can never be reduced below zero. At the end of each year, we evaluate goodwill on a separate reporting unit basis to assess recoverability, and impairments, if any, are recognized in earnings.\n\n**Consolidated Results of Operations**\n\nOur consolidated financial results include the results of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries (UK and Danish operations). Foreign subsidiaries’ results are translated from their functional currencies into USD for reporting purposes. Fluctuations in currency can therefore impact our translated results, including revenue and income. Revenue and expenses are translated using the average exchange rates in effect during the reporting period. During the Current Quarter, the British Pound strengthened against the USD when compared to the Previous Quarter exchange rate (“the Constant Rate”); whereas the Danish Kroner slightly weakened against the USD. During the Current Quarter our total consolidated revenue was $5,476,544 compared to $4,890,532, in the Previous Quarter. The impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuation between the Previous Quarter and our Current Quarter was negligible. During the Current Quarter total operating expense increased by $155,154 or 6.2%. Income from operations increased by 61.2%. Income before taxes increased by 51.4% and was $1,631,246 compared to $1,077,166 in the Previous Quarter. Further details concerning our financial results in the Current Quarter and the Current Nine Month Period are discussed immediately below.\n\n**Segment Summary**\n\n**_Products Business_**\n\nIn the Current Quarter, the Products Business generated $3,048,544 or 55.7% of our consolidated revenues compared to $2,863,251 or 58.5% in the Previous Quarter, representing an increase of 6.5%. Gross profit margin increased from 82.1% in the Previous Quarter to 82.9% in the Current Quarter. In the Current Quarter we recorded sales commissions for this segment of $99,278 compared to $120,724 in the Previous Quarter, representing a decrease of 17.8%. In the Current Quarter total operating expenses increased by 7.3% in the Products Business and were $1,545,374 compared to $1,439,923 in the Previous Quarter. Income before tax was $1,154,300 in the Current Quarter compared to $1,091,700 in the Previous Quarter. Notable in the Current Quarter, sales generated by the Products Business from the USA decreased from $1,321,495 in the Previous Quarter to $682,477. We believe this is a result of the upcoming Presidential Election which has seen funding gaps and slowdown in procurement under Defense Programs (and which has affected programs such as DAVD). This is not unusual and generally the convention is to postpone new acquisitions until the outcome of the election is decided.\n\n**_Services Business_**\n\nIn the Current Quarter, the Services Business generated $2,428,000 or 44.3% of our consolidated revenues compared to $2,027,281 or 41.5% in the Previous Quarter, representing an increase in sales of 19.8%. Gross profit margin increased from 50.0% in the Previous Quarter to 62.6% in the Current Quarter. This level of gross profit margin for the Services Business is atypical and has arisen because we utilized, against one of our engineering projects, inventory items which were in our stock at a much lower cost than market value. In the Current Quarter total operating expenses decreased by 4.2% in the Services Business and were $535,421 compared to $558,739 in the Previous Quarter and income before tax was $1,030,488 compared to $489,414 in the Previous Quarter. This Business is reliant on funding from Defense Programs.\n\n27  \n---  \n  \n**Results of Operations for the Current Quarter compared to the Previous Quarter**\n\n**_Revenue_** : Total consolidated revenues for the Current Quarter and the Previous Quarter were $5,476,544 and $4,890,532 respectively, representing an increase of 12.0%. In the Current Quarter, both the Products Business and the Services Business revenues increased over the Previous Quarter.\n\n**_Gross Profit Margins_** _:_ Consolidated margin percentage was stronger in the Current Quarter at 73.9% (gross profit of $4,048,538) compared to 68.8% (gross profit of $3,365,224) in the Previous Quarter.\n\nGross profit margins reported in our financial results may vary according to several factors. These include:\n\n● | The percentage of consolidated sales attributed to the Marine Technology Business versus the Services Business. The gross profit margin yielded by the Marine Technology Business is generally higher than that of the Services Business.  \n---|---  \n● | The percentage of consolidated sales attributed to the Services Business. The Services Business yields a lower gross profit margin on generated sales which are largely based on time and materials for our Department of Defense contracts (DoD subcontracts).   \n● | The mix of sales within the Marine Technology Business during the reporting period:  \n● | Outright Sale versus Rentals.  \n---|---  \n● | Hardware Sale versus Software, software is generally higher margin.  \n● | Mix of Services rendered in the period – offshore engineering services versus paid customer research and development projects.  \n● | Level of commissions on products which may vary according to volume. Both the Services and Marine Technology Businesses work with sales/distribution agents. Most of the Marine Technology Business sales in Asia are completed via agents or distributors. See Note 3 “Cost of Goods Sold” for more discussion on this.  \n---|---  \n● | Level of Rental Assets in the Marine Technology Business’ Rental Pool and therefore the depreciation expenses may vary accordingly.  \n● | The mix of engineering projects performed by our Services Business (Design and prototyping versus manufacturing), may also affect gross profit margins.  \n  \nIn the Current Quarter, gross profit margins for the Marine Technology Business were 82.9% compared to 82.1% in the Previous Quarter. For the Services Business these were 62.6% in the Current Quarter compared to 50.0% in the Previous Quarter. This level of gross profit margin for the Services Business is atypical and has arisen because we utilized, against one of our engineering projects, inventory items which were in our stock at a much lower cost than market value.\n\nNotable factors contributing to the higher gross profit margins include the significant increase in our rental and associated services revenue by the Products Business and the Service Business realizing higher gross margins for the reasons earlier discussed.\n\nSince there are more variable factors affecting gross profit margins in the Marine Technology Business (Products Business), a table showing a summary of break-out of sales generated by this business in the Current Quarter compared to the Previous Quarter is set out below:\n\nJuly 31, 2024 | July 31, 2023 | Percentage  \n---|---|---  \nDescription | Products | Products | Change  \nEquipment Sales | $| 1,349,011 | $| 2,143,203 | (37.1| )%  \nEquipment Rental | 805,259 | 303,525 | 165.3| %  \nSoftware Sales | 251,488 | 147,453 | 70.6| %  \nServices | 642,786 | 269,070 | 138.9| %  \nTotal Net Sales | $| 3,048,544 | $| 2,863,251 | 6.5| %  \n  \nThe decrease in Equipment Sales in the Current Quarter reflects the reduction in orders and sales emanating from the Americas caused by the funding gaps on Defense Programs described earlier. This has affected programs like the DAVD, resulting in reduced orders and sales for this segment in the Americas, which in the Current Quarter was $682,477 compared to $1,321,495 in the Previous Quarter.\n\nIn the Current Quarter the Marine Technology Business incurred commission costs of $99,278 compared to $120,724 in the Previous Quarter, representing a decrease of 17.8%.\n\nIn the Current Quarter depreciation expenses relating to our rental assets increased by 17.0% and were $105,337 compared to $90,003 in the Previous Quarter.\n\nThe main factors impacting the Gross Profit Margin of the Marine Technology Business in the Current Quarter are the reduction in equipment sale in conjunction with a significant increase in rental revenue and associated services (engineering support for rental projects), services and software sales.\n\nFurther information on the performance of each business segment including revenues by type and geography can be found in Notes 12 and Note 13 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements for the Current and Previous Quarter.\n\n**_Research and Development (R &D)_**: R&D expenditures in the Current Quarter were $496,359 compared to $568,287 in the Previous Quarter, representing a decrease of 12.7%.\n\n● | _Products Segment_  \n---|---  \n  \nDuring the Current Quarter the Products Business R&D expenditure decreased by 17.5% and was $459,879 as compared to $557,260 in the Previous Quarter. R&D expenditure is incurred by this business in connection with investments it makes in developing its products and solutions. This expenditure is an essential part of our business, as our market competitiveness is predicated on continued innovation.\n\n● | _Services Segment._  \n---|---  \n  \nDuring the Current Quarter the Services Business R&D expenditure increased by 230.8% and was $36,480 compared to $11,027 in the Previous Quarter. The Services Business incurs research and development expenses primarily on advancing its Thermite® Octal range of mission computer products with the strategic goals of increasing and diversifying its revenues and improving gross profit margins. As we understand our customer base requirements for these mission computers, we may incur more R&D expenditure on developing this range of products.\n\nPercentage  \n---  \nSegment | July 31, 2024 | July 31, 2023 | Change  \nProducts Segment R&D Expenditures | $| 459,879 | $| 557,260 | (17.5| )%  \nServices Segment R&D Expenditures | $| 36,480 | $| 11,027 | 230.8| %  \n  \n28  \n---  \n  \n**_Selling, General and Administrative Expenses (SG &A)_:** SG&A expenses for the Current Quarter increased by 11.7% to $2,161,405 from $1,934,323 in the Previous Quarter.\n\nSG&A includes transactions which are cash charges and non-cash charges. The non-cash charges transactions comprise depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation, and exchange rate variance charges. In the Current Quarter non-cash transactions as a percentage of SG&A expenses were 15.0 % compared to 17.2% in the Previous Quarter.\n\nThe main reason for the increase in our SG&A expenses in the Current Quarter when compared to the Previous Quarter is the increase in Wages and Salaries (by 5.5%), Marketing Costs (by 180.2%) and General Office Costs which increased by 47.8%.\n\n_Key Areas of SG &A Expenditure across the Company for the Current Quarter compared to the Previous Quarter are:_\n\nJuly 31, | July 31, | Percentage  \n---|---|---  \nExpenditure | 2024 | 2023 | Change  \nWages and Salaries | $| 909,504 | $| 862,493 | 5.5| %  \nLegal and Professional Fees (including accounting and audit) | $| 352,671 | $| 359,285 | (1.8| )%  \nMarketing | $| 131,690 | $| 47,002 | 180.2| %  \n  \n_Wages and Salaries_ – In the Current Quarter this category of expense increased by 5.5%. We anticipate that on a full year basis in the fiscal year 2024 this category will increase materially over the fiscal year 2023. We are currently operating on a reduced headcount and have several vacancies and are also expanding our management team.\n\n_Legal and Professional_ fees decreased and reflect the timing of services performed. On a full year basis, we anticipate this category of expenditures will largely be in line with the Previous Year.\n\n_Marketing_ – In the Current Quarter this category of expense increased by 180.2%. The increase is anticipated within our plans. We anticipate this area of expenditure will increase materially in this fiscal year and subsequent years. As we shift our focus from R&D to business development and marketing, including undertaking efforts to build our brands, we anticipate a significant increase in this area of expenditure. In the Current Quarter, the increased costs are largely a reflection of the fees associated with hiring our Business Development Focus Group Consultants in the USA to assist the Company with developing its Defense Market strategy and identifying opportunities for the Company’s technology within US Defense Programs. On a full fiscal year basis, the cost of this service will be $222,000 excluding travel expenses.\n\n**_Overhead related costs as a percentage of revenue for Current Quarter, compared to the Previous Quarter_**\n\nGeneral corporate administrative expenses in the Current Quarter were $576,969 or 10.5% of revenue and $503,948 or 10.3% of revenue in the Previous Quarter, respectively. For more information on general corporate administrative expenses, please see Note 12 (Segment Analysis).\n\n**_Operating Income_** : In the Current Quarter operating income increased by 61.2% and was $1,390,774 as compared to $862,614 in the Previous Quarter. The increase in operating income is attributed to the increase in revenue and gross profit. Gross Profit was exceptionally higher in the Services Segment because we utilized against one of our engineering projects inventory items which were in stock at a much lower cost than the market value.\n\n**_Other Income_** : In the Current Quarter, we had “total other income” of $240,472 compared to $214,552 in the Previous Quarter, representing an increase of 12.1%. In the Current Quarter we had $230,009 interest income earned on our certified deposit accounts. These accounts are for fixed 3-month rolling periods and constitute “cash equivalents” in our current unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements for the period ended July 31, 2024 (see Note 6 Composition of Certain Financial Statement Captions) for more detailed analysis of this. We anticipate that the interest earned on these certified deposit accounts will remain to be material in the future if we continue to hold this level of cash and interest rates remain at this level.\n\n**_Income before income taxes_** : In the Current Quarter, we had income before income taxes of $1,631,246 as compared to $1,077,166 in the Previous Quarter, representing an increase of 51.4%. Income before income taxes largely increased due to an increase in revenue and gross profit in the Current Quarter.\n\n29  \n---  \n  \n**_Net Income:_** In the Current Quarter we had Net Income of $1,274,658 compared to $1,038,780 in the Previous Quarter, representing an increase of 22.7%. Net Income increased in the Current Quarter over the Previous Quarter as a result of the increase in “Income before taxes” for the reasons explained above. However, in the Current Quarter our provision for tax liability was higher than in the Previous Quarter. In general, our tax liability included in our consolidated financial results will depend on the composition of our consolidated income or loss. In particular, the percentage of income or loss attributed to the Company and its US entities, and the percentage of income or loss attributed to its foreign subsidiaries. In the Current and Previous Quarter, we recorded Current Tax Expense of $325,625 (which include an amount of $26,668 relating to adjustments for fiscal year 2023) and $68,771, respectively, representing an increase of 373.5%. We also recorded a Deferred Tax Expense of $30,963 in the Current Quarter compared to a Deferred Tax Benefit of $30,385 in the Previous Quarter. In the Current Quarter the Company’s UK subsidiaries generated a taxable income but have carryforward losses and R&D tax credits which will be used to defray tax liability for these subsidiaries and therefore no provision for tax liability has been made in our consolidated results for the UK subsidiaries in the Current Quarter. The Company’s Danish subsidiary generated a taxable income in the Current Quarter, resulting in a tax provision of 22.0% in our consolidated results. We also made a further provision for Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income of $74,000.\n\n**_Comprehensive Income_** _._ In the Current Quarter comprehensive income was $1,668,038 compared to $1,431,263 for the Previous Quarter reflecting adjustments resulting from foreign currency translations. This category is affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange transactions both relating to our profit and loss expenses and valuation of our assets and liabilities on our balance sheet. A significant part of the Company’s operations is based in the UK and Denmark, and therefore a major part of the Company’s assets and liabilities recorded in its consolidated balance sheet and financial transactions are translated from the functional currencies of these subsidiaries into USD for reporting purposes. In the Current Quarter, for the purpose of reporting revenue and expenses, the value of the British Pound when compared to the Previous Quarter increased against the USD by 0.7% and the Danish Kroner decreased by 0.8%, respectively. For the purpose of reporting asset and liabilities, the value of British Pound and the Danish Kroner both increased against the USD by 5.8% and 2.4% respectively. Therefore, in the Current Quarter there was a gain of $393,380 on foreign currency translation adjustment transactions compared to $392,483 in the Previous Quarter. See the section below which concerns “Inflation & Foreign Currency” which shows the impact of the currency adjustments on our Income Statement and Balance Sheet in the Current Quarter compared to the Previous Quarter.\n\n**Results of Operations for the Current Nine Month Period compared to the Previous Nine Month Period**\n\n**_Revenue_** : Total consolidated revenues for the Current Nine Month Period and the Previous Nine Month Period were $15,260,913 and $15,788,325 respectively, representing a decrease of 3.3%. In the Current Nine Month Period, the Marine Technology Business revenues were $10,116,024 or 66.3% of our total consolidated revenue compared to $10,270,839 or 65.1% of our total consolidated revenue, representing a reduction of 1.5% when compared to the Previous Nine Month Period. The Services Business revenues in the Current Nine Month Period and the Previous Nine Month Period were $5,144,889 or 33.7% of our total consolidated revenue and $5,517,486 or 34.9% of our total consolidated revenue, representing a decrease of 6.8%. The decrease in our consolidated revenue in the Current Nine Month Period is largely due to the sharp fall in revenue from the Americas which was $4,688,741 in the Current Nine Month Period compared to $7,315,039 in the Previous Nine Month Period, representing a decrease of 35.9%. We believe this is a result of the upcoming Presidential Election which has seen funding gaps and slowdown in procurement under Defense Programs. This is not unusual in a Presidential Election year and generally the convention is to postpone new acquisitions until the outcome of the election is decided.\n\n**_Gross Profit Margins_** _:_ Consolidated margin percentage was higher in the Current Nine Month Period at 71.3% (gross profit of $10,873,708) compared to 68.0% (gross profit of $10,741,470). The main factors which have resulted in the higher margins in the Current Nine Month Period are attributable to our Marine Technology Business which realized an increase in rental revenue and associated engineering support services and incurred lower commission costs. In the Current Nine Month Period gross profit margins for the Marine Technology Business were 78.3% compared to 76.0% in the Previous Nine Month Period. In addition, the Services Business had stronger margin on sales due to a combination of factors including a sale of approximately $100,000 which utilized inventory items which were in our stock at a much lower cost than market value.\n\nGross profit margins reported in our financial results may vary according to several factors. These include:\n\n● | The percentage of consolidated sales attributable to the Marine Technology Business versus the Services Business. The gross profit margin yielded by the Marine Technology Business is generally higher than that of the Services Business.  \n---|---  \n● | The percentage of consolidated sales attributed to the Services Business. The Services Business yields a lower gross profit margin on generated sales which are largely based on time and materials for our Department of Defense contracts (DoD subcontracts).   \n● | The mix of engineering projects contracted and performed by our Services Business: Design prototyping versus Contract Manufacturing services during the reporting period, may also affect Gross Profit Margins.  \n● | The mix of sales within the Marine Technology Business during the reporting period:  \n● | Outright Sales versus Rentals.  \n---|---  \n● | Hardware Sales versus Software (software is generally higher margin).  \n● | Mix of Services rendered in the period – offshore services (such as mobilization and training support versus paid customer research and development projects relating to customization of our technology for their application).  \n● | Level of commissions on products which may vary according to volume. Both the Services and Marine Technology Businesses work with sales/distribution agents. Most of the Marine Technology Business sales in Asia is conducted via agents or distributors. See Note 3 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements “Cost of Revenue” for more discussion on this.  \n---|---  \n● | Level of Rental Assets in the Marine Technology Business’ Rental Pool and therefore the depreciation expenses may vary accordingly.  \n  \n30  \n---  \n  \n**Services Business**\n\nGross Profit Margins for the Services Business were higher at 57.3% in the Current Nine Month Period compared to 53.1% in the Previous Nine Month Period. This is largely due to the types of engineering projects that are ongoing in the reporting period (contract manufacturing versus design and development work scopes), the former yielding a higher margin profile and exceptionally year to date our revenue includes $100,000 of sales which utilized inventory items which were in our stock at a much lower cost than market value.\n\n**Marine Technology Business**\n\nIn the Current Nine Month Period gross profit margins for the Marine Technology Business were 78.3% compared to 76.0% in the Previous Nine Month Period. The strengthening is largely because of the composition of our sales in conjunction with a reduction in commission costs incurred. In the Current Nine Month Period there were more units of rental and associated engineering support sale (field engineers supporting ongoing customer projects) combined with a significant reduction in commission costs incurred and which were $523,670 in the Current Nine Month Period compared to $696,260 in the Previous Nine Month Period, representing a decrease of 24.8%. A significant percentage of our sales in foreign territories such as South Korea, Japan, China and South Africa are conducted through our sales agents and distributors. In general, gross profit margins are lower on our units of hardware sale than on software, rentals with associated services and technology customization services.\n\nSince there are more variable factors affecting gross profit margins in the Marine Technology Business, a breakdown of sales for this business in the Current Nine Month Period is set out below:\n\nJuly 31, 2024 | July 31, 2023 | Percentage  \n---|---|---  \nDescription | Products | Products | Change  \nEquipment Sales | $| 5,730,411 | $| 7,215,919 | (20.6| )%  \nEquipment Rental | 1,885,732 | 1,088,855 | 73.2| %  \nSoftware Sales | 653,759 | 784,046 | (16.6| )%  \nServices | 1,846,122 | 1,182,019 | 56.2| %  \nTotal Net Sales | $| 10,116,024 | $| 10,270,839 | (1.5| )%  \n  \nThe decrease in Equipment Sales in the Current Nine Month Period is largely due to the sharp fall in revenue from the Americas which was $1,660,492 in the Current Nine Month Period compared to $3,562,038 in the Previous Nine Month Period, representing a decrease of 53.4%. We believe this is a result of the upcoming Presidential Election which has seen funding gaps and slowdown in procurement under Defense Programs (which has affected acquisition programs like the DAVD). This is not unusual and generally the convention is to postpone new acquisitions until the outcome of the election is decided.\n\nIn the Current Nine Month Period Depreciation expense relating to our rental assets increased by 11.0% and was $292,590 compared to $263,705 in the Previous Nine Month Period.\n\nFurther information on the performance of each Segment including revenues by product and geography can be found in Notes 12 and 13 (Segment Analysis and Disaggregation of Revenue) to the unaudited consolidated financial statements.\n\n**_Research and Development (R &D)_**: R&D expenditures in the Current Nine Month Period were $1,524,817 compared to the $1,538,684 in the Previous Nine Month Period, representing a decrease of 0.9%.\n\n● | **_Services Business_**  \n---|---  \n  \nDuring the Current Nine Month Period, the Services Business R&D expenditure increased by $93,791 or 379.6% from $24,711 in the Previous Nine Month Period to $118,502 in the Current Nine Month Period. R&D expenditure is primarily incurred by the Services Business on its Thermite® range of mission computers and other developments which the business deem will advance its business strategy. The Thermite® product line remains important to the Services Business for growth and diversification of revenue. As we understand our customer base requirements for the Thermite® mission computers, we may incur more R&D expenditure on developing this range of products.\n\n● | **_Marine Technology Business_**  \n---|---  \n  \nDuring the Current Nine Month Period R&D expenditure in the Marine Technology Business decreased by $107,658 or 7.1% from $1,513,973 in the Previous Nine Month Period to $1,406,315. R&D expenditure is incurred by this business in connection with investments in developing its products and solutions. This expenditure is an essential part of our business, as our market competitiveness is predicated on continued innovation.\n\nPercentage  \n---  \nSegment | July 31, 2024 | July 31, 2023 | Change  \nProducts Segment R&D Expenditures | $| 1,406,315 | $| 1,513,973 | (7.1| )%  \nServices Segment R&D Expenditures | $| 118,502 | $| 24,711 | 379.6| %  \n  \n31  \n---  \n  \n**_Selling, General and Administrative Expenses (SG &A)_:** SG&A expenses for the Current Nine Month Period decreased by 1.4% and were $6,052,350 compared to $6,138,968 in the Previous Nine Month Period.\n\nThe modest decrease in SG&A in the Current Nine Month Period is largely attributed to the significant fall in stock compensation expense; most of the other areas of expenditure within this category have increased when compared to the Previous Nine Months including general office costs which have increased by 49.0%.\n\nSG&A includes transactions which are cash charges and non-cash charges. The non-cash charges transactions comprise depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation charges and exchange rate variance. In the Current Nine Month Period non-cash transactions as a percentage of SG&A were 10.5% compared to 19.0% in the Previous Nine Month Period. In the Current Nine Month Period there was notably a significant reduction in stock based compensation charges which were $86,843 in the Current Nine Month Period compared to $488,764 in the Previous Nine Month Period. Exchange rate variance on transactions in the Current Nine Month Period was $182,626 compared to $341,317 in the Previous Nine Month Period.\n\n_Key Areas of SG &A Expenditure across the Group for the Current Nine Month Period compared to the Previous Nine Month Period are:_\n\nJuly 31, | July 31, | Percentage  \n---|---|---  \nExpenditure | 2024 | 2023 | Change  \nWages and Salaries | $| 2,748,812 | $| 2,617,304 | 5.0| %  \nLegal and Professional Fees (including accounting and audit) | $| 1,190,181 | $| 1,232,157 | (3.4| )%  \nMarketing | $| 317,778 | $| 149,262 | 112.9| %  \n  \nWages and salaries in the Current Nine Month Period increased by 5.0% over the Previous Nine Month Period which largely reflects inflationary conditions. We anticipate that on a full fiscal year basis this category will increase materially over the fiscal year 2023 expense. We are currently operating on a reduced headcount and have several vacancies and are also expanding our management team.\n\nThe decrease in the “Legal and Professional” category of expenditures in the Current Nine Month Period reflects the timing of services performed. On a full year basis, we anticipate this category of expenditures will be in line with the Previous Year.\n\nOur marketing comprises a range of activities which include trade shows in different parts of the world, particularly in Europe, North America, Asia and the Middle East. As we increase our efforts around sales & marketing, we anticipate this area of expenditure will increase. In the Current Nine Month Period, our marketing costs include fees associated with hiring our Business Development Focus Group Consultants in the USA which have been hired to assist with developing our Defense Market strategy and identifying opportunities for our technology within Defense Programs in the US. On a full fiscal year basis, the cost of this service will be $222,000 excluding expenses.\n\n**_Overhead related costs as a percentage of revenue for Current Nine Month Period, compared to the Previous Nine Month Period_**\n\nGeneral corporate administrative expenses in the Current Nine Month Period were $1,642,771 or 10.8% of revenue and $1,866,824 or 11.8% of revenue in the Previous Nine Month Period, respectively. For more information on general corporate administrative expenses, please see Note 12 (Segment Analysis).\n\n**_Operating Income_** : Our income from our operating activities in the Current Nine Month Period was $3,296,541 as compared to $3,063,818 in the Previous Nine Month Period, which represents an increase of 7.6%. This is due to the increase in our gross profit in conjunction with a modest decrease in our total operating expense in the Current Nine Month Period.\n\n**_Other Income_** : In the Current Nine Month Period, this increased by 88.0% and was $758,864 as compared to $403,693 in the Previous Nine Month Period. In the Current Nine Month Period $716,017 of our Other Income is attributed to interest earned on our 3-month rolling certified deposit accounts. See Note 6 (Composition of Certain Financial Statement Captions) for a more detailed analysis of this. We anticipate that the interest earned on these certified deposit accounts will be material in the future if we continue to hold this level of cash in these accounts and interest rates remain broadly the same or continue to rise.\n\n**_Net Income before income taxes_** : In the Current Nine Month Period, we had income before income taxes of $4,055,405 as compared to $3,467,511 in the Previous Nine Month Period, representing an increase of 17.0%. This is largely due to an increase in interest earned on our certified deposit account, which was $716,017 compared to $395,161 in the Previous Nine Month Period. For more information on this, please refer to Note 6 (Composition of Certain Financial Statement Captions) for more information on our certified deposits.\n\n32  \n---  \n  \n**_Net Income:_** In the Current Nine Month Period we had Net Income of $3,319,784 compared to $3,445,114 in the Previous Nine Month Period, representing a decrease of 3.6%. The decrease in Net Income is largely due to an increase in our tax liability. In the Current Nine Month Period we have provided for total tax expense of $735,621 compared to $22,397 in the Previous Nine Month Period. In general, our tax liability included in our consolidated financial results will depend on the composition of our consolidated income or loss. In particular, the percentage of income or loss attributed to the Company and its US entities, and the percentage of income or loss attributed to its foreign subsidiaries. In the Current Nine Month Period we recorded Current Tax Expense of $482,683 compared to $137,555, representing an increase of 250.9% when compared to the Previous Nine Month Period, and Deferred Tax Expense of $252,938 compared to a Tax Benefit of $115,158 in the Previous Nine Month Period. In the Current Nine Month Period the Company’s UK subsidiaries generated a taxable income but have carryforward losses and R&D tax credits which will be used to defray tax liability for these subsidiaries and therefore no provision for tax liability has been made in our consolidated results for the UK subsidiaries. The Company’s Danish subsidiary generated taxable income in the Current Nine Month Period resulting in a tax provision of 22.0% in our consolidated results. We also made provision for Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income of $247,000 for the Current Nine Month Period.\n\n**_Comprehensive Income (loss)_**_._ In the Current Nine Month Period Comprehensive Income was $4,305,061 compared to $5,983,620 for the Previous Nine Month Period reflecting significant adjustments resulting from foreign currency translations. This category is affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange transactions both relating to our profit and loss expenses and our assets and liabilities on our balance sheet and are largely paper losses or gains, as may be applicable in the reporting period. A significant part of the Company’s operations is based in the UK and Denmark, and therefore a significant part of our financial transactions is performed in British Pounds and Danish Kroner which are translated into USD for reporting purposes. In the Previous Nine Month Period we had a significant gain of $2,538,506 on foreign currency translation adjustment transactions compared to a lower gain on these transactions in the Current Nine Month Period of $985,277. In the Current Nine Month Period, for the purpose of reporting revenue and expenses, the value of the British Pound when compared to the Previous Nine Month Period increased by 2.4% against the USD and the Danish Kroner increased by 0.4%, respectively. For the purpose of reporting asset and liabilities, the British Pound and the Danish Kroner both increased by 5.8% and 2.4% respectively.\n\nSee Table 2 under the MD&A section which concerns “Inflation & Foreign Currency”, and which shows the impact of the currency adjustments on our Income Statement and Balance Sheet in the Current Nine Month Period compared to the Previous Nine Month Period.\n\n**Liquidity and Capital Resources**\n\nAs of July 31, 2024, the Company had an accumulated deficit of $7,732,703, working capital of $42,682,046, cash and cash equivalent of $25,217,965 and stockholders’ equity of $52,805,037. For the nine months ended July 31, 2024, the Company’s operating activities provided cash of $458,013.\n\nThe Company entered into a $4,000,000 revolving line of credit with HSBC NA on November 27, 2019, at prime. The outstanding balance on the line of credit was $0 as of July 31, 2024. This revolving credit line will expire on November 26, 2024, unless renewed.\n\n**Inflation and Foreign Currency**\n\nThe Company and its subsidiaries maintain their accounts in the native currencies of their operations, and which are:\n\nUS Dollars | For US Operations  \n---|---  \nBritish Pound | For United Kingdom Operations  \nDanish Kroner | For Danish Operations  \nAustralian Dollars | For Australian Operations (operations are currently dormant)  \nIndian Rupees | For Indian Operations (operations are currently dormant)  \n  \nThe Company’s consolidated financial results therefore include the translation of its subsidiaries functional currencies into U.S Dollar. See “Note 5 - Foreign Currency Translation” of our unaudited consolidated financial statements, for more information on the applicable rates used for our Balance Sheet transactions and Statement of Income and Comprehensive Income.\n\nThe Company’s consolidated results are a combination of its US and foreign operations and these companies maintain their accounts in the functional currencies of their jurisdictions, which are noted above. Fluctuations in currency exchange rates can directly impact on the Company’s sales, profitability and financial position when the transactions of the foreign subsidiaries are translated from their functional currencies into USD for financial reporting purposes. In addition, the Company is also subject to currency fluctuation risk with respect to certain foreign currency denominated receivables and payables incurred in the ordinary course of its business operations (cross-border transactions such as inventory purchasing). In general, the Company’s subsidiaries perform financial transactions in their native currencies. Occasionally a subsidiary may perform financial transactions in currencies other than its native or functional currency (purchasing inventory from a foreign supplier, for example, in foreign currency). Furthermore, the Company holds significant cash balances in foreign currencies, such as British Pound, Euro and Danish Kroner. The Company cannot predict the extent to which currency fluctuations may affect its business and financial position, and there is a risk that such fluctuations may have an adverse impact on the Company’s sales, profits and financial position.\n\n33  \n---  \n  \nThrough applying the Constant Rate to the Income Statement Transactions and the Balance Sheet Transactions, the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations can be evaluated. “Constant Rate” is defined as follows:\n\n“Revenue and Expenses (Income Statement Transactions) for the three months ended July 31, 2024” the Constant Rate is defined as the prevailing average exchange rate which was applied in the Previous Quarter.\n\n“Revenue and Expenses (Income Statement Transactions) for the nine months ended July 31, 2024” the Constant Rate is defined as the prevailing average exchange rate which was applied in the Previous Nine Month Period.\n\n“Balance Sheet Transaction” the Constant Rate is defined as this is the prevailing exchange rate as of October 31, 2023.\n\nInformation is not specified for INR as there is a limited scope of operations in this jurisdiction and therefore contributions are immaterial.

Controls and Procedures**\n\na) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\n\nDisclosure controls and procedures are controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”) are recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive and financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\n\nThe Company’s management, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Interim Chief Financial (and Principal Accounting) Officer, carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) as of July 31, 2024. Based upon that evaluation the Chief Executive Officer and Interim Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this report.\n\n(b) Changes in Internal Controls.\n\nThere was no change in our internal controls over financial reporting that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting during the reporting period covered by this report.\n\n34  \n---  \n  \n**PART II - OTHER INFORMATION**\n\n**Item 1. Legal Proceedings**\n\nFrom time to time, we may become involved in various lawsuits and legal proceedings which arise in the ordinary course of business. However, litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties, and an adverse result in these or other matters may arise from time to time that may harm our business. We are currently not aware of any such legal proceedings that we believe will have, individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or operating results.\n\n**Item 1A. Risks Factors**\n\nNot required for smaller reporting companies\n\n**Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds**\n\nDuring the three month period ended July 31, 2024, we issued 3,750 shares of common stock to a consultant for consulting services. Another 1,500 shares of common stock were due to be issued to this consultant in the said three month period but have not yet been issued. Total stock compensation expense related to these issuances was $33,548.\n\nThe offer, sale and issuance of the above-mentioned securities was exempt from registration under the Securities Act in reliance on Section 4(2) of the Securities Act, including Regulation D and Rule 506 promulgated thereunder, relative to transactions by an issuer not involving a public offering. All purchasers of securities in transactions exempt from registration pursuant to Regulation D represented to us that he is a accredited investor and acquired the shares for investment purposes only and not with a view to, or for sale in connection with, any distribution thereof and he could bear the risks of the investment and could hold the securities for an indefinite period of time.

(“Coda,” “the Company,” or “we”) operates two discrete operating business units. These are the Marine Technology Business (“Products Business,”\nor “Products Segment”) and the Marine Engineering Business (“Services Business,” “Engineering Business” or “Services Segment”).\nThe Marine Technology Business is an established supplier of underwater technologies and solutions to the underwater and diving markets. Its products and solutions include\nboth hardware and software for which it is the patent holder, innovator, developer, manufacturer and distributor. It has key proprietary 4D/5D/6D imaging sonar technology\nmarketed under the name of Echoscope® and Echoscope PIPE® and diving technology marketed under the name of CodaOctopus® DAVD (Diver Augmented Vision Display).\nWe believe that the Echoscope® sonar series is the only sonar that can generate multiple real time 3D images of moving objects underwater in zero visibility conditions. In\n2021, the Marine Technology Business started marketing the DAVD tethered system. The requirements for the DAVD solution emanated from the Office of Naval Research as\npart of its Future Naval Requirements Program. The DAVD embeds inside of the diver’s head-up display (HUD) a pair of transparent glasses which is used as the data hub for\ndisplaying real time data used for the diving mission to the diver. Amongst other things, it allows both the diver underwater and the dive supervisor on the surface to share the\nsame data or visualize the underwater scene. In addition, by combining the DAVD solution with the Echoscope®, dive operations can be performed in zero visibility conditions.\nThese conditions are a common barrier which impinges on the ability to perform these activities and therefore the DAVD solution combined with the Echoscope® is a real\nrequirement for these operations. In addition, in fiscal year 2023 we were contracted by the US Navy and an allied foreign navy to develop the untethered version of the DAVD\ntechnology, for the target market of special forces (referred to as “DAVD Hardening Program”). Under the DAVD Hardening Program, we supplied in fiscal year 2023 eight\nuntethered systems to these customers for their ongoing evaluation and have since been working on and supplying further hardening features for the DAVD untethered system\nwhich arise from the ongoing field evaluation by our customers under the DAVD Hardening Program.\nThe Engineering Business is an established sub-contractor to the prime defense contractors and generally supplies proprietary sub-assemblies for incorporation into broader\nmission critical defense systems. These sub-assemblies are typically supplied for the life of the program. The Marine Engineering Business’ scope of services for these defense\nprograms typically covers: “concept, design, prototype, manufacture, and post-sale support”. The manufacturing contracts for these sub-assemblies can run over many years.\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Coda Octopus Group, Inc. and its wholly owned domestic and foreign subsidiaries. All of its subsidiaries are\nwholly owned by the Company. All significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in the consolidated financial statements.\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts\nof assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues including unbilled and\ndeferred revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Significant estimates include estimates related to the percentage of\ncompletion method used to account for contracts including costs and earnings in excess of billings, billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings and the valuation of\ngoodwill.\nNOTE 2 – REVENUE RECOGNITION\nThe Company recognizes revenue in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board’s Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (“Topic 606”).\nTopic 606 has established a five-step process to determine the amount of revenue to record from contracts with customers. The five steps are:\n● Identify the contract with the customer;\n● Identify the performance obligations in the contract with customer;\n● Determine the transaction price;\n● Allocate the transaction price to performance obligations; and\n● Recognize revenue when (or as) a performance obligation is satisfied.\nOur revenues are earned under written contracts with our customers. The Marine Technology Business model includes both rentals with associated services and outright sales of\nunderwater technologies which are utilized for a wide range of subsea applications along with technical support services. The Engineering Business supplies engineering\nservices to mainly the prime defense contractors which may include concept, design, prototyping, and contract manufacturing. Our contracts do not include the possibility for\nadditional consideration as the determination for the contract price does not involve having to consider potential additional variable consideration. Our sales do not include a\nright of return by the customer. Where there are contractual failures giving rise to post-sale obligations these are addressed under our warranty or through life support\nprovisions.\n8\nCODA OCTOPUS GROUP, INC.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nJuly 31, 2024 and October 31, 2023\nNOTE 2 – REVENUE RECOGNITION (Continued)\nRegarding our Marine Technology Business, all our products are sold on a stand-alone basis and those market prices are evidence of the value of the products. To the extent that\nwe also provide services (e.g., installation, training, post-sales technical support, customization of our technology for bespoke application, etc.), those services are either\nincluded as part of the product or are subject to written contracts based on the stand-alone value of those services. Revenue from the sale of services is recognized when those\nservices have been performed.\nRevenue derived by the Marine Technology Business from subscription package offerings or equipment rental is recognized when performance obligations are met, in\nparticular, on a daily basis during the subscription or rental period.\nFor arrangements with multiple performance obligations, we recognize product revenue by allocating the transaction revenue to each performance obligation based on a relative\nstandalone selling price basis and recognize revenue when performance obligations are met including when equipment is delivered, and for rental of equipment, when\ninstallation, training and other services prescribed by the contract are performed.\nOur contracts sometimes require customer payments in advance of revenue recognition. These are recognized as revenue when the Company has fulfilled its obligations under\nthe respective contracts. Until such time, we recognize these prepayments as deferred revenue.\nFor software license sales for which any services rendered are not considered distinct to the functionality of the software, we recognize revenue upon delivery of the software\nby the provision of the software installers and activation codes to the software.\nWith respect to revenues related to our Services Business, there are contracts in place that specify the fixed hourly rate and other reimbursable costs to be billed based on\nmaterial and direct labor hours incurred and revenue is recognized on these contracts based on material and the direct labor hours incurred. Revenues from fixed-price contracts\nare recognized on the percentage of completion method, measured by the percentage of costs incurred (materials and direct labor hours) to date to estimated total cost (materials\nand direct labor hours) for each contract. This method is used as we consider expenditures for direct materials and labor hours to be the best available measure of progress on\nthese contracts.\nOn a quarterly basis, we examine all our fixed-price contracts to determine if there are any losses to be recognized during the period. Any such loss is recorded in the quarter in\nwhich the loss first becomes apparent based upon costs incurred to date and the estimated costs to complete as determined by experience from similar contracts. Variations from\nestimated contract performance could result in adjustments to operating results.\nRecoverability of Deferred Costs\nIn accordance with Topic 606, we defer certain costs on projects for service revenue. Deferred costs consist primarily of incremental direct costs to customize and install\nsystems, as defined in individual customer contracts, including costs to acquire hardware and software from third parties and payroll costs for our employees and other third\nparties. The pricing of these service contracts is intended to provide for the recovery of these types of deferred costs over the life of the contract.\n9\nCODA OCTOPUS GROUP, INC.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nJuly 31, 2024 and October 31, 2023\nNOTE 2 – REVENUE RECOGNITION (Continued)\nWe recognize such costs in accordance with our revenue recognition policy by contract. For revenue recognized under the percentage of completion method, costs are\nrecognized as contract deliverables are provided in accordance with the percentage of completion calculation. For revenue recognized over time, costs are recognized ratably\nover the term of the contract, commencing on the date of revenue recognition. At each quarterly balance sheet date, we review deferred costs, to ensure they are ultimately\nrecoverable.\nAny anticipated losses on uncompleted contracts are recognized when evidence indicates the estimated total cost of a contract exceeds its estimated total revenue.\nOther Revenue Disclosures\nSee Notes 12 and 13 – Segment Analysis and Disaggregation of Revenue. These Notes provide disclosure of our revenue by segment (Products Business versus Services\nBusiness); revenues from external customers and cost of those revenues; and split of revenue by geography including in and outside the USA.\nNOTE 3 – COST OF GOODS SOLD\nOur cost of goods sold includes the cost of materials and related direct costs. With respect to sales made through the operating segments’ sales agents distribution network, we\ninclude in our costs of goods sold commissions paid to agents for the specific sales they make. Without using agents, we would not be eligible to participate in the Request for\nProposals (“RFP”) for these sales on which we incur commission costs. All other sales-related expenses, including those related to unsuccessful bids, are included in selling,\ngeneral and administrative (SG&A) costs. As a component of cost of goods sold, sales commission costs in the three month period ended July 31, 2024, and 2023 were\n$100,290 and $120,724, respectively. Commission costs in the nine month period ended July 31, 2024, and 2023 were $525,696 and $728,552 respectively.\nNOTE 4 – FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS\nThe Company’s financial instruments include cash, cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and accrued expenses. The carrying amounts of cash, cash\nequivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate their fair values because of the short-term nature of these instruments.\nNOTE 5 – FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION\nAssets and liabilities are translated at the prevailing exchange rates at the balance sheet dates. Related revenues and expenses are translated at average exchange rates in effect\nduring the reporting period. Stockholders’ equity is recorded at historical exchange rates. Resulting translation adjustments are recorded as a separate component in\nstockholders’ equity as part of accumulated other comprehensive income or (loss) as may be appropriate. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are included in the\nconsolidated statements of income and comprehensive income.\n10\nCODA OCTOPUS GROUP, INC.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nJuly 31, 2024 and October 31, 2023\nNOTE 6 – COMPOSITION OF CERTAIN FINANCIAL STATEMENT CAPTIONS\nCertified Deposit Interest Bearing Accounts as of July 31, 2024 and October 31, 2023.\nThe Company has certified deposit interest-bearing accounts with its current bankers HSBC NA and HSBC UK.

ASU 2023-07 will affect how we\nreport segment information, starting with our Form 10-K for the year ended October 31, 2025, and our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q starting with our quarterly report for the\nquarter ended January 31, 2026. The ASU requires that we provide disclosures of significant segment expenses and other segment items that are regularly provided to our Chief\nOperating Decision Maker (“the CODM”) and included in each reported measure of segment profit or loss. We will also have to disclose other segment items by reportable\nsegment (i.e., the difference between reported segment revenues less the significant segment expenses (which are disclosed) less reported segment profit or loss). The\ninformation needed for these disclosures is available, but we are determining the best way to provide that information for these required segment disclosures.\nOn December 14, 2023, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2023-09 entitled Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures (ASU 2023-09), which is primarily\napplicable to public companies and requires a significant expansion of the granularity of the income tax rate reconciliation as well as an expansion of other income tax\ndisclosures. The majority of the disclosures will only be made on an annual basis, although there is a modest expansion of required quarterly income tax disclosures. The\namendments in ASU 2023-09 require disclosure of specific income tax categories in the rate and reconciliation and provide additional information for reconciling items that\nmeet a quantitative threshold (if the effect of those reconciling items is equal to or greater than 5 percent of the amount computed by multiplying pretax income (or loss) by the\napplicable statutory income tax rate. There are also additional disclosures related to taxes paid to local jurisdictions, and to income taxes paid. This information is currently\navailable to the Company but was not a required disclosure. The Company expects to adopt ASU 2023-09 on November 1, 2025.\nNOTE 10 – EARNINGS PER SHARE\nThree Months Three Months Nine Months Nine Months\nEnded Ended Ended Ended\nJuly 31, July 31, July 31, July 31,\nFiscal Period 2024 2023 2024 2023\nNumerator:\nNet Income $ 1,274,658 $ 1,038,780 $ 3,319,784 $ 3,445,114\nDenominator:\nBasic weighted average common shares outstanding 11,173,819 11,092,420 11,157,799 11,044,624\nUnexercised portion of options and restricted stock awards 137,417 191,717 137,417 191,717\nDiluted outstanding shares 11,311,236 11,284,137 11,295,216 11,236,341\nNet income per share\nBasic $ 0.11 $ 0.09 $ 0.30 $ 0.31\nDiluted $ 0.11 $ 0.09 $ 0.29 $ 0.31\nNOTE 11 – 2017 STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN\n2017 Stock Incentive Plan\nOn December 6, 2017, the Board of Directors adopted the 2017 Stock Incentive Plan (the “2017 Plan”). The purpose of the Plan is to advance the interests of the Company and\nits stockholders by enabling the Company and its subsidiaries to attract and retain qualified individuals through opportunities for equity participation in the Company, and to\nreward those individuals who contribute to the Company’s achievement of its economic objectives. The Plan was adopted subject to stockholders’ approval and was approved\nby Stockholders at the Company’s Annual General Meeting held on July 24, 2018.\nThe maximum number of shares of Common Stock allocated for issuance under the 2017 Plan is 913,612. The shares allocated for issuance under the 2017 Plan may, at the\nelection of the Compensation Committee, be either treasury shares or shares authorized but unissued, and, if treasury shares are used, all references in the 2017 Plan to the\nissuance of shares will, for corporate law purposes, be deemed to mean the transfer of shares from treasury.\nDuring the three month period ended July 31, 2024, the Company granted 18,700 restricted stock awards pursuant to the terms of the 2017 Plan, 12,546 restricted stock awards\nmatured but were not issued as of July 31, 2024 and 2,500 stock awards which had previously matured were issued. No restricted stock awards were forfeited. The total stock\ncompensation expense relating to issuances under the 2017 Plan during the three month period ended July 31, 2024 and 2023 was $37,081 and $110,350, respectively. During\nthe nine month period ended July 31, 2024 and 2023, stock compensation expense was $86,843 (including $33,548 relating to shares of common stock issued outside of the\n2017 Plan) and $488,764, respectively.\nAs of July 31, 2024, there were 368,994 shares available for future issuance under the 2017 Plan.\n13\nCODA OCTOPUS GROUP, INC.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nJuly 31, 2024 and October 31, 2023\nNOTE 11 – 2017 STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN (Continued)\n2021 Stock Incentive Plan\nOn July 12, 2021, the Board of Directors adopted the 2021 Stock Incentive Plan (the “2021 Plan”). The 2021 Plan was approved by the Company’s stockholders at its Annual\nGeneral Meeting held on September 14, 2021. The 2021 Plan is identical to the 2017 Plan in all material respects, except that the number of shares allocated for issuance\nthereunder is 1,000,000.\nThe total number of shares available for issuance under the 2017 and 2021 Plans is 1,368,994.\nNOTE 12 – SEGMENT ANALYSIS\nWe operate in two reportable segments, “Products Business” and “Service Business” which are managed separately based upon fundamental differences in their operations.\nSegment operating income is total segment revenue reduced by cost of revenues and operating expenses, Research and Development (“R&D”), and Selling, General &\nAdministrative (“SG&A”) identifiable with the reporting business segment.

Our effective consolidated tax rate for the three-months ended July 31, 2024, is higher than\nthe U.S. statutory Federal tax rate of 21.0% resulting from the composition of our taxable income from each jurisdiction. We pay Danish tax at a tax rate of 22% in respect of\nour Danish subsidiary. We also pay Global Intangible Low Taxed Income (GILTI) tax in the United States based upon our foreign operations, which tax is over and above the\nstatutory tax rate. We get to offset a portion of the Danish tax we pay against the U.S. GILTI tax. Regarding our U.K. subsidiaries, we have R&D tax credits that currently\ncompletely offset our income tax liabilities in the U.K. We accrue both Federal and state income taxes in the U.S., as well as our liability for the GILTI tax. The composition of\nour taxable income in the various jurisdictions affects the calculation of our global tax liabilities. In addition, the timing of recognizing revenues and expenses for income tax\npurposes affects our effective tax rates.\n22\nITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nForward-Looking Statements\nThe information herein contains forward-looking statements. All statements other than statements of historical fact made herein are forward looking. In particular, the\nstatements herein regarding industry prospects and future results of operations or financial position are forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements can be\nidentified by the use of words such as “believes,” “estimates,” “could,” “possibly,” “probably,” anticipates,” “projects,” “expects,” “may,” “will,” or “should” or other\nvariations or similar words. No assurances can be given that the future results anticipated by the forward-looking statements will be achieved. Forward-looking statements\nreflect management’s current expectations and are inherently uncertain. Our actual results may differ significantly from management’s expectations.\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our financial statements, included herewith and the audited financial statements included in our\nannual report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on January 29, 2024. This discussion should not be construed to imply that the results\ndiscussed herein will necessarily continue into the future, or that any conclusion reached herein will necessarily be indicative of actual operating results in the future. Such\ndiscussion represents only the best present assessment of our management.\nGeneral Overview\nThroughout these discussions, the following terms shall have the meanings set forth below:\n“Current Quarter” Three month period ended July 31, 2024\n“Previous Quarter” Three month period ended July 31, 2023\n“Current Nine Month Period” Nine month period ended July 31, 2024\n“Previous Nine Month Period” Nine month period ended July 31, 2023\nThe Company operates two distinct businesses:\n● the Marine Technology Business (also referred to in this Form 10-Q as “Products Business”, or “Products Segment”); and\n● the Marine Engineering Business (also referred to in this Form 10-Q as “Engineering Business”, or “Services Business” or “Services Segment”).\nOur Marine Technology Business is an established technology solution provider to the subsea and underwater imaging, surveying, diving market and underwater\ncommunications market. It has been operating as a supplier of underwater solutions which include both hardware and software products for over 30 years. It owns key\nproprietary patented technology including real time volumetric 4D/5D and 6D imaging sonar technology and cutting-edge diving technology, that are used in both the\nunderwater defense and commercial markets. It recently launched its new AI based underwater digital communications system which advances the offering in the market from\nanalog voice communications underwater to digital voice communications underwater. All design, development and manufacturing of our technology and solutions are\nperformed within the Company.\nOur imaging sonar technology products and solutions marketed under the name of Echoscope® and Echoscope PIPE® are used primarily in the underwater construction market,\noffshore renewables, offshore oil and gas, forward looking obstacle avoidance, complex underwater mapping, salvage operations, dredging, bridge inspection, underwater\nhazard detection, port & harbor security, mining, fisheries, real time 3D monitoring and inspection, commercial and defense diving, and marine sciences sectors. Uniquely our\nEchoscope® technology is a single sensor for multiple underwater applications and therefore serves a number of discrete market verticals such as breakwater construction,\ndredging, salvage, landing operations, complex survey and mapping, commissioning and decommissioning of underwater assets.\nOur novel diving technology is distributed under the name “CodaOctopus® DAVD” (Diver Augmented Vision Display) to the global defense and commercial diving markets.\nThe DAVD embeds inside of the diver’s head up display (HUD) a pair of transparent glasses which is used as the data hub for displaying real time diving mission data to the\ndiver. We believe that the DAVD system has the potential to radically transform how diving operations are performed globally because it provides a fully integrated singular\nsystem for topside control and a fully connected HUD system for the diver allowing both the topside and diver to share a range of critical information including depth (pressure\nand temperature), compass and head tracking, real time dive timers and alerts, diver position and navigation, ultra-low light enhanced video system and enhanced digital voice\ncommunications. Current diving operations are limited in that the diver only shares analog voice communications with the topside without real time information including real\ntime navigation, tracking and mapping of the dive area. The topside must also manage several independent systems for video, communications, and positioning. The\nCompany’s solution addresses these deficiencies. Also, using our sonar technology, diving can be performed in zero visibility conditions, a common problem which besets these\noperations thereby impacting the ability to perform diving operations when these conditions prevail, safety and the costs of these operations.\n23\nOur digital audio communications system, (marketed under the name “Voice-HUB 4”), offers a digital audio communications system which advances the market from analog\nunderwater communications to digital and provides much clearer underwater communications, thereby removing the risk of miscommunication.\nAlthough we generate most of our revenues from our real time 3D sonar which includes proprietary hardware and software, we have several other products such as our inertial\nnavigation systems (F280 Series®) and our geophysical hardware (DA4G) and software solutions (GeoSurvey and Survey Engine®, which include artificial intelligence based\nautomatic detection systems), DAVD and our digital audio communications system (Voice-HUB- 4).\nOur customers include offshore service providers, major oil and gas companies, renewable energy companies, underwater construction companies, law enforcement agencies,\nports, mining companies, defense bodies (such as navies), prime defense contractors, research institutes and universities and diving companies.\nThe Services Business has operations in the USA and UK. Its central business model is working with the prime defense contractors to design and manufacture sub-assemblies\nfor utilization into larger defense mission critical integrated systems (“MCIS”). Examples of such MCIS are the US Close-In-Weapons Support (CIWS) Program for the\nPhalanx radar-guided cannon used on combat ships and the AN/AQS24 Mine Hunting System Program, both of these being programs of record. These proprietary sub-\nassemblies, once approved within the MCIS program, afford the Services Business the status of preferred supplier. Such status permits it to supply these sub-assemblies and\nupgrades in the event of obsolescence or advancement of technology for the life of the MCIS program. Clients include prime defense contractors such as Raytheon, Northrop\nGrumman, Thales Underwater and BAE Systems. The scope of services provided by the Services Business for the subassemblies they supply extends to concept, design,\nprototype, contract manufacturing and post-sale support.\nKey Pillars for our Growth Plans\nOur volumetric real time imaging sonar technology, Echoscope PIPE®, and DAVD are the most promising products for the Company’s near-term growth. We are widely\nregarded as the leading solution providers for underwater real time 3D visualization.\nOur real time 4D/5D/6D Imaging sonars are the only underwater imaging sonars which are capable of providing complex seabed mapping, real time inspection and monitoring\nand providing 4D/5D/6D data of moving underwater objects irrespective of water conditions including in zero visibility (which is a common and costly problem in underwater\noperations). Competing products such as the multibeam sonar can perform mapping (but not complex mapping) without the ability to perform real time inspection and\nmonitoring of moving objects underwater. We also believe our Echoscope PIPE® is the only technology that can generate multiple real time 4D/5D/6D acoustic images using\ndifferent acoustic parameters such as frequency, field of view, pulse length, filters and different beamforming modes allowing users to increase the efficiency of their\noperations.\nWe also believe that the DAVD system is poised to radically change the way diving operations are performed globally by providing a fully integrated suite of sensor data shared\nin real time by the dive supervisor on the surface and the diver. Current diving is done largely by voice command missions from the topside using disparate suite of systems for\nvideo data, communications, and positioning. The DAVD technology changes this and offers the market an integrated suite of sensors providing real time mission critical\ninformation to both the diver and the dive supervisor on the surface and also allow both of them to visualize the same underwater scene.\nThe DAVD tethered variant is now in early-stage adoption by different teams within the US Navy. The DAVD which is included on the Approved Navy Use (“ANU”) list is a\nstandard item available for purchase within the Navy community and some of these commands are now requesting this solution for their operations. We have also started\nrealizing sales of the DAVD in the offshore commercial market and have sold our first DAVD tethered system to a significant offshore service provider in Asia.\nThe DAVD untethered variant (“DUS”) is going through evaluation, and we are contracted under a program designed to “harden” the technology for fast adoption by special\nforces (“DAVD Hardening Program”). Under the DAVD Hardening Program, since fiscal year 2023, we have received $1.25 million in funding and, have supplied eight DUS\nsystems which are currently used by the Program Sponsor for ongoing field evaluation. We have also continued to provide feature upgrades under this DAVD Hardening\nProgram. We are expecting to receive another $700,000 in funding under the ongoing Hardening Program. Funding is currently delayed due to the upcoming Presidential\nElections which have impacted funding under many defense programs. This is not unusual during a Presidential election year. The DUS system represents our most significant\nmarket opportunity for the DAVD technology, and we continue to advance the technology based on customer feedback. We continue to receive positive feedback on the DUS\nfrom the ongoing field trials by this user community and will reach a significant milestone in the DAVD Hardening Program later this year when we deliver the newly designed\noptical engines and HUD designed for face masks used by the special forces.\nThe concept of utilizing a pair of transparent glasses in the HUD underwater, is protected by patent. All component parts of the DAVD system are proprietary to the Company\nand include overall systems designs, software (4G USE® DAVD Edition), Diver Processing Pack – telemetry system (DPP), Top Side Controller and real time 3D Sonar. The\nCompany benefits from the exclusive license from the United States Department of the Navy at Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City Division to exploit the utility patent\ncovering the concept of using the pair of transparent glasses as a data hub underwater. The DAVD is an “Approved Navy Use” item and benefits from CE Marking required\nunder UK and European Union safety regulations.\nBoth the Marine Technology Business and Engineering Business have established synergies in terms of customers and specialized engineering skill sets (hardware, firmware\nand software) encompassing capturing, computing, processing and displaying data in harsh environments. Both businesses jointly bid for projects for which their common joint\nskills provide competitive advantage and make them eligible for such projects.\nFactors Affecting our Business in the Current Quarter\nThe following is a brief summary of the most critical factors that affect our business. For a more detailed discussion of these and additional factors, refer to our Form 10-K for\nthe fiscal year ended October 31, 2023.\n24\nInflation\nInflation measured as the Consumer Price Index has been significant and volatile in the countries in which we operate. Recent trends indicate that inflation is falling. For the\n12-month period preceding July 2024, this was:\n➢ Denmark 1.1% - source: Statistics Denmark,\n➢ UK 3.1% - source: Office of National Statistics; and\n➢ USA 2.9% - source: U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.\nAlthough inflation is falling, prices which have increased due to inflation over the last year including cost of material and wages have remained at their inflationary-inspired\nlevel and have become the base price.\nInflation affects our business in a number of areas including increasing our cost of operations and materials and therefore our overall financial results. See “Inflation and\nForeign Currency” section of this Form 10-Q.\nInterest Rates\nThe change in monetary policy vis-à-vis interest rates has in general affected some of our key sectors such as offshore renewables and underwater construction. The increase in\ninterest rates has impacted on the viability of a number of underwater projects resulting in increased operational costs, which in turn has reduced the demand for our underwater\nsolutions.\nGeopolitical tensions\nThe ongoing war in Ukraine impacts our Services Business as most defense spending is now directed toward land-based applications rather than naval based applications. In\naddition, the ongoing political tension with China reduces demand for our product in in that country where we understand from our agent network that there is a “Buy-China”\npolicy in place. Furthermore, the ongoing addition of Chinese Suppliers on the US Bureau of Industry and Security (“BIS”) list may affect supply of components which are\nrelevant for our products, making these obsolete and subject to significant re-engineering costs.\nCurrency Fluctuations\nThe Company has operations in the UK, USA and Denmark. Our consolidated results include the Company’s foreign subsidiaries’ results which are transacted in their native\nfunctional currency and translated into USD for reporting purposes. Unfavorable currency fluctuations may adversely affect our financial results. Revenue and expenses are\ntranslated using the average exchange rates in effect during the reporting period. In the Current Quarter, for the purpose of reporting revenue and expenses, the value of the\nBritish Pound when compared to the Previous Quarter increased against the USD by 0.7% and the Danish Kroner decreased by 0.8%, respectively. For the purpose of reporting\nassets and liabilities, the British Pound and the Danish Kroner both increased by 5.8% and 2.4% respectively. The impact of currency fluctuations is discussed more fully below\nunder Item 2 - “Inflation and Foreign Currency”. See also Note 5 (Foreign Currency Translation) to the unaudited consolidated financial statements.\nSkills/Resource Shortages and Pressure on Salaries and Wages\nWe are experiencing skill shortages in areas that are critical to our growth strategy including experienced sales and marketing personnel, software developers, skilled electronic\nengineers and production technicians and various management positions.\nConcentration of Business Opportunities Where the Sales Cycle is Long and Unpredictable\nThe Services Business revenues are highly concentrated and are mainly generated from sub-contracts with prime defense contractors. The sales cycle is generally protracted,\nand this may affect quarterly revenues. It is also dependent on the federal government approving and appropriating budget for defense projects and where the federal\ngovernment is unable to find consensus in the US Congress, this affects the timely award of sub-contract from the prime defense contractors to our Services Business, which is\nreliant on these awards. Furthermore, the Products Business key opportunities which are critical to its growth strategy are in the Defense Market for both its imaging sonars and\nthe DAVD, both of which are key pillars of the Company’s growth strategy. Due to the protracted nature of the government procurement process and cycle for defense spending\nunder federal and/or state budgets, the sales cycle can be long and unpredictable, thus affecting timing of orders and thus quarterly revenues.\nLimitations caused by the use of Continuing Resolutions to authorize ongoing spending under Defense Programs\nYear to date, we have been affected by funding delays under Defense Programs in the USA including the DAVD Hardening Program. The upcoming Presidential election has\nresulted in funding gaps and slow down in procurement under Defense Programs. This is not unusual and generally the convention is to postpone new acquisitions until the\noutcome of the election is decided. This has adversely impacted on order intake and sales emanating from the Americas. As a result, we believe that this has impacted on our\nyear to date sales in the Americas which was $4,688,741 compared to $7,315,039 in the previous year to date period. See Note 13 (Disaggregation of Revenue) for more\ninformation on this impact on our Business.\nImpact on Revenues and Earnings\nWe are uncertain as to the extent of the impact the factors disclosed above and in our Form 10-K covering fiscal year ended October 31, 2023 and those disclosed in our Form\n10-Qs for the first and second quarters of this fiscal year, are likely to have on our future financial results.\n25\nImpact on Liquidity, Balance Sheet and Assets\nThese factors may adversely impact on our availability of free cash flow, working capital and business prospects. As of July 31, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of\n$25,217,965 and cash provided by operating activities was $458,013 in the nine months to July 31, 2024. Based on our outstanding obligations and our cash balances, we\nbelieve we have sufficient working capital to effectively continue our business operations for the foreseeable future.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThis discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements that have been prepared under accounting\nprinciples generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”). The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires our management to make\nestimates and assumptions that affect the reported values of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and\nthe reported levels of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates.\nBelow is a discussion of accounting policies that we consider critical to an understanding of our financial condition and operating results and that may require complex\njudgment in their application or require estimates about matters which are inherently uncertain. A discussion of our significant accounting policies, including further discussion\nof the accounting policies described below, can be found in Note 2, “Summary of Accounting Policies” of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended October\n31, 2023.\nRevenue Recognition\nOur revenues are earned under formal contracts with our customers and are derived from both sales and rental of underwater solutions for imaging, mapping, defense, survey\nand diving applications and from the engineering services that we provide. Our contracts do not include the possibility for additional contingent consideration so that our\ndetermination of the contract price does not involve having to consider potential variable additional consideration. Our product sales do not include a right of return by the\ncustomer.\nRegarding our Products Business, all our products are sold on a stand-alone basis and those market prices are evidence of the value of the products. To the extent that we also\nprovide services (e.g., installation, training, etc.), those services are either included as part of the product or are subject to written contracts based on the stand-alone value of\nthose services. Revenue from the sale of services is recognized when those services have been provided to the customer and evidence of the delivery of those services exists.\nFor further discussion of our revenue recognition accounting policies, refer to Note 2 – “Revenue Recognition” in these unaudited consolidated financial statements and Note 2\n“Summary of Accounting Policies” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2023.\nRecoverability of Deferred Costs\nIn respect of our Services Segment, we defer costs on projects for service revenue. Deferred costs consist primarily of direct and incremental costs to customize and install\nsystems, as defined in individual customer contracts, including costs to acquire hardware and software from third parties and payroll costs for our employees and other third\nparties.\nWe recognize such costs on a contract by contract basis in accordance with our revenue recognition policy. For revenue recognized under the completed contract method, costs\nare deferred until the products are delivered, or upon completion of services or, where applicable, customer acceptance. For revenue recognized under the percentage of\ncompletion method, costs are recognized as products are delivered or services are provided in accordance with the percentage of completion calculation. For revenue\nrecognized ratably over the term of the contract, costs are also recognized ratably over the term of the contract, commencing on the date of revenue recognition. At each balance\nsheet date, we review deferred costs, to ensure they are ultimately recoverable. Any anticipated losses on uncompleted contracts are recognized when evidence indicates the\nestimated total cost of a contract exceeds its estimated total revenue.\n26\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification 740, Income Taxes (ASC 740). Under ASC 740, deferred income tax assets and\nliabilities are recorded for the income tax effects of differences between the bases of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and their bases for income tax\nreporting. The Company’s differences arise principally from the use of various accelerated and modified accelerated cost recovery systems for income tax purposes versus\nstraight line depreciation used for book purposes; the restricted stock awards differences between stock award price at the date of award and the fair value price at the date of\nissuance and from the utilization of net operating loss carry-forwards.\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are the amounts by which the Company’s future income taxes are expected to be impacted by these differences as they reverse. Deferred tax\nassets are based on differences that are expected to decrease future income taxes as they reverse. Correspondingly, deferred tax liabilities are based on differences that are\nexpected to increase future income taxes as they reverse.\nFor income tax purposes, the Company uses the percentage of completion method of recognizing revenues on long-term contracts which is consistent with the Company’s\nfinancial reporting under GAAP.\nIntangible Assets\nIntangible assets consist principally of the excess of cost over the fair value of net assets acquired (or goodwill) and customer relationships. Goodwill was allocated to our\nreporting units based on the original purchase price allocation. Goodwill is not amortized and is evaluated for impairment annually or more often if circumstances indicate\nimpairment may exist. Customer relationships are being amortized on a straight-line basis over periods of 2 to 15 years. The Company amortizes its limited lived intangible\nassets using the straight-line method over their estimated period of benefit. Annually, or sooner if there is indication of a loss in value, we evaluate the recoverability of\nintangible assets and consider events or circumstances that warrant revised estimates of useful lives or that indicate that impairment exists. There were no impairment charges\nduring the periods presented.\nThe first step of the goodwill impairment test, used to identify potential impairment, compares the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill.\nIf the fair value, which is based on future cash flows, exceeds the carrying amount, goodwill is not considered impaired. If the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, goodwill\nis reduced by the excess of the carrying amount of the reporting unit over that reporting unit’s fair value. Goodwill can never be reduced below zero. At the end of each year, we\nevaluate goodwill on a separate reporting unit basis to assess recoverability, and impairments, if any, are recognized in earnings.\nConsolidated Results of Operations\nOur consolidated financial results include the results of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries (UK and Danish operations). Foreign subsidiaries’ results are translated from their\nfunctional currencies into USD for reporting purposes. Fluctuations in currency can therefore impact our translated results, including revenue and income. Revenue and\nexpenses are translated using the average exchange rates in effect during the reporting period. During the Current Quarter, the British Pound strengthened against the USD\nwhen compared to the Previous Quarter exchange rate (“the Constant Rate”); whereas the Danish Kroner slightly weakened against the USD. During the Current Quarter our\ntotal consolidated revenue was $5,476,544 compared to $4,890,532, in the Previous Quarter. The impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuation between the Previous Quarter and\nour Current Quarter was negligible. During the Current Quarter total operating expense increased by $155,154 or 6.2%. Income from operations increased by 61.2%. Income\nbefore taxes increased by 51.4% and was $1,631,246 compared to $1,077,166 in the Previous Quarter. Further details concerning our financial results in the Current Quarter\nand the Current Nine Month Period are discussed immediately below.\nSegment Summary\nProducts Business\nIn the Current Quarter, the Products Business generated $3,048,544 or 55.7% of our consolidated revenues compared to $2,863,251 or 58.5% in the Previous Quarter,\nrepresenting an increase of 6.5%. Gross profit margin increased from 82.1% in the Previous Quarter to 82.9% in the Current Quarter. In the Current Quarter we recorded sales\ncommissions for this segment of $99,278 compared to $120,724 in the Previous Quarter, representing a decrease of 17.8%. In the Current Quarter total operating expenses\nincreased by 7.3% in the Products Business and were $1,545,374 compared to $1,439,923 in the Previous Quarter. Income before tax was $1,154,300 in the Current Quarter\ncompared to $1,091,700 in the Previous Quarter. Notable in the Current Quarter, sales generated by the Products Business from the USA decreased from $1,321,495 in the\nPrevious Quarter to $682,477. We believe this is a result of the upcoming Presidential Election which has seen funding gaps and slowdown in procurement under Defense\nPrograms (and which has affected programs such as DAVD). This is not unusual and generally the convention is to postpone new acquisitions until the outcome of the election\nis decided.\nServices Business\nIn the Current Quarter, the Services Business generated $2,428,000 or 44.3% of our consolidated revenues compared to $2,027,281 or 41.5% in the Previous Quarter,\nrepresenting an increase in sales of 19.8%. Gross profit margin increased from 50.0% in the Previous Quarter to 62.6% in the Current Quarter. This level of gross profit margin\nfor the Services Business is atypical and has arisen because we utilized, against one of our engineering projects, inventory items which were in our stock at a much lower cost\nthan market value. In the Current Quarter total operating expenses decreased by 4.2% in the Services Business and were $535,421 compared to $558,739 in the Previous\nQuarter and income before tax was $1,030,488 compared to $489,414 in the Previous Quarter. This Business is reliant on funding from Defense Programs.\n27\nResults of Operations for the Current Quarter compared to the Previous Quarter\nRevenue: Total consolidated revenues for the Current Quarter and the Previous Quarter were $5,476,544 and $4,890,532 respectively, representing an increase of 12.0%. In the\nCurrent Quarter, both the Products Business and the Services Business revenues increased over the Previous Quarter.\nGross Profit Margins: Consolidated margin percentage was stronger in the Current Quarter at 73.9% (gross profit of $4,048,538) compared to 68.8% (gross profit of\n$3,365,224) in the Previous Quarter.\nGross profit margins reported in our financial results may vary according to several factors. These include:\n● The percentage of consolidated sales attributed to the Marine Technology Business versus the Services Business. The gross profit margin yielded by the Marine\nTechnology Business is generally higher than that of the Services Business.\n● The percentage of consolidated sales attributed to the Services Business. The Services Business yields a lower gross profit margin on generated sales which are largely\nbased on time and materials for our Department of Defense contracts (DoD subcontracts).\n● The mix of sales within the Marine Technology Business during the reporting period:\n● Outright Sale versus Rentals.\n● Hardware Sale versus Software, software is generally higher margin.\n● Mix of Services rendered in the period – offshore engineering services versus paid customer research and development projects.\n● Level of commissions on products which may vary according to volume. Both the Services and Marine Technology Businesses work with sales/distribution agents.\nMost of the Marine Technology Business sales in Asia are completed via agents or distributors. See Note 3 “Cost of Goods Sold” for more discussion on this.\n● Level of Rental Assets in the Marine Technology Business’ Rental Pool and therefore the depreciation expenses may vary accordingly.\n● The mix of engineering projects performed by our Services Business (Design and prototyping versus manufacturing), may also affect gross profit margins.\nIn the Current Quarter, gross profit margins for the Marine Technology Business were 82.9% compared to 82.1% in the Previous Quarter. For the Services Business these were\n62.6% in the Current Quarter compared to 50.0% in the Previous Quarter. This level of gross profit margin for the Services Business is atypical and has arisen because we\nutilized, against one of our engineering projects, inventory items which were in our stock at a much lower cost than market value.\nNotable factors contributing to the higher gross profit margins include the significant increase in our rental and associated services revenue by the Products Business and the\nService Business realizing higher gross margins for the reasons earlier discussed.\nSince there are more variable factors affecting gross profit margins in the Marine Technology Business (Products Business), a table showing a summary of break-out of sales\ngenerated by this business in the Current Quarter compared to the Previous Quarter is set out below:\nJuly 31, 2024 July 31, 2023 Percentage\nDescription Products Products Change\nEquipment Sales $ 1,349,011 $ 2,143,203 (37.1)%\nEquipment Rental 805,259 303,525 165.3%\nSoftware Sales 251,488 147,453 70.6%\nServices 642,786 269,070 138.9%\nTotal Net Sales $ 3,048,544 $ 2,863,251 6.5%\nThe decrease in Equipment Sales in the Current Quarter reflects the reduction in orders and sales emanating from the Americas caused by the funding gaps on Defense\nPrograms described earlier. This has affected programs like the DAVD, resulting in reduced orders and sales for this segment in the Americas, which in the Current Quarter was\n$682,477 compared to $1,321,495 in the Previous Quarter.\nIn the Current Quarter the Marine Technology Business incurred commission costs of $99,278 compared to $120,724 in the Previous Quarter, representing a decrease of 17.8%.\nIn the Current Quarter depreciation expenses relating to our rental assets increased by 17.0% and were $105,337 compared to $90,003 in the Previous Quarter.\nThe main factors impacting the Gross Profit Margin of the Marine Technology Business in the Current Quarter are the reduction in equipment sale in conjunction with a\nsignificant increase in rental revenue and associated services (engineering support for rental projects), services and software sales.\nFurther information on the performance of each business segment including revenues by type and geography can be found in Notes 12 and Note 13 to the unaudited\nconsolidated financial statements for the Current and Previous Quarter.\nResearch and Development (R&D): R&D expenditures in the Current Quarter were $496,359 compared to $568,287 in the Previous Quarter, representing a decrease of 12.7%.\n● Products Segment\nDuring the Current Quarter the Products Business R&D expenditure decreased by 17.5% and was $459,879 as compared to $557,260 in the Previous Quarter. R&D expenditure\nis incurred by this business in connection with investments it makes in developing its products and solutions. This expenditure is an essential part of our business, as our market\ncompetitiveness is predicated on continued innovation.\n● Services Segment.\nDuring the Current Quarter the Services Business R&D expenditure increased by 230.8% and was $36,480 compared to $11,027 in the Previous Quarter. The Services Business\nincurs research and development expenses primarily on advancing its Thermite® Octal range of mission computer products with the strategic goals of increasing and\ndiversifying its revenues and improving gross profit margins. As we understand our customer base requirements for these mission computers, we may incur more R&D\nexpenditure on developing this range of products.\nPercentage\nSegment July 31, 2024 July 31, 2023 Change\nProducts Segment R&D Expenditures $ 459,879 $ 557,260 (17.5)%\nServices Segment R&D Expenditures $ 36,480 $ 11,027 230.8%\n28\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses (SG&A): SG&A expenses for the Current Quarter increased by 11.7% to $2,161,405 from $1,934,323 in the Previous Quarter.\nSG&A includes transactions which are cash charges and non-cash charges. The non-cash charges transactions comprise depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation,\nand exchange rate variance charges. In the Current Quarter non-cash transactions as a percentage of SG&A expenses were 15.0 % compared to 17.2% in the Previous Quarter.\nThe main reason for the increase in our SG&A expenses in the Current Quarter when compared to the Previous Quarter is the increase in Wages and Salaries (by 5.5%),\nMarketing Costs (by 180.2%) and General Office Costs which increased by 47.8%.\nKey Areas of SG&A Expenditure across the Company for the Current Quarter compared to the Previous Quarter are:\nJuly 31, July 31, Percentage\nExpenditure 2024 2023 Change\nWages and Salaries $ 909,504 $ 862,493 5.5%\nLegal and Professional Fees (including accounting and audit) $ 352,671 $ 359,285 (1.8)%\nMarketing $ 131,690 $ 47,002 180.2%\nWages and Salaries – In the Current Quarter this category of expense increased by 5.5%. We anticipate that on a full year basis in the fiscal year 2024 this category will\nincrease materially over the fiscal year 2023. We are currently operating on a reduced headcount and have several vacancies and are also expanding our management team.\nLegal and Professional fees decreased and reflect the timing of services performed. On a full year basis, we anticipate this category of expenditures will largely be in line with\nthe Previous Year.\nMarketing – In the Current Quarter this category of expense increased by 180.2%. The increase is anticipated within our plans. We anticipate this area of expenditure will\nincrease materially in this fiscal year and subsequent years. As we shift our focus from R&D to business development and marketing, including undertaking efforts to build our\nbrands, we anticipate a significant increase in this area of expenditure. In the Current Quarter, the increased costs are largely a reflection of the fees associated with hiring our\nBusiness Development Focus Group Consultants in the USA to assist the Company with developing its Defense Market strategy and identifying opportunities for the\nCompany’s technology within US Defense Programs. On a full fiscal year basis, the cost of this service will be $222,000 excluding travel expenses.\nOverhead related costs as a percentage of revenue for Current Quarter, compared to the Previous Quarter\nGeneral corporate administrative expenses in the Current Quarter were $576,969 or 10.5% of revenue and $503,948 or 10.3% of revenue in the Previous Quarter, respectively.\nFor more information on general corporate administrative expenses, please see Note 12 (Segment Analysis).\nOperating Income: In the Current Quarter operating income increased by 61.2% and was $1,390,774 as compared to $862,614 in the Previous Quarter. The increase in\noperating income is attributed to the increase in revenue and gross profit. Gross Profit was exceptionally higher in the Services Segment because we utilized against one of our\nengineering projects inventory items which were in stock at a much lower cost than the market value.\nOther Income: In the Current Quarter, we had “total other income” of $240,472 compared to $214,552 in the Previous Quarter, representing an increase of 12.1%. In the\nCurrent Quarter we had $230,009 interest income earned on our certified deposit accounts. These accounts are for fixed 3-month rolling periods and constitute “cash\nequivalents” in our current unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements for the period ended July 31, 2024 (see Note 6 Composition of Certain Financial Statement Captions)\nfor more detailed analysis of this. We anticipate that the interest earned on these certified deposit accounts will remain to be material in the future if we continue to hold this\nlevel of cash and interest rates remain at this level.\nIncome before income taxes: In the Current Quarter, we had income before income taxes of $1,631,246 as compared to $1,077,166 in the Previous Quarter, representing an\nincrease of 51.4%. Income before income taxes largely increased due to an increase in revenue and gross profit in the Current Quarter.\n29\nNet Income: In the Current Quarter we had Net Income of $1,274,658 compared to $1,038,780 in the Previous Quarter, representing an increase of 22.7%. Net Income\nincreased in the Current Quarter over the Previous Quarter as a result of the increase in “Income before taxes” for the reasons explained above. However, in the Current Quarter\nour provision for tax liability was higher than in the Previous Quarter. In general, our tax liability included in our consolidated financial results will depend on the composition\nof our consolidated income or loss. In particular, the percentage of income or loss attributed to the Company and its US entities, and the percentage of income or loss attributed\nto its foreign subsidiaries. In the Current and Previous Quarter, we recorded Current Tax Expense of $325,625 (which include an amount of $26,668 relating to adjustments for\nfiscal year 2023) and $68,771, respectively, representing an increase of 373.5%. We also recorded a Deferred Tax Expense of $30,963 in the Current Quarter compared to a\nDeferred Tax Benefit of $30,385 in the Previous Quarter. In the Current Quarter the Company’s UK subsidiaries generated a taxable income but have carryforward losses and\nR&D tax credits which will be used to defray tax liability for these subsidiaries and therefore no provision for tax liability has been made in our consolidated results for the UK\nsubsidiaries in the Current Quarter. The Company’s Danish subsidiary generated a taxable income in the Current Quarter, resulting in a tax provision of 22.0% in our\nconsolidated results. We also made a further provision for Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income of $74,000.\nComprehensive Income. In the Current Quarter comprehensive income was $1,668,038 compared to $1,431,263 for the Previous Quarter reflecting adjustments resulting from\nforeign currency translations. This category is affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange transactions both relating to our profit and loss expenses and valuation of\nour assets and liabilities on our balance sheet. A significant part of the Company’s operations is based in the UK and Denmark, and therefore a major part of the Company’s\nassets and liabilities recorded in its consolidated balance sheet and financial transactions are translated from the functional currencies of these subsidiaries into USD for\nreporting purposes. In the Current Quarter, for the purpose of reporting revenue and expenses, the value of the British Pound when compared to the Previous Quarter increased\nagainst the USD by 0.7% and the Danish Kroner decreased by 0.8%, respectively. For the purpose of reporting asset and liabilities, the value of British Pound and the Danish\nKroner both increased against the USD by 5.8% and 2.4% respectively. Therefore, in the Current Quarter there was a gain of $393,380 on foreign currency translation\nadjustment transactions compared to $392,483 in the Previous Quarter. See the section below which concerns “Inflation & Foreign Currency” which shows the impact of the\ncurrency adjustments on our Income Statement and Balance Sheet in the Current Quarter compared to the Previous Quarter.\nResults of Operations for the Current Nine Month Period compared to the Previous Nine Month Period\nRevenue: Total consolidated revenues for the Current Nine Month Period and the Previous Nine Month Period were $15,260,913 and $15,788,325 respectively, representing a\ndecrease of 3.3%. In the Current Nine Month Period, the Marine Technology Business revenues were $10,116,024 or 66.3% of our total consolidated revenue compared to\n$10,270,839 or 65.1% of our total consolidated revenue, representing a reduction of 1.5% when compared to the Previous Nine Month Period. The Services Business revenues\nin the Current Nine Month Period and the Previous Nine Month Period were $5,144,889 or 33.7% of our total consolidated revenue and $5,517,486 or 34.9% of our total\nconsolidated revenue, representing a decrease of 6.8%. The decrease in our consolidated revenue in the Current Nine Month Period is largely due to the sharp fall in revenue\nfrom the Americas which was $4,688,741 in the Current Nine Month Period compared to $7,315,039 in the Previous Nine Month Period, representing a decrease of 35.9%. We\nbelieve this is a result of the upcoming Presidential Election which has seen funding gaps and slowdown in procurement under Defense Programs. This is not unusual in a\nPresidential Election year and generally the convention is to postpone new acquisitions until the outcome of the election is decided.\nGross Profit Margins: Consolidated margin percentage was higher in the Current Nine Month Period at 71.3% (gross profit of $10,873,708) compared to 68.0% (gross profit\nof $10,741,470). The main factors which have resulted in the higher margins in the Current Nine Month Period are attributable to our Marine Technology Business which\nrealized an increase in rental revenue and associated engineering support services and incurred lower commission costs. In the Current Nine Month Period gross profit margins\nfor the Marine Technology Business were 78.3% compared to 76.0% in the Previous Nine Month Period. In addition, the Services Business had stronger margin on sales due to\na combination of factors including a sale of approximately $100,000 which utilized inventory items which were in our stock at a much lower cost than market value.\nGross profit margins reported in our financial results may vary according to several factors. These include:\n● The percentage of consolidated sales attributable to the Marine Technology Business versus the Services Business. The gross profit margin yielded by the Marine\nTechnology Business is generally higher than that of the Services Business.\n● The percentage of consolidated sales attributed to the Services Business. The Services Business yields a lower gross profit margin on generated sales which are largely\nbased on time and materials for our Department of Defense contracts (DoD subcontracts).\n● The mix of engineering projects contracted and performed by our Services Business: Design prototyping versus Contract Manufacturing services during the reporting\nperiod, may also affect Gross Profit Margins.\n● The mix of sales within the Marine Technology Business during the reporting period:\n● Outright Sales versus Rentals.\n● Hardware Sales versus Software (software is generally higher margin).\n● Mix of Services rendered in the period – offshore services (such as mobilization and training support versus paid customer research and development projects\nrelating to customization of our technology for their application).\n● Level of commissions on products which may vary according to volume. Both the Services and Marine Technology Businesses work with sales/distribution agents.\nMost of the Marine Technology Business sales in Asia is conducted via agents or distributors. See Note 3 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements “Cost of\nRevenue” for more discussion on this.\n● Level of Rental Assets in the Marine Technology Business’ Rental Pool and therefore the depreciation expenses may vary accordingly.\n30\nServices Business\nGross Profit Margins for the Services Business were higher at 57.3% in the Current Nine Month Period compared to 53.1% in the Previous Nine Month Period. This is largely\ndue to the types of engineering projects that are ongoing in the reporting period (contract manufacturing versus design and development work scopes), the former yielding a\nhigher margin profile and exceptionally year to date our revenue includes $100,000 of sales which utilized inventory items which were in our stock at a much lower cost than\nmarket value.\nMarine Technology Business\nIn the Current Nine Month Period gross profit margins for the Marine Technology Business were 78.3% compared to 76.0% in the Previous Nine Month Period. The\nstrengthening is largely because of the composition of our sales in conjunction with a reduction in commission costs incurred. In the Current Nine Month Period there were\nmore units of rental and associated engineering support sale (field engineers supporting ongoing customer projects) combined with a significant reduction in commission costs\nincurred and which were $523,670 in the Current Nine Month Period compared to $696,260 in the Previous Nine Month Period, representing a decrease of 24.8%. A significant\npercentage of our sales in foreign territories such as South Korea, Japan, China and South Africa are conducted through our sales agents and distributors. In general, gross profit\nmargins are lower on our units of hardware sale than on software, rentals with associated services and technology customization services.\nSince there are more variable factors affecting gross profit margins in the Marine Technology Business, a breakdown of sales for this business in the Current Nine Month Period\nis set out below:\nJuly 31, 2024 July 31, 2023 Percentage\nDescription Products Products Change\nEquipment Sales $ 5,730,411 $ 7,215,919 (20.6)%\nEquipment Rental 1,885,732 1,088,855 73.2%\nSoftware Sales 653,759 784,046 (16.6)%\nServices 1,846,122 1,182,019 56.2%\nTotal Net Sales $ 10,116,024 $ 10,270,839 (1.5)%\nThe decrease in Equipment Sales in the Current Nine Month Period is largely due to the sharp fall in revenue from the Americas which was $1,660,492 in the Current Nine\nMonth Period compared to $3,562,038 in the Previous Nine Month Period, representing a decrease of 53.4%. We believe this is a result of the upcoming Presidential Election\nwhich has seen funding gaps and slowdown in procurement under Defense Programs (which has affected acquisition programs like the DAVD). This is not unusual and\ngenerally the convention is to postpone new acquisitions until the outcome of the election is decided.\nIn the Current Nine Month Period Depreciation expense relating to our rental assets increased by 11.0% and was $292,590 compared to $263,705 in the Previous Nine Month\nPeriod.\nFurther information on the performance of each Segment including revenues by product and geography can be found in Notes 12 and 13 (Segment Analysis and Disaggregation\nof Revenue) to the unaudited consolidated financial statements.\nResearch and Development (R&D): R&D expenditures in the Current Nine Month Period were $1,524,817 compared to the $1,538,684 in the Previous Nine Month Period,\nrepresenting a decrease of 0.9%.\n● Services Business\nDuring the Current Nine Month Period, the Services Business R&D expenditure increased by $93,791 or 379.6% from $24,711 in the Previous Nine Month Period to $118,502\nin the Current Nine Month Period. R&D expenditure is primarily incurred by the Services Business on its Thermite® range of mission computers and other developments which\nthe business deem will advance its business strategy. The Thermite® product line remains important to the Services Business for growth and diversification of revenue. As we\nunderstand our customer base requirements for the Thermite® mission computers, we may incur more R&D expenditure on developing this range of products.\n● Marine Technology Business\nDuring the Current Nine Month Period R&D expenditure in the Marine Technology Business decreased by $107,658 or 7.1% from $1,513,973 in the Previous Nine Month\nPeriod to $1,406,315. R&D expenditure is incurred by this business in connection with investments in developing its products and solutions. This expenditure is an essential\npart of our business, as our market competitiveness is predicated on continued innovation.\nPercentage\nSegment July 31, 2024 July 31, 2023 Change\nProducts Segment R&D Expenditures $ 1,406,315 $ 1,513,973 (7.1)%\nServices Segment R&D Expenditures $ 118,502 $ 24,711 379.6%\n31\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses (SG&A): SG&A expenses for the Current Nine Month Period decreased by 1.4% and were $6,052,350 compared to $6,138,968\nin the Previous Nine Month Period.\nThe modest decrease in SG&A in the Current Nine Month Period is largely attributed to the significant fall in stock compensation expense; most of the other areas of\nexpenditure within this category have increased when compared to the Previous Nine Months including general office costs which have increased by 49.0%.\nSG&A includes transactions which are cash charges and non-cash charges. The non-cash charges transactions comprise depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation\ncharges and exchange rate variance. In the Current Nine Month Period non-cash transactions as a percentage of SG&A were 10.5% compared to 19.0% in the Previous Nine\nMonth Period. In the Current Nine Month Period there was notably a significant reduction in stock based compensation charges which were $86,843 in the Current Nine Month\nPeriod compared to $488,764 in the Previous Nine Month Period. Exchange rate variance on transactions in the Current Nine Month Period was $182,626 compared to\n$341,317 in the Previous Nine Month Period.\nKey Areas of SG&A Expenditure across the Group for the Current Nine Month Period compared to the Previous Nine Month Period are:\nJuly 31, July 31, Percentage\nExpenditure 2024 2023 Change\nWages and Salaries $ 2,748,812 $ 2,617,304 5.0%\nLegal and Professional Fees (including accounting and audit) $ 1,190,181 $ 1,232,157 (3.4)%\nMarketing $ 317,778 $ 149,262 112.9%\nWages and salaries in the Current Nine Month Period increased by 5.0% over the Previous Nine Month Period which largely reflects inflationary conditions. We anticipate that\non a full fiscal year basis this category will increase materially over the fiscal year 2023 expense. We are currently operating on a reduced headcount and have several vacancies\nand are also expanding our management team.\nThe decrease in the “Legal and Professional” category of expenditures in the Current Nine Month Period reflects the timing of services performed. On a full year basis, we\nanticipate this category of expenditures will be in line with the Previous Year.\nOur marketing comprises a range of activities which include trade shows in different parts of the world, particularly in Europe, North America, Asia and the Middle East. As we\nincrease our efforts around sales & marketing, we anticipate this area of expenditure will increase. In the Current Nine Month Period, our marketing costs include fees\nassociated with hiring our Business Development Focus Group Consultants in the USA which have been hired to assist with developing our Defense Market strategy and\nidentifying opportunities for our technology within Defense Programs in the US. On a full fiscal year basis, the cost of this service will be $222,000 excluding expenses.\nOverhead related costs as a percentage of revenue for Current Nine Month Period, compared to the Previous Nine Month Period\nGeneral corporate administrative expenses in the Current Nine Month Period were $1,642,771 or 10.8% of revenue and $1,866,824 or 11.8% of revenue in the Previous Nine\nMonth Period, respectively. For more information on general corporate administrative expenses, please see Note 12 (Segment Analysis).\nOperating Income: Our income from our operating activities in the Current Nine Month Period was $3,296,541 as compared to $3,063,818 in the Previous Nine Month Period,\nwhich represents an increase of 7.6%. This is due to the increase in our gross profit in conjunction with a modest decrease in our total operating expense in the Current Nine\nMonth Period.\nOther Income: In the Current Nine Month Period, this increased by 88.0% and was $758,864 as compared to $403,693 in the Previous Nine Month Period. In the Current Nine\nMonth Period $716,017 of our Other Income is attributed to interest earned on our 3-month rolling certified deposit accounts. See Note 6 (Composition of Certain Financial\nStatement Captions) for a more detailed analysis of this. We anticipate that the interest earned on these certified deposit accounts will be material in the future if we continue to\nhold this level of cash in these accounts and interest rates remain broadly the same or continue to rise.\nNet Income before income taxes: In the Current Nine Month Period, we had income before income taxes of $4,055,405 as compared to $3,467,511 in the Previous Nine Month\nPeriod, representing an increase of 17.0%. This is largely due to an increase in interest earned on our certified deposit account, which was $716,017 compared to $395,161 in\nthe Previous Nine Month Period. For more information on this, please refer to Note 6 (Composition of Certain Financial Statement Captions) for more information on our\ncertified deposits.\n32\nNet Income: In the Current Nine Month Period we had Net Income of $3,319,784 compared to $3,445,114 in the Previous Nine Month Period, representing a decrease of 3.6%.\nThe decrease in Net Income is largely due to an increase in our tax liability. In the Current Nine Month Period we have provided for total tax expense of $735,621 compared to\n$22,397 in the Previous Nine Month Period. In general, our tax liability included in our consolidated financial results will depend on the composition of our consolidated\nincome or loss. In particular, the percentage of income or loss attributed to the Company and its US entities, and the percentage of income or loss attributed to its foreign\nsubsidiaries. In the Current Nine Month Period we recorded Current Tax Expense of $482,683 compared to $137,555, representing an increase of 250.9% when compared to\nthe Previous Nine Month Period, and Deferred Tax Expense of $252,938 compared to a Tax Benefit of $115,158 in the Previous Nine Month Period. In the Current Nine Month\nPeriod the Company’s UK subsidiaries generated a taxable income but have carryforward losses and R&D tax credits which will be used to defray tax liability for these\nsubsidiaries and therefore no provision for tax liability has been made in our consolidated results for the UK subsidiaries. The Company’s Danish subsidiary generated taxable\nincome in the Current Nine Month Period resulting in a tax provision of 22.0% in our consolidated results. We also made provision for Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income of\n$247,000 for the Current Nine Month Period.\nComprehensive Income (loss). In the Current Nine Month Period Comprehensive Income was $4,305,061 compared to $5,983,620 for the Previous Nine Month Period\nreflecting significant adjustments resulting from foreign currency translations. This category is affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange transactions both relating\nto our profit and loss expenses and our assets and liabilities on our balance sheet and are largely paper losses or gains, as may be applicable in the reporting period. A significant\npart of the Company’s operations is based in the UK and Denmark, and therefore a significant part of our financial transactions is performed in British Pounds and Danish\nKroner which are translated into USD for reporting purposes. In the Previous Nine Month Period we had a significant gain of $2,538,506 on foreign currency translation\nadjustment transactions compared to a lower gain on these transactions in the Current Nine Month Period of $985,277. In the Current Nine Month Period, for the purpose of\nreporting revenue and expenses, the value of the British Pound when compared to the Previous Nine Month Period increased by 2.4% against the USD and the Danish Kroner\nincreased by 0.4%, respectively. For the purpose of reporting asset and liabilities, the British Pound and the Danish Kroner both increased by 5.8% and 2.4% respectively.\nSee Table 2 under the MD&A section which concerns “Inflation & Foreign Currency”, and which shows the impact of the currency adjustments on our Income Statement and\nBalance Sheet in the Current Nine Month Period compared to the Previous Nine Month Period.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of July 31, 2024, the Company had an accumulated deficit of $7,732,703, working capital of $42,682,046, cash and cash equivalent of $25,217,965 and stockholders’ equity\nof $52,805,037. For the nine months ended July 31, 2024, the Company’s operating activities provided cash of $458,013.\nThe Company entered into a $4,000,000 revolving line of credit with HSBC NA on November 27, 2019, at prime. The outstanding balance on the line of credit was $0 as of\nJuly 31, 2024. This revolving credit line will expire on November 26, 2024, unless renewed.\nInflation and Foreign Currency\nThe Company and its subsidiaries maintain their accounts in the native currencies of their operations, and which are:\nUS Dollars For US Operations\nBritish Pound For United Kingdom Operations\nDanish Kroner For Danish Operations\nAustralian Dollars For Australian Operations (operations are currently dormant)\nIndian Rupees For Indian Operations (operations are currently dormant)\nThe Company’s consolidated financial results therefore include the translation of its subsidiaries functional currencies into U.S Dollar. See “Note 5 - Foreign Currency\nTranslation” of our unaudited consolidated financial statements, for more information on the applicable rates used for our Balance Sheet transactions and Statement of Income\nand Comprehensive Income.\nThe Company’s consolidated results are a combination of its US and foreign operations and these companies maintain their accounts in the functional currencies of their\njurisdictions, which are noted above. Fluctuations in currency exchange rates can directly impact on the Company’s sales, profitability and financial position when the\ntransactions of the foreign subsidiaries are translated from their functional currencies into USD for financial reporting purposes. In addition, the Company is also subject to\ncurrency fluctuation risk with respect to certain foreign currency denominated receivables and payables incurred in the ordinary course of its business operations (cross-border\ntransactions such as inventory purchasing). In general, the Company’s subsidiaries perform financial transactions in their native currencies. Occasionally a subsidiary may\nperform financial transactions in currencies other than its native or functional currency (purchasing inventory from a foreign supplier, for example, in foreign currency).\nFurthermore, the Company holds significant cash balances in foreign currencies, such as British Pound, Euro and Danish Kroner. The Company cannot predict the extent to\nwhich currency fluctuations may affect its business and financial position, and there is a risk that such fluctuations may have an adverse impact on the Company’s sales, profits\nand financial position.\n33\nThrough applying the Constant Rate to the Income Statement Transactions and the Balance Sheet Transactions, the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations can be evaluated.\n“Constant Rate” is defined as follows:\n“Revenue and Expenses (Income Statement Transactions) for the three months ended July 31, 2024” the Constant Rate is defined as the prevailing average exchange rate which\nwas applied in the Previous Quarter.\n“Revenue and Expenses (Income Statement Transactions) for the nine months ended July 31, 2024” the Constant Rate is defined as the prevailing average exchange rate which\nwas applied in the Previous Nine Month Period.\n“Balance Sheet Transaction” the Constant Rate is defined as this is the prevailing exchange rate as of October 31, 2023.\nInformation is not specified for INR as there is a limited scope of operations in this jurisdiction and therefore contributions are immaterial. However, the information for INR is\nincluded in the totals.\nTable 1: Three Months ended July 31, 2024 (Current Quarter)\nBased Based Based\nBritish Pounds Australian Dollar Danish Kroner TOTAL USD\nActual Constant Actual Constant Actual Constant Actual Constant *Total\nResults Rates Results Rates Results Rates Results Rates Effect\n($) ($) ($) ($) ($) ($) ($) ($) ($)\nRevenues 1,627,093 1,615,868 - - 1,385,323 1,396,140 3,012,416 3,012,008 408\nCosts 1,946,764 1,933,334 1,426 1,428 182,633 184,059 2,139,253 2,127,369 11,884\nNet profit (losses) from operations (319,671) (317,466) (1,426) (1,428) 1,202,690 1,212,081 873,163 884,639 (11,476)\nAssets 25,127,280 23,744,486 20,015 19,395 1,673,230 1,633,638 26,833,031 25,410,084 1,422,947\nLiabilities (1,556,565) (1,470,905) (1,866) (1,808) (455,602) (444,822) (2,023,951) (1,927,499) (96,452)\nNet assets 23,570,715 22,273,581 18,149 17,587 1,217,628 1,188,816 24,809,080 23,482,585 1,326,495\nThis table shows that net income from operations increased in the Current Quarter by $11,476 and net assets decreased by $1,326,495, when applying the Constant Rate applied\nin the Previous Quarter (versus the Current Quarter’s exchange rate).\n* Total Effect summary column data is the difference between the Actual Results in the reporting period and the results when the Constant Rate is applied.\nTable 2: Nine Months ended July 31, 2024 (Current Nine Month Period)\nBased Based Based\nBritish Pounds Australian Dollar Danish Kroner TOTAL USD\nActual Constant Actual Constant Actual Constant Actual Constant *Total\nResults Rates Results Rates Results Rates Results Rates Effect\n($) ($) ($) ($) ($) ($) ($) ($) ($)\nRevenues 7,425,667 7,248,603 - - 3,056,883 3,045,800 10,482,550 10,294,403 188,147\nCosts 6,404,678 6,251,959 5,308 5,408 550,356 548,361 6,980,782 6,828,458 152,324\nNet profit (losses) from operations 1,020,989 996,644 (5,308) (5,408) 2,506,527 2,497,439 3,501,768 3,465,945 35,823\nAssets 25,127,280 23,744,486 20,015 19,395 1,673,230 1,633,638 26,833,031 25,410,084 1,422,947\nLiabilities (1,556,565) (1,470,905) (1,866) (1,808) (455,602) (444,822) (2,023,951) (1,927,499) (96,452)\nNet assets 23,570,715 22,273,581 18,149 17,587 1,217,628 1,188,816 24,809,080 23,482,585 1,326,495\nThis table shows that net income from operations decreased in the Current Nine Month Period by $35,823 and net assets by $1,326,495, when applying the Constant Rate\napplied in the Previous Nine Month Period (versus the Current Nine Month Period exchange rate).\n* Total Effect summary column data is the difference between the Actual Results in the reporting period and the results when the Constant Rate is applied.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements.\nItem 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nNot required for smaller reporting companies.\nItem 4. Controls and Procedures\na) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nDisclosure controls and procedures are controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or\nsubmit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”) are recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the\nSecurities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that\ninformation required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal\nexecutive and financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nThe Company’s management, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Interim Chief Financial (and Principal\nAccounting) Officer, carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-\n15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) as of July 31, 2024. Based upon that evaluation the Chief Executive Officer and Interim Chief Financial Officer concluded that the\nCompany’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this report.\n(b) Changes in Internal Controls.\nThere was no change in our internal controls over financial reporting that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial\nreporting during the reporting period covered by this report.\n34\nPART II - OTHER INFORMATION\nItem 1. Legal Proceedings\nFrom time to time, we may become involved in various lawsuits and legal proceedings which arise in the ordinary course of business. However, litigation is subject to inherent\nuncertainties, and an adverse result in these or other matters may arise from time to time that may harm our business. We are currently not aware of any such legal proceedings\nthat we believe will have, individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or operating results.\nItem 1A. Risks Factors\nNot required for smaller reporting companies\nItem 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds\nDuring the three month period ended July 31, 2024, we issued 3,750 shares of common stock to a consultant for consulting services. Another 1,500 shares of common stock\nwere due to be issued to this consultant in the said three month period but have not yet been issued. Total stock compensation expense related to these issuances was $33,548.\nThe offer, sale and issuance of the above-mentioned securities was exempt from registration under the Securities Act in reliance on Section 4(2) of the Securities Act, including\nRegulation D and Rule 506 promulgated thereunder, relative to transactions by an issuer not involving a public offering. All purchasers of securities in transactions exempt\nfrom registration pursuant to Regulation D represented to us that he is a accredited investor and acquired the shares for investment purposes only and not with a view to, or for\nsale in connection with, any distribution thereof and he could bear the risks of the investment and could hold the securities for an indefinite period of time.

Even in somewhat visible environments, situational awareness, navigation and topside communication can be\nproblematic and very limited. The tasks the diver is expected to perform are technical in nature and often in complex hostile\nlocations. This requires prior detailed information and instruction. Divers, depending on the water depth, have\nlimited time on the seafloor to perform this tasks – this could be as little as 20 minutes.\n(cid:0)†\nSOLUTION Diver Augmented Vision Display System\nThe DAVD system radically transforms the dive mask or helmet into an immersive display capable of providing everything\nfrom life support data, to live high resolution 3D Sonar Data (Echoscope®), to advanced navigation displays to 3D\nAugmented reality displays.\nrmatnInfoio e pDatapLifSuort Nav gmentigationu3DAed atScenae DPrectoj\n26\n* 26\nSummary of Growth Accelerators\nCurrent (Commercial) Diving Systems\niving, the d dn nt Isuliecurreppsu rface ER DIV y onl shares analog omms thvoice cwe ith IDETOPS .
