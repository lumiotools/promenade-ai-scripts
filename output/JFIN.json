(“Jiayin” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: JFIN), a leading fintech platform in China, today announced its unaudited financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024.\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Operational and Financial Highlights:**\n\n  * Loan facilitation volume1 was RMB26.7 billion (US$3.8 billion), representing an increase of 10.3% from the same period of 2023. \n  * Average borrowing amount per borrowing was RMB7,629 (US$1,087), representing a decrease of 30.5% from the same period of 2023. \n  * Repeat borrowing rate2 was 67.8% compared with 71.5% in the same period of 2023. \n  * Net revenue was RMB1,444.9 million (US$205.9 million), representing a decrease of 1.5% from the same period of 2023. \n  * Income from operation was RMB311.9 million (US$44.4 million), representing a decrease of 18.3% from the same period of 2023. \n  * Net income was RMB269.6 million (US$38.4 million), representing a decrease of 16.8% from the same period of 2023.\n\n\n\nMr. Yan Dinggui, the Company’s Founder, Director and Chief Executive Officer, commented: “As we close out the third quarter of 2024, I’m proud to report continued strong performance, with a significant year-over-year increase in both loan facilitation volume and related revenue. Our loan facilitation volume reached RMB26.7 billion in the third quarter, a 10.3% increase compared with the same period last year. Loan facilitation service revenue grew 18.1% to RMB1,105.7 million. This growth reflects our strategic focus on innovation, risk management, and market diversification. We’ve successfully leveraged technology to enhance operational efficiency and borrower experience, while maintaining a sharp eye on risk resilience. We are confident that our adaptable business model and commitment to sustainable growth will enable us to capture new opportunities and deliver long-term value to our shareholders.”\n\n___________________________\n\n1 “Loan facilitation volume” refers the loan facilitation volume facilitated in Mainland China during the period presented.2 “Repeat borrowing rate” refers to the repeat borrowers as a percentage of all of our borrowers in Mainland China.“Repeat borrowers” during a certain period refers to borrowers who have borrowed in such period and have borrowed at least twice since such borrowers’ registration on our platform until the end of such period. **Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results**\n\n**Net revenue** was RMB1,444.9 million (US$205.9 million), representing a decrease of 1.5% from the same period of 2023.\n\nRevenue from loan facilitation services was RMB1,105.7 million (US$157.6 million), representing an increase of 18.1% from the same period of 2023. The increase was primarily driven by service fee optimization within our loan facilitation operations and increased loan facilitation volume from the Company’s institutional funding partners.\n\nRevenue from releasing of guarantee liabilities was RMB251.7 million (US$35.9 million) compared with RMB397.9 million in the same period of 2023.The year-over-year decrease was primarily due to the decrease in average outstanding loan balances for which the Company provided guarantee services.\n\nOther revenue was RMB87.5 million (US$12.4 million), compared with RMB131.9 million for the same period of 2023. The decrease was mainly due to the decrease in revenue from individual investor referral services.\n\n**Facilitation and servicing expense** was RMB419.1 million (US$59.7 million) compared with RMB544.3 million for the same period of 2023. This was primarily due to decreased expenses related to financial guarantee services, which was partially offset by the effect of increased loan facilitation volume.\n\n**Allowance for uncollectible receivables, contract assets, loans receivable and others** was RMB11.6 million (US$1.7 million), representing an increase of 36.5% from the same period of 2023, primarily due to increased balances of receivables arising from loan facilitation.\n\n**Sales and marketing expense** was RMB550.3 million (US$78.4 million), representing an increase of 34.9% from the same period of 2023, primarily due to an increase in borrower acquisition expenses.\n\n**General and administrative expense** was RMB56.1 million (US$8.0 million), representing an increase of 5.5% from the same period of 2023, primarily driven by an increase in expenditures for employee compensation and related benefits.\n\n**Research and development expense** was RMB95.9 million (US$13.7 million), representing an increase of 36.0% from the same period of 2023, primarily driven by an increase in expenditures for employee compensation and related benefits.\n\n**Income from operation** was RMB311.9 million (US$44.4 million), representing a decrease of 18.3% from the same period of 2023.\n\n**Net income** was RMB269.6 million (US$38.4 million), representing a decrease of 16.8% from RMB323.9 million in the same period of 2023.\n\n**Basic and diluted net income per share** were both RMB1.27 (US$0.18) compared with RMB1.51 in the third quarter of 2023. Basic and diluted net income per ADS were both RMB5.08 (US$0.72) compared with RMB6.04 in the third quarter of 2023. Each ADS represents four Class A ordinary shares of the Company.\n\n**Cash and cash equivalents** were RMB741.2 million (US$105.6 million) as of September 30, 2024, compared with RMB880.2 million as of June 30, 2024.\n\nThe following table provides the delinquency rates of all outstanding loans on the Company’s platform in Mainland China as of the respective dates indicated.\n\n**Delinquent for**  \n---  \n**As of**| **1-30days**| **31-60days**| **61-90days**| **91 -180days**| **More than 180 days**  \n(%)  \nDecember 31, 2021| 1.31| 0.90| 0.72| 1.78| 2.12  \nDecember 31, 2022| 1.01| 0.67| 0.51| 1.18| 2.02  \nDecember 31, 2023| 1.13| 0.90| 0.68| 1.48| 2.07  \nMarch 31, 2024| 0.99| 0.85| 0.68| 1.63| 2.62  \nJune 30, 2024| 0.96| 0.83| 0.67| 1.61| 2.60  \nSeptember 30, 2024| 0.93| 0.76| 0.55| 1.32| 2.49  \n  \nThe following chart and table display the historical cumulative M3+ Delinquency Rate by Vintage for loan products facilitated through the Company’s platform in Mainland China.\n\n![M3+ Delinquency Rate by Vintage](https://ml.globenewswire.com/Resource/Download/8192de01-1462-4730-9c79-d7659198df5d/jiayin.jpg)\n\n**Business Outlook**\n\nThe Company expects its loan facilitation volume for the fourth quarter of 2024 to reach no less than RMB25 billion. This forecast reflects the Company’s current and preliminary views on the market and operational conditions, which are subject to change.\n\n**Recent Development**\n\n**_Dividend Policy_**\n\nThe board of directors of the Company (the “Board”) previously approved and adopted a dividend policy on March 28, 2023, (the “Existing Dividend Policy”) under which the Company may choose to declare and distribute a cash dividend twice each fiscal year, starting from 2023, at an aggregate amount of no less than 15% of the net income after tax of the Company in the previous fiscal year.\n\nOn November 19, 2024, the Board approved and adopted an amended dividend policy (the “Amended Dividend Policy”) to replace the Company’s Existing Dividend Policy in its entirety, with immediate effect. Under the Amended Dividend Policy, the Company may choose to declare and distribute a cash dividend once each fiscal year, starting from 2025, at an aggregate amount of no less than 15% of the net income after tax of the Company in the previous fiscal year. The determination to make dividend distributions in any particular fiscal year will be made at the discretion of the Board based upon factors such as the Company’s results of operations, cash flow, general financial condition, capital requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors as the Board may deem relevant.\n\n**_Share Repurchase Plan Update_**\n\nIn March 2024, the Company’s Board of Directors approved an adjustment to the existing share repurchase plan, pursuant to which the aggregate value of ordinary shares authorized for repurchase under the plan shall not exceed US$30 million.\n\nOn June 4, 2024, the Company’s Board of Directors approved to extend the share repurchase plan for a period of 12 months, commencing on June 13, 2024, and ending on June 12, 2025. Pursuant to the extended share repurchase plan, the Company may repurchase its ordinary shares through June 12, 2025, with an aggregate value not exceeding the remaining balance under the share repurchase plan. As of November 20, 2024, the Company had repurchased approximately 3.5 million of its ADSs for approximately US$15.0 million.\n\n**Conference Call**\n\nThe Company will conduct a conference call to discuss its financial results on November 20, 2024, at 8:00 AM U.S. Eastern Time (9:00 PM Beijing/Hong Kong Time on the same day).\n\nTo join the conference call, all participants must use the following link to complete the online registration process in advance.
