Reports 2024 Third Quarter Results\n\n11/08/2024\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Highlights**\n\n  * **369 homes closed, resulting in revenue, net of sales discounts, of $118.6 million**\n  * **Average sale price (“ASP”) of production-built homes was approximately $320,000 compared to $316,000 in Q3 2023**\n  * **341 net new home orders in Q3 2024 compared to 272 net new home orders in Q3 2023**\n  * **Active community count of 55 as of September 30, 2024**\n  * **Approximately 8,600 lots currently owned or controlled by the Company or related parties**\n  * **Available liquidity of $89.0 million as of September 30, 2024, comprised of $25.8 million of cash and $63.2 million of unused committed capacity under our credit facility**\n\n\n\nCOLUMBIA, S.C.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--  United Homes Group, Inc. (the “Company”) (NASDAQ: UHG) today announced results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024. \n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Operating Results**\n\nFor the third quarter 2024, net loss was $7.3 million, or $0.15 per diluted share, which included change in fair value of derivative liabilities of $7.8 million, with that change predominantly due to changes in fair value on potential earn-out consideration due to fluctuation in the stock price during the measurement period, representing a non-cash item. The earnout consideration would be paid in common shares upon reaching certain stock price hurdles. The Company is required to record the fair value of this earnout as derivative liabilities on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets and to record changes in fair value of derivative liabilities on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations, in each case until UHG shares reach certain predetermined values or expiration of the five year earnout period. Net income for the third quarter 2023 was $150.8 million, or $2.35 per diluted share, which included change in fair value of derivative liabilities of $149.7 million. Total Stockholders' equity for the third quarter 2024 was $19.8 million. Adjusted book value 1 , which excludes the derivative liability and goodwill, was $87.7 million. \n\n“We are pleased to report that growth re-accelerated at UHG in 3Q24, as a number of operational initiatives we've put in place have begun to bear fruit. This was evidenced by a 25% year-over-year increase in net new orders and a 30% year-over-year increase in closings, which translated into a 35% year-over-year increase in top-line revenues,” said Jamie Pirrello, Interim Chief Executive Officer of United Homes Group. \n\nRevenue, net of sales discounts, for the third quarter 2024 was $118.6 million, compared to $87.7 million in the third quarter 2023. Home closings during the third quarter 2024 were 369 compared to 283 in the third quarter 2023. Net new home orders during the third quarter 2024 were 341 compared to 272 in the third quarter 2023. ASP of 369 production-built homes (which does not include general contractor, custom, and build-to-rent homes) closed during the third quarter 2024 was approximately $320,000, compared to $316,000 during the third quarter 2023 for 268 production-built homes (which does not include 15 general contractor, custom, and build-to-rent homes), representing a 1.4% increase. \n\nGross profit percentage during the third quarter of 2024 was 18.9% compared to 19.8% during the third quarter 2023. Adjusted gross profit percentage 2 in the third quarter 2024 was 20.6%, compared to 22.1% in the third quarter 2023. UHG's gross profit and adjusted gross profit percentage decreased primarily due to the Company continuing to offer attractive sales incentives to homebuyers. \n\nSelling, general and administrative expenses (“SG&A”) as a percentage of revenues was 15.8% in the third quarter 2024, which included $1.6 million of stock-based compensation and $0.7 million of transaction-related expenses. Excluding stock-based compensation, and transaction-related expenses, Adjusted SG&A 3 for the third quarter 2024 was 13.9% of revenues. \n\nAdjusted EBITDA 4 during the third quarter 2024 was $9.0 million compared to $8.8 million during the third quarter 2023. \n\n**Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Operating Results**\n\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net income was $46.2 million, or $0.86 per diluted share, which included change in fair value of derivative liabilities of $50.7 million, with that change predominantly due to changes in fair value on potential earn-out consideration due to fluctuation in the stock price during the measurement period, representing a non-cash item. Net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was $191.7 million, or $3.61 per diluted share, which included change in fair value of derivative liabilities of $185.0 million. \n\nRevenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were $328.9 million, compared to $304.6 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Home closings during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 1,017 compared to 996 in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Net new orders during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 1,048 compared to 1,002 in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. \n\nGross profit percentage during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 17.7% compared to 19.1% during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Adjusted gross profit percentage in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 20.7%, compared to 21.2% in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in gross profit percentage is primarily attributable to higher cost of sales due to higher level of incentives and amortization from purchase price accounting adjustments. The Company's adjusted gross profit percentage decreased due largely to the Company continuing to offer attractive sales incentives to homebuyers. \n\nSG&A expenses as a percentage of revenues was 16.8% in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, which included $4.9 million of stock-based compensation, $2.4 million of transaction-related expenses, and $1.2 million related to severance costs associated with the June 2024 workforce reduction. Excluding these stock-based compensation, transaction-related, and severance cost expenses, Adjusted SG&A for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 14.2% of revenues. \n\nAdjusted EBITDA during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was $23.9 million compared to $30.4 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. \n\n**Earnings Conference Call**\n\nThe Company will host a conference call via live webcast for investors and other interested parties beginning at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time on Friday, November 8, 2024.

The company focuses on southeastern markets with 55 active communities in South Carolina, North Carolina and Georgia. \n\nUHG employs a land-light operating strategy with a focus on the design, construction and sale of entry-level, first move-up and second move-up single-family houses. UHG currently designs, builds and sells detached single-family homes, and, to a lesser extent, attached single-family homes, including duplex homes and town homes in three major market regions in South Carolina: Midlands, Upstate, and Coastal, and also has a presence in Georgia and North Carolina. UHG seeks to operate its homebuilding business in high-growth markets, with substantial in-migrations and employment growth. \n\nUnder its land-light lot operating strategy, UHG controls its supply of finished building lots through lot option contracts with third parties, related parties, and land bank partners, which provide UHG with the right to purchase finished lots after they have been developed by the applicable third party or related party. This land-light operating strategy provides UHG with the ability to amass a pipeline of lots without the same risks associated with acquiring and developing raw land. \n\nAs UHG reviews potential geographic markets into which it could expand its homebuilding business, either organically or through strategic acquisitions, it intends to focus on selecting markets with positive population and employment growth trends, favorable migration patterns, attractive housing affordability, low state and local income taxes, and desirable lifestyle and weather characteristics. \n\n**Forward-Looking Statements**\n\nCertain statements contained in this earnings release, other than historical facts, may be considered forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”) and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”).

The Company defines adjusted gross profit as gross profit excluding the effects of capitalized interest expensed in cost of sales, amortization included in homebuilding cost of sales (primarily adjustments resulting from the application of purchase accounting in connection with acquisitions), severance expense in cost of sales, abandoned project costs, and non-recurring remediation costs. The Company’s management believes this information is meaningful because it separates the impact that capitalized interest and non-recurring costs directly expensed in cost of sales have on gross profit to provide a more specific measurement of the Company’s gross profits. However, because adjusted gross profit information excludes certain balances expensed in cost of sales, which have real economic effects and could impact the Company’s results of operations, the utility of adjusted gross profit information as a measure of the Company’s operating performance may be limited. Other companies may not calculate adjusted gross profit information in the same manner that the Company does. Accordingly, adjusted gross profit information should be considered only as a supplement to gross profit information as a measure of the Company’s performance. \n\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of adjusted gross profit to the GAAP financial measure of gross profit for each of the periods indicated. \n\n**Three Months Ended September 30,** |  **Nine Months Ended September 30,**  \n---|---  \n**2024** |  **2023** |  **2024** |  **2023**  \nRevenue, net of sales discounts  |  $  |  118,643,955  |  $  |  87,728,091  |  $  |  328,902,237  |  $  |  304,646,422   \nCost of sales  |  96,260,928  |  70,317,796  |  270,847,467  |  246,540,874   \nGross profit  |  $  |  22,383,027  |  $  |  17,410,295  |  $  |  58,054,770  |  $  |  58,105,548   \nInterest expense in cost of sales  |  1,524,748  |  1,531,318  |  6,696,856  |  6,078,117   \nAmortization in homebuilding cost of sales (a) |  573,183  |  —  |  2,434,356  |  —   \nSeverance expense in cost of sales  |  —  |  —  |  324,540  |  —   \nAbandoned project costs  |  —  |  —  |  320,000  |  —   \nNon-recurring remediation costs  |  —  |  447,327  |  109,422  |  447,327   \nAdjusted gross profit  |  $  |  24,480,958  |  $  |  19,388,940  |  $  |  67,939,944  |  $  |  64,630,992   \nGross profit % (b) |  18.9  |  %  |  19.8  |  %  |  17.7  |  %  |  19.1  |  %   \nAdjusted gross profit % (b) |  20.6  |  %  |  22.1  |  %  |  20.7  |  %  |  21.2  |  %   \n______________________________   \n---  \n(a) Represents expense recognized resulting from purchase accounting adjustments  \n(b) Calculated as a percentage of revenue  \n  \n**UNITED HOMES GROUP, INC** GAAP TO NON-GAAP RECONCILIATIONS (Unaudited) \n\nEarnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, and adjusted EBITDA are supplemental non-GAAP financial measures used by management of the Company. The Company defines EBITDA as net income before (i) capitalized interest expensed in cost of sales, (ii) interest expensed in other (expense) income, net, (iii) depreciation and amortization, and (iv) taxes. The Company defines adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA before stock-based compensation expense, transaction cost expense, severance expense, abandoned project costs, non-recurring remediation costs, amortization included in homebuilding cost of sales (adjustments resulting from the application of purchase accounting in connection with acquisitions), change in fair value of derivative liabilities, and non-recurring loss on disposal of leasehold improvements. Management of the Company believes EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are useful because they provide a more effective evaluation of UHG’s operating performance and allow comparison of UHG’s results of operations from period to period without regard to UHG’s financing methods or capital structure or other items that impact comparability of financial results from period to period such as fluctuations in interest expense or effective tax rates, levels of depreciation or amortization, or unusual items. EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as alternatives to, or more meaningful than, net income or any other measure as determined in accordance with GAAP. UHG’s computations of EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to EBITDA or adjusted EBITDA of other companies. \n\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA to the GAAP financial measure of net income for each of the periods indicated. \n\n**Three Months Ended September 30,** |  **Nine Months Ended September 30,**  \n---|---  \n**2024** |  **2023** |  **2024** |  **2023**  \nNet (loss) income  |  $  |  (7,339,235  |  )  |  $  |  150,842,687  |  $  |  46,239,022  |  $  |  191,701,118   \nInterest expense in cost of sales  |  1,524,748  |  1,531,318  |  6,696,856  |  6,078,117   \nInterest expense in other expense, net  |  3,649,305  |  2,039,512  |  9,369,598  |  5,458,821   \nDepreciation and amortization  |  522,483  |  381,917  |  1,448,777  |  848,693   \nTaxes  |  7,879  |  1,766,398  |  (896,148  |  )  |  2,404,242   \nEBITDA  |  $  |  (1,634,820  |  )  |  $  |  156,561,832  |  $  |  62,858,105  |  $  |  206,490,991   \nStock-based compensation expense  |  1,567,945  |  1,106,014  |  4,918,036  |  6,015,700   \nTransaction cost expense  |  687,440  |  385,180  |  2,428,344  |  2,451,298   \nSeverance expense  |  —  |  —  |  1,504,416  |  —   \nAbandoned project costs  |  —  |  —  |  320,000  |  —   \nNon-recurring remediation costs  |  —  |  447,327  |  109,422  |  447,327   \nAmortization in homebuilding cost of sales (b) |  573,183  |  —  |  2,434,356  |  —   \nChange in fair value of derivative liabilities  |  7,784,965  |  (149,703,161  |  )  |  (50,650,309  |  )  |  (184,981,652  |  )   \nAdjusted EBITDA  |  $  |  8,978,713  |  $  |  8,797,192  |  $  |  23,922,370  |  $  |  30,423,664   \nEBITDA margin (a) |  (1.4  |  )%  |  178.5  |  %  |  19.1  |  %  |  67.8  |  %   \nAdjusted EBITDA margin (a) |  7.6  |  %  |  10.0  |  %  |  7.3  |  %  |  10.0  |  %   \n______________________________   \n---  \n(a) Calculated as a percentage of revenue  \n(b) Represents expense recognized resulting from purchase accounting adjustments  \n  \n**UNITED HOMES GROUP, INC** GAAP TO NON-GAAP RECONCILIATIONS Continued \n\nAdjusted selling, general and administrative expense, or adjusted SG&A, is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure used by management of the Company.

(the “Company”) (NASDAQ: UHG), today announced that on October 1, 2024, Michael Nieri, the Company’s founder, Chairman, and Chief Executive Officer, will transition to Executive Chairman of the Company. As Executive Chairman, Mr. Nieri will shift his leadership time and energies to focus primarily on the Company’s strategic future. Concurrently with the effectiveness of Mr. Nieri’s transition to Executive Chairman, Jamie Pirrello, currently a member of the Company’s board of directors and a consultant to the Company, was named interim Chief Executive Officer of the Company. The Company’s board of directors intends to undertake a search to identify the Company’s next permanent CEO and will consider internal and external candidates. \n\nDuring his tenure with the Company to date, Mr. Nieri has overseen the tremendous growth and transformation of the Company from the founding of Great Southern Homes in 2004 through its transition to becoming a public company in 2023. Mr. Nieri also helmed the Company through its completion of three homebuilder acquisitions since becoming a public company, and the Company’s recent designation as 2024’s Builder of the Year by Builder Magazine. \n\nMr. Nieri stated, “I am incredibly proud of what this company has accomplished. We have assembled an excellent management team that is focused on growing the business and executing on our objectives as a public company. Our tremendous growth and transformation, including becoming a publicly traded company and listing on Nasdaq in 2023, necessitates these changes and this division of responsibilities. I’m excited about this transition to the next phase of leadership of the company and partnering with Jamie to further the company’s growth trajectory. As Executive Chairman, I will stay engaged with the company’s strategic initiatives but also explore other things that are important to me, including philanthropic activities and spending more time with my family and my grandchildren.” \n\nMr. Pirrello served as a Regional President for Century Communities, Inc. (NYSE: CCS) from 2018 through February 2023, overseeing their Southeast, Texas, and Florida regions. After leaving Century Communities, Mr. Pirrello has been the Managing Partner of Berkeley-Columbia Consulting Group, a consultancy firm focused on the homebuilding industry. He also previously served as CFO of Interior Logic Group (“ILG”), one of the nation’s largest flooring and finishes contractors to homebuilders, multifamily builders, and big box home supply stores. During his tenure at ILG, in early 2018, he guided the company through its merger with Interior Specialists, ILG’s largest competitor. From 2016 to 2017, Mr. Pirrello was the CFO of UCP, Inc. (NYSE: UCP), a San Jose-based land developer and homebuilder that was acquired by Century Communities in 2017. Before UCP, Mr. Pirrello spent most of his 30 years in homebuilding with large public and private builders, including PulteGroup, Inc. (NYSE: PHM), NVR, Inc. (NYSE: NVR), First Homebuilders of Florida, and BCB Homes, in markets throughout the United States. He has raised billions of dollars in capital, both public and private, and including debt and equity. Mr. Pirrello has extensive experience in M&A transactions and homebuilding operations. Mr. Pirrello earned two MBAs, from Columbia University and the University of California at Berkeley, a Masters in Education from The George Washington University, and his undergraduate degree in accounting from Juniata College. \n\nRobert Dozier, Vice Chairman of the Company’s board of directors, added, “On behalf of the Board, I want to sincerely thank Michael for his leadership and dedication to the company that he built. Michael has ably steered this company through headwinds in the homebuilding industry and capitalized on tailwinds, overseeing the company’s rapid growth into a premier homebuilder in the Carolinas. We are grateful for the opportunity to continue to work together in his role as Executive Chairman. With his energy and focus on the company’s strategic direction, we look forward to what the future will bring for the company.” Mr. Dozier continued, “We are excited to have Jamie step into the role of interim Chief Executive Officer. Jamie has a proven track record of operational excellence over his decades in the homebuilding industry, and we have confidence in his leadership of the company through this transition.” \n\n**About United Homes Group, Inc.**\n\nUHG is a publicly traded residential builder headquartered in Columbia, SC. The company focuses on southeastern markets with 59 active communities in South Carolina, North Carolina and Georgia. \n\nUHG employs a land-light operating strategy with a focus on the design, construction and sale of entry-level, first move-up and second move-up single-family houses. UHG currently designs, builds and sells detached single-family homes, and, to a lesser extent, attached single-family homes, including duplex homes and town homes in three major market regions in South Carolina: Midlands, Upstate, and Coastal, and also has a presence in Georgia and North Carolina. UHG seeks to operate its homebuilding business in high-growth markets, with substantial in-migrations and employment growth. \n\nUnder its land-light lot operating strategy, UHG controls its supply of finished building lots through lot option contracts with third parties, related parties, including its Land Development Affiliates, and land bank partners, which provide UHG with the right to purchase finished lots after they have been developed by the applicable third party or related party. This land-light operating strategy provides UHG with the ability to amass a pipeline of lots without the same risks associated with acquiring and developing raw land. \n\nAs UHG reviews potential geographic markets into which it could expand its homebuilding business, either organically or through strategic acquisitions, it intends to focus on selecting markets with positive population and employment growth trends, favorable migration patterns, attractive housing affordability, low state and local income taxes, and desirable lifestyle and weather characteristics. \n\n![](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=bwnews&sty=20240924777545r1&sid=q4-prod&distro=nx&lang=en)\n\n**Investor Relations Contact:** Drew Mackintosh drew@mackintoshir.com  Mobile: 310-924-9036 \n\n**Media Contact:** Erin Reeves McGinnis erinreevesmcginnis@unitedhomesgroup.com  Phone: 844-766-4663 \n\nSource: United Homes Group, Inc.\n\n[View All News](https://ir.unitedhomesgroup.com/news/default.aspx)\n"
