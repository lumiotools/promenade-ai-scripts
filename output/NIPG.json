Our event production business has demonstrated remarkable growth, achieving a 376.5% revenue increase year-over-year. In talent management, we made the strategic decision to shift away from low-margin platforms, focusing instead on high-performance opportunities that better serve our long-term objectives. These moves reflect our commitment to building a more well-rounded and robust organization. Meanwhile, our recent public listing provides us with enhanced access to capital markets, potentially accelerating our future growth initiatives.

Our game publishing division is set to contribute meaningful revenue starting in 2025, and its established profitability will enhance our overall margins. In addition, our recent term sheet with the Abu Dhabi Investment Office will provide crucial subsidies enabling us to not only achieve EBITDA breakeven much earlier than planned, but also accelerate our organic growth and attain the economy of scale for maintaining profitability even after the subsidy expires. We are optimistic about the potential of our new initiatives and are thrilled to see what the future will bring.”\n\nBen Li, CFO of NIP Group, added, “Our financial results for the first half of 2024 reflect the ongoing strategic transformation of our business. Net revenues maintained stability despite a challenging macro backdrop, primarily driven by significant expansion in our event production segment. This performance demonstrates the initial impact of our business transition initiatives. Notably, we have substantially improved our bottom line, with net losses narrowing from US$11.3 million in the first half of 2023 to US$4.7 million in the first half of 2024. Our balance sheet remains solid, providing us with the financial flexibility to execute our growth strategy while maintaining operational stability.

(“NIPG” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: NIPG), a leading digital entertainment company, today announced its unaudited financial results for the first half of 2024, demonstrating year-over-year topline growth and narrowing losses as the Company balances growth and profitability by investing in high-growth areas while optimizing costs.\n\n**First Six Months of 2024 Financial and Operational Highlights**\n\n  * Total net revenues for the first half of 2024 were US$39.3 million, compared with US$38.6 million in the same period of 2023.\n  * Gross profit for the first half of 2024 was US$2.4 million, compared with US$2.3 million in the same period of 2023.\n  * Net loss for the first half of 2024 was US$4.7 million, compared with US$11.3 million in the same period of 2023.\n  * Adjusted EBITDA for the first half of 2024 was negative US$2.6 million, compared with negative US$2.7 million in the same period of 2023.\n\n\n\n**Business Updates**\n\n  * Completed initial public offering on NASDAQ raising over $20 million of capital in July 2024.\n  * Launched esports-themed hospitality service through a strategic partnership with Homeinns Hotels Group in August 2024.\n  * Entered into the game publishing market to create a fully integrated digital entertainment ecosystem in September 2024.\n  * Acquired Young Will, a leader in teen culture-themed short video content which boasts a following of over 115 million fans across major Chinese social media platforms, to strengthen the Company’s position in talent management in October 2024.\n  * Facilitating the entry into a term sheet with the Abu Dhabi Investment Office (“ADIO”), marking the Company's expansion into the Middle East region.\n\n\n\nMario Ho, Chairman and Co-CEO of NIP Group, commented, “The first half of 2024 marked a pivotal phase in our company's evolution from an esports-focused enterprise to a comprehensive gaming company. We have successfully laid the groundwork for our revenue diversification through strategic initiatives in game publishing, talent management upgrades, and sports-themed hospitality services, while expanding our operations to encompass the Middle East market. Our event production business has demonstrated remarkable growth, achieving a 376.5% revenue increase year-over-year. In talent management, we made the strategic decision to shift away from low-margin platforms, focusing instead on high-performance opportunities that better serve our long-term objectives. These moves reflect our commitment to building a more well-rounded and robust organization. Meanwhile, our recent public listing provides us with enhanced access to capital markets, potentially accelerating our future growth initiatives. Through these strategic shifts, we are maintaining our revenue growth trajectory while expediting our path to profitability.”\n\nHicham Chahine, Co-CEO of NIP Group, commented, “Looking ahead, we plan on executing several key strategic initiatives through the remainder of the year and through 2025 that will position us for sustainable growth and improved profitability. We are front-loading our staffing and marketing investments in our event production segment, and we expect to realize significant benefits from these economies of scale in 2025 and beyond. Our game publishing division is set to contribute meaningful revenue starting in 2025, and its established profitability will enhance our overall margins. In addition, our recent term sheet with the Abu Dhabi Investment Office will provide crucial subsidies enabling us to not only achieve EBITDA breakeven much earlier than planned, but also accelerate our organic growth and attain the economy of scale for maintaining profitability even after the subsidy expires. We are optimistic about the potential of our new initiatives and are thrilled to see what the future will bring.”\n\nBen Li, CFO of NIP Group, added, “Our financial results for the first half of 2024 reflect the ongoing strategic transformation of our business. Net revenues maintained stability despite a challenging macro backdrop, primarily driven by significant expansion in our event production segment. This performance demonstrates the initial impact of our business transition initiatives. Notably, we have substantially improved our bottom line, with net losses narrowing from US$11.3 million in the first half of 2023 to US$4.7 million in the first half of 2024. Our balance sheet remains solid, providing us with the financial flexibility to execute our growth strategy while maintaining operational stability. These results underscore the effectiveness of our strategic initiatives and our commitment to balancing topline growth with lasting profitability.”\n\n**First Six Months of 2024 Financial Results**\n\n**Total net revenues** Total net revenues were US$39.3 million for the first half of 2024, compared to US$38.6 million in the same period of 2023.\n\nThe following table sets forth a breakdown of the Company’s net revenues by business segments for the period indicated.\n\n**For the Six Months Ended June 30,**  \n---  \n**2023**| **2024**  \nUS$| %| US$| %  \n**(US$ in thousands, except for %)**  \n**Net revenues:**  \nEsports teams operation| 9,849| 25.5| 8,782| 22.3  \nTalent management service| 26,896| 69.8| 21,901| 55.7  \nEvent production| 1,818| 4.7| 8,662| 22.0  \n**Total**| **38,563**| **100.0**| **39,345**| **100.0**  \n  \n**Total net revenues** for the first half of 2024 increased by 2.0% to US$39.3 million, compared with US$38.6 million in the same period of 2023.\n\n  * _Esports teams operation_.

Cost of revenues from esports teams operation for the first half of 2024 decreased by 17.9% to US$6.0 million, from US$7.3 million in the same period of 2023. The decline was primarily driven by a decrease in IP licensing fees paid to athletes under Ninjas in Pyjamas.\n  * _Talent management service_. Cost of revenues from talent management service for the first half of 2024 decreased by 15.3% to US$23.2 million, from US$27.4 million in the same period of 2023.

Gross margin for the first half of 2024 was 6.0%, compared with 5.9% in the same period of 2023.

Gross profit from event production increased to US$0.9 million in the first half of 2024, from US$0.3 million in the same period of 2023. Gross profit margin declined from 14.7% in the first half of 2023 to 10.5% in the same period of 2024, mainly due to new large-scale esports events with lower average margins that the Company hosted in the first half of 2024 as well as the Company frontloading staffing and marketing expenses to accelerate the pace towards economy of scale.\n\n\n\n**Selling and Marketing Expenses** Selling and marketing expenses for the first half of 2024 were US$2.8 million, representing a decrease of 26.7% from US$3.8 million in the same period of 2023. This was mainly attributable to a decrease in marketing and promotion expenses for talent management service, and the decrease in business costs.

General and administrative expenses excluding share-based compensation for management and administrative employees as a percentage of net revenues increased slightly from 11.8% in the first half of 2023 to 11.9% in the same period of 2024.\n\n**Other loss** for the first half of 2024 was US$0.5 million, compared with other income of US$0.2 million in the same period of 2023. The change was primarily due to a decline in government grant income.\n\n**Net loss** for the first half of 2024 was US$4.7 million, compared with US$11.3 million in the same period of 2023. \n\n**Adjusted EBITDA,** which is calculated as net loss excluding interest expense, net, income tax (benefit) expense, depreciation and amortization, and share-based compensation expenses, was negative US$2.6 million for the first half of 2024, compared with negative US$2.7 million in the same period of 2023.\n\n**Cash and cash equivalents**\n\nAs of June 30, 2024, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of US$6.8 million, compared with US$7.6 million as of December 31, 2023.\n\n**Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures**\n\nAdjusted EBITDA is calculated as net loss excluding interest expense, net, income tax (benefit) expense, depreciation and amortization and share-based compensation expense. The non-GAAP financial measure is presented to enhance investors’ overall understanding of financial performance and should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Investors are encouraged to review the reconciliation of the historical non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. As non-GAAP financial measure has material limitations as an analytical metric and may not be calculated in the same manner by all companies, it may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures used by other companies. In light of the foregoing limitations, you should not consider non-GAAP financial measure as a substitute for, or superior to, such metrics prepared in accordance with GAAP.\n\nThe following table sets forth a breakdown of non-GAAP financial measures of the company for the periods indicated.\n\n**For the Six Months Ended June 30,**  \n---  \n**2023** | **2024**  \nUS$| US$  \n**(US$ in thousands, except for %)**  \n**Net loss**| (11,271| )| (4,666| )  \nAdd:  \n**Interest expense, net**|  218| 340  \nIncome tax benefits| (818| )| (931| )  \n**Depreciation and amortization**(1) | 2,866| 2,698  \nShare-based compensation expense| 6,257| -  \n**Adjusted EBITDA**| **(2,748**| **)**| **(2,559**| **)**  \n**Adjusted EBITDA margin****(****2)**| **(7.1**| **)**| **(6.5**| **)**  \n  \nNotes:(1) Primarily consists of depreciation related to property and equipment, as well as amortization related to intangible assets (2) Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenues.\n\n**Exchange Rate Information**\n\nThe functional currency of the company’s PRC subsidiaries is RMB, which is the local currency used by the subsidiaries to determine financial position and operation result. The functional currency of Ninjas in Pyjamas is SEK, which is the local currency used by the subsidiary to determine financial position and operation result. The Group’s financial statements are reported using U.S. Dollars (“$”). The results of operations and the consolidated statements of cash flows denominated in functional currency is translated at the average rate of exchange during the reporting period. Assets and liabilities denominated in functional currencies at the balance sheet date are translated at the applicable rates of exchange in effect at that date. The equity denominated in the functional currency is translated at the historical rate of exchange at the time of capital contribution. Because cash flows are translated based on the average translation rate, amounts related to assets and liabilities reported on the consolidated statements of cash flows will not necessarily agree with changes in the corresponding balances on the consolidated balance sheets. Translation adjustments arising from the use of different exchange rates from period to period are included as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) included in consolidated statements of changes in equity (deficit). Gains or losses from foreign currency transactions are included in the results of operations.\n\nThe following table outlines the currency exchange rates published by the Federal Reserve Board were used in unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements: \n\n**As of**  \n---  \n**December 31,2023**| **June 30,****2024**  \nBalance sheet items, except for equity accounts  \nRMB against $| 7.0999| 7.2672  \nSEK against $| 10.0506| 10.5996  \n  \n**For the Six Months Ended June 30,**  \n---  \n**2023**| **2024**  \nItems in the statements of operation and comprehensive loss, and statements of cash flows  \nRMB against $| 6.9283| 7.2150  \nSEK against $| 10.4862| 10.5473  \n  \n**Recent Developments**\n\n  * On July 26, 2024, NIPG announced the pricing of its initial public offering of 2,250,000 American depositary shares (“ADSs”), at US$9.00 per ADS, for a total offering size of US$20.25 million.
