Beasley, at the time a high school principal, was awarded an FCC license to build his first radio station, WPYB-AM, a daytime-only 500-watt signal, in Benson, North Carolina. Mr. Beasley was part of a small group of broadcasting pioneers who were introducing radio to smaller cities and towns throughout the country, a technology previously unavailable outside larger cities .Like many first-time FCC licensees, he turned his budding interest in radio into a full-time calling.
