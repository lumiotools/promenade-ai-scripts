The Company is focused on\nthe development and commercialization of innovative GI product opportunities in areas of significant unmet need, leveraging\nits demonstrated expertise and capabilities in GI diseases.\nLINZESS® (linaclotide), the Company’s commercial product, is the first product approved by the United States Food\nand Drug Administration (the “U.S. FDA”) in a class of GI medicines called guanylate cyclase type C agonists (“GC-C\nagonists”) and is indicated for adult men and women suffering from irritable bowel syndrome with constipation (“IBS-C”) or\nchronic idiopathic constipation (“CIC”) and for pediatric patients ages 6-17 years-old suffering from functional constipation\n(“FC”). LINZESS is available to adult men and women suffering from IBS-C or CIC in the United States (the “U.S.”),\nMexico and Saudi Arabia, adult men and women suffering from IBS-C or chronic constipation in Japan, and IBS-C in China,\nand pediatric patients ages 6-17 years old with FC in the U.S. Linaclotide is available under the trademarked name\nCONSTELLA® to adult men and women suffering from IBS-C or CIC and pediatric patients ages 6-17 years old with FC in\nCanada, and to adult men and women suffering from IBS-C in certain European countries.\nThe Company has strategic partnerships with leading pharmaceutical companies to support the development and\ncommercialization of linaclotide throughout the world. The Company and its partner, AbbVie Inc. (together with its affiliates,\n“AbbVie”), began commercializing LINZESS in the U.S. in December 2012. Under the Company’s collaboration for North\nAmerica with AbbVie, total net sales of LINZESS in the U.S., as recorded by AbbVie, are reduced by commercial costs\nincurred by each party, and the resulting amount is shared equally between the Company and AbbVie. Additionally,\ndevelopment costs are shared equally between the Company and AbbVie.\nOutside of the U.S., the Company earns royalties as a percentage of net sales of products containing linaclotide as an\nactive ingredient by the Company’s collaboration partners. AbbVie has an exclusive license from the Company to develop and\ncommercialize linaclotide in all countries other than China (including Hong Kong and Macau), Japan and the countries and\nterritories of North America (the “AbbVie License Territory”). In addition, AbbVie has exclusive rights to commercialize\nlinaclotide in Canada as CONSTELLA and in Mexico as LINZESS. Astellas Pharma Inc. (“Astellas”), the Company’s partner\nin Japan, has an exclusive license to develop, manufacture, and commercialize linaclotide in Japan. AstraZeneca AB (together\nwith its affiliates) (“AstraZeneca”), the Company’s partner in China, has the exclusive right to develop, manufacture, and\ncommercialize products containing linaclotide in China (including Hong Kong and Macau) (the “AstraZeneca License\nTerritory”).\nIn June 2023, the Company completed a tender offer to purchase 98% of the outstanding ordinary shares of VectivBio\nHolding AG (“VectivBio”), a clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on the discovery and development of treatments\nfor severe, rare GI conditions for which there is a significant unmet medical need, at a price per share of $17.00, net to the\nshareholders of VectivBio in cash, without interest and subject to any applicable withholding taxes (the “VectivBio\nAcquisition”). In December 2023, the Company completed a squeeze-out merger under Swiss law to acquire all remaining\noutstanding ordinary shares in cash at a price per share of $17.00, and VectivBio Holding AG was merged with and into\nIronwood Pharmaceuticals GmbH, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Ironwood organized under the laws of Switzerland (the\n“Squeeze-out Merger”). Through the acquisition, the Company is advancing apraglutide, a next-generation, synthetic peptide\nanalog of glucagon-like peptide-2, for rare GI diseases, including short bowel syndrome with intestinal failure (“SBS-IF”), a\nsevere malabsorptive condition. In February 2024, the Company announced positive topline results from its pivotal Phase III\nclinical trial, STARS, which evaluated the efficacy and safety of once-weekly subcutaneous apraglutide in reducing parenteral\nsupport dependency in adult patients with SBS-IF, and plans to submit a new drug application and other regulatory filings for\napraglutide for use in adult patients with SBS who are dependent on parenteral support.\n11\nTable of Contents\nThe Company had a collaboration and license option agreement (the “COUR Collaboration Agreement”) with COUR\nPharmaceutical Development Company, Inc. (“COUR”), a biotechnology company developing novel immune-modifying\nnanoparticles to treat autoimmune diseases. The COUR Collaboration Agreement granted the Company an option (the\n“Option”) to acquire an exclusive license to research, develop, manufacture and commercialize, in the U.S., products\ncontaining CNP-104, a potential treatment for primary biliary cholangitis (“PBC”), a rare autoimmune disease targeting the\nliver. In the third quarter of 2024, the Company received from COUR the topline data from COUR’s Phase II clinical study for\nthe treatment of PBC. In September 2024, the Company notified COUR of the decision not to exercise the option to acquire an\nexclusive license to CNP-104. As a result, the collaboration and license option agreement between the Company and COUR\nhas terminated, and the Company retains no rights and has no obligations related to CNP-104.\nThese and other agreements are more fully described in Note 5, Collaboration, License and Other Agreements, to\nthese condensed consolidated financial statements.\nThe Company is advancing IW-3300, a GC-C agonist, for the potential treatment of visceral pain conditions, such as\ninterstitial cystitis / bladder pain syndrome (“IC/BPS”) and endometriosis. The Company has decided to end further\nrecruitment for the Phase II proof of concept study in IC/BPS and analyze the data once all currently enrolled patients\ncomplete the full 12-week study assessment, which will inform the next steps on the program.\nThe Company was incorporated in Delaware on January 5, 1998 as Microbia, Inc. On April 7, 2008, the Company\nchanged its name to Ironwood Pharmaceuticals, Inc. To date, the Company has dedicated a majority of its activities to the\nresearch, development and commercialization of linaclotide, as well as to the research and development of its other product\ncandidates.\n2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nBasis of Presentation\nThe accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements and the related disclosures are unaudited and have\nbeen prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. Additionally, certain information and\nfootnote disclosures normally included in the Company’s annual financial statements have been condensed or omitted.\nAccordingly, these interim condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated\nfinancial statements and notes thereto contained in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December\n31, 2023, which was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) on February 16, 2024 (the “2023 Annual\nReport on Form 10-K”).\nThe unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the same basis as the\naudited consolidated financial statements and, in the opinion of management, reflect all normal recurring adjustments\nconsidered necessary for a fair statement of the Company’s financial position as of September 30, 2024, and the results of its\noperations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, its statements of stockholders’ equity (deficit)\nfor the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, and its cash flows for the nine months ended September\n30, 2024 and 2023. The results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 are not\nnecessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the full year or any other subsequent interim period.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements as of September 30, 2024 include the accounts of\nIronwood and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Ironwood Pharmaceuticals Securities Corporation, Ironwood Pharmaceuticals\nGmbH, VectivBio AG, GlyPharma Therapeutic Inc. (“GlyPharma”), and VectivBio US, Inc. All intercompany transactions and\nbalances are eliminated in consolidation.\nFor consolidated entities in which the Company owns less than 100% of the outstanding shares, the Company records\nnet income (loss) and comprehensive income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests in its consolidated statements of\nincome (loss) and comprehensive income (loss), respectively, equal to the percentage of the common stock ownership interest\nretained in such entities by the noncontrolling parties. The Company reports noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities as\na component of equity separate from the Company’s equity.\n12\nTable of Contents\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of condensed consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted\naccounting principles requires the Company’s management to make estimates and judgments that may affect the reported\namounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the condensed consolidated\nfinancial statements, and the amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported periods. On an ongoing basis, the\nCompany’s management evaluates its estimates, judgments and methodologies. Estimates and assumptions in the condensed\nconsolidated financial statements include those related to fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in acquisitions;\nrevenue recognition; accounts receivable; useful lives of long-lived assets; impairment of long-lived assets, including\ngoodwill; valuation procedures for right-of-use assets and operating lease liabilities; income taxes, including uncertain tax\npositions and the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets; research and development expenses; contingencies; defined\nbenefit pension liabilities; and share-based compensation. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on\nvarious other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about\nthe carrying values of assets and liabilities. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different\nassumptions or conditions. Changes in estimates are reflected in reported results in the period in which they become known.\nSummary of Significant Accounting Policies\nThe Company’s significant accounting policies are described in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,\nin the 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company did not\nadopt any additional significant accounting policies.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nFrom time to time, new accounting pronouncements are issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the\n“FASB”) or other standard setting bodies that are adopted by the Company as of the specified effective date. The Company\ndid not adopt any new accounting pronouncements during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 that had a\nmaterial effect on its condensed consolidated financial statements.\nIn October 2023, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2023-06, Disclosure Improvements:\nCodification Amendment in Response to the SEC’s Disclosure Update and Simplification Initiative (“ASU 2023-06”). The\nguidance in ASU 2023-06 aligns the disclosure and presentation requirements in the FASB Accounting Standards Codification\nwith the SEC’s regulations. The effective date for each amendment will be the date on which the SEC's removal of the related\ndisclosure requirement from Regulation S-X or Regulation S-K becomes effective, with early adoption prohibited. Any\namendments not removed by the SEC by June 30, 2027 will not become effective. The amendments adopted in ASU 2023-06\nwill be applied prospectively. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of ASU 2023-06 may have on\nits disclosures in its condensed consolidated financial statements.\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280) (“ASU 2023-07”). The\nguidance in ASU 2023-07 expands prior reportable segment disclosure requirements by requiring entities to disclose\nsignificant segment expenses that are regularly provided to the Chief Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”) and details of\nhow the CODM uses financial reporting to assess their segment’s performance. The guidance is effective for fiscal years\nbeginning after December 15, 2023 and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, with early\nadoption permitted. The ASU is required to be applied retrospectively upon adoption. The Company is currently evaluating\nthe impact that the adoption of ASU 2023-07 may have on its condensed consolidated financial statements.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax\nDisclosures (“ASU 2023-09”). The guidance in ASU 2023-09 improves the transparency of annual income tax disclosures by\nrequiring greater disaggregation of information in the rate reconciliation and income taxes paid disaggregated by jurisdiction.\nThe standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. Upon adoption,\nASU 2023-09 may be applied prospectively or retrospectively. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that the\nadoption of ASU 2023-09 may have on its disclosures in its annual consolidated financial statements.\n13\nTable of Contents\nIn November 2024, the FASB issued ASU No. 2024-03, Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses (“ASU 2024-\n03”). The guidance in ASU 2024-03 requires new financial statement disclosures in tabular format, disaggregating information\nabout prescribed categories underlying any relevant income statement expense captions. The standard is effective for fiscal\nyears beginning after December 15, 2026 and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2027, with\nearly adoption permitted. Upon adoption, ASU 2024-03 may be applied prospectively or retrospectively. The Company is\ncurrently evaluating the impact that the adoption of ASU 2024-03 may have on its disclosures in its condensed consolidated\nfinancial statements.\nOther recent accounting pronouncements issued, but not yet effective, are not expected to be applicable to the\nCompany or have a material effect on the condensed consolidated financial statements upon future adoption.\n3. Acquisitions\nAs described in Note 1, Nature of Business, on June 29, 2023, the Company completed the VectivBio Acquisition.\nThe aggregate consideration paid by the Company to acquire the shares accepted for payment was approximately $1.2 billion.\nThe Company financed the acquisition through proceeds from the borrowings under the Revolving Credit Agreement (as\ndefined elsewhere below) and cash on hand.\nThe total purchase consideration for VectivBio is as follows (in thousands):\nCash consideration paid to selling shareholders (1) $ 1,041,391\nCash consideration paid to settle VectivBio restricted stock units (“RSUs”) and stock options (2) 78,003\nCash consideration paid to settle VectivBio warrants (3) 3,720\nTransaction costs 26,270\nFair value of noncontrolling interest (4) 26,218\nTotal purchase consideration $ 1,175,602\n(1) The cash consideration paid to selling shareholders was determined based on the total number of the outstanding ordinary shares of VectivBio (the\n“VectivBio Shares”) tendered at closing of 61,258,315 at a per share price of $17.00.\n(2) The cash consideration paid to settle VectivBio RSUs and stock options issued under VectivBio’s equity incentive plans was determined based on the\ntotal number of underlying VectivBio Shares of 8,904,171 at a per share price of $17.00, less the exercise price for stock options.\n(3) The cash consideration paid to settle VectivBio warrants was determined based on the total number of VectivBio warrant shares outstanding at close of\n324,190 at a per share price of $11.4757 calculated as the per share price of $17.00, less the exercise price of $5.5243 per share.\n(4) The fair value of the noncontrolling interest was determined based on the total number of VectivBio Shares outstanding at closing of 1,547,723 at the\nclosing date of the tender offer, using the VectivBio closing share price on June 28, 2023 of $16.94.\nOn December 12, 2023, the Company completed the Squeeze-out Merger and paid $26.3 million to acquire all\nremaining outstanding VectivBio Shares in cash. As of December 31, 2023, there was no remaining noncontrolling interest in\nVectivBio.\nThe VectivBio Acquisition was accounted for as an asset acquisition under Accounting Standards Codification\n(“ASC”) Topic 805, Business Combinations, because substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired was\nconcentrated in a single identifiable in-process research and development (“IPR&D”) asset, apraglutide, VectivBio’s lead\ninvestigational asset. Apraglutide is a next-generation, long-acting synthetic GLP-2 analog being developed for a range of rare\nGI diseases for the potential treatment of SBS-IF. The Company recognized the acquired assets and assumed liabilities based\non the consideration paid, inclusive of transaction costs, on a relative fair value basis. In accordance with the accounting for\nasset acquisitions, an entity that acquires IPR&D assets in an asset acquisition follows the guidance in ASC Topic 730\nResearch and Development, which requires that both tangible and intangible identifiable research and development assets with\nno alternative future use be allocated a portion of the consideration transferred and recorded as research and development\nexpense at the acquisition date. As a result, the Company recorded approximately $1.1 billion in acquired IPR&D expense\nrelated to the apraglutide IPR&D asset during the second quarter of 2023.\nThe following is the allocation of the purchase consideration based on the relative fair value of assets acquired and\nliabilities assumed by the Company (in thousands):\nAssets acquired\nCash and cash equivalents $ 123,340\n14\nTable of Contents\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets 10,867\nProperty and equipment 126\nIntangible assets 4,100\nAcquired in-process research and development 1,090,449\nTotal assets acquired $ 1,228,882\nLiabilities assumed\nCurrent liabilities 37,377\nOther liabilities 15,903\nTotal liabilities assumed $ 53,280\nNet assets acquired $ 1,175,602\nAcquisition-related expenses include direct and incremental costs incurred in connection with the transaction,\nincluding integration-related professional services and employee retention-related benefits. Acquisition-related expenses\nexclude transaction costs included in the computation of total consideration paid. The Company tracked and disclosed\nacquisition-related expenses incurred through the end of the second quarter of 2024. For the six months ended June 30, 2024,\nthe Company incurred acquisition-related expenses of $3.6 million, of which $1.1 million were included in selling, general\nand administrative expenses and $2.5 million were included in restructuring expense within the Company’s condensed\nconsolidated statement of income (loss). The Company incurred acquisition-related expenses of $8.5 million and $53.8\nmillion, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, of which $3.7 million and $24.5 million,\nrespectively, were included in selling, general and administrative expenses, $0.2 million and $15.0 million, respectively, were\nincluded in research and development expenses, and $4.7 million and $14.2 million, respectively, were included in\nrestructuring expenses within the Company’s condensed consolidated statement of income (loss).\nIntangible assets are comprised of the assembled workforce and are amortized on a straight-line basis over an\nestimated useful life of five years. The Company recognized $0.2 million and $0.6 million of amortization expense during the\nthree and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. The Company recognized $0.2 million of amortization\nexpense during each of the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. The net carrying value of the assembled\nworkforce was $3.1 million and $3.7 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Future annual\namortization expense will be $0.8 million for each of the years ending December 31, 2024 through December 31, 2027 and\n$0.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2028.\n4. Net Income (Loss) Per Share\nThe following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted net income (loss) per common share (in\nthousands, except per share amounts):\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024(1) 2023(1)\nNumerator:\nNet income (loss) $ 3,646 $ 13,950 $ (1,376) $ (1,029,814)\nLess: Net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests — (1,371) — (28,662)\nNet income (loss) attributable to Ironwood Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 3,646 15,321 (1,376) (1,001,152)\nAdd back interest expense, net of tax benefit, on assumed conversion of 2024\nConvertible Notes — 448 — —\nAdd back interest expense, net of tax benefit, on assumed conversion of 2026\nConvertible Notes — 669 — —\nNumerator used in computing net income (loss) per share — diluted $ 3,646 $ 16,438 $ (1,376) $ (1,001,152)\nDenominator:\nWeighted average number of common shares outstanding used in computing net\n159,706 155,886 158,810 155,240\nincome (loss) per share — basic\nEffect of dilutive securities:\nStock options — 88 — —\nTime-based restricted stock units 49 445 — —\nPerformance-based restricted stock units 439 573 — —\nRestricted stock 21 24 — —\nShares subject to issuance under Employee Stock Purchase Plan 17 7 — —\n2024 Convertible Notes assumed conversion — 14,934 — —\n2026 Convertible Notes assumed conversion — 14,934 — —\n15\nTable of Contents\nDilutive potential common shares\nWeighted average number of common shares outstanding used in computing net\nincome (loss) per share — diluted 160,232 186,891 158,810 155,240\nNet income (loss) per share — basic $ 0.02 $ 0.10 $ (0.01) $ (6.45)\nNet income (loss) per share — diluted $ 0.02 $ 0.09 $ (0.01) $ (6.45)\n(1) During each of the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company was in a net loss position and therefore did not differentiate basic\nand diluted earnings per share.\nThe outstanding securities set forth in the following table have been excluded from the computation of diluted\nweighted average shares outstanding, as applicable, as their effect would be anti-dilutive (in thousands):\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nStock options 4,678 4,744 4,906 4,896\nTime-based restricted stock units 5,327 1,626 1,994 1,042\nPerformance-based restricted stock units — 216 66 164\nNote Hedge Warrants — — — 3,364\n2026 Convertible Notes 14,934 — 14,934 —\nTotal 24,939 6,586 21,900 9,466\nThere was no dilutive impact of the 2024 Convertible Notes (as defined below) for the three and nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 because the Company had elected prior to the beginning of the period to settle the conversion of 2024\nConvertible Notes, if any, with a combination settlement of a cash payment equal to the principal value of converted notes and\nshares of Class A Common Stock equal to the conversion value in excess of the principal value, if any (Note 9). Accordingly,\ninterest expense was not removed from the numerator and there was no calculated spread added to the denominator because\nthe average market price of the Company’s Class A Common Stock during the period was not in excess of the conversion\nprice.\n5. Collaboration, License and Other Agreements\nThe Company has linaclotide collaboration agreements with AbbVie for North America and AstraZeneca for China\n(including Hong Kong and Macau), as well as linaclotide license agreements with Astellas for Japan and with AbbVie for the\nAbbVie License Territory. The following table provides amounts included in the Company’s condensed consolidated\nstatements of income (loss) as collaborative arrangements revenue attributable to transactions from these and other agreements\n(in thousands):\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\nCollaborative Arrangements Revenue 2024 2023 2024 2023\nLinaclotide Collaboration and License Agreements:\nAbbVie (North America) $ 89,426 $ 110,730 $ 254,035 $ 318,548\nAbbVie (Europe and other) 807 714 2,346 2,071\nAstraZeneca (China, including Hong Kong and Macau) 91 174 286 386\nAstellas (Japan) 413 432 1,200 1,305\nOther Agreements:\nAsahi Kasei Pharma Corporation (apraglutide) 633 934 1,902 997\nOther 222 755 1,096 1,875\nTotal collaborative arrangements revenue $ 91,592 $ 113,739 $ 260,865 $ 325,182\nAccounts receivable, net, included $76.2 million and $129.1 million primarily related to collaborative arrangements\nrevenue as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Accounts receivable, net, included $75.1 million and\n$112.6 million due from the Company’s partner, AbbVie, net of $3.6 million and $4.3 million of accounts payable, as of\nSeptember 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.\n16\nTable of Contents\nThe Company routinely assesses the creditworthiness of its license and collaboration partners. The Company did not\nexperience any material losses related to receivables from its license or collaboration partners during the three and nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.\nLinaclotide Agreements\nCollaboration Agreement for North America with AbbVie\nIn September 2007, the Company entered into a collaboration agreement with AbbVie to develop and commercialize\nlinaclotide for the treatment of IBS-C, CIC, and other GI conditions in North America. Under the terms of this collaboration\nagreement, the Company received an upfront licensing fee, equity investment, and development and regulatory milestones,\nand shares equally with AbbVie all development costs as well as net profits or losses from the development and sale of\nlinaclotide in the U.S. In addition, the Company receives royalties in the mid-teens percent based on net sales in Canada and\nMexico. AbbVie is solely responsible for the further development, regulatory approval and commercialization of linaclotide in\nthose countries and funding any costs.\nDuring the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company incurred $1.7 million and $5.2 million,\nrespectively, in total research and development expenses under the linaclotide collaboration for North America. During the\nthree and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company incurred $1.7 million and $5.1 million, respectively, in total\nresearch and development expenses under the linaclotide collaboration for North America. As a result of the research and\ndevelopment cost-sharing provisions of the linaclotide collaboration for North America, the Company incurred $2.0 million\nand $7.2 million in incremental research and development costs during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024,\nrespectively, and incurred $2.9 million and $9.0 million in incremental research and development costs during the three and\nnine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, to reflect the obligations of each party under the collaboration to bear\n50% of the development costs incurred.\nThe Company and AbbVie began commercializing LINZESS in the U.S. in December 2012. The Company receives\n50% of the net profits and bears 50% of the net losses from the commercial sale of LINZESS in the U.S. Net profits or net\nlosses consist of net sales of LINZESS to third-party customers and sublicense income in the U.S. less the cost of goods sold\nas well as selling, general and administrative expenses. LINZESS net sales are calculated and recorded by AbbVie and may\ninclude gross sales net of discounts, rebates, allowances, sales taxes, freight and insurance charges, and other applicable\ndeductions.\nThe Company evaluated its linaclotide collaboration arrangement for North America and concluded that all\ndevelopment-period performance obligations had been satisfied as of September 2012. The Company has determined that\nthere are three remaining commercial-period performance obligations, which include the sales detailing of LINZESS,\nparticipation in the joint commercialization committee, and approved additional trials. The consideration remaining includes\ncost reimbursements in the U.S. and net profit and loss sharing payments based on net sales in the U.S. Additionally, the\nCompany receives royalties in the mid-teens percent based on net sales in Canada and Mexico. Royalties and net profit and\nloss sharing payments will be recorded as collaborative arrangements revenue or expense in the period earned, as these\npayments relate predominately to the license granted to AbbVie. The Company records royalty revenue in the period earned\nbased on royalty reports from its partner, if available, or based on the projected sales and historical trends. The cost\nreimbursements received from AbbVie during the commercialization period will be recognized as earned in accordance with\nthe right-to-invoice practical expedient, as the Company’s right to consideration corresponds directly with the value of the\nservices transferred during the commercialization period.\nUnder the Company’s linaclotide collaboration agreement for North America, LINZESS net sales are calculated and\nrecorded by AbbVie and include gross sales net of discounts, rebates, allowances, sales taxes, freight and insurance charges,\nand other applicable deductions, as noted above. These amounts include the use of estimates and judgments, which could be\nadjusted based on actual results in the future. The Company records its share of the net profits or net losses from the sales of\nLINZESS in the U.S. less commercial expenses on a net basis, and presents the settlement payments to and from AbbVie as\ncollaboration expense or collaborative arrangements revenue, as applicable.

The Company assessed that it provided a right to use the\nlicense as the license exists (in terms of form and functionality) at the point in time at which it is granted and therefore, was\nsatisfied at the inception of the arrangement. The development activities are being recognized over time as the Company\nperforms development activities related to the global trials. The Company recognizes revenue associated with the development\nactivities using an input method, according to the costs incurred, which in management’s judgment, is the best measure of\nprogress towards satisfying the performance obligation.

In general, fair values determined by Level 1 inputs utilize\nobservable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Fair values determined by Level 2\ninputs utilize data points that are either directly or indirectly observable, such as quoted prices for similar instruments in active\nmarkets, interest rates and yield curves. Fair values determined by Level 3 inputs utilize unobservable data points in which\nthere is little or no market data, which require the Company to develop its own assumptions for the asset or liability.\nThe Company’s investment portfolio may include fixed income securities that do not always trade on a daily basis.\nAs a result, the pricing services used by the Company apply other available information as applicable through processes such\nas benchmark yields, benchmarking of like securities, sector groupings and matrix pricing to prepare valuations. In addition,\nmodel processes are used to assess interest rate impact and develop prepayment scenarios. These models take into\nconsideration relevant credit information, perceived market movements, sector news and economic events. The inputs into\nthese models may include benchmark yields, reported trades, broker-dealer quotes, issuer spreads and other relevant data. The\nCompany validates the prices provided by its third-party pricing services by obtaining market values from other pricing\nsources and analyzing pricing data in certain instances. The Company periodically invests in certain reverse repurchase\nagreements, which are collateralized by Government Securities and Obligations for an amount not less than 102% of their\nprincipal amount.

The effective annual interest rate is\ncomputed using the contractual interest and the amortization of debt issuance costs.\nThe following table sets forth total interest expense recognized related to convertible senior notes (in thousands):\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nContractual interest expense $ 750 $ 1,125 $ 2,938 $ 3,375\nAmortization of debt issuance costs 170 405 948 1,212\nTotal interest expense $ 920 $ 1,530 $ 3,886 $ 4,587\n25\nTable of Contents\nFuture minimum payments under the convertible senior notes as of September 30, 2024, are as follows (in\nthousands):\n2024 (1) $ 1,500\n2025 3,000\n2026 201,500\nTotal future minimum payments under the convertible senior notes 206,000\nLess: amounts representing interest (6,000)\nLess: unamortized debt issuance costs (1,183)\nConvertible senior notes balance $ 198,817\n(1) For the three months ending December 31, 2024.\nCapped Calls with Respect to 2024 Convertible Notes and 2026 Convertible Notes\nTo minimize the impact of potential dilution to the Company’s Class A common stockholders upon conversion of the\n2024 Convertible Notes and the 2026 Convertible Notes, the Company separately entered into the capped call transactions in\nAugust 2019 (the “Capped Calls”) in connection with the issuance of the 2024 Convertible Notes and the 2026 Convertible\nNotes. The Company paid the counterparties $25.2 million to enter into the Capped Calls, of which $25.0 million related to\nthe premium payments and $0.2 million related to transaction costs. These instruments meet the conditions outlined in ASC\n815 to be classified in stockholders’ equity and are not subsequently remeasured as long as the conditions for equity\nclassification continue to be met.\nThe Capped Calls in connection with the issuance of the 2024 Convertible Notes, which covered 14,933,740 shares\nof Class A Common Stock, terminated unexercised upon expiry in June 2024.\nThe Capped Calls in connection with the 2026 Convertible Notes have an initial strike price of approximately $13.39\nper share, which corresponds to the initial conversion price of the 2026 Convertible Notes and is subject to anti-dilution\nadjustments generally similar to those applicable to the 2026 Convertible Notes. The Capped Calls have a cap price of\napproximately $17.05 per share, subject to certain adjustments. The Capped Calls cover 14,933,740 shares of Class A\nCommon Stock (subject to anti-dilution and certain other adjustments), which is the same number of shares of Class A\nCommon Stock that initially underlie the 2026 Convertible Notes. Holders of the 2026 Convertible Notes do not have any\nrights with respect to the Capped Calls.\nThe Capped Calls are expected generally to reduce the potential dilution to the Class A Common Stock upon\nconversion of the 2026 Convertible Notes in the event that the market price per share of Class A Common Stock is greater\nthan the strike price of the Capped Calls as adjusted pursuant to the anti-dilution adjustments. If, however, the market price\nper share of Class A Common Stock exceeds the cap price of the Capped Calls, there would nevertheless be dilution upon\nconversion of the 2026 Convertible Notes to the extent that such market price exceeds the cap price of the Capped Calls.\nRevolving Credit Facility\nIn May 2023, in connection with the VectivBio Acquisition, the Company entered into a credit agreement with Wells\nFargo Bank, N.A., as administrative agent (in such capacity, the “Agent”), collateral agent, a letter of credit issuer and a\nlender, and the other agents, lenders and letter of credit issuers parties thereto (collectively, the “Lenders”). In September\n2024, the Company, the Agent and the Lenders entered into a first amendment to the revolving credit agreement (as amended\nfrom time to time, the “Revolving Credit Agreement”) to, among other things, increase the quantum of the Revolving Credit\nFacility from $500.0 million to $550.0 million, extend the maturity date, and increase the Company’s permitted maximum\nconsolidated secured net leverage ratio.\nThe Revolving Credit Agreement provides for a $550.0 million secured revolving credit facility (the \"Revolving\nCredit Facility”), which includes a $10.0 million letter of credit subfacility, and loans made thereunder will mature on the\nearliest to occur of (i) December 31, 2028 or (ii) the date that is 91 days prior to the stated maturity date of the Company’s\nexisting convertible notes then outstanding, unless, in the case of clause (ii), the Company’s minimum liquidity equals or\nexceeds certain agreed levels.\n26\nTable of Contents\nAt the Company’s election, borrowings under the Revolving Credit Agreement will bear interest at a rate equal to (a)\nAdjusted Term Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“Adjusted Term SOFR”) (as defined in Revolving Credit Agreement) plus\nthe applicable rate (ranging from 1.75% to 3.00%) or (b) the highest of (1) the weighted average overnight Federal funds rate,\nas published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, plus one half of 1.0%, (2) the prime lending rate or (3) the one-month\nAdjusted Term SOFR plus 1.0% in effect from time to time plus the applicable rate (ranging from 0.75% to 2.00%). The\napplicable rates are based on the Company’s consolidated secured net leverage ratio (as defined under the Revolving Credit\nFacility) at the time of the applicable borrowing.\nThe Company pays a quarterly commitment fee of 0.30% to 0.425% on the daily amount by which the commitments\nunder the Revolving Credit Agreement exceed the outstanding loans and letters of credit.\nThe loans and other obligations under the Revolving Credit Agreement are secured by substantially all of the\nCompany’s personal property, including a pledge of all the capital stock of subsidiaries held directly by the Company or any\nsubsidiary that guarantees the Revolving Credit Agreement following the closing date (which pledge, in the case of any\nforeign subsidiary, is limited to 65% of the voting stock), subject to certain customary exceptions and limitations. The\nRevolving Credit Agreement generally prohibits any other liens on the assets of the Company and its restricted subsidiaries,\nsubject to certain exceptions as described in the Revolving Credit Agreement.\nUnder the terms of the Revolving Credit Agreement, the Company will be able to request an increase in the\ncommitments or the addition of a term loan secured by a pari passu lien on the collateral of up to an additional amount equal\nto the greater of $200.0 million and 100% of the trailing twelve-month Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA (as defined in the\nRevolving Credit Agreement) upon satisfaction of customary conditions, including receipt of commitments from either new\nlenders or increased commitments from existing lenders.\nThe Revolving Credit Agreement contains certain customary covenants applicable to the Company and its Restricted\nSubsidiaries (as defined in the Revolving Credit Agreement). The Company is required to maintain a maximum consolidated\nsecured net leverage ratio of 3.50 to 1.00 until the end of the final quarter of 2025 (the “Initial Period”), (ii) 3.25 to 1.00 until\nthe end of the first quarter of 2026 (the “Interim Period”) and (iii) 3.00 to 1.00 thereafter, and a minimum interest coverage\nratio of 3.00 to 1.00, in each case at the end of each fiscal quarter. The Revolving Credit Agreement allows the Company to\nelect to increase the permitted maximum consolidated secured net leverage ratio to (i) 4.00 to 1.00 during the Initial Period,\n(ii) 3.75 to 1.00 during the Interim Period and (iii) 3.50 to 1.00 thereafter, in each case for up to four fiscal quarters in the\nevent it consummates an acquisition for consideration in excess of $50.0 million, subject to certain limitations on how often\nthis election can be made. As of September 30, 2024, the Company was in compliance with all covenants under the Revolving\nCredit Agreement.\nIn connection with the initial execution of the Revolving Credit Agreement during the second quarter of 2023 and the\namendment executed in the third quarter of 2024, the Company incurred $2.9 million and $2.2 million of debt issuance costs,\nrespectively, which consisted primarily of lender fees. The debt issuance costs are classified as other assets and are amortized\non a straight-line basis over the term of the Revolving Credit Agreement. The Company had unamortized capitalized debt\nissuance costs of $4.1 million and $2.4 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.\nThe outstanding principal balance on the revolving credit facility was $400.0 million and $300.0 million as of\nSeptember 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.\nThe following table sets forth total interest expense recognized related to the Revolving Credit Agreement (in\nthousands):\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nContractual interest expense $ 8,308 $ 8,054 $ 19,905 $ 8,269\nAmortization of debt issuance costs 180 180 541 262\nOther financing costs 13 75 38 88\nTotal interest expense $ 8,501 $ 8,309 $ 20,484 $ 8,619\n27\nTable of Contents\n10. Employee Stock Benefit Plans\nThe Company has several share-based compensation plans under which stock options, restricted stock awards,\nrestricted stock units and other share-based awards are available for grant to employees, officers, directors and consultants of\nthe Company.\nThe following table summarizes share-based compensation expense (in thousands):\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nShare-based compensation expense:\nResearch and development $ 1,714 $1,545 $ 5,760 $ 15,655\nSelling, general and administrative 6,615 6,361 19,524 34,283\nRestructuring — — — 911\nTotal share-based compensation expense included in operating expenses 8,329 7,906 25,284 50,849\nIncome tax benefit 840 850 2,853 2,069\nTotal share-based compensation expense, net of tax $ 7,489 $7,056 $ 22,431 $ 48,780\nIn connection with the VectivBio Acquisition, the Company incurred $27.5 million of share-based compensation\nexpense during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 related to the vesting acceleration and settlement of outstanding\nVectivBio stock options and RSUs under VectivBio’s 2021 Equity Incentive Plan, of which $11.3 million was recorded within\nresearch and development expense and $16.2 million was recorded within selling, general and administrative expenses,\nrespectively.\n.1 1. Income Taxes\nThe income tax provision during interim periods is computed by applying an estimated annual U.S. effective income\ntax rate to U.S. year-to-date pre-tax income, plus adjustments for significant unusual or infrequently occurring items, in\naccordance with ASC Subtopic 740-270, Income Taxes – Interim Reporting. Year-to-date pre-tax net loss generated in\nSwitzerland is not included in the interim period income tax provision, as the related deferred tax assets are reserved in full by\na valuation allowance.\nDuring the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 the Company recorded income tax expense of $13.7\nmillion and $42.6 million, respectively. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company recorded\nincome tax expense of $18.0 million and $51.4 million, respectively. Due to the Company's ability to offset its pre-tax income\nagainst net operating losses, the majority of its tax provision is expected to represent a non-cash expense until its net operating\nlosses have been fully utilized.\nThe Company continues to record a valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets comprised primarily of\nnet operating loss carryforwards in Switzerland, as well as U.S. federal and state tax credits that are expected to expire prior to\nutilization. On a periodic basis, the Company reassesses the valuation allowance on its deferred income tax assets, weighing\npositive and negative evidence to assess the recoverability of the deferred tax assets.\n28\nTable of Contents\n12. Workforce Reductions and Restructuring\nIn April 2023, the Company reduced its workforce by approximately 10% of its headquarters-based personnel in an\neffort to further strengthen the operational efficiency of the organization. The workforce reduction was substantially\ncompleted during the second quarter of 2023. The Company recorded $3.5 million of restructuring expenses and adjustments,\nwhich are primarily comprised of employee severance, benefits and related costs, during the nine months ended September 30,\n2023. No restructuring expenses or adjustments were recorded during the three months ended September 30, 2023.\nIn June 2023, the Company commenced the elimination of certain positions in connection with the VectivBio\nAcquisition. The majority of the eliminations were substantially completed during the year ended December 31, 2023. During\nthe three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company incurred an insignificant amount and $2.5 million of\nrestructuring expenses, respectively. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company incurred $4.7\nmillion and $14.3 million of restructuring expenses, respectively. The restructuring expenses are comprised primarily of\nemployee severance, benefits, and related costs.\nItem 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nForward-Looking Information\nThe following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our\ncondensed consolidated financial statements and the notes to those financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Quarterly\nReport on Form 10-Q and the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in our Annual Report on\nForm 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, which was filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, or the\nSEC, on February 16, 2024, or the 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements\nthat involve significant risks and uncertainties. As a result of many factors, such as those set forth under “Note Regarding\nForward-Looking Statements,” in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, under “Part I, Item 1A—Risk Factors” in our 2023\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K and under “Risk Factors” in Item 1A of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, our actual results\nmay differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements.\nOverview\nWe are a gastrointestinal, or GI, healthcare company dedicated to advancing the treatment of GI diseases and\nredefining the standard of care for GI patients. We are focused on the development and commercialization of innovative GI\nproduct opportunities in areas of significant unmet need, leveraging our demonstrated expertise and capabilities in GI\ndiseases.\nLINZESS® (linaclotide), our commercial product, is the first product approved by the United States Food and Drug\nAdministration, or U.S. FDA, in a class of GI medicines called guanylate cyclase type C agonists, or GC-C agonists, and is\nindicated for adult men and women suffering from irritable bowel syndrome with constipation, or IBS-C, or chronic idiopathic\nconstipation, or CIC, and for pediatric patients ages 6-17 years-old suffering from functional constipation, or FC. LINZESS is\navailable to adult men and women suffering from IBS-C or CIC in the United States, or the U.S., Mexico, and Saudi Arabia,\nadult men and women suffering from IBS-C or chronic constipation in Japan, and IBS-C in China, and pediatric patients ages\n6-17 with FC in the U.S. Linaclotide is available under the trademarked name CONSTELLA® to adult men and women\nsuffering from IBS-C or CIC and pediatric patients ages 6-17 years old with FC in Canada, and to adult men and women\nsuffering from IBS-C in certain European countries.\nWe have strategic partnerships with leading pharmaceutical companies to support the development and\ncommercialization of linaclotide throughout the world, including with AbbVie Inc. (together with its affiliates), or AbbVie, in\nthe U.S. and all countries worldwide other than China (including Hong Kong and Macau) and Japan, AstraZeneca AB\n(together with its affiliates), or AstraZeneca, in China (including Hong Kong and Macau) and Astellas Pharma Inc., or\nAstellas, in Japan.\nWe also aim to leverage our leading development and commercialization capabilities in GI to bring additional\ntreatment options to GI patients.\n29\nTable of Contents\nIn June 2023, we completed a tender offer to purchase 98% of the outstanding ordinary shares of VectivBio Holding\nAG, or the VectivBio Acquisition. In December 2023, we completed a squeeze-out merger under Swiss law to acquire all\nremaining shares and VectivBio Holding AG was merged with and into Ironwood Pharmaceuticals GmbH, our wholly-owned\nsubsidiary organized under the laws of Switzerland. The VectivBio Acquisition was partially funded with $400.0 million of\nborrowings under a new revolving credit facility, or the Revolving Credit Facility, as further described in Note 9, Debt, to our\ncondensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Through the\nacquisition, we are advancing apraglutide, a next-generation, synthetic peptide analog of glucagon-like peptide-2, or GLP-2,\nfor rare gastrointestinal diseases, including short bowel syndrome with intestinal failure, or SBS-IF.\nIn November 2021, we entered into a collaboration and license option agreement, or the COUR Collaboration\nAgreement, with COUR Pharmaceutical Development Company, Inc., or COUR, that granted us an option to acquire an\nexclusive license to research, develop, manufacture and commercialize, in the U.S., products containing CNP-104, a tolerizing\nimmune modifying nanoparticle, for the treatment of primary biliary cholangitis, or PBC. In the third quarter of 2024, we\nreceived from COUR the topline data from COUR’s Phase II Clinical study for the treatment of PBC. In September 2024, we\nnotified COUR of our decision not to exercise the option to acquire an exclusive license to CNP-104. As a result, the\ncollaboration and license option agreement between COUR and us has terminated, and we retain no rights and have no\nobligations related to CNP-104.\nWe are also advancing IW-3300, a GC-C agonist, for the potential treatment of visceral pain conditions, such as\ninterstitial cystitis / bladder pain syndrome, or IC/BPS, and endometriosis. We have decided to end further recruitment for the\nPhase II proof of concept study in IC/BPS and analyze the data once all currently enrolled patients complete the full 12-week\nstudy assessment, which will inform the next steps on the program.\nTo date, we have dedicated a majority of our activities to the research, development and commercialization of\nlinaclotide, as well as to the research and development of our other product candidates. For the three and nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024, we recorded net income of $3.6 million and net loss of $1.4 million, respectively. For the three and nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2023, we recorded net income of $14.0 million and net loss of approximately $1.0 billion,\nrespectively. As of September 30, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $1.7 billion. We are unable to predict\nthe extent of any future losses or guarantee that our company will be able to maintain positive cash flows.\nWe were incorporated in Delaware on January 5, 1998 as Microbia, Inc. On April 7, 2008, we changed our name to\nIronwood Pharmaceuticals, Inc. We operate in one reportable business segment—human therapeutics.\nFinancial Operations Overview\nRevenues. Our revenues are generated primarily through our collaborative arrangements and license agreements\nrelated to research and development and commercialization of linaclotide.\nThe majority of our revenues are generated from the sales of LINZESS in the U.S. We record our share of the net\nprofits and losses from the sales of LINZESS in the U.S. less commercial expenses on a net basis and present the settlement\npayments to and from AbbVie as collaboration expense or collaborative arrangements revenue, as applicable. Net profits or\nlosses consist of net sales to third-party customers and sublicense income in the U.S. less the cost of goods sold as well as\nselling, general and administrative expenses. Although we expect net sales to increase over time, the settlement payments\nbetween AbbVie and us, resulting in collaborative arrangements revenue or collaboration expense, are subject to fluctuation\nbased on the ratio of selling, general and administrative expenses incurred by each party. In addition, our collaborative\narrangements revenue may fluctuate as a result of the timing and amount of license fees and clinical and commercial\nmilestones received and recognized under our current and future strategic partnerships as well as timing and amount of\nroyalties from the sales of linaclotide in the European, Canadian, Mexican, Japanese, or Chinese markets or any other markets\nwhere linaclotide receives approval and is commercialized.\nResearch and Development Expense. The core of our research and development strategy is to leverage our\ndemonstrated expertise and capabilities in GI diseases to bring multiple medicines to patients. Research and development\nexpense consists of expenses incurred in connection with the research into and development of products and product\ncandidates. These expenses consist primarily of compensation, benefits and other employee-related expenses, research and\ndevelopment related facility costs, third-party contract costs relating to nonclinical study and\n30\nTable of Contents\nclinical trial activities, development of manufacturing processes, regulatory registration of third-party manufacturing facilities,\nand licensing fees for our product candidates.\nResearch and development expenses include amounts owed to AbbVie on an ongoing basis under cost-sharing\nprovisions in our collaboration agreement for linaclotide. Reimbursements received for research and development activities\nunder this agreement are netted against research and development expenses.\nLinaclotide. Our commercial product, LINZESS, is commercially available in the U.S. for the treatment of IBS-C or\nCIC in adults and for FC in pediatric patients ages 6-17 years-old. Linaclotide is also available to adult men and women\nsuffering from IBS-C or CIC in certain countries of the world, including China, Japan, and in a number of European countries.\nWe and AbbVie continue to explore ways to enhance the clinical profile of LINZESS by studying linaclotide in\nadditional indications, populations and formulations to assess its potential to treat various conditions. In September 2020,\nbased on the Phase IIIb data of linaclotide 290 mcg on the overall abdominal symptoms of bloating, pain and discomfort in\nadult patients with IBS-C, the U.S. FDA approved our supplemental new drug application to include a more comprehensive\ndescription of the effects of LINZESS in its approved label.\nIn addition, we and AbbVie have established a nonclinical and clinical post-marketing plan with the U.S. FDA to\nunderstand the safety and efficacy of LINZESS in pediatric patients. In August 2021, the U.S. FDA approved a revised label\nfor LINZESS based on clinical safety data that had been generated thus far in pediatric studies. The updated label modified the\nboxed warning for risk of serious dehydration and contraindication against use in children to those less than two years of age.\nThe boxed warning and contraindication previously applied to all children less than 18 years of age and less than 6 years of\nage, respectively. In June 2023, the U.S. FDA approved LINZESS as a once-daily treatment for pediatric patients ages 6-17\nyears-old with FC, making LINZESS the first and only FDA-approved prescription therapy for FC in this patient population.\nThe safety and effectiveness of LINZESS in patients with FC less than 6 years of age or in patients with IBS-C less than 18\nyears of age have not been established. Additional clinical pediatric programs in IBS-C and FC are ongoing.\nApraglutide for SBS-IF. In February 2024, we announced positive topline results from our pivotal Phase III clinical\ntrial, STARS, which evaluated the efficacy and safety of once-weekly subcutaneous apraglutide in reducing parenteral\nsupport, or PS, dependency in adult patients with SBS-IF. SBS-IF, a rare and severe organ failure condition in which patients\nare dependent on PS, affects an estimated 18,000 adult patients in the U.S., Europe, and Japan. Based on these results, we plan\nto submit a new drug application and other regulatory filings as a once-weekly GLP-2 analog for apraglutide for use in adult\npatients with SBS who are dependent on PS.\nApraglutide for aGvHD. In March 2024, we announced positive, primary results up to Day 91 for our Phase II\nexploratory trial, STARGAZE, to evaluate apraglutide in patients with steroid-refractory gastrointestinal acute Graft versus\nHost Disease, or aGvHD, which evaluated the safety and tolerability of once-weekly apraglutide in aGvHD patients treated\nwith standard of care, including systemic corticosteroids and ruxolitinib. The STARGAZE study will continue through its two-\nyear endpoint, where apraglutide will be re-evaluated for safety and efficacy.\nCNP-104. Through the COUR Collaboration Agreement, we and COUR developed CNP-104 for the treatment of\nPBC, a rare autoimmune disease targeting the liver. In the third quarter of 2024, we received from COUR the topline data\nfrom COUR’s Phase II Clinical study for the treatment of PBC. In September 2024, we notified COUR of our decision not to\nexercise the option to acquire an exclusive license to CNP-104. As a result, the COUR Collaboration Agreement has\nterminated, and we retain no rights and have no obligations related to CNP-104.\nIW-3300. We are advancing IW-3300, a GC-C agonist, for the potential treatment of visceral pain conditions, such as\nIC/BPS and endometriosis. In September 2024, we decided to end further recruitment for the Phase II proof of concept study\nin IC/BPS and analyze the data once all currently enrolled patients complete the full 12-week study assessment, which will\ninform the next steps on the program.\nEarly research and development. Our early research and development efforts have been focused on supporting our\ndevelopment stage GI programs, including exploring strategic options for further development of certain of our internal\nprograms, as well as evaluating external development-stage GI programs.\n31\nTable of Contents\nThe following table sets forth our research and development expenses related to our product pipeline for the three\nand nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. These expenses relate primarily to compensation, benefits\nand other employee-related expenses and external costs associated with nonclinical studies and clinical trial costs for our\nproduct candidates. We allocate costs related to facilities, depreciation, share-based compensation, research and development\nsupport services and certain other costs directly to programs.\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nLinaclotide(1) $ 4,313 $ 5,120 $ 13,760 $ 16,380\nApraglutide(2) 20,382 19,415 56,485 34,895\nIW-3300 3,421 4,128 10,306 12,104\nCNP-104(3) 619 968 4,119 8,003\nEarly research and development(4) 1,092 3,354 1,360 9,027\nTotal research and development expenses $ 29,827 $ 32,985 $ 86,030 $ 80,409\n(1) Includes linaclotide in all indications, populations and formulation.\n(2) Includes $11.4 million of share-based compensation expense and $3.5 million of employer payroll tax expense recognized immediately after the closing\nof the VectivBio Acquisition in the second quarter of 2023 in connection with the vesting acceleration and settlement of outstanding stock options and\nRSUs.\n(3) Includes $6.0 million up-front payment recognized in the second quarter of 2023 in connection with the amendment to the COUR Collaboration\nAgreement.\n(4) Includes $4.8 million reduction to research and development expense recognized in the first quarter of 2024 in connection with the settlement of a\nlicense-related contract liability.\nThe lengthy process of securing regulatory approvals for new drugs, including apraglutide, requires the expenditure\nof substantial resources. Any failure by us to obtain, or any delay in obtaining, regulatory approvals would materially\nadversely affect our product development efforts and our business overall.\nWe cannot currently estimate with any degree of certainty the amount of time or money that we will be required to\nexpend in the future on linaclotide for additional indications, populations or formulations.\nGiven the inherent uncertainties that come with the development of pharmaceutical products, we cannot estimate\nwith any degree of certainty how our programs will evolve, and therefore the amount of time or money that would be required\nto obtain regulatory approval to market them.\nAs a result of these uncertainties surrounding the timing and outcome of any approvals, we are currently unable to\nestimate precisely when, if ever, linaclotide’s utility will be expanded within its currently approved indications; if or when\nlinaclotide will be developed outside of its current markets, indications, populations or formulations; or when, if ever,\napraglutide or any of our other product candidates will generate revenues and cash flows.\nWe invest carefully in our pipeline, and the commitment of funding for each subsequent stage of our development\nprograms is dependent upon the receipt of clear, supportive data. In addition, we intend to access externally discovered drug\ncandidates that fit within our core strategy. In evaluating these potential assets, we apply the same investment criteria as those\nused for investments in internally discovered assets.\nThe successful development of our product candidates is highly uncertain and subject to a number of risks including,\nbut not limited to:\n● The duration of clinical trials may vary substantially according to the type, complexity and novelty of the\nproduct candidate;\n● The U.S. FDA and comparable agencies in foreign countries impose substantial and varying requirements on the\nintroduction of therapeutic pharmaceutical products, typically requiring lengthy and detailed laboratory and\nclinical testing procedures, sampling activities and other costly and time-consuming procedures;\n● Data obtained from nonclinical and clinical activities at any step in the testing process may be adverse and lead\nto discontinuation or redirection of development activity. Data obtained from these activities also are susceptible\nto varying interpretations, which could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval;\n32\nTable of Contents\n● The duration and cost of early research and development, including nonclinical studies and clinical trials, may\nvary significantly over the life of a product candidate and are difficult to predict;\n● The costs, timing and outcome of regulatory review of a product candidate may not be favorable, and, even if\napproved, a product may face post-approval development and regulatory requirements;\n● There may be substantial costs, delays and difficulties in successfully integrating externally developed product\ncandidates into our business operations; and\n● The emergence of competing technologies and products and other adverse market developments may negatively\nimpact us.\nAs a result of the factors discussed above, including the factors discussed under “Note Regarding Forward-Looking\nStatements” in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, and under “Part I, Item 1A – Risk Factors” in our 2023 Annual Report on\nForm 10-K, we are unable to determine the duration and costs to complete current or future nonclinical and clinical stages of\nour product candidates or when, or to what extent, we will generate revenues from the commercialization and sale of our\nproduct candidates. Development timelines, probability of success and development costs vary widely. We anticipate that we\nwill make determinations as to which additional programs to pursue and how much funding to direct to each program on an\nongoing basis in response to the data of each product candidate, the competitive landscape and ongoing assessments of such\nproduct candidate’s commercial potential.\nWe expect to invest in our development programs and incur substantial research and development expenses for the\nforeseeable future. We will continue to invest in linaclotide, including the investigation of ways to enhance the clinical profile\nwithin its currently approved indications, and the exploration of its potential utility in other indications, populations and\nformulations. We will continue to invest in our GI-focused product candidates, including apraglutide, as we advance them\nthrough pre-clinical and clinical trials, in addition to funding research and development activities under our external\ncollaboration and license agreements.\nAcquired In-Process Research and Development. Asset acquisition costs, license fees and development milestone\npayments related to acquired and in-licensed products and technology are expensed as acquired in-\nprocess research and development at the point that they have no established alternative future use.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expense. Selling, general and administrative expense consists primarily of\ncompensation, benefits and other employee-related expenses for personnel in our administrative, finance, legal, information\ntechnology, business development, commercial, sales, marketing, communications and human resource functions. Other costs\ninclude legal costs of pursuing patent protection of our intellectual property, general and administrative related facility costs,\ninsurance costs and professional fees for accounting, tax, consulting, legal and other services. As we continue to invest in the\ncommercialization of LINZESS, apraglutide and other product candidates, we expect our selling, general and administrative\nexpenses will be substantial for the foreseeable future.\nWe include AbbVie’s selling, general and administrative cost-sharing payments in the calculation of the net profits\nand net losses from the sale of LINZESS in the U.S. and present the net payment to or from AbbVie as collaboration expense\nor collaborative arrangements revenue, respectively.\nRestructuring Expenses. Restructuring expenses pertain to restructuring initiatives in connection with the VectivBio\nAcquisition and are more fully described in Note 12, Workforce Reductions and Restructuring.\nInterest Expense and Other Financing Costs. Interest expense consists primarily of cash and non-cash interest costs\nrelated to our convertible senior notes and Revolving Credit Facility. Non-cash interest expense consists of amortization of\ndebt issuance costs.\nInterest and Investment Income. Interest and investment income consists of interest earned on our cash and cash\nequivalents, as well as significant financing components of payments due from collaboration partners.\nGain on Derivatives. Gain on derivatives consists of the change in fair value of note hedge warrants, which\nterminated unexercised upon expiry in April 2023. Refer to Note 9, Debt, in the financial statements included in our 2023\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K for additional information related to the note hedge warrants.\n33\nTable of Contents\nIncome Taxes. We prepare our income tax provision based on our interpretation of the income tax accounting rules\nand each jurisdiction’s enacted tax laws and regulations. At interim reporting dates, we record our income tax provision by\napplying our estimated annual effective tax rate to year-to-date pre-tax income, plus adjustments for significant unusual or\ninfrequently occurring items.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our condensed\nconsolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation\nof these financial statements requires us to make certain estimates and assumptions that may affect the reported amounts of\nassets and liabilities, the disclosure of assets and liabilities at the date of the condensed consolidated financial statements, and\nthe amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported periods. We base our estimates on our historical experience and on\nvarious other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about\nthe carrying values of assets and liabilities. Actual results may differ materially from our estimates under different\nassumptions or conditions. Changes in estimates are reflected in reported results in the period in which they become known.\nDuring the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, there were no material changes to our critical\naccounting policies as reported in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n34\nTable of Contents\nResults of Operations\nThe following discussion summarizes the key factors our management believes are necessary for an understanding of\nour condensed consolidated financial statements.\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\n(in thousands) (in thousands)\nRevenues:\nCollaborative arrangements revenue $ 91,592 $ 113,739 $ 260,865 $ 325,182\nTotal revenues 91,592 113,739 260,865 325,182\nCosts and expenses:\nResearch and development 29,827 32,985 86,030 80,409\nSelling, general and administrative 36,113 36,046 110,682 119,647\nRestructuring 16 4,685 2,520 17,696\nAcquired in-process research and development — — — 1,090,449\nTotal costs and expenses 65,956 73,716 199,232 1,308,201\nIncome (loss) from operations 25,636 40,023 61,633 (983,019)\nOther income (expense):\nInterest expense and other financing costs (9,419) (9,839) (24,120) (13,206)\nInterest and investment income 1,152 1,748 3,690 17,777\nGain on derivatives — — — 19\nOther income (expense), net (8,267) (8,091) (20,430) 4,590\nIncome (loss) before income taxes 17,369 31,932 41,203 (978,429)\nIncome tax expense (13,723) (17,982) (42,579) (51,385)\nNet income (loss) 3,646 13,950 (1,376) (1,029,814)\nLess: Net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests — (1,371) — (28,662)\nNet income (loss) attributable to Ironwood Pharmaceuticals, Inc. $ 3,646 $ 15,321 $ (1,376) $ (1,001,152)\nThree and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to three and nine months ended September 30, 2023\nRevenues\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, Change September 30, Change\n2024 2023 $ 2024 2023 $\n(in thousands) (in thousands)\nRevenues:\nCollaborative arrangements revenue $ 91,592 $ 113,739 $ (22,147) $ 260,865 $ 325,182 $ (64,317)\nTotal revenues $ 91,592 $ 113,739 $ (22,147) $ 260,865 $ 325,182 $ (64,317)\nCollaborative Arrangements Revenue. The decrease in collaborative arrangements revenue of $22.1 million for the\nthree months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily related to a\n$21.2 million decrease in our share of net profits from the sale of LINZESS in the U.S., which was driven by decreased net\nprice (including a $5.0 million reduction to collaboration revenue as a result of changes in estimates of sales reserves and\nallowances associated with governmental and contractual rebates), partially offset by increases from prescription demand.\nThe decrease in collaborative arrangements revenue of $64.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024\ncompared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily related to a $64.5 million decrease in our share of net\nprofits from the sale of LINZESS in the U.S., which was driven by decreased net price (including a $43.0 million reduction to\ncollaboration revenue as a result of changes in estimates of sales reserves and allowances associated with governmental and\ncontractual rebates), partially offset by increases from prescription demand and inventory channel fluctuations.\n35\nTable of Contents\nCosts and Expenses\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, Change September 30, Change\n2024 2023 $ 2024 2023 $\n(in thousands) (in thousands)\nCosts and expenses:\nResearch and development $ 29,827 $ 32,985 $ (3,158) $ 86,030 $ 80,409 $ 5,621\nSelling, general and administrative 36,113 36,046 67 110,682 119,647 (8,965)\nRestructuring 16 4,685 (4,669) 2,520 17,696 (15,176)\nAcquired in-process research and\ndevelopment — — — — 1,090,449 (1,090,449)\nTotal costs and expenses $ 65,956 $ 73,716 $ (7,760) $ 199,232 $ 1,308,201 $ (1,108,969)\nResearch and Development Expenses. The decrease in research and development expenses of $3.2 million for the\nthree months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily related to a\n$1.2 million decrease in external apraglutide costs, a $1.0 million decrease in external linaclotide costs, and a $0.6 million\ndecrease in compensation, benefits, and other employee-related expenses.\nThe increase in research and development expenses of $5.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024\ncompared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily related to a $25.7 million increase in external\napraglutide costs, a $4.7 million increase in compensation, benefits, and other employee-related expenses, and a $2.0 million\nincrease related to an agreement with COUR to increase the CNP-104 clinical study budget, partially offset by $11.3 million\nof share-based compensation expense and $3.5 million in related payroll taxes recognized in the second quarter of 2023\nimmediately after the closing of the VectivBio Acquisition in connection with the vesting acceleration of outstanding stock\noptions and RSUs under VectivBio’s 2021 Equity Incentive Plan, a $6.0 million payment to COUR in the second quarter of\n2023 related to CNP-104 in connection with the amendment of the COUR Collaboration Agreement, and a $4.8 million\nreduction to research and development expense in connection with the settlement of a license-related contract liability.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by an\ninsignificant amount for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30,\n2023.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses decreased by $9.0 million for the nine months ended September 30,\n2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to $16.2 million of share-based compensation\nexpense and $3.0 million in related payroll taxes recognized immediately after the closing of the VectivBio Acquisition in\nconnection with the vesting acceleration of outstanding stock options and RSUs under VectivBio’s 2021 Equity Incentive\nPlan, partially offset by a $5.2 million increase in professional services costs (including $7.0 million related to the commercial\nlaunch of apraglutide, if approved), and a $3.4 million increase in compensation, benefits, and other employee-related\nexpenses.\nRestructuring Expenses. Restructuring expenses during each of the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024\nand September 30, 2023 include restructuring initiatives that commenced in June 2023 in connection with the VectivBio\nAcquisition and restructuring expenses during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 include a headquarters-based\nworkforce reduction that commenced in April 2023. Both restructuring initiatives are more fully described in Note 12,\nWorkforce Reductions and Restructuring.\nAcquired In-Process Research and Development. We incurred approximately $1.1 billion of expense during the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2023 in connection with the VectivBio Acquisition to acquire apraglutide.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, Change September 30, Change\n2024 2023 $ 2024 2023 $\n(in thousands) (in thousands)\nOther income (expense):\nInterest expense and other financing costs $ (9,419) $ (9,839) $ 420 $ (24,120) $ (13,206) $ (10,914)\nInterest and investment income 1,152 1,748 (596) 3,690 17,777 (14,087)\nGain on derivatives — — — — 19 (19)\nTotal other income (expense), net $ (8,267) $ (8,091) $ (176) $ (20,430) $ 4,590 $ (25,020)\n36\nTable of Contents\nInterest Expense and Other Financing Costs. Interest expense decreased by $0.4 million for three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to a decrease of $0.4 million in\ncoupon interest expenses associated with the 2024 Convertible Notes, which were fully repaid upon maturity in June 2024.\nInterest expense increased by $10.9 million for nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months\nended September 30, 2023 primarily due to an increase of $11.6 million of interest expense incurred under the revolving credit\nfacility used to partially finance the VectivBio Acquisition in June 2023.\nInterest and Investment Income. Interest and investment income decreased by $0.6 million for the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily from a decrease in cash and\ninvestment balances following the VectivBio Acquisition in September 2023.\nInterest and investment income decreased by $14.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared\nto the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily from a decrease in cash and investment balances following the\nVectivBio Acquisition in June 2023.\nGain on Derivatives. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded an insignificant gain on\nderivatives resulting from a decrease in the fair value of our note hedge warrants, which terminated unexercised upon expiry\nduring April 2023.\nIncome Tax Expense. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded income tax expense of\n$13.7 million and $42.6 million, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded income\ntax expense of $18.0 million and $51.4 million, respectively. Due to our ability to utilize our net operating losses to offset\nfederal taxable income and taxable income in most states, the majority of our tax provision will be a non-cash expense until\nour net operating losses have been fully utilized.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of September 30, 2024, we had $88.2 million of cash and cash equivalents. Our cash equivalents include amounts\nheld in money market funds, U.S. Treasury securities and commercial paper. We invest cash in excess of immediate\nrequirements in accordance with our investment policy, which limits the amounts we may invest in certain types of\ninvestments and requires all investments held by us to be at least A- rated, with a remaining final maturity when purchased of\nless than twenty-four months, so as to primarily achieve liquidity and capital preservation objectives.\nWe anticipate our cash balance and our expected net cash inflows from operations to allow us to meet our near-term\nand long-term cash obligations, which are reflected in our condensed consolidated balance sheets. Our most significant fixed\nobligations are debt obligations and lease commitments, for which annual payments are disclosed in Note 9, Debt, and Note 7,\nLeases, respectively, to our financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\nWe may from time to time seek to retire, redeem or repurchase all or part of our outstanding debt through cash\npurchases and/or exchanges, in open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, by tender offer or otherwise. Such\nrepurchases, redemptions or exchanges, if any, of our debt will depend on prevailing market conditions, liquidity\nrequirements, contractual restrictions and other factors, and the amounts involved may be material.\nSources of Liquidity\nWe have financed our operations to date primarily through both the private sale of our preferred stock and the public\nsale of our common stock, debt financings, and cash generated from our operations. As of September 30, 2024, our debt is\ncomprised of $200.0 million aggregate principal amount of convertible notes, due in 2026, and $400.0 million aggregate\nprincipal amount outstanding under our Revolving Credit Facility, which we entered into in May 2023 to partially finance the\nVectivBio Acquisition. The Revolving Credit Facility provides for $550.0 million of borrowing capacity and includes a $10.0\nmillion letter of credit subfacility. Refer to Note 9, Debt, to our condensed consolidated financial statements included\nelsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for information related to our debt obligations.\n37\nTable of Contents\nSummary of Cash Flows\nThe following table summarizes cash flows from operating, investing, and financing activities for the three and nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\n(in thousands) (in thousands)\nNet cash provided by (used in):\nOperating activities $ 9,885 $ 32,459 $ 88,335 $ 147,593\nInvesting activities (16) (22,625) (142) (1,022,130)\nFinancing activities (27,156) (74,988) (92,083) 328,064\nEffect of exchange rate changes on cash, cash equivalents and\nrestricted cash (26) (3) (53) (3)\nNet decrease in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash $ (17,313) $ (65,157) $ (3,943) $ (546,476)\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities is derived by adjusting net income (loss) for non-cash items and changes in\noperating assets and liabilities, which reflect timing differences between the receipt and payment of cash associated with\ntransactions and when they are recognized in the results of operations.\nNet cash inflows for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 totaled $9.9 million and $88.3 million,\nrespectively, and were derived primarily from collaboration arrangements revenue related to sales of LINZESS in the U.S. Net\ncash inflows for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 were $32.5 million and $147.6 million, respectively,\nand were primarily from collaboration arrangements revenue related to sales of LINZESS in the U.S.\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\nCash used in investing activities for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was insignificant and\npertained to the purchase of property and equipment. Cash used in investing activities for the three and nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023 was $22.6 million and approximately $1.0 billion, respectively, and pertained primarily to the VectivBio\nAcquisition.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\nCash used in financing activities for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 totaled $27.2 million and\n$92.1 million, respectively. Cash used in financing activities during the three months ended September 30, 2024 was\ncomprised primarily of a $25.0 million repayment on the Revolving Credit Facility. Cash used in financing activities during\nthe nine months ended September 30, 2024 was comprised primarily of the repayment of $200.0 million aggregate principal\non the 2024 Convertible Notes upon their maturity in June 2024, partially offset by $100.0 million of net borrowings under the\nRevolving Credit Facility and $10.8 million from stock option exercises and employee stock purchases.\nCash used in financing activities for the three months ended September 30, 2023 totaled $75.0 million and related\nprimarily to the repayment of borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility. Cash provided by financing activities for the\nnine months ended September 30, 2023 totaled $328.1 million and was generated primarily from the incurrence of $400.0\nmillion of borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility, net of $75.0 million of principal repayments.\n38\nTable of Contents\nFunding Requirements\nWe began commercializing LINZESS in the U.S. with our collaboration partner, AbbVie, in the fourth quarter of\n2012, and we currently derive a significant portion of our revenue from this collaboration. Our goal is to generate and\nmaintain positive cash flows, driven by increased revenue generated through sales of LINZESS and other commercial\nactivities and financial discipline, while continuing to invest in the development and commercialization of linaclotide,\napraglutide, and other product candidates.\nUnder our collaboration with AbbVie for North America, total net sales of LINZESS in the U.S., as recorded by\nAbbVie, are reduced by commercial costs incurred by each party, and the resulting amount is shared equally between us and\nAbbVie. Additionally, we receive royalties from AbbVie based on sales of linaclotide in its licensed territories outside of the\nU.S. We believe revenues from our LINZESS partnership for the U.S. with AbbVie will continue to constitute a significant\nportion of our total revenue for the foreseeable future and we cannot be certain that such revenues, as well as the revenues\nfrom our other commercial activities, will continue to enable us to generate positive cash flows, or to do so in the timeframes\nwe expect. We also anticipate that we will continue to incur substantial expenses for the next several years as we further\ndevelop and commercialize linaclotide in the U.S., develop and commercialize other products, including apraglutide, and\ninvest in building our pipeline through internal or external opportunities. We believe that our cash on hand as of September 30,\n2024 will be sufficient to meet our projected operating needs at least through the next twelve months from the issuance of\nthese financial statements.\nOur forecast of the period of time through which our financial resources will be adequate to support our operations,\nincluding the underlying revenue expectations and estimates regarding the costs to continue to develop, obtain regulatory\napproval for, and commercialize linaclotide in the U.S., as well as our expectations regarding revenue from Astellas for Japan\nand AstraZeneca for China (including Hong Kong and Macau), and our goal to generate and maintain positive cash flows, are\nforward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could vary materially and negatively from\nthese and other forward-looking statements as a result of a number of factors, including the factors discussed under the\nheadings “Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and under “Part I, Item 1A—\nRisk Factors” in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. We have based our estimates on assumptions that may prove to be\nwrong, and we could utilize our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect.\nDue to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the development and commercialization of our product\ncandidates, we are unable to estimate precisely the amounts of capital outlays and operating expenditures necessary to\ndevelop, obtain regulatory approval for, and commercialize linaclotide, apraglutide and our other product candidates, in each\ncase, for all of the markets, indications, populations and formulations for which we believe each is suited. Our funding\nrequirements will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to, the following:\n● the revenue generated by sales of LINZESS and CONSTELLA and from any other sources;\n● the rate of progress and cost of our commercialization activities, including the expense we incur in marketing\nand selling LINZESS in the U.S. and from any other sources;\n● the success of our third-party manufacturing activities;\n● the time and costs involved in developing, and obtaining regulatory approvals for, our product candidates,\nincluding apraglutide, as well as the timing and cost of any post-approval development and regulatory\nrequirements;\n● the time and cost associated with integrating VectivBio’s business and assets into our business operations;\n● the time and costs associated with commercial manufacturing, sales, marketing and distribution of apraglutide, if\napproved;\n● the success of our research and development efforts;\n● the emergence of competing or complementary products;\n39\nTable of Contents\n● the costs of filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights;\n● the terms and timing of any collaborative, licensing or other arrangements that we may establish, including\nmilestones, royalties or other payments due or payable under such agreements;\n● the settlement method used for our outstanding convertible notes; and\n● the acquisition of businesses, products and technologies and the impact of other strategic transactions, as well as\nthe cost and timing of evaluating, acquiring, and, if completed, integrating into our business operations any such\nassets.\nFinancing Strategy\nWe may, from time to time, consider additional funding through a combination of new collaborative arrangements,\nstrategic alliances, and additional equity and debt financings or from other sources. We will continue to manage our capital\nstructure and to consider all financing opportunities, whenever they may occur, that could strengthen our long-term liquidity\nprofile. Any such capital transactions may or may not be similar to transactions in which we have engaged in the past. There\ncan be no assurance that any such financing opportunities will also be available on acceptable terms, if at all.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nFor a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements, refer to Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,\nto our consolidated financial statements in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K and Note 2, Summary of Significant\nAccounting Policies, appearing elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. We did not otherwise adopt any new\naccounting pronouncements during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 that had a material effect on our\ncondensed consolidated financial statements included in this report.\nItem 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\nInterest Rate Risk\nWe are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates. We invest our cash in a variety of financial\ninstruments, principally securities issued by the U.S. government and its agencies, including collateralized reverse repurchase\nagreements, and money market instruments, as well as commercial paper. The goals of our investment policy are preservation\nof capital, fulfillment of liquidity needs and fiduciary control of cash and investments. We also seek to maximize income from\nour investments without assuming significant risk.\nOur primary exposure to market risk is interest income sensitivity, which is affected by changes in the general level\nof interest rates, particularly because our investments are in short-term marketable securities. Due to the primarily short-term\nduration of our investment portfolio and the low risk profile of our investments, an immediate 1% change in interest rates\nwould not have a material effect on the fair market value of our portfolio. Accordingly, we would not expect our operating\nresults or cash flows to be affected to any significant degree by the effect of a sudden change in market interest rates on our\ninvestment portfolio.\nWe do not believe our cash and cash equivalents have significant risk of default or illiquidity. While we believe our\ncash and cash equivalents do not contain excessive risk, we cannot provide absolute assurance that in the future our\ninvestments will not be subject to adverse changes in market value. In addition, we maintain significant amounts of cash and\ncash equivalents at one or more financial institutions that are in excess of federally insured limits. Given the potential\ninstability of financial institutions, we cannot provide assurance that we will not experience losses on these deposits.\nOur convertible senior notes bear interest at a fixed rate and therefore have minimal exposure to changes in interest\nrates; however, because these interest rates are fixed, we may be paying a higher interest rate, relative to market, in the future\nif our credit rating improves or other circumstances change.\n40\nTable of Contents\nWe are exposed to market risks related to fluctuations in interest rates relating to our secured $550.0 million\nRevolving Credit Facility. The increase or decrease in annual interest expense resulting from a 10% increase or decrease in the\napplicable interest rate is $3.2 million.\nEquity Price Risk\nOur convertible senior notes include conversion and settlement provisions that are based on the price of our Class A\nCommon Stock at conversion or maturity of the notes. The amount of cash we may be required to pay is determined by the\nprice of our Class A Common Stock. The fair value of our convertible senior notes is dependent on the price and volatility of\nour Class A Common Stock and will generally increase or decrease as the market price of our common stock changes.\nTo minimize the impact of potential dilution to our common stock upon conversion of the notes, we entered into the\ncapped call transactions with respect to the 1.50% convertible senior notes due 2026.\nThe convertible notes and derivatives are more fully described in Note 9, Debt, in the accompanying notes to our\ncondensed consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\nForeign Currency Risk\nWe are also exposed to risks related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates relating to our foreign operations.\nThe functional currency of our international subsidiaries is the local currency. We are exposed to foreign currency risk to the\nextent that we enter into transactions denominated in currencies other than our subsidiaries’ respective functional currencies.\nWe are also exposed to unfavorable fluctuations of the U.S. dollar, which is our reporting currency, against the currencies of\nour operating subsidiaries when their respective financial statements are translated into U.S. dollars for inclusion in our\ncondensed consolidated financial statements. We do not currently hedge our foreign currency exchange rate risk. Foreign\ncurrency has not had, nor do we believe that a decrease or increase in any foreign currency exchange rates would have, a\nmaterial impact on our results of operations.\nItem 4. Controls and Procedures\nLimitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures\nIn designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and\nprocedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control\nobjectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints\nand that management is required to apply judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to\ntheir costs.\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nAs required by Rule 13a-15(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or Exchange Act, our management, including\nour principal executive officer and our principal financial officer, conducted an evaluation as of the end of the period covered\nby this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and\nprocedures. Based on that evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that our\ndisclosure controls and procedures as of such date are effective at the reasonable assurance level in ensuring that information\nrequired to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized\nand reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include,\nwithout limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports\nwe file under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive\nofficer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nAs required by Rule 13a-15(d) of the Exchange Act, our management, including our principal executive officer and\nour principal financial officer, conducted an evaluation of the internal control over financial reporting to determine\n41\nTable of Contents\nwhether any changes occurred during the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that have materially affected,\nor are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nDuring the third quarter of 2024, we implemented a new global enterprise resource planning (“ERP”) system. The\nimplementation of the system will continue through early 2025. The ERP replaces the existing financial systems we have\nhistorically relied on. Throughout the implementation, we are reassessing our processes and procedures, which may result in\nchanges to our internal control over financial reporting.\nBased on management’s evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that no\nchanges during the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q materially affected, or were reasonably likely to\nmaterially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. On June 29, 2023, we completed the acquisition of VectivBio\nand in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K, we excluded VectivBio from our evaluation of internal control over financial\nreporting. This exclusion was in accordance with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s guidance that a recently\nacquired business may be omitted from the assessment scope for up to one year form the date of acquisition. We have\nextended our oversight and monitoring processes that support our internal control over financial reporting, as well as our\ndisclosure controls and procedures, to the acquired operations of VectivBio, and we will incorporate VectivBio into our annual\nassessment of internal control over financial reporting for our fiscal year ending December 31, 2024.\n42\nTable of Contents\nPART II OTHER INFORMATION\nItem 1A.

You should, however, review the factors and risks we\ndescribe in the reports we will file from time to time with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, after the\ndate of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nSummary of Risks Associated with our Business\nOur business is subject to a number of risks, which are discussed more fully under the heading “Risk Factors” in this\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K. These risks include the following:\n● We are highly dependent on the commercial success of LINZESS® (linaclotide) in the United States, or the\nU.S., for the foreseeable future.\n● We are subject to uncertainty relating to pricing and reimbursement policies in the U.S. which, if not\nfavorable for our products, could hinder or prevent our products’ commercial success.\n● We cannot give any assurance that apraglutide will be successful in clinical trials, and if successful, receive\nregulatory approval, which is necessary before it can be commercialized.\n3\nTable of Contents\n● The regulatory approval processes in the U.S., in the E.U. and in other foreign jurisdictions are lengthy,\ntime consuming and inherently unpredictable. If we are ultimately unable to obtain regulatory approval for\napraglutide or our other product candidates, our business will be harmed.\n● Delays in the completion of clinical testing of any of our products or product candidates could result in\nincreased costs and delay or limit our ability to generate revenues.\n● Our failure to successfully develop and commercialize additional product candidates or approved products\nwould impair our ability to grow and/or adversely affect our business.\n● We must work effectively and collaboratively with AbbVie Inc. (together with its affiliates) to market and\nsell LINZESS in the U.S., and must adapt our commercial model and market strategy to the evolving\nlandscape for LINZESS to achieve its maximum commercial potential.\n● We face competition and new products may emerge that provide different or better alternatives for treatment\nof the conditions that our products are approved to treat.\n● Our products or product candidates may cause undesirable side effects or have other properties that could\ndelay or prevent their development, create unpredictable clinical trial results, impact its regulatory approval or\nlimit their commercial potential.\n● Even though LINZESS is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for use in adult and certain\npediatric patients, post-approval development and regulatory requirements still remain, which may present\nadditional challenges.\n● If we are unable to execute on our strategy to in-license or acquire externally developed products or product\ncandidates, or engage in other transactions with value creation potential, our business and prospects would be\nmaterially adversely affected.\n● We may be unable to maintain the benefits associated with orphan drug designation, including market\nexclusivity, which may harm our business.\n● If we are unable to successfully partner with other companies to develop and commercialize products and/or\nproduct candidates, our ability to grow would be impaired and our business would be adversely affected.\n● We may be unable to successfully integrate the business and personnel of VectivBio and may not realize the\nexpected benefits and anticipated synergies of such acquisition.\n● Our failure to successfully develop and commercialize additional product candidates or approved products\nwould impair our ability to grow and/or adversely affect our business.\n● Healthcare reform and other governmental and private payor initiatives may have an adverse effect upon, and\ncould prevent, our products’ or product candidates’ commercial success.\n● Limitations on our ability to obtain patent protection and/or the patent rights relating to our products and our\nproduct candidates may limit our ability to prevent third parties from competing against us.\n● Our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition or restrict our future operations.\nNOTE REGARDING TRADEMARKS\nLINZESS® and CONSTELLA® are trademarks of Ironwood Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

LINZESS is\navailable to adult men and women suffering from IBS-C or CIC in the United States, or the U.S., Mexico, and Saudi Arabia,\nto adult men and women suffering from IBS-C or chronic constipation in Japan, IBS-C in China and for pediatric patients ages\n6-17 with FC in the U.S. Linaclotide is available under the trademarked name CONSTELLA® to adult men and women\nsuffering from IBS-C or CIC in Canada, and to adult men and women suffering from IBS-C in certain European countries.\nWe have strategic partnerships with leading pharmaceutical companies to support the development and\ncommercialization of linaclotide throughout the world, including with AbbVie Inc. (together with its affiliates), or AbbVie, in\nthe U.S. and all countries worldwide other than China (including Hong Kong and Macau) and Japan, AstraZeneca AB\n(together with its affiliates), or AstraZeneca, in China (including Hong Kong and Macau) and Astellas Pharma Inc., or\nAstellas, in Japan.\nWe also aim to leverage our leading development and commercialization capabilities in GI to bring additional\ntreatment options to GI patients.\nIn June 2023, we completed a tender offer to purchase 98% of the outstanding ordinary shares of VectivBio Holding\nAG, or VectivBio, a clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on the discovery and development of treatments for severe,\nrare GI conditions for which there is a significant unmet medical need, or the VectivBio Acquisition. In December 2023, we\ncompleted a squeeze-out merger to acquire all remaining shares. The VectivBio Acquisition was partially funded with $400.0\nmillion of borrowings under a new revolving credit facility, or the Revolving Credit Facility, as further described in Note 10,\nDebt, to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Through the\nacquisition, the Company is advancing apraglutide, a next-generation, synthetic peptide analog of glucagon-like peptide-2, or\nGLP-2, for rare gastrointestinal diseases, including short bowel syndrome dependent on parenteral support, also known as\nSBS-IF, as well as several earlier stage assets.\nIn November 2021, we entered into a collaboration and license option agreement, or the COUR Collaboration\nAgreement, with COUR Pharmaceutical Development Company, Inc., or COUR, that grants us an option to acquire an\nexclusive license to research, develop, manufacture and commercialize, in the U.S., products containing CNP-104, a tolerizing\nimmune modifying nanoparticle, for the treatment of primary biliary cholangitis, or PBC.\nWe are also advancing IW-3300, a GC-C agonist, for the potential treatment of visceral pain conditions, such as\ninterstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome, or IC/BPS, and endometriosis.\nWe were incorporated in Delaware on January 5, 1998 as Microbia, Inc. On April 7, 2008, we changed our name to\nIronwood Pharmaceuticals, Inc. To date, we have dedicated a majority of our activities to the research, development and\ncommercialization of linaclotide, as well as to the research and development of our other product candidates.\n5\nTable of Contents\nPerformance Against 2023 Core Priorities\nIn 2023, our GI-focused strategy, building on our commercial success and GI development capabilities, continued to\nfocus on three core priorities: maximize LINZESS, strengthen and progress our innovative GI portfolio, and deliver sustained\nprofits and generate cash flow.\nMaximize LINZESS\n● We recognized $430.5 million in collaborative arrangements revenue related to sales of LINZESS in the U.S.\nduring the year ended December 31, 2023, an increase of $31.7 million compared to the year ended December\n31, 2022. The increase was primarily driven by an increase in LINZESS prescription demand, partially offset by\ninventory channel fluctuations.\n● In June 2023, the U.S. FDA approved LINZESS as a once-daily treatment for pediatric patients ages 6-17 years-\nold with FC, making LINZESS the first and only FDA-approved prescription therapy for FC in this patient\npopulation. The safety and effectiveness of LINZESS in patients with FC less than 6 years of age or in patients\nwith IBS-C less than 18 years of age have not been established. Additional clinical pediatric programs in IBS-C\nand FC are ongoing.\nStrengthen and progress our innovative GI portfolio\n● We are conducting a Phase III clinical trial, STARS, to assess the safety and efficacy of apraglutide in adult\npatients with SBS-IF, and expect to report topline results in March 2024. In April 2023, the U.S. FDA granted\nFast Track Designation to apraglutide in SBS-IF. In October 2023, we presented positive final data from the\nSTARS Nutrition Phase II study of apraglutide in patients with SBS-IF and colon-in-continuity. We are also\nconducting open label extension studies to further evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of apraglutide in\nSBS-IF and to support potential submissions of marketing applications for apraglutide in the U.S., European\nUnion, or E.U., and Japan.\n● We are also conducting a Phase II exploratory study, STARGAZE, to evaluate apraglutide in patients with\nsteroid-refractory gastrointestinal acute Graft versus Host Disease, or aGvHD, a life-threatening condition that\noccurs when immune cells from the donor attack a recipient’s healthy cells after an allogeneic hematopoietic\nstem cell transplant, and expect data in the first quarter of 2024.\n● Through the COUR Collaboration Agreement, we and COUR are developing CNP-104 for the treatment of\nPBC, a rare autoimmune disease targeting the liver. In December 2021, the U.S. FDA granted Fast Track\nDesignation to CNP-104. COUR is currently conducting a clinical study to evaluate the safety, tolerability,\npharmacodynamic effects and efficacy of CNP-104 in PBC patients, with topline data expected in the third\nquarter of 2024.\n● We are developing IW-3300, a GC-C agonist, for the potential treatment of visceral pain conditions, including\nIC/BPS and endometriosis. We successfully completed Phase I studies to evaluate the safety and tolerability of\nIW-3300 in healthy volunteers and are continuing the Phase II proof of concept study in IC/BPS.\nDeliver sustained profits and cash flow\n● In 2023, we recognized a net loss of approximately $1.0 billion, which included a non-recurring charge of\napproximately $1.1 billion for acquired in-process research and development in connection with the VectivBio\nAcquisition.\n● We generated $183.4 million in cash from operations during the year ended December 31, 2023, ending the year\nwith $92.2 million in cash and cash equivalents.\n6\nTable of Contents\nOur Pipeline\nThe following table presents the status and anticipated near-term catalysts of selected key development programs in\nour pipeline as of December 31, 2023:\nThe status of our development programs in the table above represents the ongoing phase of development and does\nnot correspond to the completion of a particular phase. Drug development involves a high degree of risk and investment, and\nthe status, timing and scope of our development programs are subject to change. Important factors that could adversely affect\nour drug development efforts are discussed under the heading “Risk Factors” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nLinaclotide\nIBS-C and CIC are chronic, functional GI disorders that afflict millions of sufferers worldwide. As many as\n11.5 million adults suffer from IBS-C and as many as 28.5 million adults suffer from CIC in the U.S., based on Rome II\ncriteria from the Lieberman GI Patient Landscape Survey performed in 2010, or the Lieberman Survey. Symptoms of IBS-C\ninclude abdominal pain, discomfort and/or bloating and constipation symptoms (e.g., incomplete evacuation, infrequent bowel\nmovements, hard/lumpy stools), while CIC is primarily characterized by constipation symptoms. Greater than 65% of IBS-C\npatients suffer from bloating and/or discomfort at least one time per week, according to the Lieberman Survey.\nLinaclotide—U.S. In August 2012, the U.S. FDA approved LINZESS as a once-daily treatment for adult men and\nwomen suffering from IBS-C (290 mcg dose) or CIC (145 mcg dose). We and AbbVie began commercializing LINZESS in\nthe U.S. in December 2012. In January 2017, the U.S. FDA approved a 72 mcg dose of linaclotide for the treatment of adult\nmen and women with CIC.\nWe and AbbVie continue to explore ways to enhance the clinical profile of linaclotide by studying linaclotide in\nadditional indications, populations, and formulations to assess its potential to treat various conditions. In September 2020,\nbased on Phase IIIb data demonstrating the efficacy and safety of LINZESS 290 mcg on the overall abdominal symptoms of\nbloating, pain and discomfort, in adult patients with IBS-C, the U.S. FDA approved our Supplemental New Drug Application,\nor sNDA, to include a more comprehensive description of the effects of LINZESS in its approved label.\nIn addition, we and AbbVie have established a nonclinical and clinical post-marketing plan with the U.S. FDA to\nunderstand the safety and efficacy of LINZESS in pediatric patients. In August 2021, the U.S. FDA approved a revised label\nfor LINZESS based on clinical safety data that had been generated thus far in pediatric studies. The updated label modified the\nboxed warning for risk of serious dehydration and contraindication against use in children to those less than two years of age.\nThe boxed warning and contraindication previously applied to all children less than 18\n7\nTable of Contents\nyears of age and less than 6 years of age, respectively. In June 2023, the U.S. FDA approved LINZESS as a once-daily\ntreatment for pediatric patients ages 6-17 years-old with FC, making LINZESS the first and only FDA-approved prescription\ntherapy for FC in this patient population. The safety and effectiveness of LINZESS in patients with FC less than 6 years of age\nor in patients with IBS-C less than 18 years of age have not been established. Additional clinical pediatric programs in IBS-C\nand FC are ongoing.\nLinaclotide—Global. AbbVie has rights to develop and commercialize linaclotide in all countries worldwide other\nthan China (including Hong Kong and Macau) and Japan. CONSTELLA is the first, and to date, only drug approved in the\nEuropean Union, or E.U., for IBS-C. CONSTELLA first became commercially available in certain European countries\nbeginning 2013. AbbVie is commercializing CONSTELLA in a number of European countries, including the United\nKingdom, Italy and Spain for adults with IBS-C.\nAbbVie has exclusive rights to commercialize linaclotide in Canada as CONSTELLA and in Mexico as LINZESS.\nCONSTELLA became commercially available in Canada in 2014 for adults with IBS-C or CIC. LINZESS became\ncommercially available in Mexico in 2014, and in Saudi Arabia in 2023, for adults with IBS-C or CIC.\nAstellas has rights to develop, manufacture and commercialize linaclotide in Japan. Astellas began commercializing\nLINZESS in Japan for adults with IBS-C in 2017, and for adults with chronic constipation in 2018.\nAstraZeneca has rights to develop, manufacture and commercialize linaclotide in China (including Hong Kong and\nMacau). In 2019, AstraZeneca began commercializing LINZESS in China for adults with IBS-C.\nApraglutide\nThrough the VectivBio Acquisition, we are advancing apraglutide, a next-generation, long-acting synthetic peptide\nanalog of GLP-2, as a potentially differentiated therapeutic for rare diseases, including SBS-IF and aGvHD.\nSBS is a malabsorption disorder caused by the loss of functional small intestine, with symptoms that include\ndiarrhea, dehydration, malnutrition and weight loss. SBS typically occurs in adults as a consequence of irreparable GI damage\ncaused by physical trauma, Crohn’s disease, ulcerative colitis, ischemia or cancer requiring surgeries that result in the removal\nof large portions of the small intestine or colon. In infants and children, SBS is typically a consequence of congenital defects\nor decreases in intestinal absorptive capacity secondary to surgical procedures. The symptoms and severity of SBS can vary\ndepending upon the length and function of the remaining portion of the intestine. Patients suffer from SBS-IF when their gut\nfunction is reduced below the minimum function necessary for the absorption of macronutrients or water and electrolytes\nrequired to survive and, in the case of infants and children, to maintain health and growth.\nWe are conducting a Phase III clinical trial, STARS, to assess the safety and efficacy of apraglutide in adult patients\nwith SBS-IF, and expect to report topline results in March 2024. In October 2023, we presented positive final data from the\nSTARS Nutrition Phase II study of apraglutide in patients with SBS-IF and colon-in-continuity. We are also conducting open\nlabel extension studies to further evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of apraglutide in SBS-IF and to support potential\nsubmissions of marketing applications for apraglutide in the U.S., European Union, or E.U., and Japan.\nWe are also conducting a Phase II exploratory study, STARGAZE, to evaluate apraglutide in patients with steroid-\nrefractory gastrointestinal aGvHD and expect data in the first quarter of 2024.\nCNP-104\nThrough the COUR Collaboration Agreement, we and COUR are developing CNP-104 for the potential treatment of\nPBC, a rare autoimmune disease targeting the liver that affects approximately 130,000 people in the U.S., according to a study\npublished in Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology in 2018. If successful, CNP-104 has the potential to be the first\napproved PBC disease modifying therapy. In December 2021, the U.S. FDA granted Fast Track Designation to CNP-104.\nCOUR is currently conducting a clinical study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacodynamic effects and efficacy of\nCNP-104 in PBC patients, with topline data expected in the third quarter of 2024.\n8\nTable of Contents\nIW-3300\nWe are advancing IW-3300, a GC-C agonist, for the potential treatment of visceral pain conditions, including IC/BPS\nand endometriosis. IC/BPS affects an estimated 4 to 12 million Americans, according to the Interstitial Cystitis Association as\nof 2022. An estimated 4 million reproductive-age women in the U.S. have diagnosed endometriosis, according to a study\npublished in Gynecologic and Obstetric Investigation in 2017. Both diseases have a limited number of treatment options\navailable. We successfully completed Phase I studies to evaluate the safety and tolerability of IW-3300 in healthy volunteers\nand are continuing the Phase II proof of concept study in IC/BPS.\nCollaborations and Partnerships\nAs part of our GI-focused strategy, we have established development and commercial capabilities that we plan to\nleverage as we seek to bring multiple medicines to patients. We intend to play an active role in the development and\ncommercialization of our products in the U.S., either independently or with partners that have strong capabilities. We also\nintend to establish strong global brands by out-licensing development and commercialization rights to our products in other\nkey territories to high-performing partners. We plan to seek collaborations that increase the value of our products by providing\nmeaningful economics and incentives for us and any potential partner. We intend to continue to expand our expertise in GI by\naccessing innovative externally developed products and to leverage our existing capabilities to develop and commercialize\nthese products in the U.S.\nWe have pursued a partnering strategy for commercializing linaclotide that has allowed us to focus our\ncommercialization efforts in the U.S. and enabled partners with strong global capabilities to commercialize linaclotide in\nterritories outside of the U.S.\nThe following chart shows our revenue for the U.S. and the rest of the world as a percentage of our total revenue for\neach of the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021.\nYear Ended December 31,\n2023 2022 2021\nU.S. 97.8 % 98.1 % 97.8 %\nRest of world 2.2 % 1.9 % 2.2 %\n100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 %\nRevenue attributable to our linaclotide partnerships comprised substantially all of our revenue for each of the years\nindicated. Further, we currently derive a significant portion of our revenue from our LINZESS collaboration with AbbVie for\nthe U.S. and believe that the revenues from this collaboration will continue to constitute a significant portion of our total\nrevenue for the foreseeable future. Our revenue from our LINZESS collaboration with AbbVie for the U.S. is highly\ndependent on the responsiveness of patients to fill prescriptions and other factors such as retail chain and wholesaler buying\npatterns, pricing and reimbursement and inventory channel levels. Our collaborative arrangements revenue may continue to\nfluctuate as a result of the timing and amount of royalties from sales of linaclotide in the markets in which it is currently\napproved, or any other markets where linaclotide receives approval, as well as clinical and commercial milestones received\nand recognized under our strategic partnerships outside of the U.S.\nCollaboration Agreement for North America with AbbVie\nIn September 2007, we entered into a collaboration agreement with AbbVie to develop and commercialize linaclotide\nfor the treatment of IBS-C, CIC and other GI conditions in North America. Under the terms of the collaboration agreement,\nwe and AbbVie are jointly and equally funding the development and commercialization of LINZESS in the U.S., with equal\nshare of any profits or losses. Additionally, we granted AbbVie exclusive rights to develop and commercialize linaclotide in\nCanada and Mexico for which we receive royalties in the mid-teens percent on net sales in those countries. AbbVie is solely\nresponsible for the further development, regulatory approval and commercialization of linaclotide in those countries and\nfunding any costs.\n9\nTable of Contents\nLicense Agreement with AbbVie (All countries other than the countries and territories of North America, China (including\nHong Kong and Macau), and Japan)\nIn April 2009, we entered into a license agreement with Almirall, S.A., or Almirall, or the European License\nAgreement, to develop and commercialize linaclotide in Europe (including the Commonwealth of Independent States and\nTurkey) for the treatment of IBS-C, CIC, and other GI conditions. In October 2015, Almirall transferred its exclusive license\nto develop and commercialize linaclotide in Europe to AbbVie. In January 2017, we and AbbVie entered into an amendment to\nthe European License Agreement. The European License Agreement, as amended, extended the license to develop and\ncommercialize linaclotide in all countries other than China (including Hong Kong and Macau), Japan, and the countries and\nterritories of North America. We refer to the additional licensed countries as the Expanded Territory. Under the European\nLicense agreement, AbbVie is obligated to pay us (i) certain commercial milestones totaling up to $42.5 million, (ii) royalties\nbased on sales volume in Europe, beginning in the mid-single digits percent and escalating to the upper-teens percent, and (iii)\non a country-by-country and product-by-product basis in the Expanded Territory, a royalty as a percentage of net sales of\nproducts containing linaclotide as an active ingredient in the upper-single digits for five years following the first commercial\nsale of a linaclotide product in a country, and in the low-double digits thereafter. The royalty rate for products in the Expanded\nTerritory will decrease, on a country-by-country basis, to the lower-single digits, or cease entirely, following the occurrence of\ncertain events.\nLicense Agreement for Japan with Astellas\nIn November 2009, we entered into a license agreement with Astellas to develop and commercialize linaclotide for\nthe treatment of IBS-C, CIC, and other GI conditions in Japan. On August 1, 2019, we and Astellas amended and restated the\nlicense agreement. Under the terms of the amended and restated license agreement, Astellas is obligated to pay royalties to us\nat rates beginning in the mid-single-digits percent and escalating to low-double-digits percent, based on aggregate annual net\nsales in Japan of products containing linaclotide API.\nCollaboration Agreement for China (including Hong Kong and Macau), with AstraZeneca\nIn October 2012, we entered into a collaboration agreement with AstraZeneca to co-develop and co-commercialize\nlinaclotide in China (including Hong Kong and Macau). In September 2019, we and AstraZeneca amended and restated the\ncollaboration agreement, under which AstraZeneca obtained the exclusive right to develop, manufacture and commercialize\nproducts containing linaclotide in the territory. Under the terms of the amended and restated agreement, we transferred all\nmanufacturing responsibilities in China (including Hong Kong and Macau) to AstraZeneca, and we are entitled to receive non-\ncontingent payments totaling $35.0 million in three installments through 2024, of which $15.0 million remained outstanding at\nDecember 31, 2023. In addition, AstraZeneca may be required to make milestone payments totaling up to $90.0 million\ncontingent on the achievement of certain sales targets and is required to pay tiered royalties to us at rates beginning in the mid-\nsingle-digits percent and increasing up to twenty percent based on the aggregate annual net sales of products containing\nlinaclotide in the territory.\nCollaboration and License Option Agreement with COUR\nIn November 2021, we entered into the COUR Collaboration Agreement with COUR, pursuant to which we have\nbeen granted an option to acquire an exclusive license to research, develop, manufacture and commercialize, in the U.S.,\nproducts containing CNP-104 for the treatment of PBC. In December 2021, the U.S. FDA granted Fast Track Designation to\nCNP-104. COUR has initiated a clinical study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacodynamic effects and efficacy of\nCNP-104 in PBC patients, with topline data expected in the third quarter of 2024.\nPursuant to the terms of the COUR Collaboration Agreement, we made an upfront, non-refundable payment of $6.0\nmillion to COUR during the year ended December 31, 2021, and agreed to pay a non-contingent payment and milestone\npayments to COUR totaling $13.5 million in connection with certain development activities and regulatory milestones. In\nApril 2023, the Company and COUR executed an amendment to the COUR Collaboration Agreement, in which the Company\nagreed to pay a one-time, non-refundable, upfront payment of $6.0 million to COUR in exchange for the right to apply a credit\nof $6.6 million against future amounts due to COUR in connection with the exercise of the Option, commercial milestones, or\nroyalties. In connection with such payment, COUR also granted the Company a right of first negotiation over certain\nadditional potential research and development programs.\n10\nTable of Contents\nAfter reviewing the data from the clinical study for CNP-104, if we exercise the option, we will pay COUR $28.4\nmillion in exchange for the exclusive license. Upon commercialization, we will pay royalties to COUR in the high-single\ndigits to low-double digits percentage of the aggregated annual net sales in the U.S. of products containing CNP-104, and\nCOUR will be eligible to receive commercial milestone payments of up to $440.0 million over the term of the agreement.\nDevelopment and Commercialization Agreement with AKP\nIn March 2022, VectivBio entered into a development and commercialization agreement with Asahi Kasei Pharma\nCorporation, or AKP, in which VectivBio granted an exclusive license to AKP, with the right to sublicense in multiple tiers, to\ndevelop, commercialize and exploit products derived from apraglutide in Japan.\nPursuant to the terms of the development and commercialization agreement with AKP, VectivBio received an upfront\npayment of JPY 3,000 million ($24.6 million at date of agreement) and is eligible to receive development related payments of\nJPY 1,600 million in the aggregate ($13.1 million at date of agreement), development milestones of JPY 1,000 million ($8.2\nmillion at date of agreement) and up to JPY 19,000 million ($155.8 million at date of agreement) of commercial and sales-\nbased milestone payments. We are also eligible to receive payments in the commercial period for manufacturing supply equal\nto cost-plus manufacturing mark-up and tiered royalties of up to a mid-double-digit percentage on product sales continuing\nuntil the later of (i) expiration of regulatory exclusivity in Japan, or (ii) expiration of the last valid patent claim that provides\nexclusivity to apraglutide in Japan, or the Royalty Term. The development and commercialization agreement will terminate\nupon the expiration of the Royalty Term.\nOur Strategy\nOur vision is to become the leading GI healthcare company. To achieve this vision, we assembled a team with\ndemonstrated success in creating, acquiring and partnering, developing, and commercializing medicines that can make a\ndifference in patients’ lives. We are dedicated to leveraging our development and commercial expertise to advance the\ntreatment of GI diseases and redefine the standard of care for patients suffering from GI diseases. Our strategy is focused on\nthree core priorities: maximize LINZESS, advance our GI pipeline, and deliver sustained profits and cash flow.\nKey elements of our strategy include:\nMaximize LINZESS\n● Leveraging our U.S.-focused commercial capabilities in marketing, reimbursement, patient engagement,\nand sales to expand the commercial potential of LINZESS.\n● Exploring development opportunities to enhance the clinical profile of LINZESS by studying linaclotide in\nadditional indications, populations, and formulations.\n● Collaborating with global partners who share our vision, values, culture, and processes to develop and\ncommercialize linaclotide outside of the U.S.\nAdvance GI pipeline\n● Advancing our GI pipeline programs, highlighted by apraglutide for the potential treatment of SBS-IF and\nCNP-104 for the potential treatment of PBC.\n● Evaluating strategic partnership options for our wholly owned GC-C agonist, IW-3300, for the potential\ntreatment of IC/BPS and endometriosis.\nDeliver sustained profits and cash flows\n● Executing our strategy by delivering sustainable profits and cash flows.\n● Applying a thoughtful and disciplined capital allocation strategy to deliver value for our shareholders over\nthe long-term.\n11\nTable of Contents\nCompetition\nLinaclotide competes globally with certain branded and generic prescription therapies and over-the-counter, or OTC,\nproducts for the treatment of IBS-C and CIC, or their associated symptoms.\nOTC laxatives make up the majority of the treatments in the U.S. for IBS-C and CIC, according to our research.\nLINZESS is the number one prescribed branded treatment in the U.S. for adults with IBS-C and CIC, according to 2023 data\nfrom IQVIA Inc. National Prescription Audit.\nUntil the launch of LINZESS, the only available branded prescription therapy for IBS-C and CIC in the U.S. was\nAMITIZA® (lubiprostone), which was approved for the treatment of CIC in 2006, for the treatment of IBS-C in 2008, and for\nthe treatment of opioid induced constipation in 2013. AMITIZA is being commercialized in the U.S. by Takeda\nPharmaceuticals Limited, or Takeda. AMITIZA also is being commercialized for the treatment of adults with CIC in certain\nEuropean countries, including the United Kingdom and Switzerland by Sucampo AG, and for the treatment of chronic\nconstipation in Japan by Mylan N.V. Authorized generic versions of AMITIZA became available in the U.S. since January\n2021. TRULANCE® (plecanatide) was approved in the U.S. for the treatment of CIC in adults in January 2017 and for the\ntreatment of IBS-C in adults in January 2018 and is being commercialized in the U.S. by Bausch Health Companies, or\nBausch. Shire plc obtained approval of MOTEGRITY™ (prucalopride) in the U.S. for the treatment of CIC in adults in\nDecember 2018. In April 2022, Ardelyx, Inc., or Ardelyx, launched IBSRELATM (tenapanor), a U.S. FDA approved treatment\nfor IBS-C in adults, and in August 2022, Vibrant Gastro Inc. launched Vibrant, a drug-free capsule that the U.S. FDA granted\nmarketing authorization for the treatment of CIC in adults who have not experienced relief of their bowel symptoms by using\nlaxative therapies at the recommended dosage for at least one month. OTC laxatives such as MiraLAX® and DULCOLAX®,\nand lactulose, a prescription laxative treatment, are also available for the treatment of constipation.\nIn addition, any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing drugs\nand new drugs that may become available in the future. For example, for apraglutide, we compete with companies that are\ncommercializing or developing drugs for SBS, such as Takeda, which currently distributes the GLP-2 analog teduglutide,\nmarketed as GATTEX® (teduglutide) in the U.S. and REVESTIVE® (teduglutide for injection) in Europe, and Zealand\nPharma A/S, which is developing the GLP-2 analog glepaglutide for the treatment of SBS and which submitted an NDA to the\nU.S. FDA in December 2023. Hanmi Pharmaceutical is also developing a GLP-2 analog which is in Phase 2. Products with\nother mechanisms of action may emerge as future competition.\nManufacturing and Supply\nLinaclotide\nIt is our objective that the supply of linaclotide be safe and effective, with redundancy built into critical steps of the\nsupply chain, and that each of our collaboration partners are in a position to manage the supply and distribution of linaclotide\nin their respective territories through a combination of contract manufacturers and in-house manufacturing capabilities.\nLinaclotide production consists of three phases—manufacture of the API (sometimes referred to as drug substance),\nmanufacture of finished drug product and manufacture of finished goods. We and/or our partners have commercial supply\nagreements with multiple third-party manufacturers for the production of linaclotide API. We believe the current commercial\nsuppliers have the capabilities to produce linaclotide API in accordance with current good manufacturing practices, or GMP,\non a sufficient scale to meet the worldwide development and commercial needs for linaclotide. The commercial suppliers of\nlinaclotide API are subject to routine inspections by regulatory agencies worldwide and also undergo periodic audit and\ncertification by our partners’ or our own quality department.\nEach of AbbVie, Astellas and AstraZeneca is responsible for linaclotide API, finished drug product and finished\ngoods manufacturing (including bottling and packaging) and distributing the finished goods to wholesalers in its respective\nterritories.\nPrior to linaclotide, there was no precedent for long-term room temperature shelf storage formulation for an orally\ndosed peptide to be produced in millions of capsules per year. Our efforts to date have led to formulations that are both cost\neffective and able to meet the stability requirements for commercial pharmaceutical products.\n12\nTable of Contents\nApraglutide\nWe do not currently own or operate manufacturing facilities for the production of clinical, or, if approved,\ncommercial quantities of apraglutide. We design and develop the manufacturing process for apraglutide together with contract\ndevelopment and manufacturing organizations, or CDMOs. We utilize these CDMOs for the manufacture of apraglutide for\nhuman use. Although we intend to rely on third-party CDMOs to produce apraglutide, we have personnel with experience\nmanaging third-party CDMOs producing apraglutide in clinical or commercial quantities.\nOur clinical trials of apraglutide currently use the product in the form of a lyophilized powder in vial that is\nsolubilized and reconstituted with a diluent prior to injection. We are also evaluating novel drug product presentations, with\nthe goal of providing increased patient convenience and increased simplicity of the dosing and self-injection.\nSales and Marketing\nFor the foreseeable future, we intend to develop and commercialize our drugs in the U.S. alone or with partners, and\nexpect to rely on partners to develop and commercialize our drugs in territories outside the U.S. In executing our strategy, our\ngoal is to retain oversight over the worldwide development and commercialization of our products by playing an active role in\ntheir commercialization or finding partners who share our vision, values, culture and processes.\nTo date, we have established a high-quality commercial organization dedicated to supporting our vision of becoming\nthe leading GI healthcare company. Our GI commercial capabilities, including marketing, patient engagement and sales, are\ndesigned to support our existing product as well as potential future internally and externally developed products.\nWe are also coordinating efforts with our linaclotide partners to launch and maintain an integrated, global linaclotide\nbrand. By leveraging the knowledge base and expertise of our experienced commercial team and the insights of each of our\nlinaclotide commercialization partners, we continually improve our collective marketing strategies.\nWe are currently in the process of planning for the commercial launch of apraglutide, if successfully developed and\napproved, for commercialization, in the U.S. and with partners in territories outside the U.S. For example, we granted AKP an\nexclusive license to sublicense, develop, commercialize and exploit products derived from apraglutide in Japan. We are\nconsidering potential partnerships in other territories outside the U.S.\nPatents and Proprietary Rights\nWe actively seek to protect the proprietary technology that we consider important to our business, including pursuing\npatents that cover our products, compositions, and formulations, their methods of use and the processes for their manufacture,\nas well as any other relevant inventions and improvements that are commercially important to the development of our\nbusiness. We also rely on trade secrets that may be important to the development of our business.\nOur success will depend significantly on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for\nthe technology, inventions and improvements we consider important to our business; defend our patents; preserve the\nconfidentiality of our trade secrets; and operate without infringing the patents and proprietary rights of third parties.\nThe term of individual patents depends upon the legal term of the patents in the countries in which they are obtained.\nIn most countries in which we file, the patent term is 20 years from the date of filing the non-provisional application. We\nexpect to apply, and have applied, for patent term extension in countries where it is available.\nLinaclotide Patent Portfolio\nAfter the recent expiration of a number of patents in our linaclotide patent portfolio, our linaclotide patent portfolio is\ncurrently composed of 11 patents in the U.S., including 7 U.S. patents listed in the U.S. FDA publication, Approved Drug\nProducts with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, or the Orange Book, six granted European patents, most of which have\nbeen validated in available European countries, ten granted Japanese patents, three granted Chinese patents, 49 issued patents\nin other foreign jurisdictions, and numerous pending U.S., foreign and Patent Cooperation\n13\nTable of Contents\nTreaty, or PCT, patent applications. We and our partners own, either jointly or individually, all of the issued patents and\npending applications.\nThe issued, unexpired U.S. patents, which will expire between 2026 and 2033, contain claims directed to the\nlinaclotide molecule, pharmaceutical compositions thereof, methods of using linaclotide to treat GI disorders, processes for\nmaking the molecule, and room temperature stable formulations of linaclotide and methods of use thereof. The 72 mcg, 145\nmcg and 290 mcg LINZESS doses are covered by composition of matter patent in the U.S., which expires in 2026. In\naddition, the commercial formulations of the 72 mcg, 145 mcg and 290 mcg LINZESS doses are covered by patents in the\nU.S. that expire in the early 2030s. The granted, unexpired European patents, which will expire between 2027 and 2036, some\nof which have received patent term extension, contain claims directed to the linaclotide molecule, pharmaceutical\ncompositions thereof, uses of linaclotide to prepare medicaments for treating GI disorders, and room temperature stable\nformulations of linaclotide and their use in treating IBS-C and chronic constipation. The granted, unexpired Chinese patents,\nwhich will expire between 2029 and 2032, the granted Japanese patents, which will expire between 2026 and 2036, some of\nwhich are subject to granted and potential patent term extension, and the granted patents in other foreign jurisdictions, which\nwill expire between 2026 and 2034, some of which may be subject to potential patent term extension, contain claims directed\nto the linaclotide molecule, pharmaceutical compositions of linaclotide for use in treating GI disorders, and room temperature\nstable formulations of linaclotide.\nWe have pending patent applications in certain countries worldwide that, if issued, will expire between 2029 and\n2044 and which include claims covering the linaclotide molecule, methods of using linaclotide to treat GI disorders, the\ncurrent commercial formulations of linaclotide and uses thereof to treat GI disorders and delayed release and other potential\nformulations of linaclotide.\nThe patent term of a patent that covers a U.S. FDA approved drug is also eligible for patent term extension, which\npermits patent term extension as compensation for some of the patent term lost during the U.S. FDA regulatory review\nprocess. The Hatch Waxman Act permits a patent term extension of a single patent applicable to an approved drug for up to\nfive years beyond the expiration of the patent, but the extension cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of\n14 years from the date of product approval by the U.S. FDA. The United States Patent and Trademark Office has issued a\nCertificate of Patent Term Extension for U.S. Patent 7,304,036, which covers linaclotide and methods of use thereof. As a\nresult, the patent term of this patent was extended to August 30, 2026, 14 years from the date of linaclotide’s approval by the\nU.S. FDA. Similar provisions are available in Europe and certain other foreign jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that\ncovers an approved drug. We have received patent term extensions in Japan for several of our linaclotide patents. We have also\nreceived patent term extensions, called supplementary protection certificates, for certain linaclotide patents from several\nnational patent offices in Europe.\nWe and AbbVie received Paragraph IV certification notice letters regarding abbreviated new drug applications, or\nANDAs, submitted to the U.S. FDA by five generic drug manufacturers requesting approval to engage in commercial\nmanufacture, use, sale and offer for sale of linaclotide capsules (72 mcg, 145 mcg and 290 mcg), proposed generic versions of\nLINZESS. All five manufacturers requested approval for their 145 mcg and 290 mcg generic doses of LINZESS and two\nrequested additional approval for their 72 mcg generic doses of LINZESS. We and AbbVie have entered into settlement\nagreements with all five of these generic drug manufacturers providing for licenses to market their 72 mcg (if applicable),145\nmcg and 290 mcg generic versions of LINZESS, beginning as early as March 2029 (subject to U.S. FDA Approval), unless\ncertain limited circumstances, customary for settlement agreements of this nature, occur.\nApraglutide Patent Portfolio\nOur apraglutide patent portfolio includes a patent family which we exclusively license that is composed of one issued\nU.S. patent and 56 foreign patents. This patent family contains composition-of-matter claims covering apraglutide and\nmethods of treatment using apraglutide. The patents in this patent family that we exclusively license outside of the U.S. are\nissued in Europe, Japan, China, Australia, Canada, as well as other jurisdictions. The issued European patent is validated and\nissued in 37 countries, including Germany, the United Kingdom, France, Italy and Spain. Not accounting for any patent term\nadjustment, regulatory patent term extensions or terminal disclaimers, and assuming that all annuity and/or maintenance fees\nare paid timely, the patents in this patent family are expected to expire in 2030.\nOur apraglutide portfolio also includes two wholly owned patent families. The first patent family includes one\ngranted U.S. patent and five pending U.S. non-provisional patent applications, as well as 27 pending foreign patent\n14\nTable of Contents\napplications related to apraglutide. The granted U.S. patent in this patent family claims a method of treating SBS, and the\npending U.S. and foreign patent applications contain composition-of-matter claims to ultrapure compositions of apraglutide,\nmethods of manufacturing apraglutide, and methods of treatment using apraglutide. Not accounting for any patent term\nadjustment, regulatory patent term extensions or terminal disclaimers, and assuming that all annuity and/or maintenance fees\nare paid timely, the U.S. patent, as well as patents granted from the pending U.S and foreign patent applications, would be\nexpected to expire in 2041.\nThe second patent family which we wholly own includes two pending U.S. non-provisional patent applications and\n13 pending foreign patent applications related to methods of treating GvHD using apraglutide. Not accounting for any patent\nterm adjustment, regulatory patent term extension or terminal disclaimers, and assuming that all annuity and/or maintenance\nfees are paid timely, any U.S. and foreign patents granted from the pending patent applications would be expected to expire in\n2042.\nGovernment Regulation\nOur business is subject to government regulation in the U.S., E.U., and in other countries. The U.S. FDA, the\nEuropean Medicines Agency, or EMA, and other regulatory authorities have very broad enforcement authority and failure to\nabide by applicable regulatory requirements can result in administrative or judicial sanctions being imposed on us, including\nwarning letters, refusals of government contracts, clinical holds, civil penalties, injunctions, restitution, disgorgement of\nprofits, recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, withdrawal of approval, refusal\nto approve pending applications, and civil or criminal prosecution.\nU.S. FDA Approval Process\nIn the U.S., pharmaceutical products are subject to extensive regulation by the U.S. FDA. The Federal Food, Drug\nand Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and other federal and state statutes and regulations, as well as similar foreign regulations,\ngovern, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, storage, recordkeeping, approval, labeling,\npromotion and marketing, distribution, post-marketing requirements and assessments, post-approval monitoring and reporting,\nsampling, and import and export of pharmaceutical products.\nNo company may market a new drug in the U.S. until it has submitted a new drug application, or NDA, to the U.S.\nFDA, and the U.S. FDA has approved it. The steps required before the U.S. FDA may approve an NDA generally include:\n● conducting non-clinical laboratory tests and animal tests in compliance with U.S. FDA’s good laboratory\npractice, or GLP, requirements;\n● design of a clinical protocol and submission to the U.S. FDA of an investigational new drug application, or IND,\nfor human clinical testing, which must become effective before human clinical trial may begin;\n● approval by an institutional review board, or IRB, representing each clinical site before each clinical trial may be\ninitiated;\n● development, manufacture and testing of active pharmaceutical product and dosage forms suitable for human\nuse in compliance with current GMP;\n● conducting adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials that establish the safety and efficacy of the\nproduct for its specific intended use(s), in accordance with good clinical practices, or GCP;\n● preparation and submission to the U.S. FDA of an NDA;\n● review of the NDA by a U.S. FDA advisory committee, where applicable;\n● satisfactory completion of one or more U.S. FDA inspections of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which\nthe product, or components thereof, are produced to assess compliance with current GMP\n15\nTable of Contents\nrequirements and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the product’s\nidentity, strength, quality and purity;\n● satisfactory completion of any U.S. FDA inspections of non-clinical and clinical trial sites to assure compliance\nwith GLP and GCP requirements; and\n● U.S. FDA review and approval of the NDA, which may be subject to post-approval requirements, including the\npotential requirement to implement a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, and any post-approval\nstudies required by the U.S. FDA.\nNon-clinical tests include laboratory evaluation of the product candidate, as well as animal studies to assess the\npotential safety and efficacy of the product candidate. The conduct of the non-clinical tests must comply with federal\nregulations and requirements including GLP. We must submit the results of the non-clinical tests, together with manufacturing\ninformation, analytical data and a proposed clinical trial protocol to the U.S. FDA as part of an IND, which must become\neffective before we may commence human clinical trials in the U.S. The IND will automatically become effective 30 days\nafter its receipt by the U.S. FDA, unless the U.S. FDA raises concerns or questions before that time about the conduct of the\nproposed trial. In such a case, we must work with the U.S. FDA to resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial\ncan proceed. We cannot be sure that submission of an IND will result in the U.S. FDA allowing clinical trials to begin, or that,\nonce begun, issues will not arise that will cause us or the U.S. FDA to modify, suspend or terminate such trials. The study\nprotocol and informed consent information for patients in clinical trials must also be submitted to an IRB, for approval. An\nIRB may also require the clinical trial at the site to be halted, either temporarily or permanently, for failure to comply with the\nIRB requirements or if the trial has been associated with unexpected serious harm to subjects. An IRB may also impose other\nconditions on the trial. For studies conducted outside of the U.S., similarly, we are subject to local regulations which may\ndiffer from the U.S. and local regulations must be followed appropriately.\nClinical trials involve the administration of the product candidate to humans under the supervision of qualified\ninvestigators, generally physicians not employed by or under the trial sponsor’s control. Clinical trials are typically conducted\nin three sequential phases, though the phases may overlap or be combined. In Phase I, the initial introduction of the drug into\nhealthy human subjects, the drug is usually tested for safety (adverse effects), dosage tolerance and pharmacologic action, as\nwell as to understand how the drug is taken up by and distributed within the body. Phase II usually involves studies in a\nlimited patient population (individuals with the disease under study) to:\n● evaluate preliminarily the efficacy of the drug for specific, targeted conditions;\n● determine dosage tolerance and appropriate dosage as well as other important information about how to\ndesign larger Phase III trials; and\n● identify possible adverse effects and safety risks.\nPhase III trials generally further evaluate clinical efficacy and test for safety within an expanded patient population.\nThe conduct of clinical trials is subject to extensive regulation, including compliance with GCP regulations and guidance, and\nregulations designed to protect the rights and safety of subjects involved in investigations.\nThe U.S. FDA may order the temporary or permanent discontinuation of a clinical trial at any time or impose other\nsanctions if it believes that the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with U.S. FDA requirements or presents an\nunacceptable risk to the clinical trial patients. We may also suspend clinical trials at any time on various grounds.\nThe results of the non-clinical and clinical studies, together with other detailed information, including the\nmanufacture and composition of the product candidate, are submitted to the U.S. FDA in the form of an NDA requesting\napproval to market the drug. The U.S. FDA approval of the NDA is required before marketing of the product may begin in the\nU.S. If the NDA contains all pertinent information and data, the U.S. FDA will “file” the application and begin review. The\nreview process, however, may be extended by U.S. FDA requests for additional information, non-clinical or clinical studies,\nclarification regarding information already provided in the submission, or submission of a REMS. The U.S. FDA may refer an\napplication to an advisory committee for review, evaluation and recommendation as to whether the application should be\napproved. The U.S. FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but\n16\nTable of Contents\nit considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. Before approving an NDA, the U.S. FDA will typically\ninspect the facilities at which the product candidate is manufactured and will not approve the product candidate unless current\nGMP compliance is satisfactory. The U.S. FDA also typically inspects facilities responsible for performing animal testing, as\nwell as clinical investigators who participate in clinical trials. The U.S. FDA may refuse to approve an NDA if applicable\nregulatory criteria are not satisfied or may require additional testing or information. The U.S. FDA may also limit the\nindications for use and/or require post marketing testing and surveillance to monitor the safety or efficacy of a product. Once\ngranted, product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or problems are\nidentified following initial marketing.\nThe testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and our product candidates\nmay not be approved on a timely basis, if at all. The time and expense required to perform the clinical testing necessary to\nobtain U.S. FDA approval for regulated products can frequently exceed the time and expense of the research and development\ninitially required to create the product. The results of non-clinical studies and initial clinical trials of our product candidates\nare not necessarily predictive of the results from large-scale clinical trials, and clinical trials may be subject to additional costs,\ndelays or modifications due to a number of factors, including difficulty in obtaining enough patients, investigators or product\ncandidate supply. Failure by us or our collaborators, licensors or licensees to obtain, or any delay in obtaining, regulatory\napprovals or in complying with requirements could adversely affect commercialization and our ability to receive product or\nroyalty revenues.\nHatch-Waxman Act\nThe Hatch-Waxman Act established abbreviated approval procedures for generic drugs. Approval to market and\ndistribute these drugs is obtained by submitting an ANDA with the U.S. FDA. The application for a generic drug is\n“abbreviated” because it need not include non-clinical or clinical data to demonstrate safety and effectiveness and may instead\nrely on the U.S. FDA’s previous finding that the brand drug, or reference drug, is safe and effective. In order to obtain\napproval of an ANDA, an applicant must, among other things, establish that its product is bioequivalent to an existing\napproved drug and that it has the same active ingredient(s), strength, dosage form, and route of administration. A generic drug\nis considered bioequivalent to its reference drug if testing demonstrates that the rate and extent of absorption of the generic\ndrug is not significantly different from the rate and extent of absorption of the reference drug when administered under similar\nexperimental conditions.\nThe Hatch-Waxman Act also provides incentives by awarding, in certain circumstances, certain legal protections\nfrom generic competition. This protection comes in the form of a non-patent exclusivity period, during which the U.S. FDA\nmay not accept, or approve, an application for a generic drug, whether the application for such drug is submitted through an\nANDA or a through another form of application, known as a 505(b)(2) application.\nThe Hatch-Waxman Act grants five years of exclusivity when a company develops and gains NDA approval of a new\nchemical entity that has not been previously approved by the U.S. FDA. This exclusivity provides that the U.S. FDA may not\naccept an ANDA or 505(b)(2) application for five years after the date of approval of previously approved drug, or four years\nin the case of an ANDA or 505(b)(2) application that challenges a patent claiming the reference drug (see discussion below\nregarding Paragraph IV Certifications). The Hatch-Waxman Act also provides three years of exclusivity for approved\napplications for drugs that are not new chemical entities, if the application contains the results of new clinical investigations\n(other than bioavailability studies) conducted or sponsored by the applicant that were essential to approval of the application.\nExamples of applications that may require new clinical investigations essential to approval and receive three-year exclusivity\ninclude applications for new indications, dosage forms (including new drug delivery systems), strengths, or conditions of use\nfor an already approved product. This three-year exclusivity period only protects against U.S. FDA approval of ANDAs and\n505(b)(2) applications for generic drugs for the conditions of approval (for example, indication or dosage form) that required\nnew clinical investigations that were essential to approval; it does not prohibit the U.S. FDA from accepting or approving\nANDAs or 505(b)(2) NDAs for generic drugs that do not include such conditions of approval.\nParagraph IV Certifications. Under the Hatch-Waxman Act, NDA applicants and NDA holders must provide\ninformation about certain patents claiming their drugs, or methods of use of the drug that is the subject of the NDA, for listing\nin the Orange Book. When an ANDA or 505(b)(2) application is submitted, it must contain one of several possible\ncertifications regarding each of the patents listed in the Orange Book for the reference drug. A certification that a listed patent\nis invalid, unenforceable or will not be infringed by the sale of the proposed product is called a “Paragraph IV” certification. A\ncertification that provides the date a listed patent will expire, but does not challenge the validity,\n17\nTable of Contents\nenforceability or infringement of the patent, is called a “Paragraph III” certification. FDA can approve the ANDA or 505(b)(2)\napplication containing the Paragraph III certification upon expiration of the patent.\nWithin 20 days of the acceptance by the U.S. FDA of an ANDA or 505(b)(2) application containing a Paragraph IV\ncertification, the applicant must notify the NDA holder and patent owner that the application has been submitted and provide\nthe factual and legal basis for the applicant’s opinion that the patent is invalid, unenforceable, or not infringed. The NDA\nholder or patent holder may then initiate a patent infringement suit in response to the Paragraph IV notice. If this is done\nwithin 45 days of receiving notice of the Paragraph IV certification, a 30-month stay of the U.S. FDA’s ability to approve the\nANDA or 505(b)(2) application is triggered. The U.S. FDA may approve the proposed product before the expiration of the\n30-month stay only if a court finds the patent invalid or not infringed, and the court may shorten or lengthen the 30-month stay\nunder certain limited circumstances.\nPatent Term Extension. Under the Hatch-Waxman Act, a portion of the patent term lost during product development\nand U.S. FDA review of an NDA or 505(b)(2) application is extended if approval of the application is the first permitted\ncommercial marketing of a drug containing the active ingredient. The patent term extension period is generally one-half the\ntime between the effective date of the IND and the date of submission of the NDA, plus the time between the date of\nsubmission of the NDA and the date of U.S. FDA approval of the product. The maximum period of patent term extension is\nfive years, and the patent cannot be extended to more than 14 years from the date of U.S. FDA approval of the product. Only\none unexpired patent claiming the drug product, a method of using the product or a method of manufacturing the product is\neligible for extension and the patent holder must apply for extension within 60 days of approval. The U.S. Patent and\nTrademark Office, or USPTO, in consultation with the U.S. FDA, reviews and approves the application for patent term\nextension.\nOrphan Drug Designation and Exclusivity\nOrphan drug designation in the U.S. is designed to encourage sponsors to develop products intended for the treatment\nof rare diseases or conditions. In the U.S., a rare disease or condition is statutorily defined as a condition that affects fewer\nthan 200,000 individuals in the U.S. or that affects more than 200,000 individuals in the U.S. and for which there is no\nreasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making the product available for the disease or condition will be\nrecovered from sales of the product in the U.S.\nOrphan drug designation qualifies a company for certain tax credits. In addition, if a product candidate that has\norphan drug designation subsequently receives the first U.S. FDA approval for that drug for the disease for which it has such\ndesignation, the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity, which means that the U.S. FDA may not approve any other\napplications to market the same drug for the same indication for seven years following product approval unless the subsequent\nproduct candidate is demonstrated to be clinically superior. Absent a showing of clinical superiority, the U.S. FDA cannot\napprove the same product made by another manufacturer for the same indication during the market exclusivity period unless it\nhas the consent of the sponsor, or the sponsor is unable to provide sufficient quantities.\nRegulation of Drug-Device Combination Products in the U.S.\nCertain products may be comprised of components, such as drug components and device components that would\nnormally be subject to different regulatory frameworks by the U.S. FDA and frequently regulated by different centers at the\nU.S. FDA. These products are known as drug-device combination products. Under the FDCA and its implementing\nregulations, the U.S. FDA is charged with assigning a center with primary jurisdiction, or a lead center, for review of a drug-\ndevice combination product. The determination of which center will be the lead center is based on the “primary mode of\naction” of the drug-device combination product. Thus, if the primary mode of action of a drug-device combination product is\nattributable to the drug product, the U.S. FDA center responsible for premarket review of the drug product would have\nprimary jurisdiction for the drug-device combination product. The U.S. FDA has also established an Office of Combination\nProducts to address issues surrounding combination products and provide more certainty to the regulatory review process.\nThat office serves as a focal point for combination product issues for agency reviewers and industry. It is also responsible for\ndeveloping guidance and regulations to clarify the regulation of combination products, and for assignment of the U.S. FDA\ncenter that has primary jurisdiction for review of drug-device combination products where the jurisdiction is unclear or in\ndispute.\n18\nTable of Contents\nA drug-device combination product with a primary mode of action attributable to the drug component generally\nwould be reviewed and approved pursuant to the drug approval processes set forth in the FDCA. In reviewing the NDA for\nsuch a product, however, U.S. FDA reviewers could consult with their counterparts in the device center to ensure that the\ndevice component of the combination product met applicable requirements regarding safety, effectiveness, durability and\nperformance. Approval may require the performance of certain clinical studies, such as clinical usability or human factors\nstudies to demonstrate the safety and/or effectiveness of the device component of the combination product. In addition, under\nU.S. FDA regulations, drug-device combination products are subject to current GMP requirements applicable to both drugs\nand devices, including the Quality System Regulations applicable to medical devices.\nOther U.S. Regulatory Requirements\nAfter approval, finished drug products are subject to extensive continuing regulation by the U.S. FDA, which\nincludes company obligations to manufacture products in accordance with current GMP, maintain and provide to the U.S.\nFDA updated safety and efficacy information, report adverse experiences with the product, keep certain records and submit\nperiodic reports, obtain U.S. FDA approval of certain manufacturing or labeling changes, and comply with U.S. FDA\npromotion and advertising requirements and restrictions. Failure to meet these obligations can result in various adverse\nconsequences, both voluntary and U.S. FDA-imposed, including product recalls, withdrawal of approval, restrictions on\nmarketing, and the imposition of civil fines and criminal penalties against the NDA holder. In addition, later discovery of\npreviously unknown safety or efficacy issues may result in restrictions on the product, manufacturer or NDA holder.\nWe and our partners and any third-party manufacturers we or our partners engage are required to comply with\napplicable U.S. FDA manufacturing requirements contained in the U.S. FDA’s current GMP regulations. Current GMP\nregulations require, among other things, quality control and quality assurance as well as the corresponding maintenance of\nrecords and documentation. The manufacturing facilities for our products must meet current GMP requirements to the\nsatisfaction of the U.S. FDA pursuant to a pre-approval inspection before we can use them to manufacture our products. We\nand any third-party manufacturers are also subject to periodic inspections of facilities by the U.S. FDA and other authorities,\nincluding procedures and operations used in the testing and manufacture of our products to assess our compliance with\napplicable regulations.\nWith respect to post-market product advertising and promotion, the U.S. FDA imposes a number of complex\nregulations on entities that advertise and promote pharmaceuticals, which include, among others, standards for direct-to-\nconsumer advertising, prohibitions on promoting drugs for uses, conditions or diseases, or in patient populations that are not\nconsistent with the drug’s approved labeling (known as “off-label use”), and principles governing industry-sponsored\nscientific and educational activities. Failure to comply with U.S. FDA requirements can have negative consequences,\nincluding adverse publicity, warning or untitled letters from the U.S. FDA, mandated corrective advertising or\ncommunications with doctors or patients, and civil or criminal penalties. Although physicians may prescribe legally available\ndrugs for off-label uses, manufacturers may not market or promote such off-label uses.\nChanges to some of the conditions established in an approved application, including changes in indications, labeling,\nor manufacturing processes or facilities, require submission and U.S. FDA approval of a new NDA or sNDA before the\nchange can be implemented. An sNDA for a new indication typically requires clinical data similar in type and quality to the\nclinical data supporting the original application for the original indication, and the U.S. FDA uses similar procedures and\nactions in reviewing such sNDAs as it does in reviewing NDAs.\nAdverse event reporting and submission of periodic reports are required following U.S. FDA approval of an NDA.\nThe U.S. FDA also may require post marketing testing, known as Phase IV testing, REMS, and surveillance to monitor the\neffects of an approved product or to place conditions on an approval that restrict the distribution or use of the product.\nOutside the U.S., our and our collaborators’ abilities to market a product are contingent upon receiving marketing\nauthorization from the appropriate regulatory authorities. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, marketing\nauthorization, pricing and reimbursement vary widely from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. At present, foreign marketing\nauthorizations are applied for at a national level, although within the E.U. registration procedures are available to companies\nwishing to market a product in more than one E.U. member state. We are subject to U.S. federal and foreign anti-corruption\nlaws. Those laws include the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, which prohibits U.S. corporations and their\nrepresentatives from offering, promising, authorizing, or making payments to any foreign\n19\nTable of Contents\ngovernment official, government staff member, political party or political candidate in an attempt to obtain or retain business\nabroad. The scope of the FCPA encompasses certain healthcare professionals in many countries. We are also subject to similar\nlaws of other countries that have enacted anti-corruption laws and regulations.\nEU Marketing Approval of Medicinal Products\nIn order to market any product outside of the U.S., a company also must comply with numerous and varying\nregulatory requirements of other countries and jurisdictions regarding quality, safety and efficacy and governing, among other\nthings, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales and distribution of products. Regardless of whether or not it\nobtains U.S. FDA approval for a product, an applicant will need to obtain the necessary marketing approvals by the\ncomparable foreign regulatory authorities before it can initiate clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries or\njurisdictions. Specifically, there are a number of similarities between the process regarding regulatory approval of medicinal\nproducts in the European Economic Area, or EEA, and that in the U.S. Marketing approval requires satisfactory completion of\npharmaceutical development, non-clinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and\nefficacy of the medicinal product for each proposed indication. It also requires the submission to relevant competent\nauthorities for a clinical trial authorization to be granted and to the EMA, or to competent authorities in E.U. Member States\nfor granting of a marketing authorization by these authorities before the product can be marketed and sold in the E.U.\nClinical Trial Approval. Similar to the U.S., the various phases of preclinical and clinical research in the E.U. are\nsubject to significant regulatory controls. Certain preclinical (also termed “non-clinical”) data is required in order to inform\nthe scientific basis for clinical trials to be conducted and later for such data to be used in the dossier for supporting a\nmarketing authorization application, or MAA. Preclinical data are required to guide the clinical development, from Phase I\n(first-in-human clinical trials) through to Phases II and III, to establish the safety and efficacy of a medicinal product. During\nall phases of clinical development, national competent authorities of E.U. Member States and other comparable regulatory\nauthorities require extensive monitoring and auditing of all clinical trial related activities, to ensure safety of the trial\nparticipants, and quality and integrity of trial data.\nIn the E.U., clinical trials are governed by the Clinical Trials Regulation (E.U.) No. 536/2014, or CTR, which entered\ninto application on January 31, 2022, replacing Directive 2001/20/EC or CTD. The CTR is intended to harmonize and\nstreamline clinical trial authorizations, simplify adverse-event reporting procedures, improve the supervision of clinical trials\nand increase their transparency. Prior to commencing a clinical trial, the sponsor must obtain a clinical trial authorization from\ncompetent authorities of E.U. Member States in which the sponsor intends on carrying out clinical trials, and a positive\nopinion from an independent Ethics Committee. The CTR, which is directly applicable in all E.U. Member States, introduces\na streamlined application procedure through a single-entry point, the “E.U. portal”, the Clinical Trials Information System, or\nCTIS. Since January 31, 2023, the use of CTIS has become mandatory for all clinical trial sponsors submitting initial\napplications for the approval of their clinical trials in the E.U. The CTR also establishes a single set of documents to be\nprepared and submitted for the application including, among other things, a copy of the trial protocol and an investigational\nmedicinal product dossier containing information about the manufacture and quality of the medicinal product under\ninvestigation as well as simplified reporting procedures for clinical trial sponsors.\nOngoing clinical trials authorized under CTD with at least one active site in the E.U. on January 30, 2025 must be\ntransitioned to CTR. Active site in the context of transitioning means that the last visit of the last subject, or the other trial-\nrelated interventions with the subject specified in the protocol will take place after January 30, 2025. Clinical Trials with no\nactive sites authorized under CTD do not need to be transitioned even if the global trial is still ongoing outside the E.U. after\nthe transition deadline.\nClinical trials of medicinal products in the E.U. must be conducted in accordance with current good clinical practices\nrequirements and the applicable regulatory requirements, including those foreseen in the Good Clinical Practice Directive\n2005/28/EC, and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki. Studies should also be conducted\nin accordance with all applicable EMA, European Commission and national guidelines. Medicinal products used in clinical\ntrials must be manufactured in accordance with the guidelines on current GMP, and in a GMP compliant facility, which can be\nsubject to GMP inspections.\nMarketing Authorization. To obtain a marketing authorization to market a medicinal product in the EEA, an applicant\nmust submit an MAA, either in accordance with a centralized procedure administered by the EMA or one of\n20\nTable of Contents\nthe procedures administered by competent authorities in E.U. Member States (decentralized procedure, national procedure or\nmutual recognition procedure). A marketing authorization may be granted only to an applicant established in the E.U.\nThe centralized procedure provides for the grant of a single MA by the European Commission that is valid in all E.U.\nMember States and through the EEA Member States – Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein. Pursuant to Regulation (EC) No\n726/2004, the centralized procedure is compulsory for specific medicinal products, including those (i) derived from\nbiotechnological processes, (ii) designated as orphan medicinal products, (iii) that are classified as advanced therapy\nmedicinal products, or ATMPs, and (iv) containing a new active substance indicated for the treatment of HIV/AIDS, cancer,\nneurodegenerative diseases, diabetes, auto-immune and other immune dysfunctions and viral diseases. For medicinal products\ncontaining a new active substance indicated for the treatment of other diseases and products that are highly innovative or for\nwhich a centralized process is in the interest of patients, authorization through the centralized procedure is optional for product\napproval.\nUnder the centralized procedure, the EMA’s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or CHMP, conducts\nthe scientific assessment of a medicinal product in respect of its safety, quality and efficacy for the purpose of determining its\napprovability.\nUnder the centralized procedure in the EEA, the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of an MAA is 210 days,\nexcluding clock stops. Procedural clock-stops provide the applicant with the time to gather additional information in response\nto the outstanding questions raised by the CHMP. Accelerated assessment may be accepted by the CHMP in exceptional cases,\nwhen a medicinal product is considered to be of major interest from the point of view of public health, and, in particular, from\nthe viewpoint of therapeutic innovation. If the CHMP accepts a request for accelerated assessment, the time limit of 210 days\nwill be reduced to 150 days. The CHMP can, however, revert to the standard time limit for the centralized procedure if it\nconsiders that it is no longer appropriate to conduct an accelerated assessment.\nA marketing authorization granted under the E.U. regulatory system is valid for five years. The MA may be renewed\nafter five years on the basis of a re-evaluation of the risk-benefit balance by the EMA or by the competent authority of the\nE.U. Member State in which the original MA was granted. To support the application, the MA holder must provide the EMA\nor the competent authority with a consolidated version of the electronic Common Technical Document providing up-to-date\ndata concerning the quality, safety and efficacy of the product, including all variations introduced since the MA was granted,\nat least nine months before the MA ceases to be valid. The European Commission or the competent authorities of the E.U.\nMember States may decide on justified grounds relating to pharmacovigilance, to proceed with one further five-year renewal\nperiod for the MA. Thereafter, the MA shall be valid for an unlimited period. Any authorization which is not followed by the\nactual placing of the medicinal product on the E.U. market (for a centralized MA) or on the market of the authorizing E.U.\nMember State within three years after authorization ceases to be valid (the so-called sunset clause).\nInnovative products that target an unmet medical need and are expected to be of major public health interest may be\neligible for a number of expedited development and review programs, such as the Priority Medicines, or PRIME, scheme,\nwhich provides incentives similar to the breakthrough therapy designation in the U.S. PRIME is a voluntary scheme aimed at\nenhancing the EMA’s support for the development of medicinal products that target unmet medical needs. Eligible products\nmust target conditions for which there is an unmet medical need (there is no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or\ntreatment in the E.U. or, if there is, the new medicinal product will bring a major therapeutic advantage) and they must\ndemonstrate the potential to address the unmet medical need by introducing new methods of therapy or improving existing\nones. Benefits accrue to sponsors of product candidates with PRIME designation, including but not limited to, early and\nproactive regulatory dialogue with the EMA, frequent discussions on clinical trial designs and other development program\nelements, and potentially accelerated MAA assessment once a dossier has been submitted.\nCombination Products. As in the U.S., the regulation of combination drug-device products depends in large part on\nwhich component has the primary mode of action.\nWhere a medical device incorporates a medicinal product as an integral part as a single use drug delivery system, it is\nregulated as a medicinal product in accordance with Directive 2001/83/EC. In this case, the relevant General Safety and\nPerformance Requirements, or GSPRs of the MDR will apply to the safety and performance of the drug delivery device\ncomponent.\n21\nTable of Contents\nOrphan Medicinal Product Designation and Exclusivity. Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000, as implemented by\nRegulation (EC) No. 847/2000, provides that a medicinal product can be designated as an orphan medicinal product by the\nEuropean Commission if its sponsor can establish that (1) the product is intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of\na life-threatening or chronically debilitating condition; (2) either (a) such condition affects no more than five in ten thousand\npersons in the E.U. when the application is made, or (b) the product, without the benefits derived from orphan status, would\nnot generate sufficient return in the E.U.; and (3) there exists no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment of\nthe condition in question that has been authorized in the E.U. or, if such method exists, the product will be of significant\nbenefit to those affected by that condition.\nIn the E.U., an application for designation as an orphan product can be made any time prior to the filing of the MAA.\nOrphan medicinal product designation entitles a sponsor to incentives such as fee reductions or fee waivers, protocol\nassistance, and access to the centralized MA procedure. Upon grant of an MA, provided that the orphan designation is\nmaintained following a satisfactory re-assessment by the Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products, or COMP, of the EMA of\nthe criteria for orphan designation, orphan medicinal products are entitled to a ten-year period of market exclusivity for the\napproved therapeutic indication, which means that the EMA cannot accept another MAA, or grant an MA, or accept an\napplication to extend an MA for a similar product for the same indication for a period of ten years. The period of market\nexclusivity is extended by two years for orphan medicinal products provided that the results of all studies conducted in\ncompliance with an agreed PIP are provided – even though the results do not lead to an approval of a pediatric indication, but\nthe results of the studies conducted are reflected in the summary of product characteristics and, if appropriate, in the package\nleaflet of the medicinal product concerned. Orphan medicinal product designation does not confer any advantage in, or shorten\nthe duration of, the regulatory review and approval process.\nThe period of market exclusivity may, however, be reduced to six years if, at the end of the fifth year, it is established\nthat the product no longer meets the criteria on the basis of which it received orphan medicinal product destination, including\nwhere it can be demonstrated on the basis of available evidence that the original orphan medicinal product is sufficiently\nprofitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity or where the prevalence of the condition has increased above the\nthreshold. Additionally, an MA may be granted to a similar medicinal product with the same orphan indication during the 10\nyear period if: (i) if the applicant consents to a second original orphan medicinal product application, (ii) if the manufacturer\nof the original orphan medicinal product is unable to supply sufficient quantities; or (iii) if the second applicant can establish\nthat its product, although similar, is safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior to the original orphan medicinal\nproduct. A company may voluntarily remove a product from the register of orphan products.\nPost-Approval Requirements. Where an MA is granted in relation to a medicinal product in the EEA, the holder of\nthe MA is required to comply with a range of regulatory requirements applicable to the manufacturing, marketing, promotion\nand sale of medicinal products.\nSimilar to the U.S., both MA holders and manufacturers of medicinal products are subject to comprehensive\nregulatory oversight by the EMA, the European Commission and/or the competent regulatory authorities of the individual\nEEA countries. The holder of an MA must establish and maintain a pharmacovigilance system and appoint a qualified person\nfor pharmacovigilance who is responsible for oversight of that system. Key obligations include expedited reporting of\nsuspected serious adverse reactions and submission of periodic safety update reports, or PSURs.\nAll new MAAs must include a risk management plan describing the risk management system that the company will\nput in place and documenting measures to prevent or minimize the risks associated with the product. The regulatory\nauthorities may also impose specific obligations as a condition of the MA. Such risk-minimization measures or post-\nauthorization obligations may include additional safety monitoring, more frequent submission of PSURs, or the conduct of\nadditional clinical trials or post-authorization safety studies.\nIn the E.U., the advertising and promotion of medicinal products are subject to both E.U. and E.U. Member States’\nlaws governing promotion of medicinal products, interactions with physicians and other healthcare professionals, misleading\nand comparative advertising and unfair commercial practices. Although general requirements for advertising and promotion of\nmedicinal products are established under E.U. law, the implementing rules in each member state may differ from one country\nto another. In addition, the statutory control regime could be supplemented by the voluntary control of advertising of\nmedicinal products by self-regulatory bodies.\n22\nTable of Contents\nIf we fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things,\nfines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and\ncriminal prosecution.\nInternational Regulation\nIn addition to regulations in the U.S. and the E.U., we could become subject to a variety of other foreign regulations\nregarding development, approval, commercial sales and distribution of our products if we seek to market our product\ncandidates in other jurisdictions. Whether or not we obtain U.S. FDA or EMA approval for a product, we must obtain the\nnecessary approvals by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries before we can commence clinical trials or\nmarketing of the product in those countries. The approval process varies from country to country and can involve additional\nproduct testing and additional review periods, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required to obtain U.S. FDA or\nEMA approval. The requirements governing, among other things, the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and\nreimbursement vary greatly from country to country. Regulatory approval in one country does not ensure regulatory approval\nin another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country may negatively impact the regulatory process\nin others. If we fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to fines, suspension or\nwithdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution.\nPricing and Reimbursement\nWithin the U.S., significant uncertainty exists regarding the coverage and reimbursement status of products approved\nby the U.S. FDA. Sales of our product, and any future products which obtain marketing approval, depend, in part, on the\nextent to which our products will be covered by third-party payors, such as government health programs, commercial\ninsurance and managed healthcare organizations. The process for determining whether a third-party payor will provide\ncoverage for a drug or biologic typically is separate from the process for setting the price of such a product or for establishing\nthe reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the product once coverage is approved. Third-party payors may limit\ncoverage to specific products on an approved list, also known as a formulary, which might not include all of the U.S. FDA-\napproved drugs for a particular indication. A decision by a third-party payor not to cover our products or to restrict coverage of\nour products could reduce utilization of our products. Moreover, a third-party payor’s decision to provide coverage for a\nfinished drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Adequate third-party\nreimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our\ninvestment in product development. Additionally, coverage and reimbursement for products can differ significantly from\npayor to payor. One third-party payor’s decision to cover a particular product or service does not ensure that other payors will\nalso provide coverage for the medical product or service or will provide coverage at an adequate reimbursement rate.\nThe containment of healthcare costs has become a priority of federal and state governments, and the prices of drugs\nand biologics have been a focus in this effort. Federal and state governments have shown significant interest in implementing\ncost-containment programs, including restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products.\nAdoption of new or enhanced cost-containment measures could limit our net revenue and results. Third party payors are\nincreasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services and examining the medical necessity and cost\neffectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. Restrictions in coverage or decreases in\nthird-party reimbursement for our products could have a material adverse effect on our sales, results of operations and\nfinancial condition. We expect that the pharmaceutical industry will experience pricing pressures due to the increasing\ninfluence of managed care (and related implementation of managed care strategies to control utilization), additional federal\nand state legislative and regulatory proposals to regulate pricing of drugs, limit coverage of drugs or reduce reimbursement for\ndrugs, and public scrutiny of drug pricing. There have been and likely will continue to be health care reform efforts. For\nexample, federal legislation enacted in 2021 eliminates a statutory cap on Medicaid drug rebate program rebates effective\nJanuary 1, 2024. As another example, the Inflation Reduction Act, or IRA, of 2022, contains various drug pricing and payment\nprovisions. Among other provisions, the IRA imposes a yearly cap ($2,000 in 2025) on out-of-pocket prescription drug prices\nin Medicare Parts B and D. In addition, the IRA requires Medicare to negotiate Medicare prices for certain high-cost drugs\nand biologicals, including both physician-administered products covered under Medicare Part B benefit and self-administered\ndrugs covered under the Medicare Part D benefit. The Centers of Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, annually selects a\nspecified number of negotiation-eligible drugs from those drugs with the highest total Medicare Part B or D expenditures over\na preceding 12-month period. Eligible drugs generally include single source brand-name drugs or biological products that\n23\nTable of Contents\nhave been on the market without therapeutically-equivalent generic or biosimilar alternatives for a specified number of years\nwith certain exceptions (e.g., orphan drugs indicated for only one rare disease or condition and drugs with less than $200\nmillion in annual Medicare expenditures). CMS will publish the negotiated price, known as the “Maximum Fair Price”, or\nMFP, for each of the selected products. Manufacturers of selected drugs would be required to offer the drug for Medicare\nrecipients at the MFP. Manufacturers who fail to negotiate or offer the MFP can face significant civil money penalties or\nexcise tax liability on sales of that drug. The first drugs were selected in 2023 and the MFP for those drugs will take effect in\n2026. Only Medicare Part D drugs are selected for the first two years of the program (i.e., MFPs that take effect in 2026 and\n2027). Depending on the share of Medicare spending each year that is attributed to LINZESS or any other product candidate\nthat we develop and whether or not those drugs become eligible for Medicare negotiation, those drugs and our revenue may be\nadversely impacted by this provision. While we cannot predict what executive, legislative and regulatory proposals will be\nadopted or other actions will occur, such events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and\nprofitability. For additional information relating to pricing and reimbursement and legislative and other reform initiatives that\nmay affect coverage, pricing and reimbursement, see Item 1A, Risk Factors, elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nSales and Marketing\nThe marketing and sale of pharmaceutical products are subject to comprehensive governmental regulation both\nwithin and outside the U.S.\nWithin the U.S., numerous federal, state and local authorities have jurisdiction over, or enforce laws related to, such\nactivities, including the U.S. FDA, U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency, Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, the U.S.\nDepartment of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General, the U.S. Department of Justice, state Attorneys\nGeneral, state departments of health and state pharmacy boards.\nWe are subject to the requirements of the FDCA and accompanying regulations that prohibit pharmaceutical\ncompanies from promoting a drug prior to approval from the U.S. FDA and from promoting an approved drug in a manner\ninconsistent with the approved label.\nWe are also subject to various federal and state laws pertaining to health care “fraud and abuse,” including anti-\nkickback laws and false claims laws, for activities related to sales of any of our products or product candidates that may in the\nfuture receive marketing approval. Anti-kickback laws generally prohibit persons from soliciting, receiving or providing\nremuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce either the referral of an individual, for an item or service or the purchasing or\nordering of a good or service, for which payment may be made under federal healthcare programs such as Medicare and\nMedicaid or, in some cases, private third-party payors. Although the specific provisions of these laws vary, their scope is\ngenerally broad and there may not be regulations, guidance or court decisions that apply the laws to particular industry\npractices. False claims laws prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be\npresented, information or claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid, or other third-party payors that are false or\nfraudulent. Violations of fraud and abuse laws may be punishable by criminal or civil sanctions, including fines and civil\nmonetary penalties, and/or exclusion from federal health care programs (including Medicare and Medicaid).\nLaws and regulations have been enacted by the federal government and various states to regulate the sales and\nmarketing practices of pharmaceutical manufacturers with marketed products. The laws and regulations generally limit\nfinancial interactions between manufacturers and health care providers, require disclosure to the government and public of\nsuch interactions and/or require reporting of pricing information or marketing expenditures. Many of these laws and\nregulations contain ambiguous requirements or require administrative guidance for implementation.\nData Privacy and Security Laws\nPharmaceutical companies may be subject to U.S. federal and state health information privacy, security and data\nbreach notification laws, which may govern the collection, use, disclosure and protection of health-related and other personal\ninformation. State laws may be more stringent, broader in scope or offer greater individual rights with respect to protected\nhealth information, or PHI, than the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended, and its\nimplementing regulations, which are collectively referred to as HIPAA, and state laws may differ from each other, which may\ncomplicate compliance efforts. Entities that are found to be in violation of HIPAA as the result of a breach of unsecured PHI, a\ncomplaint about privacy practices or an audit by the Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, may be subject to\nsignificant civil, criminal and administrative fines and penalties and/or additional\n24\nTable of Contents\nreporting and oversight obligations if required to enter into a resolution agreement and corrective action plan with HHS to\nsettle allegations of HIPAA non-compliance.\nIn addition to federal regulation, many states have begun to focus on efforts to regulate privacy and data security. For\nexample, in California the California Consumer Privacy Act, or CCPA, which went into effect on January 1, 2020 and was\nexpanded by the California Consumer Privacy Rights Act, or CPRA, which went into effect on January 1, 2023, collectively\nestablishes a privacy framework for covered businesses by creating an expanded definition of personal information,\nestablishing new data privacy rights for consumers in the State of California, imposing special rules on the collection of\nconsumer data from minors, and creating a new and potentially severe statutory damages framework for violations and for\nbusinesses that fail to implement reasonable security procedures and practices to prevent data breaches. The California\nConfidentiality of Medical Information Act also applies to pharmaceutical companies, including requirements for written\nauthorization to use and disclose medical information and restrictions on the circumstances under which medical information\ncan be used for marketing purposes. Other states that have also recently enacted comprehensive data privacy and security\nlaws, include Washington, Utah, Virginia, Colorado, and Connecticut. Furthermore, all fifty states, the District of Columbia,\nPuerto Rico, and U.S. territories have enacted data breach notification laws. These various state laws differ from one another\nand impose significant compliance efforts.\nEEA Member States, the United Kingdom, Switzerland and other jurisdictions have also adopted data protection laws\nand regulations, which impose significant compliance obligations. In the EEA and the United Kingdom, the collection and use\nof personal data, including clinical trial data, is governed by the provisions of the General Data Protection Regulation, or\nGDPR. The GDPR, together with national legislation, regulations and guidelines of the EEA Member States, the United\nKingdom and Switzerland governing the processing of personal data, impose strict obligations and restrictions on the ability to\ncollect, analyze and transfer personal data, including health data from clinical trials and adverse event reporting. In particular,\nthese obligations and restrictions concern the consent of the individuals to whom the personal data relates, the information\nprovided to the individuals, the transfer of personal data out of the EEA, the United Kingdom or Switzerland, data breach\nnotifications, security and confidentiality, responding and handling data subject rights, ensuring appropriate assessments are\ncarried out on processing operations and documented. Under these laws, data protection authorities can impose substantial\npotential fines for breaches of the data protection obligations. European data protection authorities may interpret the GDPR\nand national laws differently and impose additional requirements, which add to the complexity of processing personal data in\nor from the EEA, United Kingdom or Switzerland. Guidance on implementation and compliance practices are often updated\nor otherwise revised.\nHuman Capital\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had 267 employees. Of these employees, 72 were on our drug development team, 133\nwere on our sales and commercial team, and 62 were in general and administrative functions. We consider our employee\nrelations to be good.\nDiversity, Equity and Inclusion (DE&I)\nCreating a diverse, equitable, and inclusive culture is essential to attracting, motivating and retaining the talent\nnecessary to deliver on our corporate mission. To establish and maintain this culture, we have a simple vision in mind: to\nmake Ironwood an environment rooted in valuing each employee for who they are.\nThis begins with ensuring our workforce represents the diverse populations we serve and reflecting our DE&I\nprinciples in our employee-related trainings and policies. Women represent approximately 50% of our employee base, 20% of\nour leadership team (vice president and above) and 33% of our board of directors (including our board and audit committee\nchairs). Additionally, approximately 20% of our employees are racially or ethnically diverse and in 2023, approximately 40%\nof our new hires were racially or ethnically diverse (excluding Europe-based employees, for which race and ethnicity is not\ndisclosed).\nWe are focused on fostering an environment where employees feel included and empowered. This approach includes\nDE&I initiatives such as learning and development opportunities, strengthened talent acquisition strategies, and the support of\nequality programs in our local communities. We are also proud to have three strong and growing employee resource groups:\nW@IRWD (Women at Ironwood), ISTAR (Ironwood Stands Together Against Racism), and PRIDE.\n25\nTable of Contents\nIn 2023, we continued to advance our DE&I initiatives with strong advocacy from our leadership team and board of\ndirectors. We incorporated DE&I metrics into our corporate goals. Over the course of the year, we achieved our target level of\nperformance on these metrics.\nCompensation and Benefits\nAll our employees receive equity and are encouraged to think and act as owners of Ironwood. We strive to provide\npay, benefits, and services that are competitive to market and to create incentives to attract, motivate and retain our employees.\nWe are focused on pay equity and regularly monitor our pay practices among similar roles and responsibilities throughout our\norganization.\nCommunication and Engagement\nWe strongly believe that our success depends on employees understanding how their work contributes to our ability\nto execute on our vision, mission and strategy. Our communication and engagement efforts seek to offset competitive talent\nchallenges in the biopharmaceutical industry and employees’ higher expectations of their employers. To this end, we utilize a\nvariety of channels to facilitate open and direct communication, including frequent town hall meetings, Ironwood intranet,\nCEO blog, leadership engagement opportunities, regular communications regarding business updates, and employee\nengagement surveys.\nAvailable Information\nYou may obtain free copies of our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Current\nReports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports, as soon as reasonably practicable after they are electronically filed or\nfurnished to the SEC, on the Investors section of our website at www.ironwoodpharma.com or by contacting our Investor\nRelations department at (617) 621-8395. The contents of our website are not incorporated by reference into this report and you\nshould not consider information provided on our website to be part of this report.\nPART II OTHER INFORMATION\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\nIn addition to the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, any of the factors described below could\nsignificantly and negatively affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects. The trading price of\nour Class A Common Stock may decline due to these risks.\nRisks Related to LINZESS, Apraglutide and Other Product Candidates\nWe are highly dependent on the commercial success of LINZESS (linaclotide) in the U.S. for the foreseeable future.\nWe and our partner, AbbVie, began selling LINZESS in the U.S. in December 2012. Revenues from our LINZESS\ncollaboration constitute a significant portion of our total revenue, and we believe they will continue to do so for the\nforeseeable future. The commercial success of LINZESS depends on a number of factors, including:\n● the effectiveness of LINZESS as a treatment for adult patients with IBS-C, or CIC, and as a treatment for\npediatric patients aged 6-17 years-old with FC;\n● the size of the treatable patient population;\n● the effectiveness of the sales, managed markets and marketing efforts by us and AbbVie, including our ability to\nadapt our commercial model and market strategy to the evolving landscape;\n● the coverage and reimbursement levels set by governmental authorities, private health insurers and other third-\nparty payors;\n● the adoption of LINZESS by physicians, which depends on whether physicians view it as safe and effective\ntreatment for adult patients with IBS-C and CIC and for pediatric patients ages 6-17 years-old with FC;\n26\nTable of Contents\n● our success in educating and activating adult IBS-C and CIC patients, and children and adolescents ages 6-17\nyears-old FC patients and their caregivers, to seek physician care for their symptoms;\n● our ability to both secure and maintain adequate reimbursement for, and optimize patient access to, LINZESS\nand our ability to demonstrate that LINZESS is safer, more efficacious and/or more cost-effective than\nalternative therapies;\n● the effectiveness of our partners’ distribution networks;\n● the occurrence of any side effects, adverse reactions or misuse, or any unfavorable publicity in these or other\nareas, associated with linaclotide; and\n● the development or commercialization of products or therapies that compete with LINZESS.\nOur revenues from the commercialization of LINZESS are subject to these and other factors, and therefore may be\nunpredictable from quarter-to-quarter.\nWe are subject to uncertainty relating to pricing and reimbursement policies in the U.S. which, if not favorable for our\nproducts, could hinder or prevent our products’ commercial success.\nOur and our partner’s ability to commercialize our products successfully depends in part on the coverage and\nreimbursement levels set by governmental authorities, private health insurers and other third-party payors. In determining\nwhether to approve reimbursement for our products and at what level, we expect that third-party payors will consider factors\nthat include the efficacy, cost effectiveness and safety of our products, as well as the availability of other treatments including\ngeneric prescription drugs and OTC alternatives. Further, in order to obtain and maintain acceptable reimbursement levels and\naccess for patients at copay levels that are reasonable and customary, we have offered, and expect to continue to face\nincreasing pressure to offer, discounts or rebates from list prices or discounts to third-party payors or other unfavorable pricing\nmodifications. Obtaining and maintaining favorable reimbursement can be a time consuming and expensive process, and there\nis no guarantee that we or AbbVie, with respect to linaclotide in the U.S., will be able to negotiate or continue to negotiate\npricing terms with third-party payors at levels that are profitable to us, or at all. Certain third-party payors also require prior\nauthorization for, or even refuse to provide, reimbursement for our products, and others may do so in the future. Our business\nwould be materially adversely affected if we and our partners are not able to receive approval for reimbursement of our\nproducts from third-party payors on a broad, timely or satisfactory basis; if reimbursement is subject to overly broad or\nrestrictive prior authorization requirements; or if reimbursement is not maintained at satisfactory levels or becomes subject to\nprior authorization. In addition, our business could be adversely affected if government healthcare programs, private health\ninsurers, including managed care organizations, or other reimbursing bodies or payors limit or reduce the indications for or\nconditions under which our products may be reimbursed. Moreover, as discussed further below, changes in insurance coverage\nor reimbursement levels by governmental authorities, private health insurers and other third-party payors, or in the type of\nsuch coverage held by patients may materially harm our business and commercialization efforts.\nWe may experience pricing pressures in connection with the sale of our current and future products due to the\nhealthcare reforms discussed below, as well as the trend toward initiatives aimed at reducing healthcare costs, the increasing\ninfluence of managed care, the scrutiny of pharmaceutical pricing, the ongoing debates on reducing government spending and\nadditional legislative proposals. There has been significant scrutiny of pharmaceutical pricing and the resulting costs of\npharmaceutical products that could cause significant operational and reimbursement changes for the pharmaceutical industry.\nThere have been a number of federal and state efforts to address drug costs, which generally have focused on increasing\ntransparency around drug costs or limiting drug prices, price increases or other related costs. Certain of these efforts have\nresulted in legislative and regulatory reforms. For example, and as discussed further below, the IRA, which could have the\neffect of reducing the prices we can charge and increasing the discounts we provide for our products and product candidates.\nAs another example, legislation enacted in 2021 revised the Medicaid drug rebate program in which we and other\nmanufacturers participate so that Medicaid rebates were no longer capped at 100% of the quarterly average manufacturer\nprice, or AMP. We anticipate that our ability to increase prices on our products, including LINZESS, and our revenues, may be\nadversely affected by legislative and regulatory reforms such as the Medicaid drug rebate program revisions.\n27\nTable of Contents\nHealthcare reform efforts or any future legislation or regulatory actions aimed at controlling and reducing healthcare\ncosts, including through measures designed to limit reimbursement, restrict access or impose unfavorable pricing\nmodifications on pharmaceutical products, could impact our and our partners’ ability to obtain or maintain reimbursement for\nour products at satisfactory levels, or at all, which could materially harm our business and financial results.\nWe and our linaclotide partners are subject to uncertainty relating to pricing and reimbursement policies outside the U.S.,\nas well as risks relating to the improper importation of linaclotide and sale of counterfeit versions of linaclotide. If such\npolicies are not favorable, or if linaclotide is improperly imported or is counterfeited, our business and financial results\ncould be adversely affected.\nIn some foreign countries, particularly Canada, the countries of Europe, Japan and China, the pricing and payment of\nprescription pharmaceuticals is subject to governmental control. In these countries, pricing negotiations with governmental\nauthorities can take 6 to 12 months or longer after the receipt of regulatory approval and product launch. Reimbursement\nsources are different in each country, and each country may include a combination of distinct potential payors, including\nprivate insurance and governmental payors. Some countries may restrict the range of medicinal products for which their\nnational health insurance systems provide reimbursement and control the prices of medicinal products for human use. To\nobtain favorable reimbursement for the indications sought or pricing approval in some countries, we and our partners may be\nrequired to conduct a clinical trial that compares the cost and clinical effectiveness of linaclotide to other available therapies.\nFurther, several countries have implemented government measures to either freeze or reduce pricing of pharmaceutical\nproducts. Many third-party payors and governmental authorities also consider the price for which the same product is being\nsold in other countries to determine their own pricing and reimbursement strategy, so if linaclotide is priced low or gets\nlimited reimbursement in a particular country, this could result in similarly low pricing and reimbursement in other countries.\nIf reimbursement for linaclotide is unavailable in any country in which reimbursement is sought, limited in scope or amount,\nor if pricing is set at or reduced to unsatisfactory levels, our and our partners’ ability to successfully commercialize linaclotide\nin such country would be impacted negatively. Furthermore, if these measures prevent us or any of our partners from selling\nlinaclotide on a profitable basis in a particular country, they could prevent the commercial launch or continued sale of\nlinaclotide in that country.\nCONSTELLA was first launched in certain European countries for the symptomatic treatment of moderate to severe\nIBS-C in adults in the second quarter of 2013 and our partner, AbbVie, is currently commercializing CONSTELLA in a\nnumber of European countries. LINZESS was first launched in Japan for the treatment of IBS-C in adults in the first quarter of\n2017, and for the treatment of chronic constipation in adults in the third quarter of 2018, and our partner Astellas is currently\ncommercializing LINZESS in Japan. In addition, LINZESS was first launched in China for the treatment of IBS-C in adults in\nNovember 2019, and our partner AstraZeneca, is currently commercializing LINZESS in China (including Hong Kong and\nMacau). The pricing and reimbursement strategy is a key component of our partners’ commercialization plans for\nCONSTELLA in Europe and LINZESS in Japan and China. Our revenues may suffer if our partners are unable to successfully\nand timely conclude reimbursement, price approval or funding processes and market CONSTELLA in key member states of\nthe E.U. or LINZESS in Japan or China, or if coverage and reimbursement for either CONSTELLA or LINZESS is limited or\nreduced. If our partners are not able to obtain or maintain coverage, pricing or reimbursement on acceptable terms or at all, or\nif such terms change in any countries in its territory, our partners may not be able to, or may decide not to, sell either\nCONSTELLA or LINZESS in such countries.\nWe and our partners also face the risk that linaclotide is imported or reimported into markets with relatively higher\nprices from markets with relatively lower prices, which would result in a decrease of sales and any payments we receive from\nthe affected market. Additionally, third parties may illegally produce, distribute and/or sell counterfeit or otherwise unfit or\nadulterated versions of linaclotide. In either case, we and our partners may not be able to detect or, if detected, prevent or\nprohibit the sale of such products, which could result in dangerous health consequences for patients, loss of confidence in us,\nour partners and our products, and adverse regulatory or legal consequences. Any of the foregoing or other consequences\ncould adversely impact our reputation, financial results and business.\nWe cannot give any assurance that apraglutide will be successful in clinical trials, and if successful, will receive regulatory\napproval, which is necessary before it can be commercialized.\n28\nTable of Contents\nUpon the closing of the VectivBio Acquisition, we added apraglutide, VectivBio’s lead investigational asset, a next\ngeneration, long-acting GLP-2 analog in development for the treatment of patients with SBS-IF and aGvHD, to our pipeline.\nApraglutide will require extensive clinical development, management of nonclinical, clinical and manufacturing\nactivities, regulatory approval, adequate manufacturing supply, and if approved, fully integrating apraglutide into the\ncommercial infrastructure to support with the appropriate sales, marketing, and market access efforts to generate sales in\npursuit of revenue. We have not yet completed a pivotal trial for this product candidate. We are not permitted to market or\npromote this product candidate before we receive regulatory approval from the U.S. FDA, the EMA, or comparable foreign\nregulatory authorities in the applicable jurisdiction, and we may never receive any such regulatory approval for apraglutide.\nTo obtain regulatory approvals for apraglutide, we must demonstrate with substantial evidence from adequate and well-\ncontrolled clinical trials, and to the satisfaction of the U.S. FDA, EMA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities, that such\nproduct candidates are safe and effective for their intended uses. However, we cannot be certain that apraglutide will be\nsuccessful in clinical trials. Further, results from clinical trials can be interpreted in different ways, and apraglutide may not\nreceive regulatory approval even if we believe it is successful in clinical trials. Even if we do receive such regulatory\napproval, we may be unable to successfully commercialize apraglutide within any approved indications or develop apraglutide\nfor the treatment of additional indications, which would materially adversely impact our business and prospects.\nThe regulatory approval processes in the U.S., in the E.U. and in other foreign jurisdictions are lengthy, time consuming\nand inherently unpredictable. If we are ultimately unable to obtain regulatory approval for apraglutide or our other\nproduct candidates, our business will be harmed.\nThe time required to obtain regulatory approval from the U.S. FDA, EMA and other comparable regulatory\nauthorities is unpredictable, typically takes many years following the commencement of clinical trials and depends upon\nnumerous factors. In addition, regulatory approval policies, regulations, or the type and amount of clinical data necessary to\ngain regulatory approval may change during the course of a product candidate’s clinical development and may vary among\njurisdictions, which may cause delays in the regulatory approval of or may result in the decision not to approve apraglutide or\nother product candidates. Regulatory approval is never guaranteed. Data obtained from nonclinical studies and clinical trials\nare susceptible to varying interpretations, and regulatory authorities may not interpret our data as favorably as we do, which\nmay further delay, limit or prevent development efforts, clinical trials, or regulatory approval. Even if we believe the\nnonclinical or clinical data for our product candidates are sufficient to support approval, such data may not be considered\nsufficient to support approval by the U.S. FDA, EMA and other comparable regulatory authorities. Of the large number of\ndrugs in development, only a small percentage successfully complete the U.S. FDA, EMA or comparable regulatory approval\nprocesses and are commercialized. Accordingly, it is possible that we will never obtain regulatory approval for apraglutide or\nour other product candidates.\nThe U.S. FDA, EMA or other comparable regulatory authorities may delay, limit, or deny approval of our product candidates,\nincluding apraglutide, for many reasons, including the following:\n● the U.S. FDA, EMA or other comparable foreign regulatory authorities may disagree with the design or\nimplementation of our clinical trials or with our interpretation of data from preclinical studies or clinical\ntrials;\n● the population studied in the clinical program may not be sufficiently broad or representative to assure\nsafety or efficacy in the full population for which we seek approval;\n● the data collected from our clinical trials may not be sufficient to support the submission of a NDA, MMA,\nor other submission or to obtain regulatory approval in the U.S., Europe or elsewhere;\n● participants in our clinical trials or individuals using drugs similar to our product candidates may experience\nserious and unexpected drug-related side effects;\n● we may be unable to demonstrate to the U.S. FDA, EMA or other comparable foreign regulatory authorities\nthat a product candidate’s risk-to-benefit ratio for its proposed indications is acceptable;\n● the U.S. FDA, EMA or the applicable foreign regulatory authority may disagree regarding the formulation,\nlabeling and/or the specifications of a product candidate;\n● the U.S. FDA, EMA or other comparable foreign regulatory authorities may fail to approve the\n29\nTable of Contents\nmanufacturing processes, test procedures and specifications, or facilities of third-party manufacturers with\nwhich we contract for clinical and commercial supplies; and\n● the regulatory approval policies or regulations of the U.S. FDA, EMA, or other applicable comparable\nforeign regulations in the E.U. and other jurisdictions may significantly change in a manner rendering our\nclinical data insufficient for approval.\nIn addition, apraglutide may be also regulated as a drug and device combination product by the U.S. FDA, EMA and\ncomparable foreign regulatory authorities. Developing and obtaining regulatory approval for combination products can pose\nunique challenges because they involve components that are regulated under different types of regulatory requirements and\npotentially by different U.S. FDA centers or regulatory authorities. As a result, combination product candidates may raise\nregulatory, policy and review challenges. Differences in regulatory pathways for each component of a combination product\ncan impact the regulatory processes for all aspects of product development and management, including clinical investigations,\nmarketing applications, manufacturing and quality control, adverse event reporting, promotion and advertising, user fees and\npost-approval modifications. Although the U.S. FDA, EMA, and comparable foreign authorities have systems in place for the\nreview and approval of combination products, we may experience additional delays in the development and\ncommercialization of apraglutide due to regulatory timing constraints and uncertainties in the product development and\napproval process. Moreover, although we expect that the device component would be reviewed in connection with the review\nof the drug marketing application for apraglutide, if and when submitted, and that no separate marketing authorization or\ncertification for the device component will be required, the U.S. FDA, EMA or comparable regulatory authorities may\ndisagree and require that we obtain a separate marketing authorization or certification for the device component, which could\nfurther delay or prevent regulatory approval of apraglutide.\nThis lengthy regulatory approval process, as well as the unpredictability of the results of clinical trials, may result in\nour failure to obtain regulatory approval to potentially market apraglutide or our other product candidates, which would\nsignificantly harm our business, results of operations, and prospects.\nDelays in the completion of clinical testing of any of our products or product candidates could result in increased costs and\ndelay or limit our ability to generate revenues.\nDelays in the completion of clinical testing could significantly affect our product development costs and timing of\ndata readouts and regulatory submissions and potential approvals. We do not know whether planned clinical trials will be\ncompleted on schedule, if at all. The commencement and completion of clinical trials can be delayed for a number of reasons,\nincluding delays related to:\n● obtaining regulatory authorization to commence a clinical trial;\n● reaching agreement on acceptable terms with prospective contract research organizations, or CROs, and\ntrial sites, the terms of which can be subject to extensive negotiation and may vary significantly among\ndifferent CROs and trial sites;\n● manufacturing sufficient quantities of a product candidate for use in clinical trials;\n● obtaining institutional review board or ethics committee approval to conduct a clinical trial at a prospective\nsite;\n● recruiting and enrolling patients to participate in clinical trials for a variety of reasons, including\ncompetition from other clinical trial programs for the treatment of similar conditions; and\n● maintaining patients who have initiated a clinical trial but may be prone to withdraw due to side effects\nfrom the therapy, lack of efficacy or personal issues, or who are lost to further follow-up.\nAdditionally, changes in regulatory requirements and guidance may occur, and we may need or otherwise determine\nto amend clinical trial protocols to reflect these changes. Each protocol amendment would require institutional review board\nor ethics committee review and approval, which may adversely impact the costs, timing or successful completion of the\nassociated clinical trials. If we or our partners terminate or experience delays in the completion of any clinical trials, the\ncommercial prospects for our products or product candidates may be harmed, and our ability to generate product revenues will\nbe delayed. In addition, many of the factors that cause, or lead to, a delay in the commencement or completion of clinical trials\nmay also ultimately lead to the denial of regulatory approval.\n30\nTable of Contents\nOur failure to successfully develop and commercialize additional product candidates or approved products would impair\nour ability to grow and/or adversely affect our business.\nAs part of our growth strategy, we intend to explore further linaclotide development opportunities as well as to\nadvance the development of our other pipeline programs through internal or external opportunities.\nWe and AbbVie are exploring development opportunities to enhance the clinical profile of LINZESS by studying\nlinaclotide in new or existing indications, populations and formulations to assess its potential to treat various conditions. For\nexample, we and AbbVie have established a nonclinical and clinical post-marketing plan with the U.S. FDA to understand the\nsafety and efficacy of LINZESS in pediatric patients. In June 2023, the U.S. FDA approved LINZESS as a once-daily\ntreatment for pediatric patients ages 6-17 years-old with FC. Additional clinical pediatric programs in IBS-C and FC are\nongoing. These development efforts may fail or may not increase the revenues that we generate from LINZESS. Furthermore,\nthey may result in adverse events, or perceived adverse events, in certain patient populations that are then attributed to the\ncurrently approved patient population, which may result in adverse regulatory action at the U.S. FDA or in other countries or\nharm linaclotide’s reputation in the marketplace, each of which could materially harm our revenues from linaclotide.\nThe strength of our company’s pipeline will depend in large part on the outcomes of studies of assets in our pipeline,\nsuch as apraglutide, CNP-104, IW-3300, and any other assets that we may acquire or license from third parties. Through the\nVectivBio Acquisition we added apraglutide to our pipeline. We are conducting a Phase III clinical trial, STARS, to assess the\nsafety and efficacy of apraglutide in adult patients with SBS-IF, and expect to report topline results in March 2024. In October\n2023, we presented positive final data from the STARS Nutrition Phase II study of apraglutide in patients with SBS-IF and\ncolon-in-continuity. We are also conducting open label extension studies to further evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability\nof apraglutide in SBS-IF and to support potential submissions of marketing applications for apraglutide in the U.S., European\nUnion, or E.U., and Japan. We are also conducting a Phase II exploratory study, STARGAZE, to evaluate apraglutide in\npatients with steroid-refractory gastrointestinal aGvHD, and expect data in the first quarter of 2024. Through the COUR\nCollaboration Agreement, we and COUR are developing CNP-104 for the treatment of PBC. COUR is currently conducting a\nclinical study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacodynamic effects and efficacy of CNP-104 in PBC patients, with\ntopline data expected in the third quarter of 2024. We are also advancing IW-3300, a GC-C agonist, for the potential treatment\nof visceral pain conditions, such as IC/BPS, and endometriosis.\nWe may spend several years and make significant investments in developing any current or future product candidate,\nand failure may occur at any point. Our product candidates must satisfy rigorous standards of safety and efficacy before they\ncan be approved for sale by the U.S. FDA, EMA or comparable foreign authorities. To satisfy these standards, we must\nallocate resources among development programs and we must engage in costly and lengthy research and development efforts,\nwhich are subject to unanticipated delays and other significant uncertainties. Despite our efforts, our product candidates may\nnot offer therapeutic or other improvement over existing competitive drugs, be proven safe and effective in clinical trials, or\nmeet applicable regulatory standards. It is possible that none of the product candidates we develop will be approved for\ncommercial sale, which would impair our ability to grow.\nWe have ongoing or planned nonclinical and clinical trials, including for linaclotide, apraglutide, and our other\nproduct candidates. Many companies in the pharmaceutical industry have suffered significant setbacks in clinical trials even\nafter achieving promising results in earlier nonclinical or clinical trials. Findings from completed nonclinical studies may not\nbe replicated in later clinical trials, and clinical trials may not be predictive of the results we may obtain in later-stage clinical\ntrials or of the likelihood of regulatory approval. Results from clinical trials and findings from nonclinical studies could lead\nto abrupt changes in development activities, including the possible limitation or cessation of development activities associated\nwith a particular product candidate or program. We cannot be certain that apraglutide or our other product candidates will be\nsuccessful in clinical trials. Furthermore, our analysis of data obtained from nonclinical and clinical activities is subject to\nconfirmation and interpretation by the U.S. FDA, EMA and other applicable regulatory authorities, which could delay, limit or\nprevent regulatory approval. The U.S. FDA, EMA or other regulatory authorities also may require additional clinical trials,\nwhich may be costly or delay, limit, prevent or otherwise impact regulatory submission or approval. Satisfaction of U.S. FDA,\nEMA or other applicable regulatory requirements is costly, time-consuming, uncertain and subject to unanticipated delays. We\ncannot give any assurance that apraglutide or our other product candidates will receive regulatory approval. Even if we do\nreceive such regulatory approval, we may be unable to successfully commercialize apraglutide or our other product candidates\nin any approved\n31\nTable of Contents\nindications or develop such product candidates for the treatment of additional indications, which would materially adversely\nimpact our business and prospects.\nThe pricing of apraglutide and our other product candidates, if and when approved for marketing, will depend in part on\npricing and reimbursement strategies adopted by our competitors.\nThe pricing of apraglutide and our other product candidates, if and when approved for marketing, will depend, in\npart, on the pricing and reimbursement strategies adopted by our competitors. For example, with respect to apraglutide, a\nmarketed GLP-2 product already exists in the U.S., E.U. and other international markets, which may or may not be\ngenericized within the coming years. Additionally, another investigational GLP-2 may be launched in advance of the potential\napproval of apraglutide in the U.S. and EMA. Order of market entry and reimbursement decisions could place apraglutide at a\ncompetitive disadvantage, possibly deny market exclusivity rights, and/or elevate the need for significant clinical\ndifferentiation to support certain pricing decisions. If these or other factors impact the price we can charge for apraglutide, we\nmay reduce our revenue and results of operations could be affected. Similar competitive factors could apply to pricing and\nreimbursement decisions for our other product candidates, if approved, in the future.\nWe must work effectively and collaboratively with AbbVie to market and sell LINZESS in the U.S., and we must adapt our\ncommercial model and market strategy to the evolving landscape for LINZESS to achieve its maximum commercial\npotential.\nWe are working closely with AbbVie to execute our joint commercialization plan for LINZESS. The\ncommercialization plan includes an agreed upon marketing campaign that targets the physicians who see patients who could\nbenefit from LINZESS treatment. Our consumer marketing campaign targets the adult men and women who suffer from IBS-\nC or CIC. Our commercialization plan also includes an integrated call plan for our sales forces in an effort to optimize the\neducation of key healthcare professionals on whom our and AbbVie’s sales representatives call, and the frequency with which\nthe representatives meet with them.\nIn order to optimize the commercial potential of LINZESS, we and AbbVie must execute upon this\ncommercialization plan effectively and efficiently. In addition, we and AbbVie must continually assess, modify and adapt our\ncommercialization plan in a coordinated and integrated fashion, including evaluating and adjusting as necessary the level and\nmix of marketing and promotion efforts, in response to changing business, market or other factors in order to advance the\ncommercial potential of LINZESS, such as the U.S. FDA approval of LINZESS in pediatric patients ages 6-17 years-old for\nFC. Further, we and AbbVie must continue to focus our combined sales and marketing efforts on educating customers about\nthe relevant data and information for LINZESS in treating adults with IBS-C and CIC, and taking a measured approach to\neducating and raising awareness on the FC indication for pediatric patients ages 6-17 years-old. We and AbbVie must ensure a\nhighly targeted and efficient promotional mix combined with providing our sales forces with the highest quality support,\nguidance, and oversight for them to continue effectively promoting LINZESS to key healthcare professionals. If we and\nAbbVie fail to evolve with the changing commercial landscape successfully and perform these commercial functions in the\nhighest quality manner and in accordance with our joint commercialization plan and related agreements, LINZESS will not\nachieve its maximum commercial potential and we may suffer financial harm. Our commercial efforts to further target and\nengage adult patients with IBS-C or CIC may not effectively increase appropriate patient awareness or patient/physician\ndialogue and may not increase the revenues that we generate from LINZESS.\nWe face competition and new products may emerge that provide different or better alternatives for treatment of the\nconditions that our products are approved to treat.\nThe pharmaceutical industry and the markets in which we operate are intensely competitive. We compete in the\nmarketing and sale of our products, the development of new products or product candidates and the acquisition of rights to\nnew products with commercial potential. Certain of our competitors have substantially greater financial, technical and human\nresources than us. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical industry may result in even more resources being\nconcentrated in our competitors and enable them to compete more effectively. Competition may also increase further as a\nresult of advances made in the commercial applicability of technologies and greater availability of capital for investment in\nthese fields. Additionally, new developments, including the development of other drug technologies and methods of\npreventing the incidence of disease, occur in the pharmaceutical and medical technology industries at a rapid pace. These\ndevelopments may render our products obsolete or noncompetitive.\n32\nTable of Contents\nLinaclotide competes with certain prescription therapies and OTC products, some of which have attained significant\nlevels of market acceptance. The availability of prescription competitors and OTC products could limit the demand, and the\nprice we are able to charge, for LINZESS unless we are able to maintain market acceptance among the medical community\nand patients and differentiate LINZESS on the basis of its cost and/or actual or perceived benefits. For example, Takeda’s\nAMITIZA (lubiprostone) is approved by the U.S. FDA for sale in the U.S. for the treatment of IBS-C, CIC and opioid-induced\nconstipation; Bausch’s TRULANCE (plecanatide) is approved by the U.S. FDA for sale in the U.S. for the treatment of adults\nwith IBS-C and CIC; Takeda’s MOTEGRITY (prucalopride) is approved by the U.S. FDA for sale in the U.S. for the\ntreatment of CIC in adults; in April 2022, Ardelyx launched in the U.S. IBSRELA™ (tenapanor), a U.S. FDA-approved\ntreatment for IBS-C in adults; and in August 2022, Vibrant Gastro Inc. launched Vibrant, a drug-free capsule that the U.S.\nFDA granted marketing authorization for the treatment of CIC in adults who have not experienced relief of their bowel\nsymptoms by using laxative therapies at the recommended dosage for at least one month. OTC laxatives such as MiraLAX®\nand DULCOLAX®, and lactulose, a prescription laxative treatment, are also available for the treatment of constipation.\nAdditionally, we believe other companies are developing products that could compete with linaclotide, should they be\napproved by the U.S. FDA or foreign regulatory authorities and become commercially available. In addition, there are other\ncompounds in late-stage development and other potential competitors that are in earlier stages of development that, if\napproved, may compete with linaclotide. If our current or potential competitors are successful in completing drug\ndevelopment for their drug candidates and obtain approval from the U.S. FDA or foreign regulatory authorities, they could\nlimit the demand for linaclotide. In addition to competition from such prescription and over-the-counter products, we may also\nface competition from multiple low-cost generic versions of such products when available in the U.S. For example, an\nauthorized generic version of AMITIZA was first launched in the U.S. in January of 2021 and multiple versions are now\navailable. We expect additional generic versions to become available in the future.\nIn addition, any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing drugs\nand new drugs that may become available in the future. Apraglutide, if successfully developed and approved, will compete\nwith companies that are commercializing or developing drugs for SBS, such as Takeda, which currently distributes the GLP-2\nanalog teduglutide, marketed as GATTEX® (teduglutide) in the U.S. and REVESTIVE® (teduglutide for injection) in Europe,\nand Zealand Pharma A/S, which is developing the GLP-2 analog glepaglutide for the treatment of SBS and which submitted\nan NDA to the U.S. FDA in December 2023. Hanmi Pharmaceutical is also developing a GLP-2 analog which is in a Phase 2\nclinical trial. Products with other mechanisms of action may emerge as future competition.\nOur products or product candidates may cause undesirable side effects or have other properties that could delay or prevent\ntheir development, create unpredictable clinical trial results, impact its regulatory approval or limit their commercial\npotential.\nUndesirable side effects caused by our products or product candidates, including adverse events associated with our\nproduct candidates, could cause us or regulatory authorities to interrupt, delay or halt clinical trials and could result in a more\nrestrictive label or the delay or denial of regulatory approval by the U.S. FDA, EMA or other comparable foreign regulatory\nauthorities. Additionally, with respect to our approved products, as patient experience increases and expands, or if one or more\nof our product candidates receives marketing approval, we, our partners, or others may later identify previously unknown side\neffects, known side effects may be found to be more frequent and/or severe than in the past, or detect unexpected safety\nsignals for our products or any products perceived to be similar to our products. The foregoing, or the perception of the\nforegoing, may have the following effects, among others:\n● sales of our products may be impaired;\n● regulatory approvals for our products may be delayed, denied, restricted or withdrawn;\n● we or our partners may decide to, or be required to, change the products’ labeling or send product warning\nletters or field alerts to physicians, pharmacists or hospitals;\n● reformulation of the products, additional nonclinical or clinical studies, changes in labeling or changes to\nor re-approvals of manufacturing facilities may be required;\n33\nTable of Contents\n● we or our partners may be precluded from pursuing approval of our products in new territories or from\nstudying additional development opportunities to enhance our products’ clinical profiles, including within\nnew or existing indications, populations or formulations, as well as in potential combination products;\n● we may be required to create a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, plan, or similar actions\nin other jurisdictions which could include a medication guide outlining the risks of such side effects for\ndistribution to patients, a communication plan for healthcare providers or other elements to assure safe\nuse;\n● our or our products’ reputation in the marketplace may suffer; and\n● government investigations or lawsuits, including class action suits, may be brought against us or our\npartners.\nAny of the above occurrences could prevent us from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of our product\ncandidates, if they are approved, and could significantly harm our business, results of operations, and prospects, prevent sales\nof our products, increase expenses and impair our and our partners’ ability to successfully commercialize our products.\nLinaclotide has been prescribed to millions of patients since its launch in the U.S. and other territories beginning in\nDecember 2012. The number and type of patients treated with linaclotide could continue to grow if physicians prescribe\nlinaclotide to more patients and as we and our partners conduct clinical trials, including in new indications, populations or\nformulations, as well as explore potential combination products, in existing and new territories. As the patient experience with\nlinaclotide increases and expands, we and others may identify previously unknown side effects, known side effects may be\nfound to be more frequent or severe than in the past, and others may detect unexpected safety signals for linaclotide or any\nproducts perceived to be similar to linaclotide. The most commonly reported adverse reaction since linaclotide became\ncommercially available, as well as in the clinical trials for linaclotide in IBS-C and CIC, has been diarrhea. In the linaclotide\nPhase III IBS-C and CIC trials in adults, severe diarrhea was reported in 2% or less of the linaclotide-treated patients and its\nincidence was similar between the IBS-C and CIC populations. In the linaclotide Phase III FC trial in pediatric patients ages 6-\n17 years-old, severe diarrhea was reported in one linaclotide-treated patient.\nIn addition, the U.S. FDA-approved labeling for LINZESS contains a boxed warning describing the risk of serious\ndehydration in pediatric patients less than two years of age and a contraindication against its use in these patients. The safety\nand effectiveness of LINZESS in patients with FC less than 6 years of age or in patients with IBS-C less than 18 years of age\nhave not been established. These and other restrictions could limit the commercial potential of LINZESS. We and AbbVie\nhave established a nonclinical and clinical post-marketing plan with the U.S. FDA to understand the safety and efficacy of\nLINZESS in pediatric patients. In June 2023, the U.S. FDA approved LINZESS as a once-daily treatment for pediatric\npatients ages 6-17 years-old with FC, making LINZESS the first and only FDA-approved prescription therapy for FC in this\npatient population. Additional clinical pediatric programs in IBS-C and FC are ongoing. There can be no assurances, however,\nwhether there may be any significant unknown side effects that could limit the commercial potential of LINZESS in this\npediatric population.\nPatients treated with apraglutide may experience well known class-specific adverse events, including, but not limited\nto, abdominal pain, injection site reactions, nausea, headaches, abdominal distension, upper respiratory tract infection,\nvomiting and fluid overload. There may be additional mechanistic side effects that only reveal themselves upon the\ncompletion of larger studies. Additionally, apraglutide has been designed to have a long half-life, creating uncertainty about its\nlong-term safety profile. For example, the increased pleiotropic activity of apraglutide will need to be assessed in longer-term\nnon-clinical safety studies.\n34\nTable of Contents\nEven though LINZESS is approved by the U.S. FDA for use in adult and certain pediatric patients, post-approval\ndevelopment and regulatory requirements still remain, which may present additional challenges, and we may not be\nsuccessful in obtaining approval for additional indications for LINZESS that we are seeking or may seek in the future.\nIn August 2012, the U.S. FDA approved LINZESS as a once-daily treatment for adult men and women suffering\nfrom IBS-C or CIC. Although we and AbbVie completed additional nonclinical and clinical studies in adults that were\nrequired by the U.S. FDA in connection with the approval of LINZESS, LINZESS remains subject to ongoing\nU.S. FDA requirements, including those governing the testing, manufacturing, labeling, packaging, storage, advertising,\npromotion, sale, distribution, recordkeeping and submission of safety and other post-market information.\nThe U.S. FDA-approved labeling for LINZESS contains a boxed warning describing the risk of serious dehydration\nin pediatric patients less than two years of age and a contraindication against its use in these patients. We and AbbVie have\nestablished a nonclinical and clinical post-marketing plan with the U.S. FDA to understand the safety and efficacy of\nLINZESS in pediatric patients. In June 2023, the U.S. FDA approved LINZESS as a once-daily treatment for pediatric\npatients ages 6-17 years-old with FC, making LINZESS the first and only FDA-approved prescription therapy for FC in this\npatient population. The safety and effectiveness of LINZESS in patients with FC less than 6 years of age or in patients with\nIBS-C less than 18 years of age have not been established. Additional clinical pediatric programs in IBS-C and FC are\nongoing in support of post-approval requirements. Our ability to expand the indication or labeling information for LINZESS\nwill depend on, among other things, our successful completion of pediatric clinical programs.\nThese post-approval requirements impose resource and cost burdens on us. Failure to effectively, appropriately and\ntimely conduct and complete the required studies relating to our products, monitor and report adverse events and meet our\nother post-approval commitments would lead to negative regulatory action at the U.S. FDA, which could include withdrawal\nof regulatory approval of our products for their currently approved indications and patient populations.\nEven though linaclotide is approved for marketing in the U.S. and in a number of other countries, we or our partners may\nnever receive approval to commercialize linaclotide in additional parts of the world.\nIn order to market any products outside of the countries where linaclotide is currently approved, we or our partners\nmust comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other jurisdictions regarding, among other things, safety\nand efficacy. Approval procedures vary among jurisdictions and can involve product testing and administrative review periods\ndifferent from, and greater than, those in the U.S. and the other countries where linaclotide is approved. Potential risks include\nthat the regulatory authorities:\n● may not deem linaclotide safe and effective;\n● may not find the data from nonclinical studies and clinical trials sufficient to support approval;\n● may not approve of manufacturing processes and facilities;\n● may not approve linaclotide for any or all indications or patient populations for which approval is sought;\n● may require significant warnings or restrictions on use to the product labeling for linaclotide; or\n● may change their approval policies or adopt new regulations.\nIf any of the foregoing were to occur, our or our partners’ receipt of regulatory approval in the applicable jurisdiction\ncould be delayed or we or our partners may never receive approval at all. Further, regulatory approval in one jurisdiction does\nnot ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one jurisdiction may have\na negative effect on the regulatory processes in others. If linaclotide is not approved for all indications or patient populations\nor with the labeling requested, this would limit the uses of linaclotide and have an adverse effect on its commercial potential\nor require costly post-marketing studies.\n35\nTable of Contents\nRisks Related to Our Growth Strategy\nIf we are unable to execute on our strategy to in-license or acquire externally developed products or product candidates, or\nengage in other transactions with value creation potential, our business and prospects would be materially adversely\naffected.\nOur future success is largely dependent on our ability to successfully execute on our growth strategy, which includes\nin-licensing or otherwise acquiring the rights to externally developed gastrointestinal products or product candidates or\nengaging in other transactions with value creation potential. The success of this strategy depends upon our ability to identify,\nselect and acquire promising assets, platforms or other opportunities. For example, through the VectivBio Acquisition, we\nadded apraglutide to our pipeline. There is no assurance that apraglutide will be successful in clinical trials, and if successful,\nthat it will receive regulatory approval. For another example, through the COUR Collaboration Agreement, we and COUR are\ndeveloping CNP-104 for the treatment of PBC, and we have been granted an option to acquire an exclusive license to\nresearch, develop, manufacture and commercialize products containing CNP-104 in the U.S. for the treatment of PBC after\nreviewing the data from this study. There is no assurance that we will exercise the option for CNP-104, and if exercised, that\nwe will complete subsequent clinical trials and receive regulatory approval.\nIn addition, the process of proposing, negotiating and implementing a license or acquisition is lengthy and complex\nand there is no assurance we will be able to enter into similar transactions in the future. Pursuit of external opportunities is\nalso a highly competitive area and a number of other companies, including some with substantially greater financial,\ndevelopment, marketing and sales resources, may compete with us for license or acquisition opportunities. We have limited\nresources to identify and execute the acquisition or in-licensing of third-party products, product candidates, businesses or\ntechnologies and integrate them into our current infrastructure. Moreover, we expect to incur a variety of costs and devote\nresources to potential acquisitions or in-licensing opportunities that are never completed, or we may fail to realize the\nanticipated benefits of such efforts. If we are unable to successfully acquire the rights to additional products or product\ncandidates on terms that we find acceptable, or at all, or execute other value creating transactions, we will remain smaller, less\ndiversified and highly dependent on the commercial success of LINZESS, and our business and prospects would be materially\nand adversely affected.\nIn addition, such in-licenses, acquisitions or other transactions may entail numerous operational and financial risks,\nincluding:\n● development, regulatory and commercialization challenges;\n● exposure to unknown liabilities;\n● disruption of our business and diversion of our management’s time and attention to develop acquired products,\nproduct candidates, businesses or technologies;\n● incurrence of substantial debt, dilutive issuances of securities or depletion of cash to pay for acquisitions;\n● higher than expected acquisition and integration costs;\n● difficulty in combining the operations and personnel of any acquired businesses with our operations and\npersonnel;\n● increased amortization expenses;\n● impairment of relationships with key suppliers or customers of any acquired businesses due to changes in\nmanagement and ownership; and\n● inability to motivate key employees of any acquired businesses.\nThe development of product candidates in particular is a highly uncertain process, as we discuss further below. Any\nproduct candidate that we in-license or acquire may require additional development efforts prior to commercial sale, including\nextensive clinical testing and approval by the U.S. FDA, EMA and applicable foreign regulatory authorities. We may also rely\non our licensors and collaboration partners to conduct development activities for certain of our product\n36\nTable of Contents\ncandidates, and while we may have oversight of such development activities, such licensees or collaboration partners may not\neffectively develop any such product candidates. All product candidates are prone to risks of failure typical of pharmaceutical\nproduct development, including the possibility that a product candidate will not be shown to be sufficiently safe and effective\nfor approval by regulatory authorities or competitors may develop alternatives that render our potential product candidates\nobsolete or less attractive. It is possible that none of the product candidates we may in-license or acquire will be approved for\ncommercial sale or be otherwise commercially viable, which would impair our ability to grow. Furthermore, we may have\nlittle or no insight or control over the development and commercialization of any product that we in-license outside the\nlicensed territory. If other licensees do not effectively develop or commercialize any such product outside the licensed\nterritory, our reputation or the reputation of any such product may be impacted.\nWe may be unable to maintain the benefits associated with orphan drug designation, including market exclusivity, which\nmay harm our business.\nIn the U.S., orphan drug designation entitles a party to financial incentives such as opportunities for grant funding\ntowards clinical trial costs, tax advantages, and user-fee waivers. In addition, if a product receives the first U.S. FDA approval\nfor the indication for which it has orphan designation, the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity, which means the U.S.\nFDA may not approve any other application to market the same drug for the same indication for a period of seven years,\nexcept in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority over the product with orphan exclusivity or where\nthe manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient product quantity. In the E.U., orphan drug designation entitles a company to\nfinancial incentives such as reduction of fees or fee waivers and ten years of data and market exclusivity for the approved\ntherapeutic indication following marketing authorization of a medicinal product, including biological medicinal products. This\nperiod may be reduced to six years if, at the end of the fifth year, the medicinal product no longer fulfills the orphan\ndesignation criteria, including where it is shown that the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market\nexclusivity.\nBecause the extent and scope of patent protection for our products may in some cases be limited, orphan drug\ndesignation is especially important for our product candidates for which orphan drug designation may be available. For\neligible drugs, we plan to rely on the exclusivity period under the Orphan Drug Act to maintain a competitive position. If we\ndo not obtain orphan drug exclusivity for our drug product candidates that does not have a broad patent protection, our\ncompetitors may then sell the same drug to treat the same condition sooner than if we had obtained orphan drug exclusivity\nand our revenue will be reduced.\nEven though we have orphan drug designation for apraglutide in the U.S. and in the E.U., we may not be the first to\nobtain marketing approval for any particular orphan indication due to the uncertainties associated with developing\npharmaceutical products. Based on available preclinical and clinical data, both the U.D. FDA and the EMA have granted\napraglutide orphan drug designation for the treatment of SBS. The U.S. FDA also granted orphan drug designation for\napraglutide for the prevention of aGvHD. Orphan drug applicability will be reassessed by health authorities upon completion\nof clinical studies and submission of our marketing application. In the E.U., the orphan designation for apraglutide may not be\nmaintained at the time of grant of the marketing authorization if the EMA and COMP do not consider that there is sufficient\nconfirmatory evidence to support that the criteria orphan designation continue to be met.\nEven if we obtain orphan drug exclusivity for a product, that exclusivity may not effectively protect the product from\ncompetition because different drugs with different active moieties can be approved for the same condition. Even after an\norphan drug is approved, the U.S. FDA or European Commission can subsequently approve the same drug with the same\nactive moiety for the same condition if the U.S. FDA or EMA concludes that the later drug is safer, more effective, or makes a\nmajor contribution to patient care. Orphan drug designation neither shortens the development time or regulatory review time\nof a drug nor gives the drug any advantage in the regulatory review or approval process.\nIf we are unable to successfully partner with other companies to develop and commercialize products and/or product\ncandidates, our ability to grow would be impaired and our business would be adversely affected.\nAs part of our business strategy, we may partner with pharmaceutical, biotechnology or other companies to develop\nand commercialize products or product candidates. Although we have entered into such arrangements with respect to the\ndevelopment and commercialization of linaclotide worldwide and of apraglutide in Japan, there can be no assurance that we\nwill be able to do so in the future with respect to other products or product candidates that we either\n37\nTable of Contents\ndevelop internally or in- license or that we will be able to gain the interest of potential partners; establish and maintain\ndevelopment, manufacturing, marketing, sales or distribution relationships on acceptable terms; that such relationships, if\nestablished, will be successful or on favorable terms; or that we will gain market acceptance for such products or product\ncandidates. The process of proposing, negotiating and implementing a partnership arrangement is lengthy and complex. If we\nenter into any partnering arrangements with third parties, any revenues we receive will depend upon the efforts of such third\nparties. If we are unable to establish successful partnering arrangements when advantageous, we may not gain access to the\nfinancial resources and industry experience necessary to develop, commercialize or successfully market our products or\nproduct candidates, may be forced to curtail, delay or stop a development program or one or more of our other development\nprograms, delay commercialization, reduce the scope of our planned sales or marketing activities or undertake development or\ncommercialization activities at our own expense, and therefore may be unable to generate revenue from products or product\ncandidates or do so to their full potential.\nRisks Related to the VectivBio Acquisition\nWe may be unable to successfully integrate the business and personnel of VectivBio, and may not realize the expected\nbenefits and anticipated synergies of such acquisition.\nIn December 2023, we completed the VectivBio Acquisition. We may not realize the expected benefits from such\nacquisition because of integration difficulties or other challenges.\nThe success of the VectivBio Acquisition will depend, in part, on our ability to realize all or some of the expected\nbenefits from the acquisition and anticipated synergies from integrating its business with our existing business. The integration\nprocess may be complex, costly and time-consuming and we may not ultimately realize the return on our investment. Risks we\nmay face in connection with the VectivBio Acquisition include, among others:\n● failure to successfully implement our business plans for the combined business, including the development of\napraglutide for SBS-IF;\n● failure of the VectivBio Acquisition to further our business strategy as we expected, including the development\nand, if approved, the commercialization of apraglutide for SBS-IF;\n● unexpected losses of key employees, customers or suppliers, and the complexities associated with integrating\npersonnel from another company;\n● unanticipated issues in conforming VectivBio’s standards, processes, procedures and controls with our\noperations;\n● coordinating product candidate and process development;\n● increasing the scope, geographic diversity and complexity of our operations;\n● diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns;\n● adverse effects on our or VectivBio’s existing business relationships;\n● unanticipated changes in applicable laws and regulations;\n● unanticipated expenses and liabilities associated with the VectivBio Acquisition; and\n● other difficulties in the assimilation of VectivBio operations, technologies, product candidates and systems.\nWe may have unanticipated or larger than anticipated liabilities for patent and trademark infringement claims,\nviolations of laws, commercial disputes, taxes and other known and unknown types of liabilities. There may be liabilities that\nwe underestimated or did not discover in the course of performing our due diligence investigation.\n38\nTable of Contents\nIf we experience difficulties with the integration process or if the business of VectivBio deteriorates, the anticipated\nbenefits, cost savings, growth opportunities and other synergies of the VectivBio Acquisition may not be realized fully or at\nall, or may take longer to realize than expected. If any of the above risks occur, our business, financial condition, results of\noperations and cash flows may be materially and adversely impacted, we may fail to meet the expectations of investors or\nanalysts, and our stock price may decline as a result.\nRisks Related to Our Dependence on Third Parties\nBecause we work with partners to develop, manufacture and commercialize linaclotide, we and our partners are dependent\nupon third parties, and our and our partners’ relationships with those third parties, in our and our partners’ efforts to\nobtain regulatory approval for, and to commercialize, linaclotide, as well as to comply with regulatory and other\nobligations with respect to linaclotide.\nAbbVie played a significant role in the conduct of the clinical trials for linaclotide and in the subsequent collection\nand analysis of data, and AbbVie holds the new drug application, or NDA, for LINZESS. AbbVie also\ncontinues to play a significant role in the conduct of our pediatric program for linaclotide. In addition, we are commercializing\nLINZESS in the U.S. with AbbVie. AbbVie is also responsible for the development, regulatory approval and\ncommercialization of linaclotide in countries worldwide other than Japan and China (including Hong Kong and Macau).\nAbbVie is commercializing LINZESS in Mexico, and Saudi Arabia and CONSTELLA in Canada as well as in certain\ncountries including in Europe. Astellas and AstraZeneca are responsible for development and commercialization of LINZESS\nin Japan and China (including Hong Kong and Macau), respectively. Each of our partners for linaclotide also is responsible for\nactive pharmaceutical ingredient, or API, finished drug product and finished goods manufacturing (including bottling and\npackaging) for its respective territories and distributing the finished goods to wholesalers. We and/or our partners have\ncommercial supply agreements with independent third parties to manufacture the linaclotide API.\nThe integration of our efforts with our partners’ efforts is subject to the uncertainty of the markets for pharmaceutical\nproducts in each partner’s respective territories, and accordingly, these relationships must evolve to meet any new challenges\nthat arise in those regions. These integrated functions may not be carried out effectively and efficiently if we fail to\ncommunicate and coordinate with our linaclotide partners, and vice versa. Our linaclotide partnering strategy imposes\nobligations, risks and operational requirements on us as the central node in our global network of partners. If we do not\neffectively communicate with each partner and ensure that the entire network is making integrated and cohesive decisions\nfocused on the global brand for linaclotide, linaclotide will not achieve its maximum commercial potential. Further, we have\nlimited ability to control the amount or timing of resources that our partners devote to linaclotide. If any of our partners fails to\ndevote sufficient time and resources to linaclotide, or if its performance is substandard or otherwise hindered, it will delay the\npotential submission or approval of regulatory applications for linaclotide, as well as the manufacturing and\ncommercialization of linaclotide in the particular territory. A material breach by any of our partners of our collaboration or\nlicense agreement with such partner, or a significant disagreement between us and a partner, could also delay the regulatory\napproval and commercialization of linaclotide, potentially lead to costly litigation, and could have a material adverse impact\non our financial condition. Moreover, although we have non-compete restrictions in place with each of our linaclotide\npartners, they may have competitive products or relationships with other commercial entities, some of which may compete\nwith us. If any of our partners competes with us or assists our competitors, it could harm our competitive position.\nIn addition, adverse event reporting requires significant coordination with our partners and third parties. We are the\nholder of the global safety database for linaclotide responsible for coordinating the safety surveillance and adverse event\nreporting efforts worldwide with respect to linaclotide; each of Astellas, AstraZeneca and AbbVie is responsible for reporting\nadverse event information from its territory to us. If we fail to perform such activities and maintain the global safety database\nfor linaclotide or if our partners do not report adverse events related to linaclotide, or fail to do so in a timely manner, we may\nnot receive the information that we or our partners are required to report to the U.S. FDA or a foreign regulatory authority\nregarding such products. Furthermore, we or our partners may fail to adequately monitor, identify or investigate adverse\nevents, or to report adverse events to the U.S. FDA or foreign regulatory authority accurately and within the prescribed\ntimeframe. If we or our partners are unsuccessful in any of the foregoing due to poor process, execution, systems, oversight,\ncommunication, adjudication or otherwise, then we may suffer any number of consequences, including the imposition of\nadditional restrictions on the use of linaclotide, removal of linaclotide from the market, criminal prosecution, the imposition of\ncivil monetary penalties, seizure of such products, or delay in approval of future products.\n39\nTable of Contents\nWe rely entirely on contract manufacturers, our partners and other third parties to manufacture linaclotide, apraglutide,\nand our other product candidates and to distribute linaclotide. If they are unable to comply with applicable regulatory\nrequirements, unable to source sufficient raw materials, experience manufacturing or distribution difficulties, or are\notherwise unable to manufacture and distribute sufficient quantities to meet demand, our development and\ncommercialization efforts may be materially harmed.\nWe have no internal manufacturing or distribution capabilities. Instead, we rely on a combination of contract\nmanufacturers and our partners to manufacture API, finished drug product and finished goods for linaclotide, apraglutide, and\nour other product candidates. For linaclotide, each of our partners is responsible for API, finished drug product and finished\ngoods manufacturing (including bottling and packaging) for its respective territories and distributing the finished goods to\nwholesalers. We and/or our partners have commercial supply agreements with independent third parties to manufacture\nlinaclotide API. For apraglutide, we design and develop the manufacturing process together with CDMOs for the manufacture\nfor human use. Should we, or any of our partners or any third-party manufacturers we or our partners engage, experience\nsetbacks or challenges in our manufacturing efforts, our development and commercialization efforts may be materially\nharmed.\nEach of our partners and the third-party manufacturers we or our partners engage, must comply with GMP and other\nstringent regulatory requirements enforced by the U.S. FDA, EMA and other foreign regulatory authorities in other\njurisdictions. These requirements include, among other things, quality control, quality assurance and the maintenance of\nrecords and documentation, which occur in addition to our and our partners’ own quality assurance releases.\nIf we or a regulatory agency discovers previously unknown problems with a product, such as adverse events of\nunanticipated severity or frequency, or problems with a facility where the product is manufactured, a regulatory agency may\nimpose restrictions on that product or the manufacturer, including withdrawal of the product from the market or suspension of\nmanufacturing. If we, our partners or the manufacturing facilities for our products fail to comply with applicable regulatory\nrequirements, a regulatory agency may take the following actions, among others:\n● issue warning letters or untitled letters;\n● impose civil or criminal penalties;\n● suspend or withdraw regulatory approval;\n● suspend any ongoing clinical trials;\n● refuse to approve pending applications or supplements to applications submitted by us or our partners;\n● impose restrictions on operations, including costly new manufacturing requirements; or\n● seize or detain products or require us to initiate a product recall.\nManufacturers of our products may be unable to comply with these GMP requirements and with other regulatory\nrequirements. We have little control over compliance with these regulations and standards by our partners and the third-party\nmanufacturers we or our partners engage.\nIn addition, we expect that apraglutide may be regulated by the U.S. FDA as a drug-device combination product. Our\nthird-party manufacturers may not be able to comply with GMP regulations applicable to drug-device combination products,\nincluding applicable provisions of the U.S. FDA’s drug GMP regulations and device GMP requirements embodied in the\nQuality System Regulation, or similar regulatory requirements outside the U.S.\nOur partners and the third-party manufacturers we or our partners engage may experience problems with their\nrespective manufacturing and distribution operations and processes, including, for example, quality issues, such as product\nspecification and stability failures, procedural deviations, improper equipment installation or operation, utility failures,\ncontamination, natural disasters and public health epidemics. In addition, the raw materials necessary to make API for our\nproducts and product candidates are acquired from a limited number of sources. Any delay or disruption in\n40\nTable of Contents\nthe availability of raw materials or a change in raw material suppliers could result in production disruptions, delays or higher\ncosts with consequent adverse effects on us.\nThe manufacture of pharmaceutical products requires significant expertise and capital investment, including the\ndevelopment of advanced manufacturing techniques and process controls. Manufacturers of pharmaceutical products often\nencounter difficulties in commercial production. These problems include difficulties with production costs and yields, quality\ncontrol, including stability of the product and quality assurance testing, and shortages of qualified personnel, as well as\ncompliance with federal, state and foreign regulations and the challenges associated with complex supply chain management.\nEven if our partners or the third-party manufacturers we or our partners engage do not experience problems and commercial\nmanufacturing is achieved, their maximum or available manufacturing capacities may be insufficient to meet commercial\ndemand. Finding alternative manufacturers or adding additional manufacturers requires a significant amount of time and\ninvolves significant expense. New manufacturers would need to develop and implement the necessary production techniques\nand processes, which along with their facilities, would need to be inspected and approved by the regulatory authorities in each\napplicable territory.\nIf our partners or the third-party manufacturers we or our partners engage fail to adhere to applicable GMP or other\nregulatory requirements, experience delays or disruptions in the availability of raw materials or experience manufacturing or\ndistribution problems, we will suffer significant consequences, including product seizures or recalls, loss of product approval,\nfines and sanctions, reputational damage, shipment delays, inventory shortages, inventory write-offs and other product-related\ncharges and increased manufacturing costs. If we experience any of these results, or if maximum or available manufacturing\ncapacities are insufficient to meet demand, our and our partners’ development or commercialization efforts may be materially\nharmed.\nIf any of our linaclotide partners undergoes a change of control or in management, this may adversely affect our\ncollaborative relationship or the success of the commercialization of linaclotide in the U.S. or in the other countries where\nit is approved, or the ability to achieve regulatory approval, launch and commercialize linaclotide in other territories.\nWe work jointly and collaboratively with partners on many aspects of the development, manufacturing and/or\ncommercialization of linaclotide. In doing so, we have established relationships with several key members of the management\nteams of our linaclotide partners in functional areas such as development, quality, regulatory, drug safety and\npharmacovigilance, operations, marketing, sales, field operations and medical science. Further, the success of our\ncollaborations is highly dependent on the resources, efforts and skills of our partners and their key employees. As we and our\npartners develop and commercialize linaclotide in the U.S. and the other countries where it is approved, and develop, launch\nand commercialize linaclotide in other parts of the world, the drug’s success becomes more dependent on us maintaining\nhighly collaborative and well aligned partnerships. In May 2020, AbbVie announced the completion of its acquisition of\nAllergan plc. Our collaboration, now with AbbVie, for the development and commercialization of linaclotide in North\nAmerica, and our license, now to AbbVie, to develop and commercialize linaclotide in all countries worldwide other than\nChina (including Hong Kong and Macau) and Japan, remain in effect. In connection with this transaction, we continue to\nengage with AbbVie to reestablish relationships and confirm alignment, including on our development and commercialization\nstrategy for linaclotide. Any failure to do so could adversely affect the development and commercialization of linaclotide. If\nany of our linaclotide partners undergoes a change of control or in management, we would similarly need to reestablish many\nrelationships and confirm alignment, including on our development and commercialization strategy for linaclotide. Further, in\nconnection with any change of control or change in management, there is inherent uncertainty and disruption in operations,\nwhich could result in distraction, inefficiencies, and misalignment of priorities. As a result, in the event of a change of control\nor in management at one of our linaclotide partners, we cannot be sure that we will be able to successfully execute on our\ndevelopment and commercialization strategy for linaclotide in an effective and efficient manner and without disruption or\nreduced performance. Finally, any change of control or in management may result in a reprioritization of linaclotide within a\npartner’s portfolio, or such partner may fail to maintain the financial or other resources necessary to continue supporting its\nportion of the development, manufacturing or commercialization of linaclotide.\nIf any of our linaclotide partners undergoes a change of control and the acquirer either (i) is unable to perform such\npartner’s obligations under its collaboration or license agreement with us or (ii) does not comply with the divestiture or certain\nother provisions of the applicable agreement, we have the right to terminate the collaboration or license agreement and\nreacquire that partner’s rights with respect to linaclotide. If we elect to exercise these rights in such circumstances, we will\nneed to either establish the capability to develop, manufacture and commercialize\n41\nTable of Contents\nlinaclotide in that partnered territory on our own or we will need to establish a relationship with a new partner. We have\nassembled a team that represents the functional areas necessary to support the commercialization of LINZESS in the U.S. If\nAbbVie was subject to a change of control that allowed us to further commercialize LINZESS in the U.S. on our own, and we\nchose to do so, we would need to enhance each of these functional aspects, as well as develop others, to replace the\ncapabilities that AbbVie was previously providing to the collaboration. Any such transition might result in a period of reduced\nefficiency or performance by our operations and commercialization teams, which could adversely affect our ability to\ncommercialize LINZESS.\nWe do not have certain operational capabilities outside of the U.S. If AbbVie, Astellas or AstraZeneca was subject to\na change of control that allowed us to continue linaclotide’s development or commercialization anywhere outside of the U.S.\non our own, and we chose to do so rather than establishing a relationship with a new partner, we would need to build\noperational capabilities in the relevant territory. In any of these situations, the development and commercialization of\nlinaclotide could be negatively impacted.\nRisks Related to Regulatory, Legal and Compliance Matters\nWe face potential product liability exposure, and, if claims brought against us are successful, we could incur substantial\nliabilities.\nThe use of our product candidates in clinical trials and the sale of our approved products, including the sale of\nlinaclotide, expose us to product liability claims. If we do not successfully defend ourselves against product liability claims,\nwe could incur substantial liabilities. In addition, regardless of merit or eventual outcome, product liability claims may result\nin:\n● decreased demand for approved products;\n● impairment of our business reputation;\n● withdrawal of clinical trial participants;\n● initiation of investigations by regulators;\n● litigation costs;\n● distraction of management’s attention from our primary business;\n● substantial monetary awards to patients or other claimants;\n● loss of revenues; and\n● the inability to commercialize our product candidates.\nWe currently have product liability insurance coverage for the commercial sale of our products and for the clinical\ntrials of our product candidates which is subject to industry-standard terms, conditions and exclusions. Our insurance coverage\nmay not be sufficient to reimburse us for expenses or losses associated with claims. Moreover, insurance coverage is\nbecoming increasingly expensive, and, in the future, we may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost\nor in sufficient amounts to protect us against losses. On occasion, large judgments have been awarded in lawsuits based on\ndrugs that had unanticipated side effects. A successful product liability claim or series of claims could cause our stock price to\ndecline and, if judgments exceed our insurance coverage, could decrease our cash and adversely affect our business.\nWe will incur significant liability if it is determined that we are promoting any “off-label” uses of our products.\nPhysicians are permitted to prescribe drug products and medical devices for uses that are not described in the\nproduct’s labeling and that differ from those approved by the U.S. FDA or other applicable regulatory agencies. Such “off-\nlabel” uses are common across medical specialties. Although the U.S. FDA and other regulatory agencies do not regulate\n42\nTable of Contents\na physician’s choice of treatments, the U.S. FDA and other regulatory agencies do restrict manufacturer communications on\noff-label use. Companies are not permitted to promote drugs or medical devices for off-label uses or to promote unapproved\ndrugs or medical devices. Accordingly, we do not permit promotion of any product that we develop, license, commercialize,\npromote, co-promote or otherwise partner prior to approval or for any indication, population or use not described in or\nconsistent with such product’s labeling. The U.S. FDA and other regulatory and enforcement authorities actively enforce laws\nand regulations prohibiting promotion of off-label uses and the promotion of products for which marketing approval has not\nbeen obtained. A company that is found to have promoted off-label uses or have engaged in improper pre-approval promotion\nwill be subject to significant liability, including civil and administrative remedies as well as criminal sanctions. Even if it is\nlater determined that we were not in violation of these laws, we may be faced with negative publicity, incur significant\nexpenses defending our actions and have to divert significant management resources from other matters.\nNotwithstanding the regulatory restrictions on off-label promotion, the U.S. FDA and other regulatory authorities\nallow companies to engage in truthful, non-misleading, and non-promotional disease awareness and scientific exchange\nconcerning their products, investigational assets and therapeutic areas of interest. We intend to engage in disease awareness\nand medical and scientific exchange and education activities and communicate with healthcare providers in compliance with\nall applicable laws, regulatory guidance and industry best practices. Although we believe we have put in place a robust\ncompliance program, which is designed to ensure that all such activities are performed in a legal and compliant manner, we\ncannot be certain that our program will address all areas of potential exposure and the risks in this area cannot be entirely\neliminated.\nIf we fail to comply with healthcare and other regulations, we could face substantial penalties and our business, operations\nand financial condition could be adversely affected.\nThe marketing of pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical products and related arrangements with healthcare\nproviders, third-party payors, patients and other third parties in the healthcare industry are subject to a wide range of\nhealthcare laws and regulations within the U.S. and in foreign jurisdictions in which we operate. These laws and regulations\nmay constrain our business and/or financial arrangements. Within the U.S., federal laws and regulations include:\n● federal healthcare program anti-kickback laws, which prohibit, among other things, persons from offering,\nsoliciting, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce either the referral of an\nindividual for, or the purchasing or ordering of, a good or service for which payment may be made under federal\nhealthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid;\n● federal false claims laws which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting,\nor causing to be presented, information or claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid, or other third-party\npayors that are false or fraudulent, and which may apply to manufacturers for reasons including providing\ncoding and billing advice to customers or engaging in prohibited off-label promotional activities;\n● federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, which prohibits executing a scheme to\ndefraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters and which also\nimposes certain requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health\ninformation on certain types of entities, which include many healthcare providers with whom we interact and\nhealth plans with which we may interact;\n● the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, which among other things, strictly regulates drug product and\nmedical device marketing, prohibits manufacturers from marketing such products prior to approval or for off-\nlabel use and regulates the distribution of samples;\n● the 21st Century Cures Act, which amends Section 114 of the Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act\nof 1997 to define healthcare economic information and the circumstances under which healthcare economic\ninformation may be disseminated;\n● federal laws, including the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, that require pharmaceutical manufacturers to report\ncertain calculated product prices to the government or provide certain discounts or rebates to\n43\nTable of Contents\ngovernment authorities or private entities, often as a condition of reimbursement under government healthcare\nprograms; and\n● the so-called “federal sunshine” law, which requires pharmaceutical and medical device companies to monitor\nand report certain financial interactions with physicians, certain non-physician practitioners and teaching\nhospitals to the federal government for re-disclosure to the public; and\nThere are also state law equivalents of certain of the above federal laws, many of which differ from each other in\nsignificant ways and often are not preempted by federal laws, thus complicating compliance efforts, which laws include anti-\nkickback and false claims laws which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including\ncommercial insurers, state transparency laws, state laws limiting interactions between pharmaceutical manufacturers and\nmembers of the healthcare industry, and state laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain\ncircumstances.\nOther laws and regulations have also been enacted by various states to regulate the sales and marketing practices of\npharmaceutical or biopharmaceutical manufacturers. The laws and regulations generally limit financial interactions between\nmanufacturers and health care providers; require manufacturers to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary\ncompliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the U.S. federal government; and/or require\ndisclosure to the government and/or public of financial interactions (so-called “sunshine laws”). State laws may also require\ndisclosure of pharmaceutical pricing information and marketing expenditures. Certain state and local laws require the\nregistration of pharmaceutical sales representatives. Many of these laws and regulations contain ambiguous requirements or\nrequire administrative guidance for implementation.\nOutside the U.S., our activities may be subject to healthcare laws. For example, the provision of benefits or\nadvantages to physicians to induce or encourage the prescription, recommendation, endorsement, purchase, supply, order, or\nuse of medicinal products is prohibited in the E.U. The provision of benefits or advantages to physicians is also governed by\nthe national anti-bribery laws of E.U. Member States, and by Bribery Act 2010 in the United Kingdom Infringement of these\nlaws could result in substantial fines and imprisonment.\nPayments made to physicians in certain E.U. Member States must be publicly disclosed, and in the United Kingdom\na public consultation on the introduction of equivalent transparency requirements is currently underway. Moreover,\nagreements with physicians often must be the subject of prior notification and approval by the physician’s employer, his or her\ncompetent professional organization, and/or the regulatory authorities of the individual E.U. Member States and the United\nKingdom. These requirements are provided in the national laws, self-regulatory industry codes, or professional codes of\nconduct applicable in the E.U. Member States and the United Kingdom. Failure to comply with these requirements could\nresult in reputational risk, public reprimands, administrative penalties, fines, or imprisonment.\nWe also are subject to the FCPA which prohibits corporations and individuals from paying, offering to pay, or\nauthorizing the payment of anything of value to any foreign government official, government staff member, political party, or\npolitical candidate in an attempt to obtain or retain business or to otherwise influence a person working in an official capacity,\nrelated to any ex-U.S. activities, as well as other similar anti-bribery laws in any other country in which we may do business.\nWe are subject to stringent and changing U.S. and foreign laws, regulations, rules, contractual obligations, policies and\nother obligations related to data privacy and security. Our actual or perceived failure to comply with such obligations could\nlead to regulatory investigations or actions; litigation; fines and penalties; disruptions of our business operations;\nreputational harm; loss of revenue or profits; disruptions of our operating results and business; and other adverse business\nconsequences.\nWe may be subject to privacy and security laws in the various jurisdictions, both inside and outside the U.S., in which\nwe operate and/or obtain or store personally identifiable information, such as the E.U. GDPR, the United Kingdom’s GDPR\nand the Swiss Federal Act on Data Protection, or FADP. The legislative and regulatory landscape for privacy and data\nprotection continues to evolve, and there has been an increasing focus on privacy and data protection issues with the potential\nto affect our business. For example, the GDPR, which took effect in May 2018, applies to the processing of personal data in\nthe EEA. The GDPR increases obligations with respect to clinical trials conducted in the EEA, by certain companies that\nprocess data in relation to (i) offering goods or services to, or (ii) monitoring the behavior of, individuals located in the EEA.\nAs such, we would be subject to the GDPR for data processing associated,\n44\nTable of Contents\nfor example, with conducting clinical trials in the EEA or entering into research collaborations in the EEA. The GDPR\nimposes stringent obligations for processing of personal data, such as setting high standards for consent, requiring the\nprovision of detailed processing notices, facilitating the exercise of data subject rights and requiring reporting certain data\nbreaches to regulators and affected individuals, as well as establishing standards for how we document our relationships with\nthird parties that process GDPR-covered personal data on our behalf. The FADP also applies to the collection and processing\nof personal data by companies located in Switzerland, or in certain circumstances, by companies located outside of\nSwitzerland. The FADP has been revised and adopted by the Swiss Parliament and took effect on September 1, 2023. The\nrevisions to the FADP may result in increased costs of compliance, risks of noncompliance and penalties for noncompliance.\nThe GDPR, United Kingdom’s GDPR and FADP also increase the scrutiny applied to transfers of personal data from\nthe EEA, UK, and Switzerland, respectively (including from clinical trial sites in the EEA) to countries that are considered by\nthe European Commission, United Kingdom or Switzerland, respectively, to lack an adequate level of data protection, such as\nthe U.S. In July 2020 the Court of Justice of the E.U. (CJEU) invalidated the E.U.-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework, under\nwhich personal data could be transferred from the EEA to U.S. entities that had self-certified under the Privacy Shield scheme.\nThe framework has been replaced by the E.U.-U.S. Data Privacy Framework for which the European Commission adopted am\nadequacy decision in July 2023. While we do not currently rely upon this framework, we expect there to be legal challenges to\nthis framework in the future, which could draw into question the legitimacy of other cross-border transfer mechanism,\nincluding the standard contractual clauses on which we rely to transfer personal data from the EEA to the U.S. and other\njurisdictions. As supervisory authorities issue further guidance on personal data export mechanisms or where the standard\ncontractual clauses cannot be used, we could incur additional compliance costs, complaints, and/or regulatory investigations\nand, if we are unable to otherwise transfer personal data among jurisdictions in which we operate, our services and\ngeographical location or segregation of our relevant systems and operations could be affected.\nIn addition, in the U.S., we are subject to the California Consumer Privacy Act, or CCPA, as amended by the CPRA,\nwhich became effective on January 1, 2023 (the CPRA, together with CCPA, the California Privacy Law). The California\nPrivacy Law gives California consumers (defined to include all California residents) certain rights regarding personal\ninformation collected about them; the California Privacy Law also imposes certain obligations and limitations on companies\nregarding the collection, use, selling or sharing (as defined in the California Privacy Law) of personal information collected\nfrom or about California consumers.\nThe compliance obligations imposed by the GDPR, United Kingdom’s GDPR, FADP, the California Privacy Law,\nand other applicable privacy laws, have required us to revise our operations. Breaches of applicable data protection\nrequirements may result in substantial fines and other regulatory penalties, as well as confer a private right of action on data\nsubjects (in the case of the GDPR, UK GDPR and FADP) and consumers (in the case of the California Privacy Law) and their\nrepresentatives for breaches of certain data protection requirements. We expect to be subject to additional privacy laws at both\nthe U.S. state level and abroad as many jurisdictions either recently have data privacy legislation or are considering enacting\nsuch legislation to which we may become subject. Achieving and sustaining compliance with applicable international, federal\nand state privacy, security, fraud and reporting laws may prove time-consuming and costly.\nIf our operations, or the operations of third parties upon which we rely, are found to be in violation of any of the laws\ndescribed above or any other laws, rules or regulations that apply to us, we will be subject to penalties, including civil and\ncriminal penalties, damages, fines and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. For example, under the GDPR and\nthe United Kingdom’s GDPR, penalties for noncompliance could be up to 20 million Euros or 4% of our total worldwide\nannual revenue of the preceding financial year, whichever is greater. Any penalties, damages, fines, curtailment or\nrestructuring of our operations could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results. Although\ncompliance programs can mitigate the risk of investigation and prosecution for violations of these laws, rules or regulations,\nwe cannot be certain that our program will address all areas of potential exposure and the risks in this area cannot be entirely\neliminated, particularly because the requirements and government interpretations of the requirements in this space are\nconstantly evolving. Any action against us for violation of these laws, rules or regulations, even if we successfully defend\nagainst it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management’s attention from the operation of our\nbusiness, as well as damage our business or reputation.\n45\nTable of Contents\nHealthcare reform and other governmental and private payor initiatives may have an adverse effect upon, and could\nprevent, our products’ or product candidates’ commercial success.\nThe U.S. government and individual states have been aggressively pursuing healthcare reform designed to impact\ndelivery of, and/or payment for, healthcare, which include initiatives intended to reduce the cost of healthcare. For example, in\nMarch 2010, the U.S. Congress enacted the PPACA, as modified by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, or the\nACA, which, among other things, expanded healthcare coverage through Medicaid expansion and the implementation of the\nindividual health insurance mandate; included changes to the coverage and reimbursement of drug products under government\nhealthcare programs; imposed an annual fee on manufacturers of branded drugs; and expanded government enforcement\nauthority.\nBeyond the ACA, there have been ongoing legislative and administrative and other health care reform efforts, which\ncould have an adverse effect on our products’ or product candidates’ commercial success. Some healthcare reform efforts\naffect pricing or payment for drug products or the healthcare industry more generally. Drug pricing and payment reform was a\nfocus of the Trump Administration and has been a focus of the Biden Administration. For example, under the Trump\nAdministration, federal legislation increased the size of the discount on brand-name drugs that pharmaceutical manufacturers\nare required to offer Medicare beneficiaries who are in the Medicare Part D coverage gap, or “donut hole,” from 50 percent to\n70 percent. As another example, under the Biden Administration, federal legislation enacted in 2021 eliminates a statutory cap\non Medicaid drug rebate program rebates effective January 1, 2024. As another example, the IRA contains various drug\npricing and payment provisions. Among other provisions, the IRA imposes a yearly cap ($2,000 in 2025) on out-of-pocket\nprescription drug prices in Medicare Parts B and D. In addition, the IRA requires Medicare to negotiate prices for certain high-\ncost drugs and biologicals, including both physician-administered products covered under Medicare Part B benefit and self-\nadministered drugs covered under the Medicare Part D benefit. CMS annually selects a specified number of negotiation-\neligible drugs from those drugs with the highest total Medicare Part B or D expenditures over a preceding 12-month period.\nEligible drugs generally include single source brand-name drugs or biological products that have been on the market without\ntherapeutically-equivalent generic or biosimilar alternatives for a specified number of years with certain exceptions (e.g.,\norphan drugs indicated for only one rare disease or condition and drugs with less than $200 million in annual Medicare\nexpenditures). CMS will publish the negotiated price, known as the MFP for each of the selected products. Manufacturers of\nselected drugs would be required to offer the drug for Medicare recipients at the MFP. Manufacturers who fail to negotiate or\noffer the MFP can face significant civil money penalties or excise tax liability on sales of that drug. The first drugs were\nselected in 2023 and the MFP for those drugs will take effect in 2026. Only Medicare Part D drugs are selected for the first\ntwo years of the program (i.e., MFPs that take effect in 2026 and 2027). Depending on the share of Medicare spending each\nyear that is attributed to LINZESS or any other product candidate that we develop and whether or not those drugs become\neligible for Medicare negotiation, those drugs and our revenue may be adversely impacted by this provision.\nHealth care reform efforts have been and may continue to be subject to scrutiny and legal challenge. For example,\nwith respect to the ACA, tax reform legislation was enacted that eliminated the tax penalty established for individuals who do\nnot maintain mandated health insurance coverage beginning in 2019 and, in 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed the latest\njudicial challenge to the ACA brought by several states without specifically ruling on the constitutionality of the ACA. As\nanother example, revisions to regulations under the federal anti-kickback statute would remove protection for traditional\nMedicare Part D discounts offered by pharmaceutical manufacturers to pharmacy benefit managers and health plans. The\nrevisions were challenged in court and, pursuant to court order, the removal was delayed, and recent legislation imposed a\nmoratorium on implementation of the rule until January 2032. Certain pharmaceutical manufacturers and organizations have\nfiled lawsuits challenging the IRA drug price negotiation program. Adoption of new healthcare reform legislation at the\nfederal or state level could negatively affect demand for, or pricing of, our products or product candidates if approved for sale.\nIn addition, other legislative changes have been adopted that could have an adverse effect upon, and could prevent,\nour products’ or product candidates’ commercial success. For example, the Budget Control Act of 2011, as amended, or the\nBudget Control Act, includes provisions intended to reduce the federal deficit, including reductions in Medicare payments to\nproviders through 2032 (except May 1, 2020 to March 31, 2022). Any significant spending reductions affecting Medicare,\nMedicaid or other publicly funded or subsidized health programs, or any significant taxes or fees imposed as part of any\nbroader deficit reduction effort or legislative replacement to the Budget Control Act, or otherwise, could have an adverse\nimpact on our anticipated product revenues.\n46\nTable of Contents\nIn addition to governmental efforts in the U.S., foreign jurisdictions as well as private health insurers and managed\ncare plans are likely to continue challenging manufacturers’ ability to obtain reimbursement, as well as the level of\nreimbursement, for pharmaceuticals and other healthcare-related products and services. These cost-control initiatives could\nsignificantly decrease the available coverage and the price we might establish for our products, which would have an adverse\neffect on our financial results.\nThe Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007 also provides the U.S. FDA enhanced post- marketing\nauthority, including the authority to require post-marketing studies and clinical trials, labeling changes based on new safety\ninformation, and compliance with REMS approved by the U.S. FDA. The U.S. FDA’s exercise of this authority has resulted\n(and is expected to continue to result) in increased development-related costs following the commercial launch of our products\nand product candidates, and could result in potential restrictions on the sale and/or distribution of our products, even in such\nproducts’ approved indications and patient populations.\nThe VectivBio Acquisition increases our exposure to doing business in foreign jurisdictions.\nFollowing the VectivBio Acquisition, we retained VectivBio’s legacy headquarters in Basel, Switzerland and, as a\nresult, we now have employees and operations in foreign jurisdictions. Operating in foreign jurisdictions exposes us to\nadditional risks such as: fluctuations in currency exchange rates; compliance with different legal and regulatory environments;\nforeign regulatory regimes applicable to clinical trials and obtaining approvals for product candidates; compliance with\napplicable data privacy laws and regimes such as the E.U. GDPR, the United Kingdom’s GDPR and the Swiss Federal Act on\nData Protection; risk relating to the political and economic status of foreign governments; differences in the manner in which\ndifferent cultures do business; difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations; differences in financial reporting; and\noperating difficulties; among other factors. The realization of any of these risks, if severe enough, could have an adverse effect\non our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nRisks Related to Intellectual Property\nLimitations on our ability to obtain patent protection and/or the patent rights relating to our products and our product\ncandidates may limit our ability to prevent third parties from competing against us.\nOur success depends on our ability to obtain and maintain sufficient patent protection for our products and product\ncandidates, preserve our trade secrets, prevent third parties from infringing upon our proprietary rights and operate without\ninfringing upon the proprietary rights of others.\nThe strength of patents in the pharmaceutical industry involves complex legal and scientific questions and can be\nuncertain. Patent applications in the U.S. and most other countries are confidential for a period of time until they are\npublished, and publication of discoveries in scientific or patent literature typically lags actual discoveries by several months or\nmore. As a result, we cannot be certain that we were the first to conceive inventions covered by our patents and pending patent\napplications or that we were the first to file patent applications for such inventions. In addition, we cannot be certain that our\npatent applications will be granted, that any issued patents will adequately protect our intellectual property, or that such\npatents will not be challenged, narrowed, invalidated or circumvented.\nWe have several issued patents in the U.S. related to LINZESS, including a LINZESS composition of matter and\nmethods of use patent (U.S. Patent 7,304,036) expiring in 2026. Additional U.S. patents related to LINZESS include multiple\npatents relating to our commercial, room temperature stable formulations of the 72 mcg, 145 mcg and 290 mcg doses of\nlinaclotide and methods of using these formulations, the latest of which expires in the early 2030s, as well as other patents\ncovering processes for making LINZESS, formulations thereof, and molecules related to LINZESS.\nIn addition, we have exclusive rights to apraglutide including issued composition of matter and method of use patents\nin the U.S. in lead indications. We aim to maintain a strong and broad estate of patents in the U.S. and other geographic areas.\nTo this end, we have exclusively licensed 57 patents and 3 pending patent applications in the U.S., E.U., Japan, China and\nother jurisdictions protecting apraglutide. We also own one patent and 36 pending patent applications worldwide that cover\napraglutide, including ultrapure compositions, methods of manufacture and methods of use in various diseases including\naGvHD.\n47\nTable of Contents\nAlthough none of these issued patents currently is subject to a patent reexamination or review, we cannot guarantee\nthat they will not be subject to reexamination or review by the USPTO in the future. We believe in the strength of our\nLINZESS and apraglutide patent portfolio and that we have sufficient freedom to operate; however, if any of our present or\nfuture patents is challenged, narrowed, invalidated or circumvented, or our pending patent applications are not granted, our\nability to prevent third parties from competing with LINZESS or apraglutide could be limited and our business and financial\nresults may be materially harmed.\nFurthermore, the America Invents Act, which was signed into law in 2011, has made several major changes in the\nU.S. patent statutes. These changes permit third parties to challenge our patents more easily and create uncertainty with\nrespect to the interpretation and practice of U.S. patent law. Moreover, the U.S. Supreme Court has ruled on several patent\ncases that narrow the scope of patent protection available and weakening the rights of patent owners in certain circumstances.\nDepending on the impact of these decisions and other actions by the U.S. Congress, the federal courts, the USPTO, and their\nforeign counterparts, the laws and regulations governing patents may change, or their interpretation or implementation may\nchange, in unpredictable ways that could impact, potentially adversely, our ability to obtain new patents or to enforce and\ndefend patents that we have already obtained or that we might obtain in the future. For example, such changes may increase\nthe costs and complexity associated with obtaining, enforcing or defending our patents, including in ANDA litigation.\nWe also rely upon unpatented trade secrets, unpatented know-how and continuing technological innovation to\ndevelop and maintain our competitive position, which we seek to protect, in part, by confidentiality agreements with our\nemployees and our partners and consultants. We also have agreements with our employees and selected consultants that\nobligate them to assign their inventions to us. It is possible, however, that technology relevant to our business will be\nindependently developed by a person that is not a party to such an agreement. Furthermore, if the employees and consultants\nthat are parties to these agreements breach or violate the terms of these agreements, we may not have adequate remedies, and\nwe could lose our trade secrets through such breaches or violations. Additionally, our trade secrets could otherwise become\nknown or be independently discovered by our competitors.\nIn addition, the laws of certain foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent or in the same\nmanner as the U.S., and, therefore, we or our partners may encounter problems in protecting and defending our intellectual\nproperty in certain foreign jurisdictions.\nIf we are sued for infringing intellectual property rights of third parties, it will be costly and time consuming, and an\nunfavorable outcome in such litigation could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur commercial success depends on our ability, and the ability of our partners, to develop, manufacture, market and\nsell our products and use our proprietary technologies without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties.\nNumerous U.S. and foreign issued patents and pending patent applications, which are owned by third parties, exist in the\nfields in which we and our partners are developing products. As the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industry expands and\nmore patents are issued, the risk increases that our potential products may give rise to claims of infringement of the patent\nrights of others. There may be issued patents of third parties of which we are currently unaware that may be infringed by\nLINZESS, apraglutide, or our product candidates. Because patent applications can take many years to issue, there may be\ncurrently pending applications which may later result in issued patents that LINZESS, apraglutide, or our product candidates\nmay infringe.\nWe may be exposed to, or threatened with, litigation by third parties alleging that LINZESS, apraglutide, or our\nproduct candidates infringe their intellectual property rights. If LINZESS, apraglutide, or one of our product candidates is\nfound to infringe the intellectual property rights of a third party, we or our partners could be enjoined by a court and required\nto pay damages and could be unable to develop or commercialize LINZESS, apraglutide, or the applicable product candidate\nunless we obtain a license to the intellectual property rights. A license may not be available to us on acceptable terms, if at all.\nIn addition, during litigation, the counterparty could obtain a preliminary injunction or other equitable relief which could\nprohibit us from making, using or selling our products, pending a trial on the merits, which may not occur for several years.\n48\nTable of Contents\nThere is a substantial amount of litigation involving patent and other intellectual property rights in the biotechnology\nand pharmaceutical industries generally. If a third party claims that we or our partners infringe its intellectual property rights,\nwe may face a number of issues, including, but not limited to:\n● infringement and other intellectual property claims which, regardless of merit, may be expensive and time-\nconsuming to litigate and may divert our management’s attention from our core business;\n● substantial damages for infringement, which we may have to pay if a court decides that the product at issue\ninfringes on or violates the third party’s rights, and, if the court finds that the infringement was willful, we could\nbe ordered to pay treble damages and the patent owner’s attorneys’ fees;\n● a court prohibiting us from selling our product unless the third party licenses its rights to us, which it is not\nrequired to do;\n● if a license is available from a third party, we may have to pay substantial royalties, fees or grant cross- licenses\nto our intellectual property rights; and\n● redesigning our products so they do not infringe, which may not be possible or may require substantial monetary\nexpenditures and time.\nIf we fail to comply with our obligations or have disagreements over contract interpretation in agreements under which we\nlicense intellectual property and other rights from third parties or otherwise experience disruptions to our business\nrelationship with our licensor, the scope of our intellectual property or technology rights could be narrowed and we could\nlose license rights that are important to our business.\nLicensing of intellectual property is of critical importance to our business and involves complex legal, business, and\nscientific issues. Disputes may arise regarding intellectual property subject to a licensing agreement, including but not limited\nto:\n● the scope of rights granted under the license agreement and other interpretation-related issues;\n● the extent to which our technology and processes infringe intellectual property of the licensor that is not subject\nto the licensing agreement;\n● the sublicensing of patent and other rights;\n● our diligence obligations under the license agreement and what activities satisfy those diligence obligations;\n● the ownership of inventions and know-how resulting from the joint creation or use of intellectual property by\nour licensors, our collaborators and us;\n● the priority of invention of patented technology; and\n● the fulfilment of our obligations under the license.\nIn addition, certain provisions in such agreements may be susceptible to multiple interpretations. The resolution of\nany contract interpretation disagreement that may arise could narrow what we believe to be the scope of our rights to the\nrelevant intellectual property or technology, or increase what we believe to be our financial or other obligations under the\nrelevant agreement, either of which could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. If our\nlicenses or material relationships or any in-licenses upon which our licenses are based are terminated or breached, we may:\n● lose our rights to develop and market product candidates;\n● lose patent protection for product candidates;\n49\nTable of Contents\n● experience significant delays in the development or commercialization of product candidates;\n● not be able to obtain any other licenses on acceptable terms, if at all; or\n● incur liability for damages.\nApraglutide is among the assets that are subject to licensing agreements with third parties. If disputes over\nintellectual property and other rights that we have licensed prevent or impair our ability to maintain our current licensing\narrangements on acceptable terms, we may be unable to successfully develop and commercialize apraglutide.\nWe are currently a party to and may in the future be party to license agreements. For example, we are a party to an\namended and restated intellectual property license agreement with Ferring pursuant to which we have exclusive rights to\napraglutide including issued composition of matter and method of use patents in the U.S. in lead indications, or the Ferring\nAgreement. The Ferring Agreement imposes, and other current or future license agreements may impose, various diligence,\nmilestone payment, royalty, and other obligations on us. These milestone, royalty, and other payments associated with the\nlicense, will make it less profitable for us to develop apraglutide or other product candidates that are the subject of current or\nfuture licenses. If we fail to comply with our obligations under the Ferring Agreement, or we are subject to a bankruptcy, we\nmay be required to make certain payments to Ferring, we may lose the exclusivity of our license, or Ferring may have the\nright to terminate the license. If the Ferring Agreement is terminated, we could lose intellectual property rights that are\nimportant to our business, be liable for damages to the licensor or be prevented from developing and commercializing our\napraglutide. Termination of the agreement or reduction or elimination of our rights under the agreement may also result in us\nbeing required to negotiate a new or reinstated agreement with less favorable terms, and it is possible that we may be unable to\nobtain any such additional license at a reasonable cost or on reasonable terms and will be unable to develop and\ncommercialize apraglutide. These or similar risks may apply to other license agreements, including future license agreements.\nIn some cases, patent prosecution of our licensed technology is controlled solely by the licensor. If our licensor fails\nto obtain or maintain a patent or other protection for the proprietary intellectual property we license from them, we could lose\nour rights to the intellectual property or our exclusivity with respect to those rights, and our competitors could market\ncompeting products using the intellectual property. In certain cases, we control the prosecution of patents resulting from\nlicensed technology. In the event we breach any of our obligations related to such prosecution, we may incur significant\nliability to our licensing partners.\nWe have received notices of Paragraph IV certifications related to LINZESS in conjunction with ANDAs filed by generic\ndrug manufacturers, and we may receive additional notices from others in the future. We have, and may continue to,\nbecome involved in legal proceedings to protect or enforce intellectual property rights relating to our products and our\nproduct candidates, which could be expensive and time consuming, and unfavorable outcomes in such proceedings could\nhave a material adverse effect on our business.\nCompetitors may infringe the patents relating to our products and our product candidates or may assert that such\npatents are invalid. To counter ongoing or potential infringement or unauthorized use, we may be required to file infringement\nclaims, which can be expensive and time-consuming. Litigation with generic manufacturers has become increasingly common\nin the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries. In addition, in an infringement or invalidity proceeding, a court or patent\nadministrative body may determine that a patent of ours is not valid or is unenforceable, or may refuse to stop the other party\nfrom using the technology at issue on the grounds that our patents do not cover the technology in question.\nGeneric drug manufacturers were first able to file ANDAs for generic versions of LINZESS in August 2016. When\nfiling an ANDA for one of our products, a generic drug manufacturer may choose to challenge one or more of the patents that\ncover such product and seek to commercialize generic versions of one or more LINZESS doses. As such, we have brought,\nand may bring in the future, legal proceedings against generic drug manufacturers.\nWe and AbbVie have received Paragraph IV certification notice letters regarding ANDAs submitted to the U.S. FDA\nby generic drug manufacturers requesting approval to engage in commercial manufacture, use, sale and offer for sale of\nlinaclotide capsules (72 mcg, 145 mcg and 290 mcg), proposed generic versions of our U.S. FDA-approved drug\n50\nTable of Contents\nLINZESS. We filed patent infringement lawsuits against five companies making such ANDA filings and subsequently entered\ninto settlement agreements with each of these filers. Frequently, innovators receive multiple ANDA filings. Consequently, we\nmay receive additional notice letters regarding ANDAs submitted to the U.S. FDA (and we may receive amendments to those\nnotice letters), but we may not become aware of these filings for several months after any such submission due to procedures\nspecified under applicable U.S. FDA regulations.\nAfter evaluation, we have in the past filed, and may, in the future, file patent infringement lawsuits or take other\naction against companies making ANDA filings. If a patent infringement suit has been filed within 45 days of receipt of a\nnotice letter, the U.S. FDA is not permitted to approve any ANDA that is the subject of such lawsuit for 30 months from the\ndate of the NDA holder’s and patent owner’s receipt of the ANDA filer’s notice letter, or until a court decides that the relevant\npatents are invalid, unenforceable and/or not infringed. Additionally, the validity of the patents relating to our products and\nour product candidates may be challenged by third parties pursuant to administrative procedures introduced by the America\nInvents Act, specifically inter partes review, or IPR, and/or post grant review, or PGR, before the USPTO. Generic drug\nmanufacturers may challenge our patents through IPRs or PGRs instead of or in addition to ANDA legal proceedings.\nPatent litigation (including any lawsuits that we file against generic drug manufacturers in connection with the\nreceipt of a notice letter), IPRs and PGRs involve complex legal and factual questions and we may need to devote significant\nresources to such legal proceedings. We can provide no assurance concerning the duration or the outcome of any such patent-\nrelated lawsuits or administrative proceedings, including any settlements or other resolutions thereof which could, in addition\nto other risks, result in a shortening of exclusivity periods. An adverse result in any litigation or defense proceedings could put\none or more of the patents relating to our products and our product candidates at risk of being invalidated or interpreted\nnarrowly, or could otherwise result in a loss of patent protection for the product or product candidate at issue, and could put\nour patent applications at risk of not issuing, which would materially harm our business. Upon any loss of patent protection\nfor one of our products, or upon an “at-risk” launch (despite pending patent infringement litigation, before any court decision\nor while an appeal of a lower court decision is pending) by a manufacturer of a generic version of one of our patented\nproducts, our revenues for that product could be significantly reduced in a short period of time, which would materially and\nadversely affect our business.\nInterference or derivation proceedings brought by the USPTO may be necessary to determine the priority of\ninventions with respect to the patents relating to our products and our product candidates and patent applications or those of\nour partners. An unfavorable outcome could require us to cease using the technology or to attempt to license rights to it from\nthe prevailing party. Our business could be harmed if a prevailing party does not offer us a license on terms that are acceptable\nto us. Litigation or interference proceedings may fail and, even if successful, may result in substantial costs and distraction of\nour management and other employees. In addition, we may not be able to prevent, alone or with our partners,\nmisappropriation of our proprietary rights, particularly in countries where the laws may not protect those rights as fully as in\nthe U.S.\nFurthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property\nlitigation, as well as the potential for public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceeding or\ndevelopments, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of\nlitigation.\nRisks Related to Our Finances and Capital Requirements\nWe incurred significant losses from our inception in 1998 through the year ended December 31, 2018, and we may incur\nlosses in future periods.\nIn recent years, we have focused primarily on developing, manufacturing and commercializing linaclotide, as well as\ndeveloping our other product candidates. For example, in June 2023, we acquired VectivBio and added apraglutide, a next\ngeneration long-acting GLP-2 analog, in development for the treatment of patients with SBS-IF, to our pipeline. We have\nfinanced our business to date primarily through the issuance of equity, our collaboration and license arrangements, and debt\nissuances, including our August 2019 issuance of the $200.0 million aggregate principal amount of Convertible Senior Notes,\nbearing an interest of 0.75% and due in 2024, or the 2024 Convertible Notes, the $200.0 million aggregate principal amount of\nConvertible Senior Notes, bearing an interest of 1.50% and due in 2026, or the 2026 Convertible Notes (together with the\n2024 Convertible Notes, the Convertible Senior Notes), and our four-year $500.0 million secured revolving credit facility, or\nthe Revolving Credit Facility. We currently derive a significant\n51\nTable of Contents\nportion of our revenue from our LINZESS collaboration with AbbVie for the U.S. We believe that the revenues from the\nLINZESS collaboration will continue to constitute a significant portion of our total revenue for the foreseeable future. Such\nrevenue is highly dependent on LINZESS demand and other factors such as fluctuations in retail chains’ and wholesalers’\nbuying patterns and inventory levels, pricing and reimbursement. Our collaborative arrangements revenue outside of the U.S.\nhas and may continue to fluctuate as a result of the timing and amount of royalties from sales of linaclotide in the markets in\nwhich it is currently approved, or any other markets where linaclotide receives approval, as well as clinical and commercial\nmilestones received and recognized under our current and future strategic partnerships outside of the U.S.\nPrior to the year ended December 31, 2019, we incurred net losses in each year since our inception in 1998. As of\nDecember 31, 2023, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $1.7 billion. We cannot be certain that sales of our\nproducts, and the revenue from our other commercial activities will not fall short of our projections or be delayed. Further, we\nexpect to continue to incur substantial expenses in connection with our efforts to commercialize linaclotide, research and\ndevelop our product candidates, and access externally developed products or product candidates. Because of the numerous\nrisks and uncertainties associated with developing and commercializing pharmaceutical products, as well as those related to\nour expectations for our products and our other activities, we are unable to predict the extent of any future losses. Failure to\nachieve sustainable net income and maintain positive cash flows would have an adverse effect on stockholders’ equity and\nworking capital.\nWe may need additional funding and may be unable to raise capital when needed, which could cause us to delay, reduce or\neliminate our corporate or product development or commercialization efforts.\nWe have previously raised funds to finance our operations through capital raising activities, including the sale of\nshares of our Class A Common Stock in public offerings and convertible and other debt issuances. However, marketing and\nselling gastrointestinal drugs, purchasing commercial quantities of pharmaceutical products, developing product candidates,\nconducting clinical trials and accessing externally developed products or product candidates are expensive and uncertain.\nCircumstances, our strategic imperatives, or opportunities to create or acquire new programs, as well as maturities,\nredemptions or repurchases of our outstanding debt securities, could require us to, or we may choose to, seek to raise\nadditional funds. The amount and timing of our future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including, but not\nlimited to:\n● the level of underlying demand for our products by prescribers and patients in the countries in which they are\napproved;\n● the costs associated with commercializing our products in the U.S.;\n● the costs of establishing, maintaining and/or expanding sales, marketing, distribution, and market access\ncapabilities for our products;\n● the regulatory approval of linaclotide within new indications, populations and formulations, as well as the\nassociated development and commercial milestones and royalties;\n● the rate of progress, the cost of our clinical trials and the other costs associated with our development programs,\nincluding our clinical trial of apraglutide in adult patients with SBS-IF, post-approval nonclinical and clinical\nstudies of linaclotide in pediatrics and our investment to enhance the clinical profile of LINZESS within IBS-C\nand CIC, as well as to study linaclotide in additional indications, populations and formulations to assess its\npotential to treat various conditions;\n● the costs and timing of in-licensing additional products or product candidates or acquiring other complementary\ncompanies or assets;\n● the achievement and timing of milestone payments and royalties due or payable under our collaboration and\nlicense agreements;\n● the status, terms and timing of any collaboration, licensing, co-commercialization or other arrangements;\n● the timing of any regulatory approvals of apraglutide and our other product candidates;\n52\nTable of Contents\n● whether the holders of our Convertible Senior Notes hold the notes to maturity without conversion into our\nClass A Common Stock or cash and whether we are required to repurchase any of our Convertible Senior Notes\nprior to maturity upon a fundamental change, as defined in each of the indentures governing the Convertible\nSenior Notes; and\n● whether we seek to redeem, repurchase or retire all or part of our outstanding debt through cash purchases and/or\nexchanges, in open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, by tender offer or otherwise.\nAdditional funding may not be available on acceptable terms or at all. If adequate funds are not available, we may be\nrequired to delay or reduce the scope of our commercialization efforts, delay, reduce or eliminate one or more of our\ndevelopment programs or delay or abandon potential strategic opportunities.\nOur ability to pay principal of and interest on our outstanding debt will depend in part on the receipt of payments from\nAbbVie under our collaboration agreement for North America.\nSemi-annual payments on our Convertible Senior Notes began in December 2019. In addition, in May 2023, we\nentered into the Revolving Credit Facility. As of December 31, 2023, the outstanding principal balance on the Revolving\nCredit Facility was $300.0 million. We expect that for the next few years, at a minimum, the net quarterly payments from\nAbbVie will be a significant source of cash flows from operations. If the cash flows derived from the net quarterly payments\nthat we receive from AbbVie under the collaboration agreement for North America are insufficient on any particular payment\ndate to fund the interest payment on our outstanding indebtedness, at a minimum, we will be obligated to pay the amounts of\nsuch shortfall out of our general funds. The determination of whether AbbVie will be obligated to make a net quarterly\npayment to us in respect of a particular quarterly period is a function of the revenue generated by LINZESS in the U.S. as well\nas the development, manufacturing and commercialization expenses incurred by each of us and AbbVie under the\ncollaboration agreement for North America. Accordingly, since we cannot guarantee that our company will maintain net\nincome or positive cash flows, we cannot provide assurances for any particular quarterly period that (i) we will have the\navailable funds to fund the interest payment on our outstanding indebtedness, at a minimum, in the event that there is a\ndeficiency in the net quarterly payment received from AbbVie, (ii) there will be a net quarterly payment from AbbVie at all or\n(iii) we will not also be required to make a true-up payment to AbbVie under the collaboration agreement for North America.\nOur indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition or restrict our future operations.\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had total indebtedness of $700.0 million and available cash and cash equivalents of\n$92.2 million.\nWe incurred significant new indebtedness in connection with the VectivBio Acquisition. In May 2023, we entered\ninto the Revolving Credit Facility, which includes a $10.0 million letter of credit subfacility. In June 2023, we borrowed\n$400.0 million to fund a portion of the consideration paid to purchase VectivBio’s outstanding ordinary shares in connection\nwith the VectivBio Acquisition. As of December 31, 2023, we have repaid $100.0 million of the outstanding principal balance.\nThe agreement governing the Revolving Credit Facility, or the Revolving Credit Agreement, contains certain\ncovenants applicable to us and certain of our subsidiaries that may, under certain circumstances, impose significant operating\nand financial restrictions on us, including, without limitation, limitations on additional indebtedness, liens, various\nfundamental changes, dividends and distributions, investments (including acquisitions), transactions with affiliates, asset sales,\nprepayment of junior financing, changes in business and other limitations customary in senior secured credit facilities. The\nRevolving Credit Agreement also includes cross-default features providing that defaults under certain other indebtedness\nwould result in a default under the Revolving Credit Agreement. In addition, the Revolving Credit Agreement requires us to\nmaintain a maximum consolidated secured net leverage ratio of 3.00 to 1.00 and a minimum interest coverage ratio of 3.00 to\n1.00, in each case at the end of each fiscal quarter. The Revolving Credit Agreement allows us to elect to increase the\npermitted maximum consolidated secured net leverage ratio to 3.50 to 1.00 for four fiscal quarters in the event we\nconsummate an acquisition for consideration in excess of $50 million, subject to certain limitations on how often this election\ncan be made. Additionally, the lenders under the Revolving\n53\nTable of Contents\nCredit Agreement will be permitted to accelerate all outstanding borrowings and other obligations, terminate outstanding\ncommitments and exercise other specified remedies upon the occurrence of customary events of default.\nIn addition, while none of the indentures governing our Convertible Senior Notes include covenants restricting the\noperation of our business except in certain limited circumstances, in the event of a default under any of the Convertible Senior\nNotes, the applicable noteholders or the trustee under the indenture governing the applicable Convertible Senior Notes may\naccelerate our payment obligations under such Convertible Senior Notes, which could have a material adverse effect on our\nbusiness, financial condition and results of operations. We are also required to offer to repurchase the Convertible Senior\nNotes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change, which could include, among other things, any acquisition of our\ncompany (other than an acquisition in which at least 90% of the consideration is Class A Common Stock listed on The Nasdaq\nGlobal Select Market or The New York Stock Exchange), subject to the terms of each of the indenture governing the\nConvertible Senior Notes. The repurchase price must be paid in cash, and this obligation may have the effect of discouraging,\ndelaying or preventing an acquisition of our company that would otherwise be beneficial to our security holders.\nEach of the indentures governing our Convertible Senior Notes also includes cross-default features providing that\ncertain failures to pay for outstanding indebtedness would result in a default under the indentures governing our Convertible\nSenior Notes. In the event of such default, the trustee or noteholders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding to be\nimmediately due and payable under the applicable indenture, which could have a material adverse effect on our business,\nfinancial condition and results of operations.\nTo the extent we become subject to such covenants, our ability to comply with such covenants in future periods will\ndepend on our ongoing financial and operating performance, which in turn will be subject to economic conditions and to\nfinancial, market and competitive factors, many of which are beyond our control. The ability to comply with these covenants\nin future periods will also depend on our ability to successfully implement our overall business strategy and realize the\nanticipated benefits of the VectivBio Acquisition, including synergies, cost savings, innovation and operational efficiencies.\nOur significant indebtedness, combined with our other financial obligations and contractual commitments, could\nhave important consequences on our business, including:\n● limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital, capital expenditures or other\ngeneral corporate purposes, including product development, commercialization efforts, research and\ndevelopment activities, strategic arrangements, acquisitions and refinancing of our outstanding debt;\n● requiring a substantial portion of our cash flows to be dedicated to debt service payments instead of other\npurposes, thereby reducing the amount of cash flows available for working capital, capital expenditures,\ncorporate transactions and other general corporate purposes;\n● increasing our vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic, industry and competitive conditions;\n● limiting our flexibility in planning for and reacting to changes in the industry in which we compete;\n● placing us at a disadvantage compared to other, less leveraged competitors or competitors with comparable debt\nat more favorable interest rates; and\n● increasing our cost of borrowing.\nIf we do not generate sufficient cash flows from operations or if future borrowings are not available to us in an\namount sufficient to service our indebtedness, including payments of principal when due on our outstanding indebtedness or,\nin the case of our Convertible Senior Notes, in connection with a transaction involving us that constitutes a fundamental\nchange under the indentures governing the Convertible Senior Notes, or under our Revolving Credit Facility, or to fund our\nliquidity needs, we may be forced to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before the maturity dates thereof, sell\nassets, reduce or delay currently planned activities or curtail operations, seek to raise additional capital or take other actions.\nWe may not be able to execute any of these actions on commercially reasonable terms or at all. This, together with any of the\nfactors described above, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n54\nTable of Contents\nThe capped call transactions entered into in connection with our 2024 Convertible Notes and our 2026 Convertible Notes\nmay affect the value of our Class A Common Stock.\nIn connection with the issuance of our 2024 Convertible Notes and our 2026 Convertible Notes, we entered into\ncapped call transactions, or the Capped Calls, with certain financial institutions. These transactions are expected generally to\nreduce the potential dilution upon any conversion of our 2024 Convertible Notes or our 2026 Convertible Notes, as applicable,\nor offset any cash payments we are required to make in excess of the principal amount of converted Convertible Senior Notes,\nas the case may be.\nIn connection with these transactions, the financial institutions likely purchased our Class A Common Stock in\nsecondary market transactions and entered into various OTC derivative transactions with respect to our Class A Common\nStock. These entities or their affiliates are likely to modify their hedge positions from time to time prior to conversion or\nmaturity of the 2024 Convertible Notes and the 2026 Convertible Notes, as applicable, by purchasing and selling shares of our\nClass A Common Stock or other instruments they may wish to use in connection with such hedging. Any of these activities\ncould adversely affect the value of our Class A Common Stock and, as a result, the number of shares and the value of the\nClass A Common Stock noteholders will receive upon conversion of the 2024 Convertible Notes, or the 2026 Convertible\nNotes, as applicable. In addition, under certain circumstances the counterparties have the right to terminate the Capped Calls\non terms set forth in the applicable confirmations, which may result in us not receiving all or any portion of the anticipated\nbenefit of the Capped Calls. If the price of our Class A Common Stock increases such that the hedge transactions settle in our\nfavor, we could also be exposed to credit risk related to the counterparties to the Capped Calls, which would limit or eliminate\nthe benefit of such transactions to us.\nOur quarterly and annual operating results may fluctuate significantly.\nWe expect our operating results to be subject to frequent fluctuations. Our net income (loss) and other operating\nresults will be affected by numerous factors, including:\n● the level of underlying demand and price for our products in the countries in which they are approved;\n● retail chains’ and wholesalers’ buying patterns, pricing and reimbursement and inventory levels with respect to\nour products;\n● the costs associated with commercializing our products in the U.S.;\n● the achievement and timing of milestone payments and royalties due or payable under our collaboration and\nlicense agreements;\n● our execution of any collaboration, partnership, licensing or other strategic arrangements, and the timing of\npayments we may make or receive under these arrangements;\n● any impairments of assets or goodwill, and associated write-downs;\n● any variations in the level of expenses related to our development programs;\n● addition or termination of clinical trials;\n● any impact on taxes or changes in tax rules;\n● regulatory developments affecting our products and product candidates;\n● any material lawsuit in which we may become involved; and\n● the impact of public health emergencies, including containment or mitigation measures, or natural disasters.\n55\nTable of Contents\nIf our operating results fall below the expectations of investors or securities analysts for any of the foregoing reasons\nor otherwise, the price of our Class A Common Stock could decline substantially. Furthermore, any quarterly or annual\nfluctuations in our operating results may, in turn, cause the price of our stock to fluctuate substantially.\nOur ability to use net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards and certain built-in losses to reduce future tax payments\nis limited by provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, and it is possible that our net operating loss and tax credit\ncarryforwards may expire before we generate sufficient taxable income to use such carryforwards, or that certain\ntransactions or a combination of certain transactions may result in material additional limitations on our ability to use our\nnet operating loss and tax credit carryforwards.\nPrior to the year ended December 31, 2019, we incurred significant net losses since our inception. To the extent that\nwe do not generate federal and state taxable income in the future, unused net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards will\ncarry forward to offset future taxable income, if any, until the date, if any, on which such unused carryforwards expire.\nSections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, contain rules that limit the ability of a company that\nundergoes an ownership change, which is generally any change in ownership of more than 50% of its stock over a three-year\nperiod, to utilize its net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards and certain built-in losses recognized in years after the\nownership change. These rules generally operate by focusing on ownership changes involving stockholders owning directly or\nindirectly 5% or more of the stock of a company and any change in ownership arising from a new issuance of stock by the\ncompany. Generally, if an ownership change occurs, the yearly taxable income limitation on the use of net operating loss and\ntax credit carryforwards and certain built-in losses is equal to the product of the applicable long-term tax exempt rate and the\nvalue of the company’s stock immediately before the ownership change. Certain future equity offerings or strategic\ntransactions, if any, could potentially result in a 50% or greater change of control.\nIf we do not generate sufficient taxable income prior to the expiration, if any, of the applicable carryforwards or if the\ncarryforwards are subject to the limitations described above, we may be unable to offset our taxable income with losses, or our\ntax liability with credits, before such losses and credits expire and therefore would incur larger federal or state income tax\nliability. We have completed several financings since our inception which may have resulted in a change in control as defined\nby Section 382, or could result in a change in control in the future.\nOur ability to use foreign tax loss carryforwards acquired in the VectivBio Acquisition may be limited.\nPrior to our acquisition of VectivBio, VectivBio incurred significant net losses since its inception. In Switzerland, tax\nloss carryforwards may, with certain limitations, be used to offset future taxable income. However, if not utilized, the tax loss\ncarryforwards, under Swiss laws, expire seven years after the tax year in which they were incurred. Due to our current limited\nincome in Switzerland, there is a high risk that the tax loss carryforwards will expire in part or in their entirety and will not be\nused to offset future taxable income. Any limitations in our ability to use tax loss carryforwards to offset taxable income could\nadversely affect our financial condition.\nIf the distribution of the shares of Cyclerion Therapeutics, Inc., or Cyclerion, common stock in connection with the\nSeparation is not generally tax- free for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we and our stockholders could be subject to\nsignificant tax liabilities.\nThe distribution, together with certain related transactions, is intended to qualify for tax-free treatment to us and our\nstockholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes. We received a favorable private letter ruling from the Internal Revenue\nService, or IRS, under the pilot program established in Revenue Procedure 2017-52 relating to the U.S. federal income tax\ntreatment of the distribution. Consistent with the guidelines set forth in Revenue Procedure 2017-52, the IRS private letter\nruling does not cover all of the issues that are relevant to determining whether the distribution is generally tax free for U.S.\nfederal income tax purposes. Accordingly, completion of the distribution was conditioned upon, among other things, our\nreceipt of an opinion from an outside tax advisor that the distribution will qualify as a transaction that is generally tax-free to\nboth us and our stockholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Sections 355 and 368(a)(1)(D) of the Internal\nRevenue Code. The private letter ruling and opinion were based on and relied on, among other things, certain facts and\nassumptions, as well as certain representations, statements and undertakings from us and Cyclerion (including those relating to\nthe past and future conduct of us and Cyclerion). If any of these facts, assumptions, representations, statements or\nundertakings is, or becomes, inaccurate or incomplete, or if we or Cyclerion breach any of our respective covenants relating to\nthe distribution, the IRS private letter ruling and any tax opinion may be invalid. Moreover, the opinion is not binding on the\nIRS or any courts. Accordingly, notwithstanding receipt of the\n56\nTable of Contents\nIRS private letter ruling and the opinion, the IRS could determine that the distribution and certain related transactions should\nbe treated as taxable transactions for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\nIf the distribution, together with certain related transactions, fails to qualify as a transaction that is generally tax-free\nunder Sections 355 and 368(a)(1)(D) of the Internal Revenue Code, in general, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we\nwould recognize taxable gain with respect to Cyclerion’s distributed common stock and our stockholders who received shares\nof Cyclerion common stock in the distribution would be subject to tax as if they had received a taxable distribution equal to\nthe fair market value of such shares.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nWe may not be able to manage our business effectively if we lose any of our current management team or if we are unable\nto attract, motivate and retain key personnel.\nWe may not be able to attract, motivate or retain qualified management and scientific, clinical, operations and\ncommercial personnel due to the intense competition for qualified personnel among biotechnology, pharmaceutical and other\nbusinesses, particularly in the greater-Boston area. If we are not able to attract, motivate and retain necessary personnel to\naccomplish our business objectives, we will experience constraints that will significantly impede the achievement of our\nobjectives.\nWe are highly dependent on the drug research, development, regulatory, commercial, financial and other expertise of\nour management, particularly Thomas McCourt, our chief executive officer; Sravan Emany, our senior vice president, chief\nfinancial officer; Andrew Davis, our senior vice president, chief business officer; John Minardo, our senior vice president,\nchief legal officer and secretary; and Michael Shetzline, our senior vice president, chief medical officer and head of research\nand drug development. Transitions in our senior management team or other key employees, or the unavailability of any such\npersons for any reason, can be inherently difficult to manage and may disrupt our operations or business or otherwise harm\nour business, for example due to the diversion of our board and management’s time and attention and a decline in employee\nmorale. In addition to the competition for personnel, the Boston area in particular is characterized by a high cost of living. As\nsuch, we could have difficulty attracting experienced personnel to our company and may be required to expend significant\nfinancial resources in our employee recruitment efforts, which may or may not be successful.\nWe also have scientific and clinical advisors who assist us in formulating our product development, clinical strategies\nand our global supply chain plans, as well as sales and marketing advisors who have assisted us in our commercialization\nstrategy and brand plan for our products. These advisors are not our employees and may have commitments to, or consulting\nor advisory contracts with, other entities that may limit their availability to us, or may have arrangements with other\ncompanies to assist in the development and commercialization of products that may compete with ours.\nSecurity breaches and other disruptions to our information technology structure could compromise our information,\ndisrupt our business and expose us to liability, which would cause our business and reputation to suffer.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we collect, process and store sensitive data, including intellectual property, our\nproprietary business information and that of our suppliers and business partners, as well as personally identifiable information\nof our patients, clinical trial participants and employees. We also rely to a large extent on information technology systems to\noperate our business, including to deliver our products. We have outsourced elements of our confidential information\nprocessing and information technology structure, and as a result, we are managing independent vendor relationships with third\nparties who may or could have access to our confidential information. Similarly, our business partners and other third-party\nproviders possess certain of our sensitive data. The secure maintenance of this information is critical to our operations and\nbusiness strategy. Despite our security measures, our large and complex information technology and infrastructure (and those\nof our partners, vendors and third-party providers) may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to employee,\npartner, vendor or third-party error, malfeasance or other disruptions. We, our partners, vendors and other third-party providers\ncould be susceptible to third party attacks on our, and their, information security systems, which attacks are of ever-increasing\nlevels of sophistication and are made by groups and individuals with a wide range of motives and expertise, including\norganized criminal groups, hacktivists, nation states and others. While we have invested in information technology and\nsecurity and the protection of confidential information, there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent service\ninterruptions or\n57\nTable of Contents\nsecurity breaches. Further, while some or all of our workforce, and those of our partners, vendors and other third-party\nproviders, work remotely, we may have greater vulnerability to cyberattacks or other losses of confidential information, as\nwell as interruptions in information technology systems. Any such interruptions, losses or breaches would substantially impair\nour ability to operate our business and would compromise our, or our partners, vendors and other third-party providers,\nnetworks and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. Any such access, disclosure or\nother loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal\ninformation, disrupt our operations, negatively impact our financial condition and damage our reputation, any of which could\nadversely affect our business. While we maintain cyber liability insurance, this insurance may not be sufficient to cover the\nfinancial or other losses that may result from an interruption or breach of our (or our partners’, vendors’ and third-party\nproviders’) systems.\nAnti-takeover provisions under our charter documents and Delaware law could delay or prevent a change of control which\ncould negatively impact the market price of our Class A Common Stock.\nProvisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of\ncontrol. These provisions include the following:\n● Our board of directors has the right to elect directors to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of the board of\ndirectors or the resignation, death or removal of a director, which prevents stockholders from being able to fill\nvacancies on our board of directors.\n● Our board of directors may issue, without stockholder approval, shares of preferred stock. The ability to\nauthorize preferred stock makes it possible for our board of directors to issue preferred stock with voting or other\nrights or preferences that could impede the success of any attempt to acquire us.\n● Stockholders must provide advance notice to nominate individuals for election to the board of directors or to\npropose matters that can be acted upon at a stockholders’ meeting. These provisions may discourage or deter a\npotential acquirer from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect such acquirer’s own slate of directors or\notherwise attempting to obtain control of our company.\n● Our stockholders may not act by written consent. As a result, a holder, or holders, controlling a majority of our\ncapital stock are not able to take certain actions outside of a stockholders’ meeting.\n● Special meetings of stockholders may be called only by the chairman of our board of directors, our chief\nexecutive officer or a majority of our board of directors. As a result, a holder, or holders, controlling a majority\nof our capital stock are not able to call a special meeting.\n● A super-majority (80%) of the outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock are required to amend our bylaws,\nwhich make it more difficult to change the provisions described above.\nIn addition, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which may\nprohibit certain business combinations with stockholders owning 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock. These and\nother provisions in our certificate of incorporation and our bylaws and in the Delaware General Corporation Law could make\nit more difficult for stockholders or potential acquirers to obtain control of our board of directors or initiate actions that are\nopposed by the then-current board of directors.\nIf we identify a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, it could have an adverse effect on our\nbusiness and financial results and our ability to meet our reporting obligations could be negatively affected, each of which\ncould negatively affect the trading price of our Class A Common Stock.\nA material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting,\nsuch that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be\nprevented or detected on a timely basis. Accordingly, a material weakness increases the risk that the financial information we\nreport contains material errors.\nWe regularly review and update our internal controls, disclosure controls and procedures, and corporate governance\npolicies. In addition, we are required under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 to report annually on our\n58\nTable of Contents\ninternal control over financial reporting. Our system of internal controls, however well-designed and operated, is based in part\non certain assumptions and includes elements that rely on information from third parties, including our partners. Our system\ncan provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurances that the objectives of the system are met. If we, or our independent\nregistered public accounting firm, determine that our internal controls over financial reporting are not effective, or we discover\nareas that need improvement in the future, these shortcomings could have an adverse effect on our business and financial\nresults, and the price of our Class A Common Stock could be negatively affected.\nFurther, we are dependent on our partners for information related to our results of operations. Our net profit or net\nloss generated from the sales of LINZESS in the U.S. is partially determined based on amounts provided by AbbVie and\ninvolves the use of estimates and judgments, which could be modified in the future. We are highly dependent on our\nlinaclotide partners for timely and accurate information regarding any revenues realized from sales of linaclotide in their\nrespective territories, and in the case of AbbVie for the U.S., the costs incurred in developing and commercializing it in order\nto accurately report our results of operations. Our results of operations are also dependent on the timeliness and accuracy of\ninformation from any other licensing, collaboration or other partners we may have, as well as our and our partners’ use of\nestimates and judgments. If we do not receive timely and accurate information or if estimated activity levels associated with\nthe relevant collaboration or partnership at a given point in time are incorrect, whether the result of a material weakness or not,\nwe could be required to record adjustments in future periods. Such adjustments could have an adverse effect on our financial\nresults, which could lead to a decline in our Class A Common Stock price.\nIf we cannot conclude that we have effective internal control over our financial reporting, or if our independent\nregistered public accounting firm is unable to provide an unqualified opinion regarding the effectiveness of our internal\ncontrol over financial reporting, investors could lose confidence in the reliability of our financial statements, which could lead\nto a decline in our stock price. Failure to comply with reporting requirements could also subject us to sanctions and/or\ninvestigations by the SEC, The Nasdaq Stock Market or other regulatory authorities.\nWe expect that the price of our Class A Common Stock will fluctuate substantially.\nThe market price of our Class A Common Stock may be highly volatile due to many factors, including:\n● the commercial performance of our products in the countries in which they are approved, as well as the costs\nassociated with such activities;\n● any third-party coverage and reimbursement policies for our products;\n● market conditions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology sectors;\n● developments, litigation or public concern about the safety of our products or our potential products;\n● announcements of the introduction of new products by us or our competitors;\n● announcements concerning product development, including clinical trial results or timelines, or intellectual\nproperty rights of us or others;\n● actual and anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly and annual operating results;\n● deviations in our operating results from any guidance we may provide or the estimates of securities analysts;\n● sales of additional shares of our Class A Common Stock or sales of securities convertible into Class A Common\nStock or the perception that these sales might occur;\n● any conversions of our Convertible Senior Notes into Class A Common Stock or activities undertaken by the\ncounterparties to the Capped Calls;\n● additions or departures of key personnel;\n59\nTable of Contents\n● developments concerning current or future collaboration, partnership, licensing or other strategic arrangements;\n● discussion of us or our stock price in the financial or scientific press or in online investor communities; and\n● the impact of public health epidemics, including containment or mitigation measures, or natural disasters.\nOur business could be negatively affected as a result of a proxy contest or certain other stockholder actions.\nResponding to certain stockholder actions can be costly, disruptive and time-consuming, and could also impact our\nability to attract, retain and motivate our employees. For example, a proxy contest for our annual meeting of stockholders\nrelating to stockholder proposals or director nominees would require significant time and could divert the attention of our\nmanagement, other employees and our board of directors. In addition, a proxy contest would require us to incur significant\ncosts, including legal fees and proxy solicitation expenses. The realization of any of the risks described in these “Risk Factors”\ncould have a dramatic and material adverse impact on the market price of our Class A Common Stock. In addition, class action\nlitigation has often been instituted against companies whose securities have experienced periods of volatility. Any such\nlitigation brought against us could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management attention, which could hurt our\nbusiness, operating results and financial condition.\nItem 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments\nNone.\n60\nTable of Contents\nItem 1C. Cybersecurity\nWe have a multilayered framework for assessing, identifying, detecting and responding to reasonably foreseeable\ncybersecurity risks and threats. To protect our information technology, or IT, systems from cybersecurity threats, we use\nvarious security tools that help prevent, identify, escalate, investigate, resolve and recover from identified vulnerabilities and\nsecurity incidents in a timely manner. In the event of a material change to our systems or operations, we would conduct an\nassessment of the internal and external threats to the security, confidentiality, integrity, and availability of our data and\nsystems, along with other material risks to our operations. We leverage third-party security services for audit, benchmarking,\nand improvement and use various tools and methodologies to manage cybersecurity risks that are tested regularly, including a\ncybersecurity assessment guided by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) cybersecurity framework and\nongoing security awareness training. We oversee third-party service providers by conducting vendor diligence upon\nonboarding and ongoing monitoring. Vendors are assessed for risk based on the nature of their digital footprint, company\nprofile, domain name services health, internet protocol reputation, external access threats and social engineering landscapes,\nbased on that assessment, we conduct diligence that may include completing security questionnaires, onsite evaluation, and\nscans or other technical evaluations. We also monitor and evaluate our cybersecurity posture and performance on an ongoing\nbasis through regular vulnerability scans, simulated phishing tests, penetration tests, and threat intelligence feeds. The results\nof these assessments are reported to the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.\nWe have developed an incident response plan designed to coordinate the activities that we and our third-party\nsecurity service provider take to prepare to respond and recover from cybersecurity incidents, which include processes to\ntriage, assess severity, investigate, escalate, contain, and remediate an incident, as well as to comply with potentially\napplicable legal obligations and mitigate any reputational damage.\nOur business strategy, results of operations and financial condition have not been materially affected as a result of\npreviously identified cybersecurity incidents, but we cannot provide assurance that they will not be materially affected in the\nfuture by such risks or any future material incidents. For more information on our cybersecurity-related risks, see Item 1A,\nRisk Factors, elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThe Company’s Chief Information Officer, or CIO, is responsible for developing and implementing our information\nsecurity program and reporting on cybersecurity matters to the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors and management.\nOur CIO has over 20 years of cybersecurity experience in various roles involving information security, developing\ncybersecurity strategies, and implementing cybersecurity programs.\nOur Board of Directors is responsible for overseeing our enterprise risk management activities in general, and each of\nour Board committees assists the Board in the role of risk oversight. The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors oversees\nour cybersecurity risk and receives regular reports, with a minimum frequency of once per year, from our CIO on various\ncybersecurity matters, including risk assessments, mitigation strategies, areas of emerging risks, incidents and industry trends,\nand other areas of importance. Promptly after becoming aware of a material cybersecurity incident affecting our IT systems or\ndata, the Audit Committee would work with management to formulate a mitigation plan and review compliance with such\nplan, as well as to ensure compliance with any external regulatory or disclosure requirements, including any disclosures of\nmaterial cybersecurity breaches.\nItem 2. Properties\nOur corporate headquarters are located in Boston, Massachusetts, where, as of December 31, 2023, we occupied\napproximately 39,000 square feet of office space under our lease expiring in June 2030. We also have operations in Basel,\nSwitzerland. We believe that our facilities are suitable and adequate for our needs for the foreseeable future.\nItem 3. Legal Proceedings\nNone.\nItem 4.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nForward-Looking Information\nThe following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our\nconsolidated financial statements and the notes to those financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on\nForm 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve significant risks and uncertainties. As a result of\nmany factors, such as those set forth under “Risk Factors” in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our actual results\nmay differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements.\nDiscussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations for the fiscal year ended December 31,\n2022 compared to the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021 is included in Part II, Item 7 – \"Management's Discussion and\nAnalysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended\nDecember 31, 2022 filed with the SEC on February 16, 2023.\nOverview\nWe are a GI healthcare company dedicated to advancing the treatment of GI diseases and redefining the standard of\ncare for GI patients. We are focused on the development and commercialization of innovative GI product opportunities in\nareas of significant unmet need, leveraging our demonstrated expertise and capabilities in GI diseases.\nLINZESS® (linaclotide), our commercial product, is the first product approved by the U.S. FDA, in a class of GI\nmedicines called GC-C agonists, and is indicated for adult men and women suffering from IBS-C, or CIC, and for pediatric\npatients ages 6-17 years-old suffering from FC. LINZESS is available to adult men and women suffering from IBS-C or CIC\nin the U.S., Mexico, and Saudi Arabia, to adult men and women suffering from IBS-C or chronic constipation in Japan, IBS-C\nin China and for pediatric patients ages 6-17 with FC in the U.S. Linaclotide is available under the trademarked name\nCONSTELLA® to adult men and women suffering from IBS-C or CIC in Canada, and to adult men and women suffering\nfrom IBS-C in certain European countries.\nWe have strategic partnerships with leading pharmaceutical companies to support the development and\ncommercialization of linaclotide throughout the world, including with AbbVie in the U.S. and all countries worldwide other\nthan China (including Hong Kong and Macau) and Japan, AstraZeneca in China (including Hong Kong and Macau) and\nAstellas in Japan.\nWe also aim to leverage our leading development and commercialization capabilities in GI to bring additional\ntreatment options to GI patients.\nIn June 2023, we completed a tender offer to purchase outstanding ordinary shares of VectivBio. In December 2023,\nwe completed a squeeze-out merger to acquire all remaining shares. The VectivBio Acquisition was partially funded with\n$400.0 million of borrowings under a new revolving credit facility, or the Revolving Credit Facility, as further described in\nNote 10, Debt, to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Through the\nacquisition, the Company is advancing apraglutide, a next-generation, synthetic peptide analog of GLP-2, for rare\ngastrointestinal diseases, including SBS-IF, as well as several earlier stage assets.\nIn November 2021, we entered into the COUR Collaboration Agreement, with COUR, that grants us an option to\nacquire an exclusive license to research, develop, manufacture and commercialize, in the U.S., products containing CNP-104,\na tolerizing immune modifying nanoparticle, for the treatment of PBC.\nWe are also advancing IW-3300, a GC-C agonist, for the potential treatment of visceral pain conditions, such as\nIC/BPS, and endometriosis.\nTo date, we have dedicated a majority of our activities to the research, development and commercialization of\nlinaclotide, as well as to the research and development of our other product candidates. Prior to the year ended December 31,\n2019, we incurred net losses in each year since inception. For the year ended December 31, 2023, we recorded net loss of\napproximately $1.0 billion, which included a charge of approximately $1.1 billion related to acquired in-process research and\ndevelopment, or IPR&D, in connection with the VectivBio Acquisition. For the years ended 2022 and 2021, we recorded net\nincome of $175.1 million and $528.4 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2023, we had an\n64\nTable of Contents\naccumulated deficit of approximately $1.7 billion. We are unable to predict the extent of any future losses or guarantee that\nour company will be able to maintain positive cash flows.\nWe were incorporated in Delaware on January 5, 1998 as Microbia, Inc. On April 7, 2008, we changed our name to\nIronwood Pharmaceuticals, Inc. We operate in one reportable business segment – human therapeutics.\nKey 2023 Financial Highlights\n● We recognized $442.7 million in total revenues during the year ended December 31 2023, compared to $410.6\nmillion during the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase was primarily driven by an increase of $31.7\nmillion in collaborative arrangements revenue related to sales of LINZESS in the U.S.\n● We recognized $430.5 million in collaborative arrangements revenue related to sales of LINZESS in the U.S.\nduring the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to $398.8 million during the year ended December 31,\n2022. The increase was primarily driven by increased prescription demand, partially offset by inventory channel\nfluctuations.\n● We generated a loss from operations of $945.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to\nincome from operations of $250.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2022. The decrease was\nprimarily attributable to approximately $1.1 billion in IPR&D expense related to the VectivBio Acquisition.\n● We generated $183.4 million in cash from operations during the year ended December 31, 2023, ending the year\nwith $92.2 million in cash and cash equivalents.\nFinancial Operations Overview\nRevenues. Our revenues are generated primarily through our collaborative arrangements and license agreements\nrelated to research and development and commercialization of linaclotide.\nThe majority of our revenues are generated from the sales of LINZESS in the U.S. We record our share of the net\nprofits and losses from the sales of LINZESS in the U.S. less commercial expenses on a net basis and present the settlement\npayments to and from AbbVie as collaboration expense or collaborative arrangements revenue, as applicable. Net profits or\nlosses consist of net sales to third-party customers and sublicense income in the U.S. less the cost of goods sold as well as\nselling, general and administrative expenses. Although we expect net sales to increase over time, the settlement payments\nbetween AbbVie and us, resulting in collaborative arrangements revenue or collaboration expense, are subject to fluctuation\nbased on the ratio of selling, general and administrative expenses incurred by each party. In addition, our collaborative\narrangements revenue may fluctuate as a result of the timing and amount of license fees and clinical and commercial\nmilestones received and recognized under our current and future strategic partnerships as well as timing and amount of\nroyalties from the sales of linaclotide in the European, Canadian, Mexican, Japanese, or Chinese markets or any other markets\nwhere linaclotide receives approval and is commercialized.\nCost of Revenues. Cost of revenues primarily includes costs related to the sales of linaclotide API, finished drug\nproduct, and finished goods to our partners, which generally occurs upon shipment for sales of API, finished drug product and\nfinished goods after the material has passed all quality testing required for acceptance by the partner to certain of our partners\noutside of the U.S.\nResearch and Development Expense. The core of our research and development strategy is to leverage our\ndemonstrated expertise and capabilities in GI diseases to bring multiple medicines to patients. Research and development\nexpense consists of expenses incurred in connection with the research into and development of products and product\ncandidates. These expenses consist primarily of compensation, benefits and other employee-related expenses, research and\ndevelopment related facility costs, third-party contract costs relating to nonclinical study and clinical trial activities,\ndevelopment of manufacturing processes, regulatory registration of third-party manufacturing facilities, and licensing fees for\nour product candidates.\n65\nTable of Contents\nResearch and development expenses include amounts owed to AbbVie on an ongoing basis under cost-sharing\nprovisions in our collaboration agreement for linaclotide. Reimbursements received for research and development activities\nunder this agreement are netted against research and development expenses.\nLinaclotide. Our commercial product, LINZESS, is commercially available in the U.S. for the treatment of IBS-C or\nCIC in adults and for FC in pediatric patients ages 6-17 years-old. Linaclotide is also available to adult men and women\nsuffering from IBS-C or CIC in certain countries of the world, including China, Japan, and in a number of E.U. countries.\nWe and AbbVie continue to explore ways to enhance the clinical profile of LINZESS by studying linaclotide in\nadditional indications, populations and formulations to assess its potential to treat various conditions. In September 2020,\nbased on the Phase IIIb data of linaclotide 290 mcg on the overall abdominal symptoms of bloating, pain and discomfort in\nadult patients with IBS-C, the U.S. FDA approved our sNDA to include a more comprehensive description of the effects of\nLINZESS in its approved label.\nIn addition, we and AbbVie have established a nonclinical and clinical post-marketing plan with the U.S. FDA to\nunderstand the safety and efficacy of LINZESS in pediatric patients. In August 2021, the U.S. FDA approved a revised label\nfor LINZESS based on clinical safety data that had been generated thus far in pediatric studies. The updated label modified the\nboxed warning for risk of serious dehydration and contraindication against use in children to those less than two years of age.\nThe boxed warning and contraindication previously applied to all children less than 18 years of age and less than 6 years of\nage, respectively. In June 2023, the U.S. FDA approved LINZESS as a once-daily treatment for pediatric patients ages 6-17\nyears-old with FC, making LINZESS the first and only FDA-approved prescription therapy for FC in this patient population.\nThe safety and effectiveness of LINZESS in patients with FC less than 6 years of age or in patients with IBS-C less than 18\nyears of age have not been established. Additional clinical pediatric programs in IBS-C and FC are ongoing.\nApraglutide. Refer to Acquired In-Process Research and Development.\nCNP-104. Through the COUR Collaboration Agreement, we and COUR are developing CNP-104 for the treatment\nof PBC, a rare autoimmune disease targeting the liver. In December 2021, the U.S. FDA granted Fast Track Designation to\nCNP-104. COUR is currently conducting a clinical study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacodynamic effects and\nefficacy of CNP-104 in PBC patients, with topline data expected in the third quarter of 2024.\nIW-3300. We are developing IW-3300, a GC-C agonist, for the potential treatment of visceral pain conditions,\nincluding IC/BPS and endometriosis. We successfully completed Phase I studies to evaluate the safety and tolerability of IW-\n3300 in healthy volunteers and are continuing the Phase II proof of concept study in IC/BPS.\nIW-3718. We were developing IW-3718, a gastric retentive formulation of a bile acid sequestrant, for the potential\ntreatment of refractory gastroesophageal reflux disease, or refractory GERD. In September 2020, we announced that one of\nour two identical Phase III trials evaluating IW-3718 in refractory GERD did not meet the pre-specified criteria associated\nwith a planned early efficacy assessment and, based on these findings, we discontinued development of IW-3718.\nEarly research and development. Our early research and development efforts have been focused on supporting our\ndevelopment stage GI programs, including exploring strategic options for further development of certain of our internal\nprograms, as well as evaluating external development-stage GI programs.\n66\nTable of Contents\nThe following table sets forth our research and development expenses related to our product pipeline for the years\nended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. These expenses relate primarily to compensation, benefits and other\nemployee-related expenses and external costs associated with nonclinical studies and clinical trial costs for our product\ncandidates. We allocate costs related to facilities, depreciation, share-based compensation, research and development support\nservices and certain other costs directly to programs.\nYear Ended December 31,\n2023 2022 2021\nLinaclotide(1) $ 21,103 $ 17,267 $ 21,075\nApraglutide(2) 58,244 — —\nIW-3718 — 461 8,002\nIW-3300 15,091 15,824 11,687\nCNP-104(3) 9,461 1,022 19,500\nEarly research and development 12,186 9,691 10,141\nTotal research and development expenses $ 116,085 $ 44,265 $ 70,405\n(1) Includes linaclotide in all indications, populations and formulations.\n(2) Includes $11.3 million of share-based compensation expense and $3.5 million of employer payroll tax expense recognized\nin the second quarter of 2023 immediately after the closing of the VectivBio Acquisition in connection with the vesting\nacceleration and settlement of outstanding stock options and restricted stock units.\n(3) Includes $6.0 million up-front payment recognized in the second quarter of 2023 in connection with the amendment to the\nCOUR Collaboration Agreement.\nThe lengthy process of securing regulatory approvals for new drugs requires the expenditure of substantial resources.\nAny failure by us to obtain, or any delay in obtaining, regulatory approvals would materially adversely affect our product\ndevelopment efforts and our business overall.\nWe and AbbVie are exploring development opportunities to enhance the clinical profile of LINZESS by studying\nlinaclotide in additional indications, populations and formulations to assess its potential to treat various conditions. We cannot\ncurrently estimate with any degree of certainty the amount of time or money that we will be required to expend in the future\non linaclotide for additional indications, populations or formulations.\nGiven the inherent uncertainties that come with the development of pharmaceutical products, we cannot estimate\nwith any degree of certainty how our programs will evolve, and therefore the amount of time or money that would be required\nto obtain regulatory approval to market them.\nAs a result of these uncertainties surrounding the timing and outcome of any approvals, we are currently unable to\nestimate precisely when, if ever, linaclotide’s utility will be expanded within its currently approved indications; if or when\nlinaclotide will be developed outside of its current markets, indications, populations or formulations; or when, if ever, any of\nour other product candidates will generate revenues and cash flows.\nWe invest carefully in our pipeline, and the commitment of funding for each subsequent stage of our development\nprograms is dependent upon the receipt of clear, supportive data. In addition, we intend to access externally discovered drug\ncandidates that fit within our core strategy. In evaluating these potential assets, we apply the same investment criteria as those\nused for investments in internally discovered assets.\nThe successful development of our product candidates is highly uncertain and subject to a number of risks including,\nbut not limited to:\n● The duration of clinical trials may vary substantially according to the type, complexity and novelty of the\nproduct candidate;\n● The U.S. FDA and comparable agencies in foreign countries impose substantial and varying requirements on the\nintroduction of therapeutic pharmaceutical products, typically requiring lengthy and detailed laboratory and\nclinical testing procedures, sampling activities and other costly and time-consuming procedures;\n67\nTable of Contents\n● Data obtained from nonclinical and clinical activities at any step in the testing process may be adverse and lead\nto discontinuation or redirection of development activity. Data obtained from these activities also are susceptible\nto varying interpretations, which could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval;\n● The duration and cost of early research and development, including nonclinical studies and clinical trials, may\nvary significantly over the life of a product candidate and are difficult to predict;\n● The costs, timing and outcome of regulatory review of a product candidate may not be favorable, and, even if\napproved, a product may face post-approval development and regulatory requirements;\n● There may be substantial costs, delays and difficulties in successfully integrating externally developed product\ncandidates into our business operations; and\n● The emergence of competing technologies and products and other adverse market developments may negatively\nimpact us.\nAs a result of the factors discussed above, including the factors discussed under “Risk Factors” in Item 1A of this\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K, we are unable to determine the duration and costs to complete current or future nonclinical and\nclinical stages of our product candidates or when, or to what extent, we will generate revenues from the commercialization\nand sale of our product candidates. Development timelines, probability of success and development costs vary widely. We\nanticipate that we will make determinations as to which additional programs to pursue and how much funding to direct to each\nprogram on an ongoing basis in response to the data of each product candidate, the competitive landscape and ongoing\nassessments of such product candidate’s commercial potential.\nWe expect to invest in our development programs for the foreseeable future. We will continue to invest in linaclotide,\nincluding the investigation of ways to enhance the clinical profile within its currently approved indications, and the\nexploration of its potential utility in other indications, populations and formulations. We will continue to invest in our GI-\nfocused product candidates as we advance them through pre-clinical and clinical trials, in addition to funding research and\ndevelopment activities under our external collaboration and license agreements.\nAcquired In-Process Research and Development. Asset acquisition costs, license fees and development milestone\npayments related to acquired and in-licensed products and technology are expensed as acquired in-process research and\ndevelopment at the point that they have no established alternative future use.\nThrough the VectivBio Acquisition, we are advancing apraglutide, a next-generation, long-acting synthetic peptide\nanalog of GLP-2, as a differentiated therapeutic for a wide range of rare diseases, including SBS-IF and aGvHD.\nApraglutide for SBS-IF. We are conducting a Phase III clinical trial, STARS, to assess the safety and efficacy of\napraglutide in adult patients with SBS-IF, and expect to report topline results in March 2024. In October 2023, we presented\npositive final data from the STARS Nutrition Phase II study of apraglutide in patients with SBS-IF and colon-in-continuity\nduring United European Gastroenterology (UEG) Week. We are also conducting open label extension studies to further\nevaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of apraglutide in SBS-IF and to support potential submissions of marketing\napplications for apraglutide in the U.S., European Union, or E.U., and Japan. In October 2023, we presented positive final\ndata from the STARS Nutrition Phase II study during United European Gastroenterology (UEG) Week. This multicenter,\nopen-label study of nine patients was designed to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy of apraglutide on\nintestinal absorption in adult patients who have SBS-IF and colon-in-continuity.\nApraglutide for aGvHD: We are conducting a Phase II exploratory study, STARGAZE, to evaluate apraglutide in\npatients with steroid-refractory gastrointestinal aGvHD and expect data in the first quarter of 2024.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expense. Selling, general and administrative expense consists primarily of\ncompensation, benefits and other employee-related expenses for personnel in our administrative, finance, legal, information\ntechnology, business development, commercial, sales, marketing, communications and human resource functions. Other costs\ninclude legal costs of pursuing patent protection of our intellectual property, general and administrative related facility costs,\ninsurance costs and professional fees for accounting, tax, consulting, legal and other services. As we continue to invest in the\ncommercialization of LINZESS and other product candidates, we expect our selling, general and administrative expenses will\nbe substantial for the foreseeable future.\n68\nTable of Contents\nWe include AbbVie’s selling, general and administrative cost-sharing payments in the calculation of the net profits\nand net losses from the sale of LINZESS in the U.S. and present the net payment to or from AbbVie as collaboration expense\nor collaborative arrangements revenue, respectively.\nRestructuring Expenses. Restructuring expenses pertain to a workforce reduction in April 2023 and restructuring\ninitiatives, which commenced in June 2023 in connection with the VectivBio Acquisition. The workforce reduction and\nrestructuring initiatives are more fully described in Note 16, Workforce Reductions and Restructuring, to our consolidated\nfinancial statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nInterest Expense and Other Financing Costs. Interest expense consists primarily of cash and non-cash interest costs\nrelated to our convertible senior notes and Revolving Credit Facility. Non-cash interest expense consists of amortization of\ndebt issuance costs.\nInterest and Investment Income. Interest and investment income consists of interest earned on our cash and cash\nequivalents, as well as significant financing components of payments due from collaboration partners.\nGain (Loss) on Derivatives. In June 2015, we issued 2.25% Convertible Senior Notes due June 15, 2022, or the 2022\nConvertible Notes, and in August 2019, we issued the Convertible Senior Notes. In connection with the issuance of our 2022\nConvertible Notes, we entered into convertible note hedge transactions, or the Convertible Note Hedges, and separate note\nhedge warrant transactions, or the Note Hedge Warrants, with certain financial institutions. Gain (loss) on derivatives consists\nof the change in fair value of the Convertible Note Hedges and Note Hedge Warrants, which are recorded at fair value at each\nreporting date and changes in fair value are recorded in our consolidated statements of income (loss). The Convertible Note\nHedges and Note Hedge Warrants terminated unexercised upon expiry in June 2022 and April 2023, respectively. The\nConvertible Note Hedges and Note Hedge Warrants are more fully described in Note 10, Debt, to our consolidated financial\nstatements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nIncome Taxes. We prepare our income tax provision based on our interpretation of the income tax accounting rules\nand each jurisdiction’s enacted tax laws and regulations. At interim reporting dates, we record our income tax provision by\napplying our estimated annual effective tax rate to year-to-date pre-tax income, plus adjustments for significant unusual or\ninfrequently occurring items. For additional information refer to Note 14, Income Taxes, to our consolidated financial\nstatements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated\nfinancial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these\nfinancial statements requires us to make certain estimates and assumptions that may affect the reported amounts of assets and\nliabilities, the disclosure of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, and the amounts of\nrevenues and expenses during the reported periods. We base our estimates on our historical experience and on various other\nassumptions that are believed to be reasonable, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying\nvalues of assets and liabilities. Actual results may differ materially from our estimates under different assumptions or\nconditions. Changes in estimates are reflected in reported results in the period in which they become known.\nWe believe that our application of the following accounting policies, each of which require significant judgments and\nestimates on the part of management, are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial\nresults. Our significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to\nour consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nAcquisitions\nWe evaluate acquisitions of assets and other similar transactions to assess whether the transaction should be\naccounted for as a business combination or asset acquisition by first applying a screen test to determine whether substantially\nall of the fair value of the gross assets acquired is concentrated into a single identifiable asset or group of similar identifiable\nassets. If the screen test is met, a single asset or group of assets is not a business and is accounted for\n69\nTable of Contents\nas an asset acquisition. If the screen test is not met, further determination is required as to whether we have acquired inputs\nand processes that have the ability to create outputs that would meet the requirements of a business.\nWe account for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires the acquiring\nentity to recognize the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed and establishes the acquisition date as the fair value\nmeasurement point. We determine the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on management’s estimate of\nthe fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the acquisition. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price\nover the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired. Transaction costs are expensed as incurred.\nWe account for asset acquisitions that are not determined to be a business combination by recognizing net assets\nbased on the consideration paid, inclusive of transaction costs, on a relative fair value basis. In an asset acquisition, the cost\nallocated to acquired IPR&D with no alternative future use is charged to research and development expense at the acquisition\ndate. We classify asset acquisitions of acquired IPR&D as investing activities on its consolidated statements of cash flows.\nRevenue Recognition\nUpon executing a revenue generating arrangement, we assess whether it is probable we will collect consideration in\nexchange for the good or service it transfers to the customer and perform the following five steps: (i) identify the contract(s)\nwith a customer; (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (iii) determine the transaction price; (iv) allocate the\ntransaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) we satisfy the\nperformance obligations. We must develop assumptions that require significant judgment to determine the standalone selling\nprice for each performance obligation identified in the contract. The assumptions that are used to determine the standalone\nselling price may include forecasted revenues, development timelines, reimbursement rates for personnel costs, discount rates\nand probabilities of technical and regulatory success.\nOur revenues are generated primarily through collaborative arrangements and license agreements related to the\ndevelopment and commercialization of linaclotide. The terms of the collaborative arrangements and other agreements contain\nmultiple performance obligations which may include (i) licenses, (ii) research and development activities, including\nparticipation on joint steering committees, (iii) the manufacture of finished drug product, API, or development materials for a\npartner, which are reimbursed at a contractually determined rate, and (iv) education or co-promotion activities by our clinical\nsales specialists. Non-refundable payments to us under these agreements may include (i) up-front license fees, (ii) payments\nfor research and development activities, (iii) payments for the manufacture of finished drug product, API, or development\nmaterials, (iv) payments based upon the achievement of certain milestones, (v) payments for sales detailing, promotional\nsupport services and medical education initiatives, and (vi) royalties on product sales. Additionally, we receive our share of the\nnet profits or bear our share of the net losses from the sale of linaclotide in the U.S. We have adopted a policy to recognize\nrevenue net of tax withholdings, as applicable.\nCollaboration, License, and Other Agreements\nUpon licensing intellectual property, we determine if the license is distinct from the other performance obligations\nidentified in the arrangement. We recognize revenues from the transaction price, including non-refundable, up-front fees\nallocated to the license when the license is transferred to the customer if the license has distinct benefit to the customer. For\nlicenses that are combined with other promises, we assess the nature of the combined performance obligation to determine\nwhether the combined performance obligation is satisfied over time or at a point in time. For performance obligations that are\nsatisfied over time, we evaluate the measure of progress each reporting period and, if necessary, adjust the measure of\nperformance and related revenue recognition.\nOur license and collaboration agreements include milestone payments, such as development and other milestones.\nWe evaluate whether the milestones are considered probable of being reached and estimate the amount to be included in the\ntransaction price using the most likely amount method at the inception of the agreement. If it is probable that a significant\nrevenue reversal would not occur, the associated milestone value is included in the transaction price. Milestone payments that\nare not within our control, such as regulatory approvals, are not considered probable of being achieved until those approvals\nare received. The transaction price is then allocated to each performance obligation on a relative standalone selling price basis,\nfor which we recognize revenue as or when the performance obligations under the\n70\nTable of Contents\ncontract are satisfied. We re-evaluate the probability of achievement of such milestones and any related constraint at each\nreporting period, and any adjustments are recorded on a cumulative catch-up basis.\nAgreements that include the supply of API or drug product for either clinical development or commercial supply at\nthe customer’s discretion are generally considered as options. We assess if these options provide a material right to our partner,\nand if so, they are accounted for as separate performance obligations. If we are entitled to additional payments when the\ncustomer exercises these options, any additional payments are recorded as revenue when the customer obtains control of the\ngoods, which is typically upon shipment for sales of API and finished drug product.\nFor agreements that include sales-based royalties, including milestone payments based on the level of sales, and the\nlicense is deemed to be the predominant item to which the royalties relate, we recognize revenue when the related sales occur\nin accordance with the sales-based royalty exception.\nNet Profit or Net Loss Sharing\nIn accordance with Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC, Topic 808, Collaborative Arrangements, or ASC\n808, we considered the nature and contractual terms of the arrangement and the nature of our business operations to determine\nthe classification of payments under our collaboration agreements. While ASC 808 provides guidance on classification, the\nstandard is silent on matters of separation, initial measurement, and recognition. Therefore, we apply the separation, initial\nmeasurement, and recognition principles of ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, to our collaboration\nagreements.\nOur collaborative arrangements revenue generated from sales of LINZESS in the U.S. are considered akin to sales-\nbased royalties. We recognize our share of the pre-tax commercial net profit or net loss generated from the sales of LINZESS\nin the U.S. in the period the product sales are earned, as reported by AbbVie, and related cost of goods sold and selling,\ngeneral and administrative expenses as incurred by us and our collaboration partner. These amounts are partially determined\nbased on amounts provided by AbbVie and involve the use of estimates and judgments, such as product sales allowances and\naccruals related to prompt payment discounts, chargebacks, governmental and contractual rebates, wholesaler fees, product\nreturns, and co-payment assistance costs, which could be adjusted based on actual results in the future. We are highly\ndependent on AbbVie for timely and accurate information regarding any net revenues realized from sales of LINZESS in the\nU.S. in accordance with ASC 808, and the related costs, in order to accurately report its results of operations. If we do not\nreceive timely and accurate information or incorrectly estimate activity levels associated with the collaboration at a given\npoint in time, we could be required to record adjustments in future periods.\nWe record revenue transactions as net product revenue in our consolidated statements of income if we are deemed the\nprincipal in the transaction, which includes being the primary obligor, retaining inventory risk, and control over pricing. Given\nthat we are not the primary obligor and do not have the inventory risks in the collaboration agreement with AbbVie for North\nAmerica, we record our share of the net profits or net losses from the sales of LINZESS in the U.S. on a net basis and present\nthe settlement payments to and from AbbVie as collaboration expense or collaborative arrangements revenue, as applicable.\nWe and AbbVie settle the cost sharing quarterly, such that our consolidated statements of income reflect 50% of the pre-tax net\nprofit or loss generated from sales of LINZESS in the U.S.\nSale of Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient\nThe Company is not currently responsible for the supply of linaclotide API, finished drug product, finished goods or\ndevelopment materials to its partners, though the Company may provide development materials to certain of its partners on a\nperiodic basis. Sales of such development materials have been and are expected to continue to be immaterial.\nWe recognize revenue on linaclotide API, finished drug product, finished goods, and development materials when\ncontrol has transferred to the partner, which generally occurs upon shipment after the material has passed all quality testing\nrequired for acceptance by the partner.\nOther\nOur deferred revenue balance consists of advance billings and payments received from customers in excess of\nrevenue recognized.\n71\nTable of Contents\nResearch and Development Expense\nWe have committed significant resources into the research and development of our product candidates and intend to\ncontinue to do so for the foreseeable future. Research and development expenses are generally expensed as incurred. We\ncapitalize nonrefundable advance payments we make for research and development activities and defer expense recognition\nuntil the related goods are received or the related services are performed.\nResearch and development expenses are comprised of costs incurred in performing research and development\nactivities, including salary, benefits, share-based compensation, and other employee-related expenses; laboratory supplies and\nother direct expenses; facilities expenses; overhead expenses; third-party contractual costs relating to nonclinical studies and\nclinical trial activities and related contract manufacturing expenses, development of manufacturing processes and regulatory\nregistration of third-party manufacturing facilities; licensing fees for our product candidates; and other outside expenses.\nClinical trial expenses include expenses associated with CROs. The invoicing from CROs for services rendered can\nlag several months. We accrue the cost of services rendered in connection with CRO activities based on our estimate of site\nmanagement, monitoring costs, project management costs, and investigator fees. We maintain regular communication with our\nCRO vendors to gauge the reasonableness of our estimates. Differences between actual clinical trial expenses and estimated\nclinical trial expenses recorded have not been material and are adjusted for in the period in which they become known.\nHowever, if we incorrectly estimate activity levels associated with the CRO services at a given point in time, we could be\nrequired to record material adjustments in future periods. Under our collaboration agreement with AbbVie for North America,\nwe are reimbursed for certain research and development expenses and we net these reimbursements against our research and\ndevelopment expenses as incurred.\nResearch and development expenses also include up-front payment, non-contingent payment, and milestone payment\nobligations under the COUR Collaboration Agreement. Recognition of expense for such payments requires judgment with\nrespect to when the obligation is probable.\nShare-Based Compensation Expense\nWe grant awards under our share-based compensation programs, including stock awards, restricted stock awards, or\nRSAs, restricted stock units, or RSUs (including performance-based RSUs, or PSUs), stock options, and shares issued under\nour employee stock purchase plan, or ESPP. Share-based compensation is recognized as expense in the consolidated\nstatements of income based on the grant date fair value over the requisite service period, net of estimated forfeitures. We\nestimate forfeitures over the requisite service period using historical forfeiture activity and record share-based compensation\nexpense only for those awards that are expected to vest.\nWe estimate the fair value of stock options on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which\nrequires the use of subjective assumptions including volatility and expected term, among others. The fair value of stock\nawards, RSAs, and RSUs is based on the market value of our Class A Common Stock on the date of grant, with the exception\nof PSUs with market conditions, which are measured using the Monte Carlo simulation method. Discounted stock purchases\nunder our ESPP are valued on the first date of the offering period using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to compute\nthe fair value of the lookback provision plus the purchase discount.\nFor awards that vest based on service conditions and market conditions, we use the straight-line method to recognize\ncompensation expense over the respective service period. For awards that contain performance conditions, we determine the\nappropriate amount to expense based on the anticipated achievement of performance targets, which requires judgment,\nincluding forecasting the achievement of future specified targets. At the date performance conditions are determined to be\nprobable of achievement, we record a cumulative expense catch-up, with remaining expense amortized over the remaining\nservice period. Throughout the performance period, we re-assess the estimated performance and update the number of\nperformance-based awards that we believe will ultimately vest. Discounted stock purchases under our ESPP are recognized\nover the offering period.\nCompensation expense related to modified awards is measured based on the fair value for the awards as of the\nmodification date. Any incremental compensation expense arising from the excess of the fair value of the awards on the\nmodification date compared to the fair value of the awards immediately before the modification date is recognized at the\nmodification date or ratably over the remaining service period, as appropriate.\n72\nTable of Contents\nWhile the assumptions used to calculate and account for share-based compensation awards represent management’s\nbest estimates, these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management’s judgment. As a result, if\nrevisions are made to our underlying assumptions and estimates, our share-based compensation expense could vary\nsignificantly from period to period.\nIncome Taxes\nWe utilize the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and\nliabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement carrying amounts and tax basis of assets and\nliabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for years in which the temporary differences are expected to reverse. We provide a\nvaluation allowance when it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets will not be realized.\nPrior to 2021, we maintained a valuation allowance on the majority of our net operating losses and other deferred tax\nassets. On a periodic basis, we reassess the valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets, weighing positive and negative\nevidence to assess the recoverability of the deferred tax assets. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we reassessed the\nvaluation allowance noting the shift of positive evidence outweighing negative evidence, including: continued strong\nprescription demand growth of LINZESS, continued profitability of a GI-focused business since completing the tax-free spin-\noff of Cyclerion, and expectations regarding future profitability. After assessing both the positive evidence and negative\nevidence, we determined it was more likely than not that we will realize the majority of our deferred tax assets and therefore\nreleased the majority of our valuation allowance for the deferred tax assets that are expected to be utilized in future years. We\nwill continue to maintain a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets that are unlikely to be realized, which are primarily\ncertain tax credits that are expected to expire prior to utilization.\nSignificant judgment is required in making these assessments to maintain or reverse our valuation allowances and, to\nthe extent our future expectations change we would have to assess the recoverability of these deferred tax assets at that time. If\nwe determine that our net deferred tax assets are not realizable in a future period, we would record material changes to income\ntax expense or benefit in that period.\nWe record uncertain tax positions on the basis of a two-step process. First, we determine whether it is more likely\nthan not that the tax positions will be sustained based on the technical merits of the position. Second, for those tax positions\nthat meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, we recognize the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50\npercent likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement with the relevant tax authority. Significant judgment is required in\nevaluating whether our tax positions meet this two-step process. The nature of the uncertain tax positions is often complex and\nsubject to change, and the amounts at issue can be substantial. We re-evaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis\nbased on a number of factors including, but not limited to, changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, and\neffectively settled issues under audit and new audit activity. Any change in these factors could result in the recognition of a tax\nbenefit or an additional charge to the tax provision.\n73\nTable of Contents\nResults of Operations\nThe following discussion summarizes the key factors our management believes are necessary for an understanding of\nour consolidated financial statements.\nYear Ended December 31,\n2023 2022\n(in thousands)\nRevenues:\nCollaborative arrangements revenue $ 442,735 $ 410,596\nTotal revenues 442,735 410,596\nCosts and expenses:\nResearch and development 116,085 44,265\nSelling, general and administrative 158,314 115,994\nRestructuring expenses 18,317 —\nAcquired in-process research and development 1,095,449 —\nTotal costs and expenses 1,388,165 160,259\nIncome (loss) from operations (945,430) 250,337\nOther income (expense):\nInterest expense and other financing costs (21,629) (7,598)\nInterest and investment income 18,971 9,501\nGain on derivatives 19 182\nOther income (expense), net (2,639) 2,085\nIncome (loss) before income taxes (948,069) 252,422\nIncome tax expense (83,490) (77,357)\nNet income (loss) (1,031,559) 175,065\nLess: Net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests (29,320) —\nNet income (loss) attributable to Ironwood Pharmaceuticals, Inc. $ (1,002,239) $ 175,065\nYear Ended December 31, 2023 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2022\nRevenues\nYear Ended\nDecember 31, Change\n2023 2022 $\n(in thousands)\nRevenues:\nCollaborative arrangements revenue $ 442,735 $ 410,596 $ 32,139\nTotal revenues $ 442,735 $ 410,596 $ 32,139\nCollaborative arrangements revenue. The increase in collaborative arrangements revenue of $32.1 million for the\nyear ended December 31, 2023 compared to the year ended December 31, 2022 was primarily related to a $31.7 million\nincrease in our share of net profits from the sale of LINZESS in the U.S., which was primarily driven by increased\nprescription demand, partially offset by inventory channel fluctuations.\nCost and Expenses\nYear Ended\nDecember 31, Change\n2023 2022 $\n(in thousands)\nOperating expenses:\nResearch and development $ 116,085 $ 44,265 $ 71,820\nSelling, general and administrative 158,314 115,994 42,320\nRestructuring expenses 18,317 — 18,317\nAcquired in-process research and development 1,095,449 — 1,095,449\nTotal operating expenses $ 1,388,165 $ 160,259 $ 1,227,906\n74\nTable of Contents\nResearch and development. The increase in research and development expenses of $71.8 million for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023 compared to the year ended December 31, 2022 was primarily related to $43.3 million of apraglutide\nprogram costs, $11.3 million of share-based compensation and $3.5 million in related payroll taxes recognized immediately\nafter the closing of the VectivBio Acquisition in connection with the vesting acceleration of outstanding stock options and\nRSUs under VectivBio’s 2021 Equity Incentive Plan, a $6.0 million payment to COUR related to CNP-104 in connection with\nthe amendment of the COUR Collaboration Agreement, a $3.3 million increase in linaclotide program costs, and a $3.2\nmillion increase in external costs associated with other pipeline programs. Research and development expenses for the year\nended December 31, 2023 included $15.1 million of acquisition-related costs.\nSelling, general and administrative. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $42.3 million for the year\nended December 31, 2023 compared to the year ended December 31, 2022, primarily due to $16.2 million of share-based\ncompensation and $3.0 million in related payroll taxes recognized immediately after the closing of the VectivBio Acquisition\nin connection with the vesting acceleration of outstanding stock options and RSUs under VectivBio’s 2021 Equity Incentive\nPlan, $12.9 million of general and administrative costs incurred for operating activities of the acquired VectivBio entities, a\n$5.8 million increase in compensation, benefits, and other employee-related expenses, a $3.7 million increase of professional\nservices costs, and a $1.6 million increase in sales and marketing activities. Selling, general and administrative expenses for\nthe year ended December 31, 2023 included $25.6 million of acquisition-related costs.\nRestructuring expenses. Restructuring expenses were $18.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 related to\nemployee severance, benefits and related costs for the headquarters-based workforce reduction and VectivBio Acquisition-\nrelated workforce reduction.\nAcquired In-Process Research & Development. We incurred approximately $1.1 billion of expense during the year\nended December 31, 2023 in connection with the VectivBio Acquisition to acquire apraglutide.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nYear Ended\nDecember 31, Change\n2023 2022 $\n(in thousands)\nOther income (expense):\nInterest expense and other financing costs $ (21,629) $ (7,598) $ (14,031)\nInterest and investment income 18,971 9,501 9,470\nGain on derivatives 19 182 (163)\nTotal other income (expense), net $ (2,639) $ 2,085 $ (4,724)\nInterest expense and other financing costs. Interest expense increased by $14.0 million during the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023 compared to the year ended December 31, 2022 primarily due to $15.3 million of interest expense\nincurred under the revolving credit facility used to partially finance the VectivBio Acquisition in June 2023.\nInterest and investment income. Interest and investment income increased by $9.5 million in the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023 compared to the year ended December 31, 2022, resulting primarily from an increase in investment\ninterest rates, as well as an increase in investment balances prior to the VectivBio Acquisition.\nGain on derivatives. During the year ended December 31, 2023, we recorded an insignificant gain on derivatives\nresulting from a decrease in the fair value of the Note Hedge Warrants, which terminated unexercised upon expiry in April\n2023.\nIncome taxes. During the year ended December 31, 2023, we recorded income tax expense of $83.5 million,\ncomprised of non-cash tax expense of $74.1 million and cash tax expense of $9.4 million for state income taxes in certain\nstates in which state taxable income exceeded available net operating losses. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we\nrecorded income tax expense of $77.4 million, comprised of non-cash tax expense of $73.4 million and cash tax expense of\n$4.0 million for state income taxes in certain states in which state taxable income exceeded available net operating losses.\n75\nTable of Contents\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had $92.2 million of cash and cash equivalents. Our cash equivalents include amounts\nheld in money market funds, U.S. Treasury securities and commercial paper. We invest cash in excess of immediate\nrequirements in accordance with our investment policy, which limits the amounts we may invest in certain types of\ninvestments and requires all investments held by us to be at least A- rated, with a remaining final maturity when purchased of\nless than twenty-four months, so as to primarily achieve liquidity and capital preservation objectives.\nWe anticipate our cash balance and our expected net cash inflows from operations to allow us to meet our near-term\nand long-term cash obligations, which are reflected in our consolidated balance sheets. Our most significant fixed obligations\nare debt obligations and lease commitments, for which annual payments are disclosed in Note 10, Debt, and Note 7, Leases,\nrespectively, to our financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nWe may from time to time seek to retire, redeem or repurchase all or part of our outstanding debt through cash\npurchases and/or exchanges, in open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, by tender offer or otherwise. Such\nrepurchases, redemptions or exchanges, if any, of our debt will depend on prevailing market conditions, liquidity\nrequirements, contractual restrictions and other factors, and the amounts involved may be material.\nIn May 2021, our board of directors authorized a program to repurchase up to $150.0 million of our Class A Common\nStock. The program was completed in May 2022 and the repurchased shares were retired. Additional information regarding\nthe repurchase program is disclosed in Note 12, Stockholders’ Equity, to our financial statements included elsewhere in this\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K.\nSources of Liquidity\nWe had incurred losses since our inception in 1998 and until the year ended December 31, 2019. However, after\nachieving profitability for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2021 and 2022, we incurred a loss of approximately $1.0\nbillion for year ended December 31, 2023 due to the approximately $1.1 billion IPR&D charge recognized in connection with\nthe VectivBio Acquisition, and had an accumulated deficit of approximately $1.7 billion as of December 31, 2023. We have\nfinanced our operations to date primarily through both the private sale of our preferred stock and the public sale of our\ncommon stock, debt financings, and cash generated from our operations. As of December 31, 2023, our debt is comprised of\n$400.0 million aggregate principal amount of convertible notes, due at various dates between 2024 and 2026, and $300.0\nmillion aggregate principal amount outstanding under our Revolving Credit Facility, which we entered into in May 2023 to\npartially finance the VectivBio Acquisition. The Revolving Credit Facility provides for $500.0 million of borrowing capacity\nand includes a $10.0 million letter of credit subfacility. Refer to Note 10, Debt, to our condensed consolidated financial\nstatements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for information related to our debt obligations, including\nthe Revolving Credit Facility.\nSummary of Cash Flows\nThe following table summarizes cash flows from operating, investing, and financing activities for the years ended\nDecember 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2023 2022 2021\n(in thousands)\nNet cash provided by (used in):\nOperating activities $ 183,427 $ 273,763 $ 261,895\nInvesting activities (1,026,318) (136) (265)\nFinancing activities 277,160 (237,553) (4,550)\nEffect of exchange rate changes on cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash (53) — —\nNet increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash $ (565,784) $ 36,074 $ 257,080\n76\nTable of Contents\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities is derived by adjusting net income for non-cash items and changes in\noperating assets and liabilities, which reflect timing differences between the receipt and payment of cash associated with\ntransactions and when they are recognized in the results of operations.\nNet cash inflows during the year ended December 31, 2023 totaled $183.4 million and were derived primarily from\ncollaboration arrangements revenue related to sales of LINZESS in the U.S., partially offset by research and development\nexpenditures for apraglutide and acquisition-related costs in connection with the VectivBio Acquisition.\nNet cash inflows during the year ended December 31, 2022 totaled $273.8 million and were derived primarily from\ncollaboration arrangements revenue related to sales of LINZESS in the U.S.\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\nCash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2023 totaled approximately $1.0 billion and\npertained primarily to the VectivBio Acquisition.\nCash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2022 totaled $0.1 million and pertained to the\npurchase of property and equipment.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\nCash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2023 totaled $277.2 million and was\ngenerated primarily from the incurrence of $400.0 million of borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility, net of $100.0\nmillion of principal repayments. Additionally, we paid $26.3 million to acquire subsidiary shares from noncontrolling interests\nto complete the squeeze-out merger in connection with the VectivBio Acquisition.\nCash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2022 totaled $237.6 million and resulted from\n$126.4 million of share repurchases and repayment of the $120.7 million remaining aggregate principal on the 2022\nConvertible Notes upon maturity in June 2022, partially offset by $9.5 million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options\nand the issuance of shares under our ESPP.\nFunding Requirements\nWe began commercializing LINZESS in the U.S. with our collaboration partner, AbbVie, in the fourth quarter of\n2012, and we currently derive a significant portion of our revenue from this collaboration. Our goal is to generate and\nmaintain positive cash flows, driven by increased revenue generated through sales of LINZESS and other commercial\nactivities and financial discipline, while continuing to invest in the development and commercialization of linaclotide,\napraglutide, and other product candidates.\nUnder our collaboration with AbbVie for North America, total net sales of LINZESS in the U.S., as recorded by\nAbbVie, are reduced by commercial costs incurred by each party, and the resulting amount is shared equally between us and\nAbbVie. Additionally, we receive royalties from AbbVie based on sales of linaclotide in its licensed territories outside of the\nU.S. We believe revenues from our LINZESS partnership for the U.S. with AbbVie will continue to constitute a significant\nportion of our total revenue for the foreseeable future and we cannot be certain that such revenues, as well as the revenues\nfrom our other commercial activities, will continue to enable us to generate positive cash flows, or to do so in the timeframes\nwe expect. We also anticipate that we will continue to incur substantial expenses for the next several years as we further\ndevelop and commercialize linaclotide in the U.S., develop and commercialize other products, including apraglutide, and\ninvest in building our pipeline through internal or external opportunities, including potential payments associated with\nexercising the Option under the COUR Collaboration Agreement. We believe that our cash on hand as of December 31, 2023\nwill be sufficient to meet our projected operating needs at least through the next twelve months from the issuance of these\nfinancial statements.\nOur forecast of the period of time through which our financial resources will be adequate to support our operations,\nincluding the underlying revenue expectations and estimates regarding the costs to continue to develop, obtain regulatory\napproval for, and commercialize linaclotide in the U.S., as well as our expectations regarding revenue\n77\nTable of Contents\nfrom Astellas for Japan and AstraZeneca for China (including Hong Kong and Macau), and our goal to generate and maintain\npositive cash flows, are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could vary\nmaterially and negatively from these and other forward-looking statements as a result of a number of factors, including the\nfactors discussed in the “Risk Factors” section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We have based our estimates on\nassumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could utilize our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect.\nDue to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the development and commercialization of our product\ncandidates, we are unable to estimate precisely the amounts of capital outlays and operating expenditures necessary to\ndevelop, obtain regulatory approval for, and commercialize linaclotide, apraglutide and our other product candidates, in each\ncase, for all of the markets, indications, populations and formulations for which we believe each is suited. Our funding\nrequirements will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to, the following:\n● the revenue generated by sales of LINZESS and CONSTELLA and from any other sources;\n● the rate of progress and cost of our commercialization activities, including the expense we incur in marketing\nand selling LINZESS in the U.S. and from any other sources;\n● the success of our third-party manufacturing activities;\n● the time and costs involved in developing, and obtaining regulatory approvals for, our product candidates,\nincluding apraglutide, as well as the timing and cost of any post-approval development and regulatory\nrequirements;\n● the time and cost associated with integrating VectivBio’s business and assets into our business operations;\n● the time and costs associated with commercial manufacturing, sales, marketing and distribution of apraglutide, if\nsuccessfully developed and approved;\n● the success of our research and development efforts;\n● the emergence of competing or complementary products;\n● the costs of filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights;\n● the terms and timing of any collaborative, licensing or other arrangements that we may establish, including\nmilestones, royalties or other payments due or payable under such agreements;\n● the settlement method used for our outstanding convertible notes; and\n● the acquisition of businesses, products and technologies and the impact of other strategic transactions, as well as\nthe cost and timing of evaluating, acquiring, and, if completed, integrating into our business operations any such\nassets.\nFinancing Strategy\nWe may, from time to time, consider additional funding through a combination of new collaborative arrangements,\nstrategic alliances, and additional equity and debt financings or from other sources. We will continue to manage our capital\nstructure and to consider all financing opportunities, whenever they may occur, that could strengthen our long-term liquidity\nprofile. Any such capital transactions may or may not be similar to transactions in which we have engaged in the past. There\ncan be no assurance that any such financing opportunities will also be available on acceptable terms, if at all.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred\nto as structured finance or special purpose entities, that would have been established for the purpose of\n78\nTable of Contents\nfacilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. As such, we are not exposed to\nany financing, liquidity, market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in those types of relationships. We enter into\nguarantees in the ordinary course of business related to the guarantee of our own performance and the performance of our\nsubsidiaries.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nFor a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements, refer to Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,\nto our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We did not otherwise adopt\nany new accounting pronouncements during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 that had a material effect on our\nconsolidated financial statements included in this report.\nItem 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\nInterest Rate Risk\nWe are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates. We invest our cash in a variety of financial\ninstruments, principally securities issued by the U.S. government and its agencies, including collateralized reverse repurchase\nagreements, and money market instruments, as well as commercial paper. The goals of our investment policy are preservation\nof capital, fulfillment of liquidity needs and fiduciary control of cash and investments. We also seek to maximize income from\nour investments without assuming significant risk.\nOur primary exposure to market risk is interest income sensitivity, which is affected by changes in the general level\nof interest rates, particularly because our investments are in short-term marketable securities. Due to the primarily short-term\nduration of our investment portfolio and the low risk profile of our investments, an immediate 1% change in interest rates\nwould not have a material effect on the fair market value of our portfolio. Accordingly, we would not expect our operating\nresults or cash flows to be affected to any significant degree by the effect of a sudden change in market interest rates on our\ninvestment portfolio.\nWe do not believe our cash and cash equivalents have significant risk of default or illiquidity. While we believe our\ncash and cash equivalents do not contain excessive risk, we cannot provide absolute assurance that in the future our\ninvestments will not be subject to adverse changes in market value. In addition, we maintain significant amounts of cash and\ncash equivalents at one or more financial institutions that are in excess of federally insured limits. Given the potential\ninstability of financial institutions, we cannot provide assurance that we will not experience losses on these deposits.\nOur Convertible Senior Notes bear interest at a fixed rate and therefore have minimal exposure to changes in interest\nrates; however, because these interest rates are fixed, we may be paying a higher interest rate, relative to market, in the future\nif our credit rating improves or other circumstances change.\nWe are exposed to market risks related to fluctuations in interest rates relating to our four-year secured $500.0 million\nRevolving Credit Facility. The increase or decrease in annual interest expense resulting from a 10% increase or decrease in the\napplicable interest rate is $2.2 million.\nEquity Price Risk\nOur convertible notes include conversion and settlement provisions that are based on the price of our Class A\nCommon Stock at conversion or maturity of the notes. The amount of cash we may be required to pay is determined by the\nprice of our Class A Common Stock. The fair values of our convertible notes are dependent on the price and volatility of our\nClass A Common Stock and will generally increase or decrease as the market price of our common stock changes.\nTo minimize the impact of potential dilution to our common stock upon conversion of the notes, we entered into the\nConvertible Note Hedges and Note Hedge Warrants, with respect to the 2022 Convertible Notes, and the Capped Calls, with\nrespect to the 2024 Convertible Notes and 2026 Convertible Notes. The Convertible Note Hedges and Note Hedge Warrants\nterminated unexercised upon expiry in June 2022 and April 2023, respectively.\n79\nTable of Contents\nThe convertible notes and derivatives are more fully described in Note 10, Debt, in the accompanying notes to our\nconsolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nForeign Currency Risk\nWe are also exposed to risks related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates relating to our foreign operations.\nThe functional currency of our international subsidiaries is the local currency. We are exposed to foreign currency risk to the\nextent that we enter into transactions denominated in currencies other than our subsidiaries’ respective functional currencies.\nWe are also exposed to unfavorable fluctuations of the U.S. dollar, which is our reporting currency, against the currencies of\nour operating subsidiaries when their respective financial statements are translated into U.S. dollars for inclusion in our\nconsolidated financial statements. We do not currently hedge our foreign currency exchange rate risk. Foreign currency has\nnot had, nor do we believe that a decrease or increase in any foreign currency exchange rates would have, a material impact on\nour results of operations.\nItem 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\nOur consolidated financial statements, together with the independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst &\nYoung LLP (PCAOB ID: 42), report thereon, appear at pages F-1 through F-47, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nItem 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure\nNone.\nItem 9A. Controls and Procedures\nLimitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures\nIn designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and\nprocedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control\nobjectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints\nand that management is required to apply judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to\ntheir costs.\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nAs required by Rule 13a-15(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or Exchange Act, our management, including\nour principal executive officer and our principal financial officer, conducted an evaluation as of the end of the period covered\nby this Annual Report on Form 10-K of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and\nprocedures. Based on that evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that our\ndisclosure controls and procedures are effective at the reasonable assurance level in ensuring that information required to be\ndisclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported\nwithin the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation,\ncontrols and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file under the\nExchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal\nfinancial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nManagement’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over our financial\nreporting. Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act as the\nprocess designed by, or under the supervision of, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, and effected by our\nboard of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial\nreporting and the preparation of our financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted\naccounting principles, and includes those policies and procedures that:\n(1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions\nand dispositions of assets;\n80\nTable of Contents\n(2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial\nstatements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures\nare being made only in accordance with the authorizations of management and directors; and\n(3) provide reasonable assurance regarding the prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use\nor disposition of assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements.\nAs permitted by guidance issued by the SEC that an assessment of internal control over financial reporting of a\nrecently acquired business may be omitted from management's evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures, management\nexcluded an assessment of the internal controls of VectivBio, which we acquired on June 29, 2023, from its evaluation of the\neffectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures. VectivBio represented approximately 5% of total assets and 6% of\ntotal liabilities as of December 31, 2023, and less than 1% and 2% of revenues and net loss, respectively, for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023.\nUnder the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and\nChief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based\non the framework provided in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations\nof the Treadway Commission (2013 framework). Based on this evaluation, our management concluded that our internal\ncontrol over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2023.\nThe effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023 has been audited by Ernst\nand Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report, which is included herein.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nAs required by Rule 13a-15(d) of the Exchange Act, our management, including our principal executive officer and\nour principal financial officer, conducted an evaluation of the internal control over financial reporting to determine whether\nany changes occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2023 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to\nmaterially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.\nBased on management’s evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded no\nchanges during the quarter ended December 31, 2023 materially affected, or were reasonably likely to materially affect, our\ninternal controls over financial reporting.\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Ironwood Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\nOpinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited Ironwood Pharmaceuticals, Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on\ncriteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the\nTreadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Ironwood Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (the Company)\nmaintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on the\nCOSO criteria.\nAs indicated in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, management’s\nassessment of and conclusion on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting did not include the internal\ncontrols of VectivBio Holding AG, which is included in the 2023 consolidated financial statements of the Company and\nconstituted approximately 5% and 6% of total assets and total liabilities, respectively, as of December 31, 2023 and less than\n1% and 2% of revenues and net loss, respectively, for the year then ended. Our audit of internal control over financial\nreporting of the Company also did not include an evaluation of the internal control over financial reporting of VectivBio\nHolding AG.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)\n(PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the related\n81\nTable of Contents\nconsolidated statements of income (loss), comprehensive income (loss), stockholders’ equity (deficit) and cash flows for each\nof the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023, and the related notes and our report dated February 16, 2024\nexpressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its\nassessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s\nReport on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal\ncontrol over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are\nrequired to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable\nrules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the\naudit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all\nmaterial respects.\nOur audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material\nweakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk,\nand performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a\nreasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the\nreliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally\naccepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures\nthat (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and\ndispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to\npermit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and\nexpenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the\ncompany; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or\ndisposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,\nprojections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate\nbecause of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nBoston, Massachusetts\nFebruary 16, 2024\n82\nTable of Contents\nItem 9B.

(the Company) as of\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022, the related consolidated statements of income (loss), comprehensive income (loss),\nstockholders' equity (deficit) and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023, and the related\nnotes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements\npresent fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results\nof its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023, in conformity with U.S.\ngenerally accepted accounting principles.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)\n(PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in\nInternal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission\n(2013 framework), and our report dated February 16, 2024 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on\nthe Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are\nrequired to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable\nrules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform\nthe audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due\nto error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial\nstatements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included\nexamining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also\nincluded evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the\noverall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nAdoption of New Accounting Standard\nAs discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed its method of accounting for\nconvertible senior notes in 2022 due to the adoption of ASU 2020-06.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that\nwas communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that\nare material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The\ncommunication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements,\ntaken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the\ncritical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nCollaboration Agreement for North America with AbbVie Inc.\nDescription of the Revenue recognized from the Collaboration Agreement for North America with AbbVie Inc. (together\nMatter with its affiliates, or “AbbVie”) was $430.5 million for the sale of LINZESS in the U.S. for the year\nended December 31, 2023. As discussed in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements, the\nCompany generates the majority of its revenue from a collaboration arrangement with AbbVie related\nto linaclotide (LINZESS). The Company records its share of the net profits or net losses from the sale\nof LINZESS in the U.S., less commercial expenses, and presents the\nF-2\nTable of Contents\nsettlement payments to and from AbbVie as collaboration expense or collaborative arrangements\nrevenue, as applicable.\nAuditing revenue recognition under the AbbVie collaboration was especially challenging and required\nsignificant auditor judgment because the Company relies on AbbVie for timely and accurate\ninformation regarding net profits realized from the sale of LINZESS in the U.S. Management uses the\ninformation provided by AbbVie, which includes net revenues from sales of LINZESS in the U.S. and\nrelated costs, to record its collaboration revenue. Certain of such information received from AbbVie are\ndetermined by AbbVie by using estimates and judgments, which could be adjusted based on actual\nresults in the future.\nHow We Addressed We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of the\nthe Matter in Our Company’s internal controls over its collaboration revenue process, including controls over the\nAudit Company’s evaluation of the completeness and accuracy of information related to net sales of\nLINZESS provided from AbbVie.\nOur audit procedures included, among others, inspecting reported information provided by AbbVie to\nthe Company related to the net profits realized from the sale of LINZESS in the U.S. We analyzed the\ngross sales and certain adjustments to arrive at net sales, cost of goods sold, and related costs\ncontributing to Ironwood’s share of net profits and compared current period results to historical trends.\nWe also tested settlement payments received by the Company throughout the year. In addition, we\nconfirmed directly with AbbVie the collaborative arrangement revenue for the year ended December\n31, 2023 related to the sale of LINZESS in the U.S. as well as the amounts due to the Company as of\nDecember 31, 2023.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 1998.\nBoston, Massachusetts\nFebruary 16, 2024\nF-3\nTable of Contents\nIronwood

Nature of Business\nIronwood Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“Ironwood” or the “Company”) is a gastrointestinal (“GI”) healthcare company\ndedicated to advancing the treatment of GI diseases and redefining the standard of care for GI patients. The Company is\nfocused on the development and commercialization of innovative GI product opportunities in areas of significant unmet need,\nleveraging its demonstrated expertise and capabilities in GI diseases.\nLINZESS® (linaclotide), the Company’s commercial product, is the first product approved by the United States Food\nand Drug Administration (the “U.S. FDA”) in a class of GI medicines called guanylate cyclase type C agonists (“GC-C\nagonists”) and is indicated for adult men and women suffering from irritable bowel syndrome with constipation (“IBS-C”) or\nchronic idiopathic constipation (“CIC”) and for pediatric patients ages 6-17 years-old suffering from functional constipation\n(“FC”). LINZESS is available to adult men and women suffering from IBS-C or CIC in the United States (the “U.S.”),\nMexico and Saudi Arabia, to adult men and women suffering from IBS-C or chronic constipation in Japan, IBS-C in China,\nand pediatric patients ages 6-17 years old with FC in the U.S. Linaclotide is available under the trademarked name\nCONSTELLA® to adult men and women suffering from IBS-C or CIC in Canada, and to adult men and women suffering\nfrom IBS-C in certain European countries.\nThe Company has strategic partnerships with leading pharmaceutical companies to support the development and\ncommercialization of linaclotide throughout the world. The Company and its partner, AbbVie Inc. (together with its affiliates,\n“AbbVie”), began commercializing LINZESS in the U.S. in December 2012. Under the Company’s collaboration for North\nAmerica with AbbVie, total net sales of LINZESS in the U.S., as recorded by AbbVie, are reduced by commercial costs\nincurred by each party, and the resulting amount is shared equally between the Company and AbbVie. Additionally,\ndevelopment costs are shared equally between the Company and AbbVie.\nOutside of the U.S., the Company earns royalties as a percentage of net sales of products containing linaclotide as an\nactive ingredient by the Company’s collaboration partners. AbbVie has an exclusive license from the Company to develop and\ncommercialize linaclotide in all countries other than China (including Hong Kong and Macau), Japan and the countries and\nterritories of North America (the “AbbVie License Territory”). In addition, AbbVie has exclusive rights to commercialize\nlinaclotide in Canada as CONSTELLA and in Mexico as LINZESS. Astellas Pharma Inc. (“Astellas”), the Company’s partner\nin Japan, has an exclusive license to develop, manufacture, and commercialize linaclotide in Japan. AstraZeneca AB (together\nwith its affiliates) (“AstraZeneca”), the Company’s partner in China, has the exclusive right to develop, manufacture, and\ncommercialize products containing linaclotide in China (including Hong Kong and Macau) (the “AstraZeneca License\nTerritory”).\nIn June 2023, the Company completed a tender offer to purchase 98% of the outstanding ordinary shares of VectivBio\nHolding AG (“VectivBio”), a clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on the discovery and development of treatments\nfor severe, rare GI conditions for which there is a significant unmet medical need. In December 2023, the Company completed\na squeeze-out merger under Swiss law to acquire all remaining outstanding ordinary shares and VectivBio Holding AG was\nmerged with and into Ironwood Pharmaceuticals GmbH, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Ironwood organized under the laws of\nSwitzerland. Through the acquisition, the Company is advancing apraglutide, a next-generation, synthetic peptide analog of\nglucagon-like peptide-2 (“GLP-2”), for rare GI diseases, including short bowel syndrome dependent on parenteral support\n(“SBS-IF”).\nThe Company has a collaboration and license option agreement (the “COUR Collaboration Agreement”) with COUR\nPharmaceutical Development Company, Inc. (“COUR”), a biotechnology company developing novel immune-modifying\nnanoparticles to treat autoimmune diseases. The COUR Collaboration Agreement grants the Company an option to acquire an\nexclusive license to research, develop, manufacture and commercialize, in the U.S., products containing CNP-104, a potential\ntreatment for primary biliary cholangitis, a rare autoimmune disease targeting the liver.\nThese and other agreements are more fully described in Note 5, Collaboration, License, and Other Agreements, to\nthese consolidated financial statements.\nF-9\nTable of Contents\nThe Company is also advancing IW-3300, a GC-C agonist, for the potential treatment of visceral pain conditions,\nincluding interstitial cystitis / bladder pain syndrome (“IC/BPS”) and endometriosis.\nThe Company was incorporated in Delaware on January 5, 1998 as Microbia, Inc. On April 7, 2008, the Company\nchanged its name to Ironwood Pharmaceuticals, Inc. To date, the Company has dedicated a majority of its activities to the\nresearch, development and commercialization of linaclotide, as well as to the research and development of its other product\ncandidates.\n2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2023 include the accounts of Ironwood, its\nwholly-owned subsidiaries, Ironwood Pharmaceuticals Securities Corporation and Ironwood Pharmaceuticals GmbH, as well\nas Ironwood Pharmaceuticals GmbH’s wholly-owned subsidiaries, VectivBio AG, VectivBio Comet AG, GlyPharma\nTherapeutic Inc. and VectivBio US, Inc. All intercompany transactions and balances are eliminated in consolidation.\nFor consolidated entities in which the Company owns less than 100% of the outstanding shares, the Company records\nnet income (loss) and comprehensive income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests in its consolidated statements of\nincome (loss) and comprehensive income (loss), respectively, equal to the percentage of the common stock ownership interest\nretained in such entities by the noncontrolling parties. The Company reports noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities as\na component of equity separate from the Company’s equity.\nThe Company acquired control of VectivBio on June 29, 2023 (Note 3). Accordingly, the accompanying consolidated\nfinancial statements reflect the results of operations and cash flows of VectivBio from the acquisition date through December\n31, 2023. Net income (loss) and comprehensive income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests was recorded during the\nperiod between the acquisition date and the completion of the squeeze-out merger on December 12, 2023 (Note 1). As of\nDecember 31, 2023, there were no remaining noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities.\nSegment Information\nOperating segments are components of an enterprise for which separate financial information is available and is\nevaluated regularly by the Company’s chief operating decision-maker in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing\nperformance. The Company currently operates in one reportable business segment – human therapeutics.\nReclassifications\nCertain prior period financial statement items have been reclassified to conform to current period presentation.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting\nprinciples requires the Company’s management to make estimates and judgments that may affect the reported amounts of\nassets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, and\nthe amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported periods. On an ongoing basis, the Company’s management\nevaluates its estimates, judgments and methodologies. Estimates and assumptions in the consolidated financial statements\ninclude those related to fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in acquisitions; revenue recognition; accounts\nreceivable; useful lives of long-lived assets, impairment of long-lived assets, including goodwill; valuation procedures for\nright-of-use assets and operating lease liabilities; fair value of derivatives; income taxes, including uncertain tax positions and\nthe valuation allowance for deferred tax assets; research and development expenses; contingencies; defined benefit pension\nliability; and share-based compensation. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other\nassumptions that are believed to be reasonable, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying\nvalues of assets and liabilities. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or\nconditions. Changes in estimates are reflected in reported results in the period in which they become known.\nF-10\nTable of Contents\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nThe Company considers all highly liquid investment instruments with a remaining maturity when purchased of three\nmonths or less to be cash equivalents. Investments qualifying as cash equivalents primarily consist of money market funds,\nrepurchase agreements, commercial paper, and corporate bonds. The carrying amount of cash equivalents approximates fair\nvalue. The amount of cash equivalents included in cash and cash equivalents was $58.7 million and $650.2 million at\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nRestricted Cash\nThe Company is contingently liable under unused letters of credit with a bank, related to the Company’s facility lease\nand vehicle lease agreements. Collateral used to secure letters of credit is classified as restricted cash. The amount of restricted\ncash in current assets and non-current assets was $1.3 million and $0.5 million at December 31, 2022, respectively. There was\nno restricted cash as of December 31, 2023.\nConcentrations of Suppliers\nThe Company relies on its collaboration partners and their suppliers to manufacture linaclotide API, linaclotide\nfinished drug product, and finished goods.\nIf any of the Company’s collaboration partners and their suppliers were to limit or terminate production or otherwise\nfail to meet the quality or delivery requirements needed to satisfy the supply commitments, the process of locating and\nqualifying alternate sources could require up to several months, during which time production could be delayed. Such delays\ncould have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial position and results of operations.\nAccounts Receivable\nThe Company makes judgments as to its ability to collect outstanding receivables and provides an allowance for\ncredit losses when collection becomes doubtful. Provisions are made based upon a specific review of all significant\noutstanding invoices and the overall quality and age of those invoices not specifically reviewed. The Company’s receivables\nrelate primarily to amounts reimbursed under its collaboration, license, and other agreements. The Company believes that\ncredit risks associated with these partners are not significant. The Company reviews the need for an allowance for credit losses\nfor its receivables based on various factors including payment history and historical bad debt experience. The Company had\nno allowance for credit losses as of December 31, 2023 or 2022.\nConcentrations of Credit Risk\nFinancial instruments that subject the Company to credit risk primarily consist of cash and cash equivalents,\nrestricted cash, and accounts receivable. The Company maintains its cash and cash equivalent balances with high-quality\nfinancial institutions and the Company believes that such funds are subject to minimal credit risk. The Company has adopted\nan investment policy which limits the amounts the Company may invest in certain types of investments, and requires all\ninvestments held by the Company to be at least A- rated, thereby reducing credit risk exposure.\nAccounts receivable primarily consists of amounts due under the linaclotide collaboration agreement with AbbVie for\nNorth America (Note 5). The Company does not obtain collateral for its accounts receivable.\nThe percentages of revenue recognized from significant collaborative partners of the Company in the years ended\nDecember 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 and the account receivable balances, net of any payables due, at December 31, 2023 and\n2022 are included in the following table:\nAccounts\nReceivable Revenue\nDecember 31, Year Ended December 31,\n2023 2022 2023 2022 2021\nCollaborative Partner:\nAbbVie (North America and Europe) 87 % 80 % 98 % 98 % 98 %\nF-11\nTable of Contents\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment, including leasehold improvements, are recorded at cost, and are depreciated when placed\ninto service using the straight-line method based on their estimated useful lives as follows:\nEstimated(cid:0)(cid:3)Useful Life\nAsset Description (In Years)\nLaboratory equipment 5\nComputer and office equipment 3\nFurniture and fixtures 7\nSoftware 3\nIncluded in property and equipment are certain costs of software obtained for internal use. Costs incurred during the\npreliminary project stage are expensed as incurred, while costs incurred during the application development stage are\ncapitalized and amortized over the estimated useful life of the software. The Company also capitalizes costs related to specific\nupgrades and enhancements when it is probable the expenditures will result in additional functionality. Maintenance and\ntraining costs related to software obtained for internal use are expensed as incurred.\nLeasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset or the lease term.\nCosts for capital assets not yet placed into service have been capitalized as construction in process, and will be\ndepreciated in accordance with the above guidelines once placed into service. Maintenance and repair costs are expensed as\nincurred.\nIntangible Assets\nIntangible assets are comprised of the assembled workforce acquired in the VectivBio Acquisition and are amortized\non a straight-line basis over an estimated useful life of five years.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nThe Company regularly reviews the carrying amount of its long-lived assets to determine whether indicators of\nimpairment may exist, which warrant adjustments to carrying values or estimated useful lives. If indications of impairment\nexist, projected future undiscounted cash flows associated with the asset are compared to the carrying amount to determine\nwhether the asset’s value is recoverable. If the carrying value of the asset exceeds such projected undiscounted cash flows, the\nasset will be written down to its estimated fair value.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company provides for income taxes under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are\ndetermined based on differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the\nenacted tax rates in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation\nallowance to reflect the uncertainty associated with their ultimate realization.\nThe Company accounts for uncertain tax positions recognized in the consolidated financial statements in accordance\nwith the provisions of Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 740, Income Taxes, by prescribing a more-likely-\nthan-not threshold for financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax\nreturn. When uncertain tax positions exist, the Company recognizes the tax benefit of tax positions to the extent that the\nbenefit will more likely than not be realized. The determination as to whether the tax benefit will more likely than not be\nrealized is based upon the technical merits of the tax position as well as consideration of the available facts and circumstances.\nThe Company evaluates uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis and adjusts the level of the liability to reflect any\nsubsequent changes in the relevant facts surrounding the uncertain positions. Any changes to these estimates, based on the\nactual results obtained and/or a change in assumptions, could impact the Company’s income tax provision in future periods.\nInterest and penalty charges, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits are classified as income tax expense in the Company’s\nconsolidated statements of income (loss).\nF-12\nTable of Contents\nFinancing Costs\nFinancing costs include costs directly attributable to the Company’s offerings of its equity securities and its debt\nfinancings. Costs attributable to equity offerings are charged as a reduction to stockholders’ equity against the proceeds of the\noffering once the offering is completed. Costs attributable to debt financings are deferred and amortized to interest expense\nover the term of the debt using the effective interest method. In accordance with ASC Topic 835, Interest, the Company\npresents on its balance sheet unamortized debt issuance costs related to convertible notes as a direct deduction from the\nassociated debt liability and unamortized debt issuance costs related to revolving credit arrangements as other assets.\nLeases\nThe Company’s lease portfolio for the year ended December 31, 2023 included: an office lease for its headquarters\nlocation and other locations, vehicle leases for its salesforce representatives, and leases for computer and office equipment.\nThe Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at the inception of the contract and determines the classification of its\nleases at lease commencement. The asset component of the Company’s operating leases is recorded as operating lease right-\nof-use assets, and the liability component is recorded as current portion of operating lease liabilities and operating lease\nliabilities, net of current portion in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. As of December 31, 2023, the Company did\nnot record any finance leases.\nRight-of-use assets and operating lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of lease payments over\nthe lease term at the lease commencement date. The lease term used to measure the right-of-use asset and operating lease\nliability may include options to extend the lease when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise the option. The\nCompany accounts for lease components and non-lease components together as a single lease component for the asset class of\nright-of-use real estate assets. The Company uses an incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at lease\ncommencement in determining the present value of lease payments, if an implicit rate of return is not readily determinable.\nOperating lease right-of-use assets are adjusted for prepaid rent, initial direct costs, and lease incentives.\nRight-of-use assets and operating lease liabilities are remeasured upon reassessment events and modifications to\nleases using the present value of remaining lease payments and estimated incremental borrowing rate at the time of\nremeasurement, as applicable.\nOperating lease cost is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term, and includes amounts related to short-\nterm leases. The Company has elected to not recognize lease terms with a term of twelve months or less on its balance sheet\nfor all classes of underlying asset types. The Company recognizes variable lease payments as operating expenses in the period\nin which the obligation for those payments is incurred. Variable lease payments primarily include common area maintenance,\nutilities, real estate taxes, insurance, and other operating costs that are passed on from the lessor in proportion to the space\nleased by the Company.\nDerivative Assets and Liabilities\nIn June 2015, the Company issued 2.25% Convertible Senior Notes due June 15, 2022 (the “2022 Convertible\nNotes”), and in August 2019, the Company issued 0.75% Convertible Senior Notes due 2024 (the “2024 Convertible Notes”)\nand 1.50% Convertible Senior Notes due 2026 (the “2026 Convertible Notes”, and together with the 2022 Convertible Notes\nand the 2024 Convertible Notes, the “Convertible Senior Notes”). In connection with the issuance of the 2022 Convertible\nNotes, the Company entered into convertible note hedge transactions (the “Convertible Note Hedges”) and separate note\nhedge warrant transactions (the “Note Hedge Warrants”), with certain financial institutions (Note 10). In connection with the\npartial repurchase of the 2022 Convertible Notes in August 2019, the Company terminated its Convertible Note Hedges and\nNote Hedge Warrants proportionately. The Convertible Note Hedges terminated unexercised upon expiry in June 2022 and the\nNote Hedge Warrants terminated unexercised upon expiry in April 2023. These instruments are derivative financial\ninstruments under ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging (“ASC 815”).\nThese derivatives are recorded as assets or liabilities at fair value each reporting date and the fair value is determined\nusing the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The changes in fair value are recorded as a component of\nF-13\nTable of Contents\nother (expense) income in the consolidated statements of income. Significant inputs used to determine the fair value include\nthe price per share of the Company’s Class A Common Stock, expected terms of the derivative instruments, strike prices of the\nderivative instruments, risk-free interest rates, and expected volatility of the Company’s Class A Common Stock. Changes to\nthese inputs could materially affect the valuation of the derivative instruments.\nIn August 2019, in connection with the issuance of the 2024 Convertible Notes and the 2026 Convertible Notes, the\nCompany entered into the Capped Calls. The Capped Calls cover the same number of shares of Class A Common Stock that\ninitially underlie the 2024 Convertible Notes and the 2026 Convertible Notes (subject to anti-dilution and certain other\nadjustments). These instruments meet the conditions outlined in ASC 815 to be classified in stockholders’ equity (deficit) and\nare not subsequently remeasured as long as the conditions for equity classification continue to be met.\nShare Repurchases\nThe Company accounts for repurchases of its Class A Common Stock on the trade date by recording the excess of the\nrepurchase price over the par value entirely to additional paid-in capital. All repurchased shares are retired or constructively\nretired. Issued and outstanding shares are reduced by shares repurchased.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company’s revenues are generated primarily through collaborative arrangements and license agreements related\nto the research and development and commercialization of linaclotide. The terms of the collaborative research and\ndevelopment, license, co-promotion and other agreements contain multiple performance obligations which may include (i)\nlicenses, (ii) research and development activities, including participation on joint steering committees, (iii) the manufacture of\nfinished drug product, API, or development materials for a partner, which are reimbursed at a contractually determined rate,\nand (iv) education or co-promotion activities by the Company’s clinical sales specialists. Non-refundable payments to the\nCompany under these agreements may include (i) up-front license fees, (ii) payments for research and development activities,\n(iii) payments for the manufacture of finished drug product, API, or development materials, (iv) payments based upon the\nachievement of certain milestones, (v) payments for sales detailing, promotional support services and medical education\ninitiatives, and (vi) royalties on product sales. The Company receives its share of the net profits or bears its share of the net\nlosses from the sale of linaclotide in the U.S. through its collaboration agreement with AbbVie for North America. The\nCompany has adopted a policy to recognize revenue net of tax withholdings, as applicable.\nCollaboration, License, and Other Commercial Agreements\nUpon licensing intellectual property to a customer, the Company determines if the license is distinct from the other\nperformance obligations identified in the arrangement. The Company recognizes revenues from the transaction price,\nincluding non-refundable, up-front fees allocated to the license when the license is transferred to the customer if the license\nhas distinct benefit to the customer. For licenses that are combined with other promises, the Company assesses the nature of\nthe combined performance obligation to determine whether the combined performance obligation is satisfied over time or at a\npoint in time. For performance obligations that are satisfied over time, the Company evaluates the measure of progress each\nreporting period and, if necessary, adjusts the measure of performance and related revenue recognition.\nThe Company’s license and collaboration agreements include milestone payments, such as development and other\nmilestones. The Company evaluates whether the milestones are considered probable of being reached and estimates the\namount to be included in the transaction price using the most likely amount method at the inception of the agreement. If it is\nprobable that a significant revenue reversal would not occur, the associated milestone value is included in the transaction\nprice. Milestone payments that are not within the control of the Company, such as regulatory approvals, are not considered\nprobable of being achieved until those approvals are received. The transaction price is then allocated to each performance\nobligation on a relative standalone selling price basis, for which the Company recognizes revenue as or when the performance\nobligations under the contract are satisfied. The Company re-evaluates the probability of achievement of such milestones and\nany related constraint at each reporting period, and any adjustments are recorded on a cumulative catch-up basis.\nF-14\nTable of Contents\nAgreements that include the supply of API or drug product for either clinical development or commercial supply at\nthe customer’s discretion are generally considered as options. The Company assesses if these options provide a material right\nto its partner, and if so, they are accounted for as separate performance obligations. If the Company is entitled to additional\npayments when the customer exercises these options, any additional payments are recorded as revenue when the customer\nobtains control of the goods, which is typically upon shipment for sales of API and finished drug product.\nFor agreements that include sales-based royalties, including milestone payments based on the level of sales, and the\nlicense is deemed to be the predominant item to which the royalties relate, the Company recognizes revenue when the related\nsales occur in accordance with the sales-based royalty exception.\nNet Profit or Net Loss Sharing\nIn accordance with ASC Topic 808, Collaborative Arrangements (“ASC 808”), the Company considers the nature\nand contractual terms of the arrangement and the nature of the Company’s business operations to determine the classification\nof payments under the Company’s collaboration agreements. While ASC 808 provides guidance on classification, the standard\nis silent on matters of separation, initial measurement, and recognition. Therefore, the Company applies the separation, initial\nmeasurement, and recognition principles of ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (“ASC 606”), as\napplicable.\nThe Company’s collaborative arrangements revenues generated from sales of LINZESS in the U.S. are considered\nakin to sales-based royalties. In accordance with the sales-based royalty exception, the Company recognizes its share of the\npre-tax commercial net profit or net loss generated from the sales of LINZESS in the U.S. in the period the product sales are\nearned, as reported by AbbVie, and related cost of goods sold and selling, general and administrative expenses as incurred by\nthe Company and AbbVie. These amounts are partially determined based on amounts provided by AbbVie and involve the use\nof estimates and judgments, such as product sales allowances and accruals related to prompt payment discounts, chargebacks,\ngovernmental and contractual rebates, wholesaler fees, product returns, and co-payment assistance costs, which could be\nadjusted based on actual results in the future. The Company is highly dependent on AbbVie for timely and accurate\ninformation regarding net revenues from sales of LINZESS in the U.S. in accordance with both ASC 808 and ASC 606, and\nthe related costs, in order to accurately report its results of operations. If the Company does not receive timely and accurate\ninformation or incorrectly estimates activity levels associated with the collaboration at a given point in time, the Company\ncould be required to record adjustments in future periods.\nIn accordance with ASC 606-10-55, Principal Agent Considerations, the Company records revenue transactions as\nnet product revenue in its consolidated statements of income if it is deemed the principal in the transaction, which includes\nbeing the primary obligor, retaining inventory risk, and control over pricing. Given that the Company is not the primary\nobligor and does not have the inventory risks in the collaboration agreement with AbbVie for North America, it records its\nshare of the net profits or net losses from the sales of LINZESS in the U.S. on a net basis and presents the settlement payments\nto and from AbbVie as collaboration expense or collaborative arrangements revenue, as applicable. The Company and AbbVie\nsettle the cost sharing quarterly such that the Company’s statements of income reflect 50% of the pre-tax net profit or loss\ngenerated from sales of LINZESS in the U.S.\nSale of Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient\nThe Company is not currently responsible for the supply of linaclotide API, finished drug product, finished goods or\ndevelopment materials to its partners, though the Company may provide development materials to certain of its partners on a\nperiodic basis. Sales of such development materials have been and are expected to continue to be immaterial.\nThe Company recognizes revenue on linaclotide API, finished drug product, finished goods, and development\nmaterials when control has transferred to the partner, which generally occurs upon shipment after the material passed all\nquality testing required for acceptance by the partner.\nF-15\nTable of Contents\nOther\nThe Company’s deferred revenue balance consists of advance billings and payments received from collaboration\npartners in excess of revenue recognized.\nCost of Revenues\nCost of revenues includes cost related to the sales of linaclotide API, finished drug product, and finished goods and\nare generally recognized upon shipment to certain of the Company’s partners outside of the U.S. The Company’s cost of\nrevenues for linaclotide consists of the internal and external costs of producing such API, finished drug product, and finished\ngoods.\nResearch and Development Costs\nThe Company generally expenses research and development costs to operations as incurred. The Company\ncapitalizes nonrefundable advance payments made by the Company for research and development activities and defers\nexpense recognition until the related goods are received or the related services are performed.\nResearch and development expenses are comprised of costs incurred in performing research and development\nactivities, including salary, benefits, share-based compensation, and other employee-related expenses; laboratory supplies and\nother direct expenses; facilities expenses; overhead expenses; third-party contractual costs relating to nonclinical studies and\nclinical trial activities and related contract manufacturing expenses, development of manufacturing processes and regulatory\nregistration of third-party manufacturing facilities; licensing fees for the Company’s product candidates; and other outside\nexpenses.\nThe Company has certain collaboration agreements pursuant to which it shares or has shared research and\ndevelopment expenses related to linaclotide. The Company records expenses incurred under such linaclotide collaboration\narrangements as research and development expense. Under the Company’s collaboration agreement with AbbVie for North\nAmerica, the Company is reimbursed for certain research and development expenses and nets these reimbursements against its\nresearch and development expenses as incurred.\nResearch and development expense includes up-front payment, non-contingent payment, and milestone payment\nobligations under the COUR Collaboration Agreement (Note 5). Expense is recognized when the obligation is determined to\nbe probable.\nRestructuring Expenses\nRestructuring expenses are comprised primarily of costs associated with exit and disposal activities in accordance\nwith ASC Topic 420, Exit or Disposal Cost Obligations, and ASC Topic 712, Compensation – Nonretirement Postemployment\nBenefits, and include one-time termination benefits and contract-related costs. Such costs are based on estimates of fair value\nin the period liabilities are incurred. The Company evaluates and adjusts these costs for changes in circumstances as additional\ninformation becomes available.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nThe Company expenses selling, general and administrative costs to operations as incurred. Selling, general and\nadministrative expenses consist primarily of compensation, benefits and other employee-related expenses for personnel in the\nCompany’s administrative, finance, legal, information technology, business development, commercial, sales, marketing,\ncommunications and human resources functions. Other costs include the legal costs of pursuing patent protection of the\nCompany’s intellectual property, general and administrative related facility costs, insurance costs and professional fees for\naccounting, tax, consulting, legal and other services.\nThe Company includes AbbVie’s selling, general and administrative cost-sharing payments in the calculation of the\nnet profits and net losses from the sale of LINZESS in the U.S. and presents the net payment to or from AbbVie as\ncollaboration expense or collaborative arrangements revenue, respectively.\nF-16\nTable of Contents\nShare-Based Compensation Expense\nThe Company grants awards under its share-based compensation programs, including stock awards, restricted stock\nawards (“RSAs”), restricted stock units (“RSUs”) (including both time-based and performance-based RSUs), stock options,\nand shares issued under the Company’s employee stock purchase plan (“ESPP”). Share-based compensation is recognized as\nexpense in the consolidated statements of income based on the grant date fair value over the requisite service period, net of\nestimated forfeitures. The Company estimates forfeitures over the requisite service period using historical forfeiture activity\nand records share-based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest.\nThe Company estimates the fair value of stock options using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which requires\nthe use of subjective assumptions including volatility and expected term, among others. The fair value of stock awards, RSAs,\nand RSUs is based on the market value of the Company’s Class A Common Stock on the date of grant, with the exception of\nperformance-based RSUs with market conditions, which are measured using the Monte Carlo simulation method on the date\nof grant (Note 13). Discounted stock purchases under the Company’s ESPP are valued on the first date of the offering period\nusing the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to compute the fair value of the lookback provision plus the purchase discount.\nFor awards that vest based on service conditions and market conditions, the Company uses a straight-line method to\nrecognize compensation expense over the respective service period. For awards that contain performance conditions, the\nCompany determines the appropriate amount to expense at each reporting date based on the anticipated achievement of\nperformance targets, which requires judgement, including forecasting the achievement of future specified targets. At the date\nperformance conditions are determined to be probable of achievement, the Company records a cumulative expense catch-up,\nwith remaining expense amortized over the remaining service period. Throughout the performance period, the Company re-\nassesses the estimated performance and updates the number of performance-based awards that it believes will ultimately vest.\nDiscounted stock purchases under the Company’s ESPP are recognized over the offering period.\nCompensation expense related to modified awards is measured based on the fair value for the awards as of the\nmodification date. Any incremental compensation expense arising from the excess of the fair value of the awards on the\nmodification date compared to the fair value of the awards immediately before the modification date is recognized at the\nmodification date or ratably over the requisite remaining service period, as appropriate.\nWhile the assumptions used to calculate and account for share-based compensation awards represent management’s\nbest estimates, these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management’s judgment. As a result, if\nrevisions are made to the Company’s underlying assumptions and estimates, the Company’s share-based compensation\nexpense could vary significantly from period to period.\nPatent Costs\nThe Company incurred and recorded as operating expense legal and other fees related to patents of $1.8 million, $1.3\nmillion, and $1.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. These costs were charged to\nselling, general and administrative expenses as incurred.\nNet Income (Loss) Per Share\nBasic net income (loss) per common share is computed by dividing the net income by the weighted average number\nof common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net income (loss) per share reflects the potential dilution beyond\ncommon shares for basic net income (loss) per share that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common shares\nwere exercised, converted into common shares, or resulted in the issuance of common shares that would have shared in the\nCompany’s earnings.\nForeign Currency Translation\nFor subsidiaries with a different functional currency than the U.S. dollar, assets and liabilities are translated at the\nexchange rate as of the balance sheet date and income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rate for the\nreporting period. Adjustments resulting from the translation of the financial statements of foreign subsidiaries are recorded in\naccumulated comprehensive income (loss), a separate component of stockholders’ equity.\nF-17\nTable of Contents\nAcquisitions\nThe Company evaluates acquisitions of assets and other similar transactions to assess whether the transaction should\nbe accounted for as a business combination or asset acquisition by first applying a screen test to determine whether\nsubstantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired is concentrated into a single identifiable asset or group of similar\nidentifiable assets. If the screen test is met, a single asset or group of assets is not a business and is accounted for as an asset\nacquisition. If the screen test is not met, further determination is required as to whether the Company has acquired inputs and\nprocesses that have the ability to create outputs that would meet the requirements of a business.\nThe Company accounts for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires the\nacquiring entity to recognize the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed and establishes the acquisition date as the\nfair value measurement point. The Company determines the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on\nmanagement’s estimate of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the acquisition. Goodwill represents the\nexcess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired. Transaction costs are\nexpensed as incurred.\nThe Company accounts for asset acquisitions that are not determined to be a business combination by recognizing net\nassets based on the consideration paid, inclusive of transaction costs, on a relative fair value basis. In an asset acquisition, the\ncost allocated to acquired in-process research and development (“IPR&D”) with no alternative future use is charged to\nresearch and development expense at the acquisition date. The Company classifies asset acquisitions of acquired IPR&D as\ninvesting activities on its consolidated statements of cash flows.\nComprehensive Income (Loss)\nComprehensive income (loss) is comprised of net income (loss) and other comprehensive income (loss). Other\ncomprehensive income (loss) includes foreign currency translation adjustments and certain changes in the fair value of\npension plan assets and projected benefit obligation attributed to the Company’s defined benefit pension plans. Accumulated\nother comprehensive income (loss) is presented as a separate component of stockholders’ equity (deficit).\nSubsequent Events\nThe Company considers events or transactions that have occurred after the balance sheet date of December 31, 2023,\nbut prior to the filing of the financial statements with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) to provide additional\nevidence relative to certain estimates or to identify matters that require additional recognition or disclosure. Subsequent events\nhave been evaluated through the filing of the financial statements accompanying this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nFrom time to time, new accounting pronouncements are issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the\n“FASB”) or other standard setting bodies that are adopted by the Company as of the specified effective date. The Company\ndid not adopt any new accounting pronouncements during the year ended December 31, 2023 that had a material effect on its\nconsolidated financial statements.\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic\n280) (“ASU 2023-07”). The guidance in ASU 2023-07 expands prior reportable segment disclosure requirements by requiring\nentities to disclose significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to the Chief Operating Decision Maker\n(“CODM”) and details of how the CODM uses financial reporting to assess their segment’s performance. The guidance is\neffective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2023, with early\nadoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of ASU 2023-07 may have on its\nconsolidated financial statements.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax\nDisclosures (“ASU 2023-09”). The guidance in ASU 2023-09 improves the transparency of income tax disclosures by greater\ndisaggregation of information in the rate reconciliation and income taxes paid disaggregated by jurisdiction. The standard is\neffective for public companies for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. The\nCompany is currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of ASU 2023-09 may have on its consolidated financial\nstatements.\nF-18\nTable of Contents\nOther recent accounting pronouncements issued, but not yet effective, are not expected to be applicable to the\nCompany or have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements upon future adoption.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company adopted the following accounting pronouncement that had\na material effect on its consolidated financial statements:\nIn August 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-06, Debt—Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-\n20) and Derivatives and Hedging— Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40): Accounting for Convertible\nInstruments and Contracts in an Entity’s Own Equity (“ASU 2020-06”). The amendments in ASU 2020-06 simplify the\naccounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of liabilities and equity, including convertible instruments and\ncontracts on an entity’s own equity. Under ASU 2020-06, embedded conversion features are no longer separately reported in\nequity and convertible debt instruments are now accounted for as a single liability measured at amortized cost, as long as no\nother features require bifurcation and recognition as derivatives. These changes reduce reported interest expense and increase\nreported net income for entities with convertible instruments that were bifurcated between liabilities and equity under\npreviously existing guidance. Additionally, temporary differences between the book and tax bases resulting from the\nbifurcation of the embedded conversion feature under previously existing guidance have been eliminated and deferred tax\nassets and liabilities arising from such temporary differences are no longer reported. The new guidance also requires the if-\nconverted method to be used in diluted earnings per share computations for all convertible instruments and revised the if-\nconverted method to preclude the addback of interest expense to the numerator if the principal portions of the convertible\ninstruments are required to be settled in cash. The standard became effective for public companies for fiscal years, and interim\nperiods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2021. Upon adoption, entities could elect to apply the new\nstandard on a modified retrospective or full retrospective basis.\nThe Company adopted ASU 2020-06 on January 1, 2022 using the modified retrospective approach, which resulted\nin a cumulative-effect adjustment recorded on the date of adoption as follows (in thousands):\nDecember 31, 2021 Effect of the Adoption January 1, 2022\nConsolidated Balance Sheet (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)(cid:3) As Reported of ASU 2020-06 As Adjusted\nDeferred tax assets $ 333,294 $ 16,855 $ 350,149\nCurrent portion of convertible senior notes 116,858 3,581 120,439\nLong-term portion of convertible senior notes 337,333 57,324 394,657\nAdditional paid-in-capital 1,543,357 (110,217) 1,433,140\nRetained earnings (937,608) 66,167 (871,441)\nInterest expense recognized in subsequent periods is reduced as a result of accounting for convertible debt\ninstruments as a single liability measured at amortized cost, with a decrease of $22.1 million of non-cash interest expense\nduring the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the year ended December 31, 2021 related to convertible debt\ninstruments outstanding on the adoption date.\nThe adoption of ASU 2020-06 does not impact the Company’s liquidity or cash flows.\n3.Acquisitions\nOn June 29, 2023, the Company completed a tender offer to purchase 98% of the outstanding ordinary shares of\nVectivBio (the “VectivBio Shares”) at a price per share of $17.00, net to the shareholders of VectivBio in cash, without interest\nand subject to any applicable withholding taxes (the “VectivBio Acquisition”). The aggregate consideration paid by the\nCompany to acquire the shares accepted for payment was approximately $1.2 billion. The Company financed the acquisition\nthrough proceeds from the borrowings under the Revolving Credit Agreement (as defined elsewhere below), cash on hand.\nThe total purchase consideration for VectivBio is as follows (in thousands):\nCash consideration paid to selling shareholders (1) $ 1,041,391\nCash consideration paid to settle VectivBio restricted stock units (“RSUs”) and stock options (2) 78,003\nCash consideration paid to settle VectivBio warrants (3) 3,720\nF-19\nTable of Contents\nTransaction costs 26,270\nFair value of noncontrolling interest (4) 26,218\nTotal purchase consideration $ 1,175,602\n(1)The cash consideration paid to selling shareholders was determined based on the total number of VectivBio Shares\ntendered at closing of 61,258,315 at a per share price of $17.00.\n(2)The cash consideration paid to settle VectivBio RSUs and stock options issued under VectivBio’s equity incentive plans\nwas determined based on the total number of underlying VectivBio Shares of 8,904,171 at a per share price of $17.00, less\nthe exercise price for stock options.\n(3)The cash consideration paid to settle VectivBio warrants was determined based on the total number of VectivBio warrant\nshares outstanding at close of 324,190 at a per share price of $11.4757 calculated as the per share price of $17.00, less the\nexercise price of $5.5243 per share.\n(4)The fair value of the noncontrolling interest was determined based on the total number of VectivBio Shares outstanding at\nclosing of 1,547,723 at the closing date of the tender offer, using the VectivBio closing share price on\nJune 28, 2023 of $16.94.\nOn December 12, 2023, the Company completed a squeeze-out merger under Swiss law to acquire all remaining\noutstanding VectivBio Shares in cash at a price per share of $17.00, totaling $26.3 million. As of December 31, 2023, there\nwas no remaining noncontrolling interest in VectivBio. The purchase of subsidiary shares from the noncontrolling interests is\nrecorded as an equity transaction, with no gain or loss reflected in the consolidated statements of income (loss), and is\nreflected as a financing activity in the consolidated statements of cash flows.\nThe VectivBio Acquisition was accounted for as an asset acquisition under ASC Topic 805, Business Combinations,\nbecause substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired was concentrated in a single identifiable IPR&D asset,\napraglutide, VectivBio’s lead investigational asset. Apraglutide is a next generation, long-acting synthetic GLP-2 analog being\ndeveloped for a range of rare GI diseases and is currently in Phase III clinical trial for the potential treatment of SBS-IF. The\nCompany recognized the acquired assets and assumed liabilities based on the consideration paid, inclusive of transaction\ncosts, on a relative fair value basis. In accordance with the accounting for asset acquisitions, an entity that acquires IPR&D\nassets in an asset acquisition follows the guidance in ASC Topic 730, Research and Development, which requires that both\ntangible and intangible identifiable research and development assets with no alternative future use be allocated a portion of the\nconsideration transferred and recorded as research and development expense at the acquisition date. As a result, the Company\nrecorded approximately $1.1 billion in acquired in-process research and development expense related to the apraglutide\nIPR&D asset during the second quarter of 2023.\nThe following is the allocation of the purchase consideration based on the relative fair value of assets acquired and\nliabilities assumed by the Company (in thousands):\nAssets acquired\nCash and cash equivalents $ 123,340\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets 10,867\nProperty and equipment 126\nIntangible assets 4,100\nAcquired in-process research and development 1,095,449\nTotal assets acquired $ 1,233,882\nLiabilities assumed\nCurrent liabilities 42,377\nOther liabilities 15,903\nTotal liabilities assumed $ 58,280\nNet assets acquired $ 1,175,602\nThe Company incurred acquisition-related expenses of $55.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, of\nwhich $25.6 million was included in selling, general and administrative expenses, $15.1 million was included in research and\ndevelopment expense, and $14.9 million was included in restructuring expense within the Company’s consolidated statement\nof income (loss) for the year ended December 31, 2023. Acquisition-related expenses include direct and incremental costs\nincurred in connection with the transaction, including integration-related professional services and\nF-20\nTable of Contents\nemployee retention-related benefits. Acquisition-related expenses exclude transaction costs included in the computation of\ntotal consideration paid.\nIntangible assets are comprised of the assembled workforce acquired in the VectivBio Acquisition. The Company\nrecognized $0.4 million of amortization expense during the period between acquisition date on June 29, 2023 through\nDecember 31, 2023 and the net carrying value of the assembled workforce at December 31, 2023 is $3.6 million.

Under this method, no numerator or denominator adjustments arose from the\nprincipal and interest components of the Convertible Senior Notes because the Company had the intent and ability to settle the\nConvertible Senior Notes’ principal and interest in cash. Instead, the Company was required to increase the diluted net income\nper share denominator by the variable number of shares that would be issued upon conversion if it settled the conversion\nspread obligation with shares. For diluted net income per share purposes, the conversion spread obligation was calculated\nbased on whether the average market price of the Company’s Class A Common Stock during the reporting period was in\nexcess of the conversion price of the Convertible Senior Notes. There was no calculated spread added to the denominator for\nthe years ended December 31, 2021 or 2020.\nFollowing the adoption of ASU 2020-06 on January 1, 2022, the dilutive impact of the Convertible Senior Notes is\ndetermined using the if-converted method. Under the if-converted method, the Convertible Senior Notes are assumed to be\nconverted into common stock at the beginning of the period (or at the time of issuance, if later). Interest charges are deducted\nfrom the numerator, unless the principal amount of the convertible instruments is required to be paid in cash.\nThere was no dilutive impact of the 2022 Convertible Notes for the year ended December 31, 2022 because the\nCompany had elected prior to the beginning of the period to settle the conversion of 2022 Convertible Notes, if any, with a\ncombination settlement of a cash payment equal to the principal value of converted notes and shares of Class A Common\nStock equal to the conversion value in excess of the principal value, if any. Accordingly, interest expense was not removed\nfrom the numerator and there was no calculated spread added to the denominator because the average market price of the\nCompany’s Class A common stock during the portion of each period in which the 2022 Convertible Notes were outstanding\nwas not in excess of the conversion price.\n5. Collaboration, License, and Other Agreements\nThe Company has linaclotide collaboration agreements with AbbVie for North America and AstraZeneca for China\n(including Hong Kong and Macau), as well as linaclotide license agreements with Astellas for Japan and with AbbVie for the\nAbbVie License Territory. The following table provides amounts included in the Company’s\nF-22\nTable of Contents\nconsolidated statements of income (loss) as collaborative arrangements revenue and sale of API attributable to transactions\nfrom these and other agreements (in thousands):\nYear Ended December 31,\nCollaborative Arrangements Revenue 2023 2022 2021\nLinaclotide Collaboration and License Agreements:\nAbbVie (North America) $ 433,242 $ 401,498 $ 403,085\nAbbVie (Europe and other) 2,779 2,444 2,558\nAstraZeneca (China, including Hong Kong and Macau) 430 635 743\nAstellas (Japan) 1,799 2,001 2,232\nOther Agreements:\nAlnylam (GIVLAARI) — 2,194 2,411\nAKP (apraglutide) 2,009 — —\nOther 2,476 1,824 1,755\nTotal collaborative arrangements revenue $ 442,735 $ 410,596 $ 412,784\nSale of API\nLinaclotide Agreements:\nAstellas (Japan) $ — $ — $ 149\nAstraZeneca (China, including Hong Kong and Macau) — — 597\nOther — — 223\nTotal sale of API $ — $ — $ 969\nAccounts receivable, net, included $129.1 million and $130.0 million primarily related to collaborative arrangements\nrevenue, collectively, as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Accounts receivable, net, included $112.6 million and\n$104.4 million due from the Company’s partner, AbbVie, net of $4.3 million and $4.0 million of accounts payable, as of\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nThe Company routinely assesses the creditworthiness of its license and collaboration partners. The Company has not\nexperienced any material losses related to receivables from its license or collaboration partners during the years ended\nDecember 31, 2023, 2022, or 2021.\nLinaclotide Agreements\nCollaboration Agreement for North America with AbbVie\nIn September 2007, the Company entered into a collaboration agreement with AbbVie to develop and commercialize\nlinaclotide for the treatment of IBS-C, CIC, and other GI conditions in North America. Under the terms of this collaboration\nagreement, the Company received an upfront licensing fee, equity investment, and development and regulatory milestones,\nand shares equally with AbbVie all development costs as well as net profits or losses from the development and sale of\nlinaclotide in the U.S. In addition, the Company receives royalties in the mid-teens percent based on net sales in Canada and\nMexico. AbbVie is solely responsible for the further development, regulatory approval and commercialization of linaclotide in\nthose countries and funding any costs.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, the Company incurred $7.0 million, $8.0 million, and\n$8.2 million, respectively, in total research and development expenses under the linaclotide collaboration for North America.\nAs a result of the research and development cost-sharing provisions of the linaclotide collaboration for North America, the\nCompany incurred $11.6 million, $8.9 million, and $11.5 million in incremental research and development costs during the\nyears ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively, to reflect the obligations of each party under the collaboration\nto bear 50% of the development costs incurred.\nThe Company and AbbVie began commercializing LINZESS in the U.S. in December 2012. The Company receives\n50% of the net profits and bears 50% of the net losses from the commercial sale of LINZESS in the U.S. Net profits or net\nlosses consist of net sales of LINZESS to third-party customers and sublicense income in the U.S. less the cost of goods sold\nas well as selling, general and administrative expenses. LINZESS net sales are calculated and\nF-23\nTable of Contents\nrecorded by AbbVie and may include gross sales net of discounts, rebates, allowances, sales taxes, freight and insurance\ncharges, and other applicable deductions.\nThe Company evaluated its linaclotide collaboration arrangement for North America and concluded that all\ndevelopment-period performance obligations had been satisfied as of September 2012. The Company has determined that\nthere are three remaining commercial-period performance obligations, which include the sales detailing of LINZESS,\nparticipation in the joint commercialization committee, and approved additional trials. The consideration remaining includes\ncost reimbursements in the U.S. and net profit and loss sharing payments based on net sales in the U.S. Additionally, the\nCompany receives royalties in the mid-teens percent based on net sales in Canada and Mexico. Royalties and net profit and\nloss sharing payments will be recorded as collaborative arrangements revenue or expense in the period earned, as these\npayments relate predominately to the license granted to AbbVie. The Company records royalty revenue in the period earned\nbased on royalty reports from its partner, if available, or based on the projected sales and historical trends. The cost\nreimbursements received from AbbVie during the commercialization period will be recognized as earned in accordance with\nthe right-to-invoice practical expedient, as the Company’s right to consideration corresponds directly with the value of the\nservices transferred during the commercialization period.\nUnder the Company’s linaclotide collaboration agreement for North America, LINZESS net sales are calculated and\nrecorded by AbbVie and include gross sales net of discounts, rebates, allowances, sales taxes, freight and insurance charges,\nand other applicable deductions, as noted above. These amounts include the use of estimates and judgments, which could be\nadjusted based on actual results in the future. The Company records its share of the net profits or net losses from the sales of\nLINZESS in the U.S. less commercial expenses on a net basis, and presents the settlement payments to and from AbbVie as\ncollaboration expense or collaborative arrangements revenue, as applicable. This treatment is in accordance with the\nCompany’s revenue recognition policy, given that the Company is not the primary obligor and does not have the inventory\nrisks in the collaboration agreement with AbbVie for North America. The Company relies on AbbVie to provide accurate and\ncomplete information related to net sales of LINZESS in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles in\norder to calculate its settlement payments to and from AbbVie and record collaboration expense or collaborative arrangements\nrevenue, as applicable.\nThe following table summarizes collaborative arrangements revenue from the linaclotide collaboration agreement for\nNorth America during the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021 as follows (in thousands):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2023 2022 2021\nCollaborative arrangements revenue related to sales of LINZESS in the U.S. $ 430,463 $ 398,767 $ 400,371\nRoyalty revenue\n2,779 2,731 2,714\n$ 433,242 $ 401,498 $ 403,085\nTotal collaborative arrangements revenue\nThe Company incurred $37.1 million, $34.3 million, and $30.3 million in total selling, general and administrative\ncosts related to the sale of LINZESS in the U.S. in accordance with the cost-sharing arrangement with AbbVie for the years\nended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively.\nIn May 2014, CONSTELLA® became commercially available in Canada and, in June 2014, LINZESS became\ncommercially available in Mexico.

The Company recognized $2.8 million, $2.7 million, and $2.7 million of combined royalty\nrevenues from Canada and Mexico during the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively.\nLicense Agreement with AbbVie (All countries other than the countries and territories of North America, China (including\nHong Kong and Macau), and Japan)\nThe Company has a license agreement with AbbVie to develop, manufacture and commercialize linaclotide in (i)\nEurope, and (ii) all other countries other than China (including Hong Kong and Macau), Japan, and the countries and\nterritories of North America, or collectively the “Expanded Territory”, for the treatment of IBS-C, CIC and other GI\nconditions.\nF-24\nTable of Contents\nUnder the license agreement, as amended, AbbVie is obligated to pay the Company, (i) royalties based on sales\nvolume in Europe in the upper-teens percent, and (ii) on a country-by-country and product-by-product basis in the Expanded\nTerritory, a royalty as a percentage of net sales of products containing linaclotide as an active ingredient in the upper-single\ndigits for five years following the first commercial sale of a linaclotide product in a country, and in the low-double digits\nthereafter. The royalty rate for products in Europe and the Expanded Territory will decrease, on a country-by-country basis, to\nthe lower-single digits, or cease entirely, following the occurrence of certain events. The license agreement also contains\ncertain sales-based milestones and commercial launch milestones, which could total up to $42.5 million.\nThe Company recognized $2.8 million, $2.4 million and $2.6 million of royalty revenue during the years ended\nDecember 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively.\nLicense Agreement for Japan with Astellas\nThe Company has a license agreement with Astellas to develop, manufacture, and commercialize linaclotide for the\ntreatment of IBS-C, CIC and other GI conditions in Japan.\nUnder the license agreement, as amended, Astellas is required to pay royalties to the Company at rates beginning in\nthe mid-single digit percent and escalating to low-double-digit percent, based on aggregate annual net sales in Japan of\nproducts containing linaclotide as an active ingredient. These royalty payments are subject to reduction following the\nexpiration of certain licensed patents and the occurrence of generic competition in Japan.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company recognized $1.8 million and $2.0 million of\nroyalty revenue, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company recognized $2.2 million of royalty\nrevenue and $0.2 million from the sale of API to Astellas under the Amended Astellas License Agreement.\nCollaboration Agreement for China (including Hong Kong and Macau) with AstraZeneca\nThe Company has a collaboration agreement with AstraZeneca under which AstraZeneca has the exclusive right to\ndevelop, manufacture and commercialize products containing linaclotide in the AstraZeneca License Territory.\nUnder the collaboration agreement, AstraZeneca is required to pay tiered royalties to the Company at rates beginning\nin the mid-single-digit percent and increasing up to twenty percent based on the aggregate annual net sales of products\ncontaining linaclotide in the AstraZeneca License Territory.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company recognized $0.4 million and $0.6 million of\nroyalty revenue, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company recognized $0.7 million in\ncollaborative arrangements revenue related to the Amended AstraZeneca Agreement, of which $0.5 million related to royalties\nand $0.2 million related to services provided under a transition services agreement, and recognized $0.6 million in sales of\nAPI relating to the supply of development material.\nThe Company is entitled to receive non-contingent payments totaling $35.0 million in three installments through\n2024, of which $15.0 million remained outstanding at December 31, 2023. In addition, AstraZeneca may be required to make\nmilestone payments totaling up to $90.0 million contingent on the achievement of certain sales targets. The significant\nfinancing component of the transaction was $2.6 million and is recognized as interest income through 2024 using the effective\ninterest method. At December 31, 2023, the non-contingent receivable due from AstraZeneca was $15.0 million and was\nclassified as current. At December 31, 2022, the current portion and the non-current portion of the non-contingent receivable\ndue from AstraZeneca were $10.0 million and $14.6 million, respectively.\nApraglutide Agreements\nDevelopment and Commercialization Agreement with AKP\nIn March 2022, VectivBio entered into a development and commercialization agreement with Asahi Kasei Pharma\nCorporation (“AKP”) in which VectivBio granted an exclusive license to AKP, with the right to sublicense in multiple tiers, to\ndevelop, commercialize and exploit products derived from apraglutide in Japan.\nF-25\nTable of Contents\nPursuant to the terms of the development and commercialization agreement with AKP, VectivBio received an upfront\npayment of JPY 3,000 million ($24.6 million at date of agreement) and was eligible to receive development related payments\nof JPY 1,600 million in the aggregate ($13.1 million at date of agreement), development milestones of JPY 1,000 million\n($8.2 million at date of agreement) and up to JPY 19,000 million ($155.8 million at date of agreement) of commercial and\nsales-based milestone payments. VectivBio is also eligible to receive payments in the commercial period for manufacturing\nsupply equal to cost-plus manufacturing mark-up and tiered royalties of up to a mid-double-digit percentage on product sales\ncontinuing until the later of (i) expiration of regulatory exclusivity in Japan, or (ii) expiration of the last valid patent claim that\nprovides exclusivity to apraglutide in Japan (the “Royalty Term”). The development and commercialization agreement will\nterminate upon the expiration of the Royalty Term.\nThe Company identified two performance obligations consisting of the (i) exclusive license for the development and\ncommercialization of apraglutide in Japan and (ii) development activities for conducting global trials and sharing of associated\ndevelopment data necessary for obtaining and maintaining regulatory approval in Japan. Each performance obligation was\ncapable of being distinct and distinct in the context of the contract. The initial transaction price was allocated to each\nperformance obligation on a relative standalone selling price basis. The Company assessed that it provided a right to use the\nlicense as the license exists (in terms of form and functionality) at the point in time at which it is granted and therefore, was\nsatisfied at the inception of the arrangement. The development activities are being recognized over time as the Company\nperforms development activities related to the global trials. The Company recognizes revenue associated with the development\nactivities using an input method, according to the costs incurred, which in management’s judgment, is the best measure of\nprogress towards satisfying the performance obligation. Under the sales-or-usage-based royalty exception, revenue related to\nsales-based milestone payments and royalty payments will be recognized as the underlying sales occur.\nPrior to its acquisition by the Company, VectivBio had received the upfront payment of JPY 3,000 million ($24.6\nmillion at date of agreement), development-related payments of JPY 1,100 million ($9.0 million at date of agreement), and\ndevelopment milestones of JPY 500 million ($4.1 million at date of agreement).

As of December 31, 2023, deferred revenue of $2.6 million is\nreported within accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. Deferred revenue and future\npayments received related to development activities are expected to be recognized over the course of the development\nactivities, which are expected to occur through 2028.\nLicense Agreement with Ferring\nIn August 2012, as subsequently amended and restated in December 2016, GlyPharma Therapeutic Inc., a subsidiary\nof VectivBio (“GlyPharma”), entered into an exclusive licensing agreement with Ferring International Center, S.A.\n(“Ferring”), pursuant to which Ferring granted GlyPharma an exclusive, worldwide, sublicensable license under certain patent\nrights and know-how controlled by Ferring relating to apraglutide and certain know-how controlled by Ferring relating to\nspecified alternate drug compounds, to research, develop, manufacture, make, have made, import, export, use, sell, distribute,\npromote, advertise, dispose of or offer to sell (i) products containing apraglutide whose manufacture, use or sale is covered by\na valid claim of the licensed patents, or licensed products and (ii) products, containing a specified alternate drug compound, or\nalternate drug products. In April 2021, the license agreement was transferred and assigned to VectivBio AG, a subsidiary of\nVectivBio.\nUnder the license agreement, as partial consideration for the rights Ferring granted to it, VectivBio AG is required to\npay Ferring a high single-digit percentage royalty on worldwide annual net sales of licensed products and alternate drug\nproducts until, on a country-by-country basis and licensed product-by-licensed product or alternate drug product-by-alternate\ndrug product basis, as applicable, the date on which the manufacture, use or sale of such licensed product or alternate drug\nproduct, as applicable, ceases to be covered by a valid claim of a patent within the licensed patents in such a country.\nGlyPharma was also required to pay Ferring a certain number of warrants and Class A preferred shares pursuant to a\nshareholders’ agreement. The equity obligations under the license agreement have been fully performed by GlyPharma.\nF-26\nTable of Contents\nThe Company is also obligated to pay a specified percentage of the annual consideration VectivBio AG or its\naffiliates, including the Company, received in connection with sales of licensed product or alternate drug product by any third\nparties to which VectivBio AG or its affiliates, including the Company, grant a sublicense of any of the rights licensed to\nVectivBio AG by Ferring under this Agreement.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments\nThe tables below present information about the Company’s assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a\nrecurring basis as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 and indicate the fair value hierarchy of the valuation techniques\nF-27\nTable of Contents\nthe Company utilized to determine such fair value. In general, fair values determined by Level 1 inputs utilize observable\ninputs such as quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Fair values determined by Level 2 inputs utilize\ndata points that are either directly or indirectly observable, such as quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets,\ninterest rates and yield curves. Fair values determined by Level 3 inputs utilize unobservable data points in which there is little\nor no market data, which require the Company to develop its own assumptions for the asset or liability.\nThe Company’s investment portfolio may include fixed income securities that do not always trade on a daily basis.\nAs a result, the pricing services used by the Company apply other available information as applicable through processes such\nas benchmark yields, benchmarking of like securities, sector groupings and matrix pricing to prepare valuations. In addition,\nmodel processes are used to assess interest rate impact and develop prepayment scenarios. These models take into\nconsideration relevant credit information, perceived market movements, sector news and economic events. The inputs into\nthese models may include benchmark yields, reported trades, broker-dealer quotes, issuer spreads and other relevant data. The\nCompany validates the prices provided by its third party pricing services by obtaining market values from other pricing\nsources and analyzing pricing data in certain instances. The Company periodically invests in certain reverse repurchase\nagreements, which are collateralized by Government Securities and Obligations for an amount not less than 102% of their\nprincipal amount.

The\nRevolving Credit Agreement generally prohibits any other liens on the assets of the Company and its restricted subsidiaries,\nsubject to certain exceptions as described in the Revolving Credit Agreement.\nUnder the terms of the Revolving Credit Agreement, the Company will be able to request an increase in the\ncommitments or the addition of a term loan secured by a pari passu lien on the collateral of up to an additional amount equal\nto the greater of $200.0 million and 100% of the trailing twelve-month Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA (as defined in the\nRevolving Credit Agreement) upon satisfaction of customary conditions, including receipt of commitments from either new\nlenders or increased commitments from existing lenders.\nThe Revolving Credit Agreement contains certain customary covenants applicable to the Company and its Restricted\nSubsidiaries (as defined in the Revolving Credit Agreement), and commencing in the third quarter of 2023, the Company is\nrequired to maintain a maximum consolidated secured net leverage ratio of 3.00 to 1.00 and a minimum interest coverage ratio\nof 3.00 to 1.00, in each case at the end of each fiscal quarter. The Revolving Credit Agreement allows the Company to elect to\nincrease the permitted maximum consolidated secured net leverage ratio to 3.50 to 1.00 for four fiscal quarters in the event it\nconsummates an acquisition for consideration in excess of $50.0 million, subject to certain limitations on how often this\nelection can be made. As of December 31, 2023, the Company was in compliance with all covenants.\nIn connection with the Revolving Credit Agreement, the Company incurred $2.9 million of debt issuance costs,\nwhich primarily consisted of $2.0 million of lender fees and $0.9 million of legal and other professional fees. The debt\nissuance costs are classified as other assets and are amortized on a straight-line basis over the four-year term of the Revolving\nCredit Agreement. The Company had unamortized capitalized debt issuance costs of $2.4 million at December 31, 2023.\nIn June 2023, the Company borrowed $400.0 million to partially finance the VectivBio Acquisition (Note 3). The\nCompany repaid $100.0 million of the outstanding principal balance during the year ended December 31, 2023. The\noutstanding principal balance on the revolving credit facility was $300.0 million as of December 31, 2023.\nThe following table sets forth total interest expense recognized related to Revolving Credit Agreement (in\nthousands):\nYear Ended\nDecember 31, 2023\nContractual interest expense $ 14,718\nAmortization of debt issuance costs 442\nOther financing costs 101\nTotal interest expense $ 15,261\nF-36\nTable of Contents\n11. Commitments and Contingencies\nCommitments with AbbVie\nThe Company and AbbVie are jointly obligated to make minimum purchases of linaclotide API for the territories\ncovered by the Company’s collaboration with AbbVie for North America. Currently, AbbVie fulfills all such minimum\npurchase commitments.\nUnder the collaboration agreement with AbbVie for North America, the Company shares all development and\ncommercialization costs related to linaclotide in the U.S. with AbbVie. The actual amounts that the Company pays to AbbVie\nor that AbbVie pays to the Company will depend on numerous factors outside of the Company’s control, including the success\nof certain clinical development efforts with respect to linaclotide, the content and timing of decisions made by the regulators,\nthe reimbursement and competitive landscape around linaclotide and the Company’s other product candidates, and other\nfactors.\nOther Funding Commitments\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company has ongoing studies in various pre-clinical and clinical trial stages. The\nCompany’s most significant clinical trial expenditures are to contract research organizations. These contracts are generally\ncancellable, with notice, at the Company’s option and do not have any significant cancellation penalties.\nGuarantees\nAs permitted under Delaware law, the Company indemnifies its directors and certain of its officers for certain events\nor occurrences while such director or officer is, or was, serving at the Company’s request in such capacity. The maximum\npotential amount of future payments the Company could be required to make is unlimited; however, the Company has\ndirectors’ and officers’ insurance coverage that is intended to limit its exposure and enable it to recover a portion of any future\namounts paid.\nThe Company enters into certain agreements with other parties in the ordinary course of business that contain\nindemnification provisions. These typically include agreements with business partners, contractors, landlords, clinical sites\nand customers. Under these provisions, the Company generally indemnifies and holds harmless the indemnified party for\nlosses suffered or incurred by the indemnified party as a result of the Company’s activities. These indemnification provisions\ngenerally survive termination of the underlying agreements. The maximum potential amount of future payments the Company\ncould be required to make under these indemnification provisions is unlimited. However, to date the Company has not\nincurred material costs to defend lawsuits or settle claims related to these indemnification provisions. As a result, the\nestimated fair value of these obligations is minimal. Accordingly, the Company did not have any liabilities recorded for these\nobligations as of December 31, 2023 and 2022.\nLitigation\nFrom time to time, the Company is involved in various legal proceedings and claims, either asserted or unasserted,\nwhich arise in the ordinary course of business. While the outcome of these other claims cannot be predicted with certainty,\nmanagement does not believe that the outcome of any of these ongoing legal matters, individually and in aggregate, will have\na material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.\nIn May 2021, the Company and AbbVie entered into a settlement agreement with Teva, under which the Company\nand AbbVie will grant Teva a license to market a generic version of 72 mcg LINZESS beginning March 31, 2029 (subject to\nFDA approval), unless certain limited circumstances, customary for settlement agreements of this nature, occur. With this\nsettlement agreement, the Company and AbbVie have settled with the filers of all known ANDAs to date seeking approval to\nmarket generic versions of LINZESS.\nF-37\nTable of Contents\n12.

As of December 31, 2023, the Company\nmaintained a valuation allowance of $85.6 million on deferred tax assets not expected to be realized, related primarily to\ndeferred tax assets acquired in the VectivBio Acquisition comprised primarily of net operating loss carryforwards in\nSwitzerland, as well as certain tax credits that are expected to expire prior to utilization. As of December 31, 2022, the\nCompany maintained a valuation allowance of $3.1 million on deferred tax assets not expected to be realized, related\nprimarily to certain tax credits that are expected to expire prior to utilization.\nThe valuation allowance increased by $82.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2023 primarily to offset the\nacquired foreign net operating losses from the VectivBio Acquisition. Additionally, in response to a state tax law change\nenacted in October 2023, the Company increased its valuation allowance on certain state tax credits that are\nF-44\nTable of Contents\nexpected to expire prior to utilization. The valuation allowance decreased by $1.2 million during the year ended December 31,\n2022 primarily for certain tax credits that expired unused during 2022.\nAdditionally, the Company increased its reserves for uncertain tax positions by $11.0 million in the second quarter of\n2023 in connection with a liability assumed in the VectivBio Acquisition.\nSubject to the limitations described below, at December 31, 2023, the Company had federal net operating loss\ncarryforwards of $411.8 million, of which $282.2 million is subject to expiration between 2033 and 2038 and $129.6 million\nmay be carried forward indefinitely.

These ownership changes may limit the amount of net operating\nloss carryforwards and research and development credit carryforwards that can be utilized annually to offset future taxable\nincome and taxes, respectively.

For example, if the award is being granted\non May 29, 2023, the Average Stock Price is the average\nclosing price of the Company’s Class A common stock on\nthe Nasdaq Global Select Market (or the stock exchange\non which the Company’s Class A common stock is being\nactively traded) from November 1, 2022 – April 30, 2023.\nSuch award will vest in three equal annual installments on\nthe first three anniversaries of the date of grant, subject to\nthe Non-Employee Director’s continued service on the\nBoard through each applicable vesting date. For clarity, if\na Non-Employee Director ceases serving as a member of\nthe Board at any time prior to the date on which the award\nof Restricted Stock is fully vested, any shares of\nRestricted Stock that remain unvested on the date of such\nNon-Employee Director’s termination of service will be\nforfeited on the date of such termination of service.\nAnnual equity award Beginning with the 2019 annual meeting of stockholders\nof the Company (the “2019 Annual Meeting”), on the date\nof each annual meeting of stockholders of the Company,\neach Non-Employee Director shall be granted Restricted\nStock having a grant date fair value of $250,000,\ndetermined based on the Average Stock Price, rounded\ndown to the nearest whole share, provided, however, that\nsuch awards made in connection with the 2019 Annual\nMeeting shall be granted on the date immediately\npreceding the 2019 Annual Meeting.\nIf a Non-Employee Director is initially elected to the\nBoard other than at an annual meeting of the stockholders\nof the Company, upon his or her initial election to the\nBoard (the “Start Date”), such Non-Employee Director\nshall be granted an award of Restricted Stock equal to the\nnumber of shares of Restricted Stock granted to the Non-\nEmployee Directors in connection with the last annual\nmeeting of the stockholders of the Company preceding the\nStart Date multiplied by a ratio equal to (i) 365 minus the\nnumber of days between the last annual meeting of the\nstockholders of the Company preceding the Start Date and\nthe Start Date (ii) divided by 365.\nSuch awards will vest in full on the date immediately\npreceding the date of the next annual meeting of\nstockholders, subject to the Non-Employee Director’s\ncontinued service on the Board through such vesting date.\nFor clarity, if a Non-Employee Director ceases serving as\na member of the Board at any time prior to the award’s\nvesting date, the award will be forfeited on the date of\nsuch Non-Employee Director’s termination of service.\nCash Fees.

Each Non-Employee Director may elect to receive fully vested\nshares of the Company’s Class A common stock (each, a “Stock Grant”), at no cash cost to the Non-Employee\nDirector, in lieu of his or her annual cash retainer and any additional cash retainers for Board chair, committee\nor committee chair service set forth above. If a Stock Grant is so elected, the shares shall automatically be\nissued to the Non-Employee Director as of the applicable Grant Date without further action by the Board. The\nnumber of shares of the Company’s Class A common stock to be issued will be determined by dividing the\napplicable cash retainer(s) the Non-Employee Director would be eligible to receive on such Grant Date, by the\nFair Market Value (as defined in the Equity Incentive Plan) of a share of the Company’s Class A common\nstock on the Grant Date, rounded down to the nearest whole share.\nAny election to receive Company Class A common stock in lieu of a cash retainer must be received by the\nCompany prior to January 1 of the year with respect to which the election is effective, except as otherwise\npermitted by the Company. In the event that a Non-Employee Director has not submitted his or her election\nfor the applicable year by December 31 of the preceding year, then the election of such Non-Employee\nDirector shall be deemed the same as the election made by such Non-Employee Director for the prior year. If\na Non-Employee Director has never made an election, all such retainer amounts shall be paid in cash.\nEquity Grants. Each award of Restricted Stock and Stock Grants, other than those awards of Restricted\nStock granted in connection with the 2019 Annual Meeting, will be subject to the terms and conditions of the\nCompany’s 2019 Equity Incentive Plan (or any successor plan) (the “Equity Incentive Plan”), including any\nindividual limits contained therein, with respect to Non-Employee Directors and otherwise, and transfer\nrestrictions, and, in the case of a Restricted Stock Award, a Restricted Stock agreement thereunder. Each\naward of Restricted Stock granted in connection with the 2019 Annual Meeting will be subject to the terms and\nconditions of the Company’s Amended and Restated 2010 Employee, Director and Consultant Equity\nIncentive Plan (the “2010 Plan”), including any individual limits contained therein, with respect to Non-\nEmployee Directors and otherwise, and transfer restrictions, and a Restricted Stock agreement thereunder.\nEach award of Restricted Stock that is then outstanding will vest in full upon the Non-Employee Director’s\ndeath or (i) if the award of Restricted Stock was granted under the Equity Incentive Plan, upon a Covered\nTransaction (as defined in the Equity Incentive Plan) following which the Non-Employee Director is not\nappointed to the board of directors of the surviving entity, and (ii) if the award of Restricted Stock was granted\nunder the 2010 Plan, upon a Corporate Transaction (as defined in the 2010 Plan), following which the Non-\nEmployee Director is not appointed to the board of directors of the surviving entity. Directors will be\nresponsible for the satisfaction of any state or federal income taxation liabilities resulting from each award of\nRestricted Stock and Stock Grants. Each award of Restricted Stock or Stock Grants shall be rounded down to\nthe nearest whole number of shares so that no fractional shares shall be issued, and no cash shall be paid in lieu\nof fractional shares.\nStock Ownership Requirements. Each Non-Employee Director must accumulate and continuously hold\nshares of the Company’s Class A common stock with a value equal to or greater than three (3) times the\namount of the then-current annual retainer paid to the Non-Employee Director for service on the Board\n(excluding additional Board chair, committee, or committee chair retainers, if any). Non-Employee Directors\nare required to achieve the applicable level of ownership by the later of (a) two years from the Effective Date\nand (b) two years from the date the individual first became a Non-Employee Director (the “Ownership Date”).\nInterests that count towards satisfaction of these stock ownership requirements include shares of the\nCompany’s Class A common stock owned by the Non-Employee Director under the definition of “beneficial\nownership” under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 or the Treasury Regulations and guidance thereunder.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, unexercised stock options and/or unvested equity awards do not count towards\nsatisfaction of the stock ownership requirements.\nCompliance with the stock ownership requirements will be measured on the date of the annual meeting of\nstockholders of the Company each year (each, a “Measurement Date”), based on the annual retainer then in\neffect for Non-Employee Directors. The value of shares of the Company’s Class A common stock will be\nbased on the average closing price of the Company’s Class A common stock on the Nasdaq Global Select\nMarket (or the stock exchange on which the Company’s Class A common stock is being actively traded) for\nthe six months preceding the month in which the Measurement Date occurs.\nFollowing the Ownership Date, until a Non-Employee Director holds the required ownership level and if such\nNon-Employee Director does not hold the number of shares of the Company’s Class A common stock to meet\nthis requirement at any time thereafter, such Non-Employee Director shall be required to retain 100% of any\nshares of Company Class A common stock, net of shares sold to cover applicable taxes and the payment of any\nexercise or purchase price (if applicable), held or received upon the vesting or settlement\nof equity awards or the exercise of stock options, in each case, in accordance with the applicable award\nagreement. Further, following the Ownership Date, to the extent a Non-Employee Director does not a hold the\nnumber of shares of the Company’s Class A common stock that meets this threshold, the Non-Employee\nDirector will be automatically deemed to have elected to receive his or her annual cash retainer and any\nadditional cash retainer for service as Board chair, committee service, or service as a committee chair in the\nform of shares of the Company’s Class A common stock in an amount that satisfies the threshold shortfall.\nExpense Reimbursement. In addition, Non-Employee Directors will be reimbursed by the Company for\nreasonable travel and other expenses incurred in connection with the Non-Employee Director’s attendance\nBoard and committee meetings, in accordance with the Company’s policies as in effect from time to time.\nEmployee Directors. For the avoidance of doubt, directors who are employees of the Company or one of its\nsubsidiaries will not receive compensation for their service as a director.\nAdministration.

Policy\nIn accordance with Section 10D of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the\n“Exchange Act”), and the regulations thereunder, the Board of Directors (the “Board”) of Ironwood\nPharmaceuticals, Inc. (the “Company”) has adopted a policy (the “Policy”) providing for the\nCompany’s recoupment of certain incentive-based compensation paid to Covered Executives (as\ndefined below) in the event that the Company is required to prepare an accounting restatement due to\nits material noncompliance with any financial reporting requirement under the securities laws.\n2. Administration\nAdministration and enforcement of this Policy is delegated to the Compensation and HR\nCommittee of the Board (as constituted from time to time, and including any successor committee,\nthe “Committee”). The Committee shall make all determinations under this Policy in its sole\ndiscretion. Determinations of the Committee under this Policy need not be uniform with respect to\nany or all Covered Executives and will be final and binding.\n3. Effective Date\nThis Policy shall be effective as of October 2, 2023 (the “Effective Date”) and shall apply only to\nCovered Compensation (as defined below) that is approved, awarded or granted to Covered\nExecutives on or after the Effective Date, except as otherwise agreed to by any Covered Executive.\n4. Covered Executives\nThis Policy covers each current or former employee who is, or was, an “officer” of the Company\nfor purposes of Section 16 of the Exchange Act (each, a “Covered Executive”).\n5. Covered Compensation\nThis Policy applies to any cash-based and equity-based incentive compensation, bonuses, and\nawards granted, paid, earned or that become vested wholly or in part upon the attainment of any\nfinancial reporting measure (“Covered Compensation”) to Covered Executives. For the avoidance of\ndoubt, none of the following shall be deemed to be Covered Compensation: base salary, a bonus that\nis paid solely at the discretion of the Committee or Board and not paid from a bonus pool determined\nby satisfying a financial reporting measure performance goal, and cash or equity-based awards that\nare earned solely upon satisfaction of one or more subjective or strategic standards. This Policy shall\napply to any Covered Compensation received by an employee who served as a Covered Executive at\nany time during the performance period for that Covered Compensation.\n1\n6. Financial Restatements; Recoupment\nIn the event that the Company is required to prepare an accounting restatement due to the material\nnoncompliance of the Company with any financial reporting requirement under the securities laws,\nincluding any required accounting restatement to correct an error in previously issued financial\nstatements that is material to the previously issued financial statements, or that would result in a\nmaterial misstatement if the error were corrected in the current period or left uncorrected in the\ncurrent period (such an accounting restatement, a “Restatement”), the Committee shall review the\nCovered Compensation received by a Covered Executive during the three-year period preceding the\nRequired Financial Restatement Date as well as any transition period that results from a change in the\nCompany’s fiscal year within or immediately following those three completed fiscal years.\nRegardless of whether the Company filed the restated financial statements, the Committee shall, to\nthe full extent permitted by governing law, seek recoupment of any Covered Compensation, whether\nin the form of cash or equity, awarded or paid to a Covered Executive (computed without regard to\nany taxes paid), if and to the extent:\na. the amount of the Covered Compensation was calculated based upon the achievement of\ncertain financial results that were subsequently the subject of a Restatement; and\nb. the amount of the Covered Compensation that would have been awarded to the Covered\nExecutive had the financial results been properly reported would have been lower than the\namount actually awarded.\nIf the achievement of a certain financial result was considered in determining the Covered\nCompensation awarded or paid, but the Covered Compensation is not awarded or paid on a formulaic\nbasis, the Committee shall determine the amount, if any, by which the payment or award should be\nreduced or recouped.\nFor purposes of this Policy, the “Required Financial Restatement Date” is the earlier to occur of:\na. the date the Board, a committee of the Board, or any officer or officers authorized to take\nsuch action if Board action is not required, concludes, or reasonably should have\nconcluded, that the Company is required to prepare a Restatement; or\nb. the date a court, regulator, or other legally authorized body directs the Company to\nprepare a Restatement.\nFor the avoidance of doubt, a Covered Executive will be deemed to have received Covered\nCompensation in the Company’s fiscal period during which the financial reporting measure specified\nin the award is attained, even if the Covered Executive remains subject to additional payment\nconditions with respect to such award.\n2\n7. Method of Recoupment\nThe Committee will determine, in its sole discretion, the method for recouping erroneously\nawarded Covered Compensation, which may include, without limitation:\na. requiring reimbursement of cash incentive compensation previously paid;\nb. cancelling or rescinding some or all outstanding vested or unvested equity (and/or equity-\nbased) awards;\nc. adjusting or withholding from unpaid compensation or other set-off to the extent\npermitted by applicable law; and/or\nd. reducing or eliminating future salary increases, cash-based or equity-based incentive\ncompensation, bonuses, awards or severance.\n8. Impracticability Exceptions\nThe Committee shall not seek recoupment of any erroneously awarded Covered Compensation to\nthe extent it determines that:\na. the direct expense paid to a third party to assist in enforcing this Policy would exceed the\namount of erroneously awarded Covered Compensation to be recovered;\nb. recovery would violate home country law where that law was adopted prior to November\n28, 2022; and/or\nc. recovery would likely cause an otherwise tax-qualified retirement plan, under which\nbenefits are broadly available to Company employees, to fail to meet the requirements of\nSections 401(a)(13) and 411(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and\nthe regulations thereunder.\n9. No Indemnification\nFor the avoidance of doubt, the Company shall not indemnify any Covered Executive against the\nloss of any erroneously awarded Covered Compensation or any Covered Compensation that is\nrecouped pursuant to the terms of this Policy, or any claims relating to the Company’s enforcement of\nits rights under this Policy.\n10.Severability\nIf any provision of this Policy or the application of any such provision to any Covered Executive\nshall be adjudicated to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, such invalidity, illegality or\nunenforceability shall not affect any other provisions of this Policy, and the invalid, illegal or\nunenforceable provisions shall be deemed amended to the minimum extent necessary to render any\nsuch provision or application enforceable.\n3\n11. Amendments\nThe Committee may amend, modify or terminate this Policy in whole or in part at any time and\nmay adopt such rules and procedures that it deems necessary or appropriate to implement this Policy\nor to comply with applicable laws and regulations.\n12.No Impairment of Other Remedies\nThe remedies under this Policy are in addition to, and not in lieu of, any legal and equitable\nclaims the Company may have or any actions that may be imposed by law enforcement agencies,\nregulators or other authorities. The Company may adopt additional recoupment provisions in the\nfuture or amend existing requirements as required by law or regulation.\n4"

Although LINZESS has faced pricing headwinds throughout 2024, we are maintaining our full year financial guidance. With apraglutide, we continue making progress in preparing the NDA submission and remain on track to complete the submission in the first quarter of 2025. Our team is focused on getting apraglutide to market as soon as possible, and we look forward to providing more updates on our progress in the months ahead. We believe that, if approved, apraglutide would be the drug of choice among physicians to treat adult patients with short bowel syndrome who are dependent on parenteral support.” \n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Highlights 1  ** _(in thousands, except for per share amounts)_\n\n**Q3 2024** |  **Q3 2023**  \n---|---  \nTotal revenue  |  $91,592  |  $113,739   \nTotal costs and expenses  |  65,956  |  73,716   \nGAAP net income  |  3,646  |  13,950   \nGAAP net income attributable to Ironwood Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  |  3,646  |  15,321   \nGAAP net income – per share basic  |  0.02  |  0.10   \nGAAP net income – per share diluted  |  0.02  |  0.09   \nAdjusted EBITDA  |  26,159  |  49,079   \nNon-GAAP net income  |  3,869  |  21,802   \nNon-GAAP net income per share – basic  |  0.02  |  0.14   \nNon-GAAP net income per share – diluted  |  0.02  |  0.12   \n  \n1  Refer to the Reconciliation of GAAP Results to Non-GAAP Financial Measures table and to the Reconciliation of GAAP Net Income to Adjusted EBITDA table at the end of this press release. Refer to Non-GAAP Financial Measures for additional information. \n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Corporate Highlights**\n\n**U.S. LINZESS**\n\n  * Prescription Demand : Total LINZESS prescription demand in the third quarter of 2024 was 54 million LINZESS capsules, a 13% increase compared to the third quarter of 2023, per IQVIA. \n  * U.S. Brand Collaboration : LINZESS U.S. net sales are provided to Ironwood by its U.S. partner, AbbVie Inc. (“AbbVie”). LINZESS U.S. net sales were $225.5 million in the third quarter of 2024, a 19% decrease compared to $279.0 million in the third quarter of 2023. Ironwood and AbbVie share equally in U.S. brand collaboration profits. \n    * LINZESS commercial margin was 65% in the third quarter of 2024, compared to 72% in the third quarter of 2023. See the U.S. LINZESS Full Brand Collaboration table at the end of this press release. \n    * Net profit for the LINZESS U.S. brand collaboration, net of commercial and research and development (“R&D”) expenses, was $139.6 million in the third quarter of 2024, a decrease compared to $192.0 million in the third quarter of 2023. See the U.S. LINZESS Full Brand Collaboration table at the end of this press release. \n  * Collaboration Revenue to Ironwood : Ironwood recorded $88.9 million in collaboration revenue in the third quarter of 2024 related to sales of LINZESS in the U.S., compared to $110.1 million for the third quarter of 2023. Third quarter of 2024 collaboration revenue to Ironwood includes a $5.8 million positive adjustment to reflect Ironwood’s estimate of LINZESS gross-to-net reserves as of September 30, 2024. See the U.S. LINZESS Commercial Collaboration table at the end of the press release. \n\n\n\n**Pipeline Updates**\n\nApraglutide \n\n  * Ironwood is advancing apraglutide, a next-generation, synthetic glucagon-like peptide-2 (“GLP-2”) analog for short bowel syndrome (“SBS”) patients dependent on parenteral support (“PS”), a severe chronic malabsorptive condition. Ironwood believes apraglutide has the potential to improve the standard of care for adult patients with SBS who are dependent on PS as the first and only GLP-2 with once-weekly administration, if approved. \n    * Ironwood is working to submit a new drug application (“NDA”) to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) and marketing applications to other regulatory agencies for apraglutide for the treatment of adult patients with SBS who are dependent on PS. \n\n\n\nCNP-104 \n\n  * In the third quarter of 2024, Ironwood received from COUR Pharmaceutical Development Company, Inc. (“COUR”) the topline data from COUR’s Phase II clinical study for the treatment of primary biliary cholangitis. On September 27, 2024, Ironwood notified COUR of its decision not to exercise the option to acquire an exclusive license to CNP-104. As a result, the collaboration and license option agreement between Ironwood and COUR terminated, and Ironwood retains no rights and has no obligations related to CNP-104. \n\n\n\nIW-3300 \n\n  * Ironwood is advancing IW-3300, a guanylate cyclase-C agonist for the potential treatment of visceral pain conditions, such as interstitial cystitis / bladder pain syndrome (“IC/BPS”) and endometriosis. Ironwood has decided to end further recruitment for the Phase II proof of concept study in IC/BPS and analyze the data once all currently enrolled patients complete the full 12-week study assessment, which will inform the next steps on the program. \n\n\n\n**Revolving Credit Facility**\n\n  * In September 2024, Ironwood entered into a first amendment to its revolving credit agreement to, among other things, increase the quantum of the revolving credit facility from $500.0 million to $550.0 million, extend the maturity date, and increase Ironwood’s permitted maximum consolidated secured net leverage ratio. Additional details can be found in Ironwood’s Form 8-K filing dated September 30, 2024. \n\n\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results**\n\n  * **Total Revenue.** Total revenue in the third quarter of 2024 was $91.6 million, compared to $113.7 million in the third quarter of 2023. \n    * As noted above, revenue was lower year-over-year, primarily due to the decrease in collaborative arrangements revenue. \n    * Total revenue in the third quarter of 2024 consisted of $88.9 million associated with Ironwood’s share of the net profits from the sales of LINZESS in the U.S., and $2.7 million in royalties and other revenue. Total revenue in the third quarter of 2023 consisted of $110.1 million associated with Ironwood’s share of the net profits from the sales of LINZESS in the U.S. and $3.6 million in royalties and other revenue. \n  * **Total Costs and Expenses** . Total costs and expenses in the third quarter of 2024 were $66.0 million, compared to $73.7 million in the third quarter of 2023. \n    * Total costs and expenses in the third quarter of 2024 consisted of $36.1 million in selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses, $29.8 million in R&D expenses and an insignificant amount in restructuring expenses.

For purposes of the 2024 guidance, Ironwood has assumed it will not incur material expenses related to business development activities in 2024. Ironwood does not provide guidance on GAAP net income or a reconciliation of expected adjusted EBITDA to expected GAAP net income because, without unreasonable efforts, it is unable to predict with reasonable certainty the non-GAAP adjustments used to calculate adjusted EBITDA. These adjustments are uncertain, depend on various factors and could have a material impact on GAAP net income for the guidance period. Management believes this non-GAAP information is useful for investors, taken in conjunction with Ironwood’s GAAP financial statements, because it provides greater transparency and period-over-period comparability with respect to Ironwood’s operating performance. These measures are also used by management to assess the performance of the business. Investors should consider these non-GAAP measures only as a supplement to, not as a substitute for or as superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures are unlikely to be comparable with non-GAAP information provided by other companies. \n\n**Non-GAAP Financial Measures**\n\nIronwood presents non-GAAP net income (loss) and non-GAAP net income (loss) per share to exclude the impact, net of tax effects, of net gains and losses on derivatives related to Ironwood’s 2022 Convertible Notes that are required to be marked-to-market, amortization of acquired intangible assets, restructuring expenses, and acquisition-related costs. Non-GAAP adjustments are further detailed below: \n\n  * The gains and losses on the derivatives related to Ironwood’s 2022 Convertible Notes were highly variable, difficult to predict and of a size that could have a substantial impact on the company’s reported results of operations in any given period. \n  * Amortization of acquired intangible assets are non-cash expenses arising in connection with the acquisition of VectivBio and are considered to be non-recurring. \n  * Restructuring expenses are considered to be a non-recurring event as they are associated with distinct operational decisions. Restructuring expenses include costs associated with exit and disposal activities. \n  * Acquisition-related costs in connection with the acquisition of VectivBio are considered to be non-recurring and include direct and incremental costs associated with the acquisition and integration of VectivBio to the extent such costs were not classified as capitalizable transaction costs attributed to the cost of net assets acquired through acquisition accounting. \n\n\n\nIronwood also presents adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure, as well as guidance on adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA is calculated by subtracting mark-to-market adjustments on derivatives related to Ironwood’s 2022 Convertible Notes, restructuring expenses, net interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, and acquisition-related costs from GAAP net income. The adjustments are made on a similar basis as described above related to non-GAAP net income (loss), as applicable. \n\nManagement believes this non-GAAP information is useful for investors, taken in conjunction with Ironwood’s GAAP financial statements, because it provides greater transparency and period-over-period comparability with respect to Ironwood’s operating performance. These measures are also used by management to assess the performance of the business. Investors should consider these non-GAAP measures only as a supplement to, not as a substitute for or as superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures are unlikely to be comparable with non-GAAP information provided by other companies. For a reconciliation of non-GAAP net income (loss) and non-GAAP net income (loss) per share to GAAP net income and GAAP net income per share, respectively, and for a reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA to GAAP net income, please refer to the tables at the end of this press release. \n\nIronwood does not provide guidance on GAAP net income or a reconciliation of expected adjusted EBITDA to expected GAAP net income because, without unreasonable efforts, it is unable to predict with reasonable certainty the non-GAAP adjustments used to calculate adjusted EBITDA. These adjustments are uncertain, depend on various factors and could have a material impact on GAAP net income for the guidance period. \n\n**Conference Call Information**\n\nIronwood will host a conference call and webcast at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time on Thursday, November 7, 2024 to discuss its third quarter 2024 results and recent business activities.

We are pioneers in the development of LINZESS® (linaclotide), the U.S. branded prescription market leader for adults with irritable bowel syndrome with constipation (IBS-C) or chronic idiopathic constipation (CIC). LINZESS is also approved for the treatment of functional constipation in pediatric patients ages 6-17 years-old. Ironwood is also advancing apraglutide, a next-generation, long-acting synthetic GLP-2 analog being developed for rare gastrointestinal diseases, including short bowel syndrome with intestinal failure (SBS-IF) as well as several earlier stage assets. Building upon our history of GI innovation, we keep patients at the heart of our R&D and commercialization efforts to reduce the burden of GI diseases and address significant unmet needs. \n\nFounded in 1998, Ironwood Pharmaceuticals is headquartered in Boston, Massachusetts, with a site in Basel, Switzerland. \n\nWe routinely post information that may be important to investors on our website at [www.ironwoodpharma.com](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ironwoodpharma.com&esheet=54147938&newsitemid=20241107549223&lan=en-US&anchor=www.ironwoodpharma.com&index=3&md5=5fd3596a6c94d716e0a54a5735b32027).

LINZESS is a once-daily capsule that helps relieve the abdominal pain, constipation, and overall abdominal symptoms of bloating, discomfort and pain associated with IBS-C, as well as the constipation, infrequent stools, hard stools, straining, and incomplete evacuation associated with CIC. LINZESS relieves constipation in children and adolescents aged 6 to 17 years with functional constipation. The recommended dose is 290 mcg for IBS-C patients and 145 mcg for CIC patients, with a 72 mcg dose approved for use in CIC depending on individual patient presentation or tolerability. In children with functional constipation aged 6 to 17 years, the recommended dose is 72 mcg. \n\nLINZESS is not a laxative; it is the first medicine approved by the FDA in a class called GC-C agonists. LINZESS contains a peptide called linaclotide that activates the GC-C receptor in the intestine. Activation of GC-C is thought to result in increased intestinal fluid secretion and accelerated transit and a decrease in the activity of pain-sensing nerves in the intestine. The clinical relevance of the effect on pain fibers, which is based on nonclinical studies, has not been established. \n\nIn the United States, Ironwood and AbbVie co-develop and co-commercialize LINZESS for the treatment of adults with IBS-C or CIC. In Europe, AbbVie markets linaclotide under the brand name CONSTELLA® for the treatment of adults with moderate to severe IBS-C. In Japan, Ironwood's partner, Astellas, markets linaclotide under the brand name LINZESS for the treatment of adults with IBS-C or CIC. Ironwood also has partnered with AstraZeneca for development and commercialization of LINZESS in China, and with AbbVie for development and commercialization of linaclotide in all other territories worldwide. \n\n**LINZESS Important Safety Information**\n\n**INDICATIONS AND USAGE**\n\nLINZESS® (linaclotide) is indicated for the treatment of both irritable bowel syndrome with constipation (IBS-C) and chronic idiopathic constipation (CIC) in adults and functional constipation (FC) in children and adolescents 6 to 17 years of age. It is not known if LINZESS is safe and effective in children with FC less than 6 years of age or in children with IBS-C less than 18 years of age. \n\n**IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION**\n\n**WARNING: RISK OF SERIOUS DEHYDRATION IN PEDIATRIC PATIENTS LESS THAN 2 YEARS OF AGE** **LINZESS is contraindicated in patients less than 2 years of age. In nonclinical studies in neonatal mice, administration of a single, clinically relevant adult oral dose of linaclotide caused deaths due to dehydration.**  \n---  \n  \n**Contraindications**\n\n  * LINZESS is contraindicated in patients less than 2 years of age due to the risk of serious dehydration. \n  * LINZESS is contraindicated in patients with known or suspected mechanical gastrointestinal obstruction. \n\n\n\n**Warnings and Precautions**\n\n  * LINZESS is contraindicated in patients less than 2 years of age. In neonatal mice, linaclotide increased fluid secretion as a consequence of age-dependent elevated guanylate cyclase (GC-C) agonism, which was associated with increased mortality within the first 24 hours due to dehydration. There was no age dependent trend in GC-C intestinal expression in a clinical study of children 2 to less than 18 years of age; however, there are insufficient data available on GC-C intestinal expression in children less than 2 years of age to assess the risk of developing diarrhea and its potentially serious consequences in these patients. \n\n\n\n_Diarrhea_\n\n  * In adults, diarrhea was the most common adverse reaction in LINZESS-treated patients in the pooled IBS-C and CIC double-blind placebo-controlled trials. The incidence of diarrhea was similar in the IBS-C and CIC populations. Severe diarrhea was reported in 2% of 145 mcg and 290 mcg LINZESS-treated patients and in <1% of 72 mcg LINZESS-treated CIC patients. \n  * In children and adolescents 6 to 17 years of age, diarrhea was the most common adverse reaction in 72 mcg LINZESS-treated patients in the FC double-blind placebo-controlled trial. Severe diarrhea was reported in <1% of 72 mcg LINZESS treated patients. If severe diarrhea occurs, dosing should be suspended and the patient rehydrated. \n\n\n\n**Common Adverse Reactions** (incidence ≥2% and greater than placebo) \n\n  * In IBS-C or CIC adult patients: diarrhea, abdominal pain, flatulence, and abdominal distension. \n  * In FC pediatric patients: diarrhea. \n\n\n\nPlease see full Prescribing Information including Boxed Warning: [https://www.rxabbvie.com/pdf/linzess_pi.pdf](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rxabbvie.com%2Fpdf%2Flinzess_pi.pdf&esheet=54147938&newsitemid=20241107549223&lan=en-US&anchor=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rxabbvie.com%2Fpdf%2Flinzess_pi.pdf&index=6&md5=6956987027beb1809178d24cf15876a9)\n\nLINZESS® and CONSTELLA® are registered trademarks of Ironwood Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

Under the terms of the collaboration agreement, Ironwood receives 50% of the net profits and bears 50% of the net losses from the commercial sale of LINZESS in the U.S. The purpose of this table is to present calculations of Ironwood’s share of net profit (loss) generated from the sales of LINZESS in the U.S. and Ironwood’s collaboration revenue/expense; however, the table does not present the research and development expenses related to LINZESS in the U.S. that are shared equally between the parties under the collaboration agreement. Please refer to the table at the end of this press release for net profit for the U.S. LINZESS brand collaboration with AbbVie. 2 LINZESS net sales are recognized using AbbVie’s revenue recognition accounting policies and reporting conventions. As a result, certain rebates and discounts are classified as LINZESS U.S. commercial costs, expenses and other discounts within Ironwood’s calculation of collaborative arrangements revenue. 3 Includes certain discounts recognized and cost of goods sold incurred by AbbVie; also includes commercial costs incurred by AbbVie and Ironwood that are attributable to the cost-sharing arrangement between the parties. 4 Commercial margin is defined as commercial profit on sales of LINZESS as a percent of total LINZESS U.S. net sales. 5 Figures presented for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2024 include a $5.8 million increase and $7.2 million reduction to collaborative arrangement revenues, respectively, as a result of an adjustment recorded for Ironwood’s estimate of LINZESS gross-to-net reserves as of September 30, 2024. \n\n**US LINZESS Full Brand Collaboration 1 ** **Revenue/Expense Calculation** **(In thousands)** **(unaudited)**  \n---  \n**Three Months Ended** **September 30,** |  **Nine Months Ended** **September 30,**  \n**2024** |  **2023** |  **2024** |  **2023**  \nLINZESS U.S. net sales as reported by AbbVie 2 |  $  |  225,537  |  $  |  278,954  |  $  |  693,320  |  $  |  798,854   \nAbbVie & Ironwood commercial costs, expenses and other discounts 3 |  78,499  |  77,736  |  232,811  |  223,142   \nAbbVie & Ironwood R&D Expenses 4 |  7,451  |  9,264  |  24,823  |  28,270   \nTotal net profit on sales of LINZESS  |  $  |  139,587  |  $  |  191,954  |  $  |  435,686  |  $  |  547,442   \n  \n____________________ 1 Ironwood collaborates with AbbVie on the development and commercialization of linaclotide in North America.
