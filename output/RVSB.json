With the first century firmly behind us, 2024 is positioned to\nbe a year of amplifying areas of opportunity for clients to utilize tools they desire and bank how, when, and from\nanywhere they like. We view 2024 as the beginning of a new chapter with a renewed vision and strategic\npriorities.\nIn late June 2024, Riverview board of directors hired Nicole Sherman as the new President/CEO to lead the\norganization forward using her years of banking acumen. To say that Nicole is no stranger to banking is an\nunderstatement. Ms. Sherman brings over 25 years of experience at the Chief, Executive, and Senior VP levels\nwith organizations such as Columbia Bank, Utah First, Numerica Credit Union, AmericanWest Bank, and Zions\nBank. Her expertise ranges from Retail and Digital Banking, Commercial and Business Banking to Wealth\nManagement including Private Banking and Financial Services, as well as Corporate Marketing and\nCommunications, DEIBA and Community Impact and Philanthropy.\nAdditionally, Ms. Sherman has led through 10 successful mergers and acquisitions throughout her career.

However, like all in the financial services industry, we are\nimpacted by the elevated interest rate environment and inflation levels that are higher than what we have\nhistorically experienced. We continue to focus on providing excellent service and solutions to our clients along\nwith our goal to continually improve shareholder value. Riverview has strategically restructured its balance sheet\nwhich impacted earnings in the current year, along with being impacted by the higher interest rate\nenvironment. Net income totaled $3.8 million compared to $18.1 million in the previous year. Our capital levels\nremained strong with a total risk-based capital ratio of 16.32% and a leverage ratio of 10.29% at March 31, 2024.\nNon-performing assets (excluding SBA loans) remained exceptionally low at 0.01% of total assets, and we are\nproud that our core deposits represented 98% of total deposits. Credit quality remains a high priority as we\ncontinue to focus on our prudent underwriting standards and diversification of our loan portfolio.\nWhile we are focused on all areas of banking, these key areas will propel us forward:\nDeposit retention and growth – We have enacted several initiatives to attract and retain deposits. Revamping\nchecking accounts for business and consumer clients was a recent initiative. We will continue to offer Certificate\nof Deposit and other promotions, providing an opportunity to serve existing clients and build relationships with\nnew clients.\nTools and technology – Branch banking is essential to our business model and is key in providing excellent\nservice and connecting with clients. Because certain segments of clients want to access and manage money\ndigitally, we will continue working to provide more tools for just this reason. At the same time, financial safety\nand security are critical areas for the bank and for clients.\nCulture/talent attraction and retention – We have made significant strides in this area and will continue to focus\non attracting and retaining exceptional talent. People are at the center of all we do.\nBrand awareness/marketing – Riverview conducted a rebranding project two years ago. Riverview believes in an\nintegrated marketing approach to create a greater awareness, gain new clients and to be viewed as a valued\ncommunity asset and partner.\nRiverview is evolving and growing to meet client needs. We are proud of our legacy, and we are energized and\ncommitted as we move forward with vision and purpose. It’s always been about people. By focusing on our\nemployees, clients, and communities, our shareholders and all stakeholders will thrive.\nIt’s about you.\nThe future is bright,\nJerry Nies Nicole Sherman\nChairman of the Board of Directors President and Chief Executive Officer\nSupporting community is in our DNA\nRiverview Bank is a community bank that demonstrates unwavering commitment to its\ncommunity.

(Nasdaq GSM: RVSB) (“Riverview” or the “Company”) today reported earnings of $1.6 million, or $0.07 per diluted share, in the second fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to $2.5 million, or $0.12 per diluted share, in the second fiscal quarter a year ago.\n\nIn the first six months of fiscal 2025, net income was $2.5 million, or $0.12 per diluted share, compared to $5.3 million, or $0.25 per diluted share, in the first six months of fiscal 2024.\n\n“While our second quarter operating results were an improvement compared to the preceding quarter, we still have work to do,” stated Nicole Sherman, President and Chief Executive Officer. “We remain focused on improving our performance metrics and profitability in the second half of fiscal year 2025. We were particularly encouraged by the increase in deposit balances during the quarter, as our team is doing a great job of deepening client relationships and bringing in new business.”\n\n“We have made good progress with our operating results since our balance sheet restructuring in March 2024, and we are continuing with that momentum as we look to the future,” said David Lam, EVP and Chief Financial Officer.\n\n**Second Quarter Highlights (at or for the period ended September 30, 2024)**\n\n  * Net interest income was $8.9 million for the quarter, compared to $8.8 million in the preceding quarter and $9.9 million in the second fiscal quarter a year ago.\n  * Net interest margin (“NIM”) was 2.46% for the quarter, compared to 2.47% in the preceding quarter and 2.63% for the year ago quarter.\n  * Asset quality remained strong, with non-performing assets at $450,000, or 0.03% of total assets at September 30, 2024.\n  * Riverview recorded a $100,000 provision for credit losses during the current quarter, compared to no provision in both the preceding quarter and in the year ago quarter.\n  * The allowance for credit losses was $15.5 million, or 1.46% of total loans.\n  * Total loans increased $15.9 million during the quarter to $1.06 billion at September 30, 2024, compared to $1.05 billion at June 30, 2024, and increased $45.4 million compared to $1.02 billion at September 30, 2023.\n  * Total deposits were $1.24 billion, compared to $1.22 billion three months earlier and $1.24 billion a year earlier.\n  * The uninsured deposit ratio was 24.1% at September 30, 2024. Available liquidity under the FRB borrowing line would cover 100% of the estimated uninsured deposits and available liquidity under both the FHLB and FRB borrowing lines would cover 156% of the estimated uninsured deposits.\n  * Riverview has approximately $467.0 million in available liquidity at September 30, 2024, including $167.5 million of borrowing capacity from the FHLB and $299.5 million from the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco (“FRB”). At September 30, 2024, the Bank had $102.3 million in outstanding FHLB borrowings.\n  * Total risk-based capital ratio was 16.14% and Tier 1 leverage ratio was 10.72%.\n  * Non-interest income increased $474,000 during the quarter to $3.8 million at September 30, 2024 compared to $3.4 million at June 30, 2024. \n\n\n\n**Income Statement Review**\n\nRiverview’s net interest income was $8.9 million in the current quarter, compared to $8.8 million in the preceding quarter, and $9.9 million in the second fiscal quarter a year ago. The increase compared to the preceding quarter was driven by organic loan growth and higher interest earning asset yields due to higher origination rates on new loan growth as well as loan repricing. Additionally, Riverview sold a portion of its converted Visa A shares (formerly Visa B shares) during the second quarter which generated income of $199,000. The decrease in net interest income compared to the year ago quarter was driven primarily by an increase in interest expense on deposits due to higher interest rates and interest rate expense related to borrowings. In the first six months of fiscal 2025, net interest income was $17.8 million, compared to $20.2 million in the first six months of fiscal 2024. Investment income decreased compared to the six month period a year ago due to the strategic investment restructuring that was executed in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024.\n\nRiverview’s NIM was 2.46% for the second quarter of fiscal 2025, a one basis point decrease compared to 2.47% in the preceding quarter and a 17 basis-point decrease compared to 2.63% in the second quarter of fiscal 2024. “Our NIM is showing signs of stabilizing, contracting only one basis point compared to the linked quarter, as loan growth and higher interest earning asset yields are keeping up with higher deposit costs,” said Lam. “The slight NIM contraction during the current quarter, compared to the year ago quarter, was a result of higher interest expense due to increased rates on our deposit products and the interest expense related to our borrowings. With the decrease in the federal funds rate occurring late in the second fiscal quarter, we expect the impact of the rate decrease to benefit the NIM in future quarters.” In the first six months of fiscal 2025, the net interest margin was 2.46% compared to 2.71% in the same period a year earlier.\n\nInvestment securities decreased $8.2 million during the quarter to $354.9 million at September 30, 2024, compared to $363.2 million at June 30, 2024, and decreased $75.1 million compared to $430.0 million at September 30, 2023. The average securities balances for the quarters ended September 30, 2024, June 30, 2024, and September 30, 2023, were $378.4 million, $391.3 million, and $466.0 million, respectively. The weighted average yields on securities balances for those same periods were 2.05%, 2.11%, and 2.00%, respectively. The duration of the investment portfolio at September 30, 2024 was approximately 5.0 years. The anticipated investment cashflows over the next twelve months is approximately $49.2 million. There were no investment purchases during the second fiscal quarter of 2025.\n\nRiverview’s yield on loans improved to 4.80% during the second fiscal quarter, compared to 4.70% in the preceding quarter, and 4.51% in the second fiscal quarter a year ago. “Loan yields improved during the current quarter as a result of higher rates on new loan originations and higher rates on existing loans that have come up for repricing, when compared to the existing loan portfolio. We continue to explore opportunities to enhance our loan yield by expanding our commercial business portfolio offerings,” said Robert Benke, EVP and Chief Credit Officer. Deposit costs increased to 1.26% during the second fiscal quarter compared to 1.14% in the preceding quarter, and 0.59% in the second fiscal quarter a year ago.\n\nNon-interest income increased to $3.8 million during the second fiscal quarter of 2025 compared to $3.4 million in both the preceding quarter and in the second fiscal quarter of 2024. The current quarter included approximately $525,000 in income related to a legal expense recovery from the prior year. In the first six months of fiscal 2025, non-interest income increased to $7.2 million compared to $6.7 million in the same period a year ago.\n\nAsset management fees were $1.4 million during the second fiscal quarter, compared to $1.6 million in the preceding quarter, and $1.3 million in the second fiscal quarter a year ago. The decrease compared to the first fiscal quarter was due to tax preparation fees included in the first fiscal quarter. Asset management fees increased compared to the year ago quarter due to new client relationships and the continued positive market performance in the equity markets during the second quarter. Riverview Trust Company’s assets under management were $871.6 million at September 30, 2024, compared to $897.9 million at June 30, 2024, and $875.7 million at September 30, 2023.\n\nNon-interest expense was $10.7 million during the second fiscal quarter, compared to $11.0 million in the preceding quarter and $10.1 million in the second fiscal quarter a year ago. Salary and employee benefits were up modestly during the current quarter compared to the preceding quarter, due to strategic hiring. Occupancy and depreciation costs increased modestly during the quarter due to updates and modernization of Riverview’s facilities, but these expenses have started to level off. The efficiency ratio was 83.7% for the second fiscal quarter, compared to 90.0% for the previous quarter and 76.1% in the second fiscal quarter a year ago. Year-to-date, non-interest expense was $21.7 million compared to $20.1 million in the first six months of fiscal 2024.\n\nRiverview’s effective tax rate for the second fiscal quarter of 2025 was 21.4%, compared to 20.8% for the preceding quarter and 22.0% for the year ago quarter.\n\n**Balance Sheet Review**\n\nLoans increased during the second quarter due to a combination of organic loan production along with construction draws, as well as the purchase of $10.0 million in consumer loans. Total loans increased $15.9 million during the quarter to $1.06 billion at September 30, 2024, compared to $1.05 billion three months earlier and increased $45.4 million compared to $1.02 billion a year earlier.

New loan originations during the quarter were $25.6 million, compared to $23.2 million in the preceding quarter and $39.5 million in the second fiscal quarter a year ago.\n\nUndisbursed construction loans totaled $34.1 million at September 30, 2024, compared to $48.0 million at June 30, 2024, with the majority of the undisbursed construction loans expected to be funded over the next several quarters.

Tangible book value per share (non-GAAP) increased to $6.33 at September 30, 2024, compared to $6.09 at June 30, 2024, and $5.90 at September 30, 2023. Riverview paid a quarterly cash dividend of $0.02 per share on October 18, 2024, to shareholders of record on October 7, 2024.\n\n**Credit Quality**\n\n“We continue to monitor our loan portfolio closely resulting in our continued strong asset quality metrics in the second quarter” said Benke. Non-performing loans, excluding SBA and USDA government guaranteed loans (“government guaranteed loans”) (non-GAAP) totaled $149,000 or 0.01% of total loans as of September 30, 2024, compared to $160,000, or 0.02% of total loans at June 30, 2024, and $198,000, or 0.02% of total loans at September 30, 2023. There was one non-performing government guaranteed loan totaling $301,000 at both September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024. At September 30, 2024, including government guaranteed loans, non-performing assets were $450,000, or 0.03% of total assets.\n\nRiverview recorded $2,000 in net loan recoveries for the second fiscal quarter.

Criticized assets were $50.7 million at September 30, 2024, compared to $37.7 million at June 30, 2024, and $35.1 million at September 30, 2023. The increase in criticized assets during the quarter was mainly due to one relationship that was moved to the criticized asset category as the loan goes through probate. The Company does not anticipate any loss from this relationship.\n\nThe allowance for credit losses was $15.5 million at September 30, 2024, compared to $15.4 million at June 30, 2024, and at September 30, 2023. The allowance for credit losses represented 1.46% of total loans at September 30, 2024, compared to 1.47% at June 30, 2024, and 1.51% a year earlier. The allowance for credit losses to loans, net of government guaranteed loans (non-GAAP), was 1.53% at September 30, 2024, compared to 1.54% at June 30, 2024, and 1.60% a year earlier.\n\n**Capital**\n\nRiverview continues to maintain capital levels well in excess of the regulatory requirements to be categorized as “well capitalized” with a total risk-based capital ratio of 16.14% and a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 10.72% at September 30, 2024. Tangible common equity to average tangible assets ratio (non-GAAP) was 8.78% at September 30, 2024.\n\nOn September 25, 2024, the Company’s Board of Directors adopted a stock repurchase program. Under this repurchase program, the Company may repurchase up to $2.0 million of the Company’s outstanding shares of common stock, in the open market, based on prevailing market prices, or in privately negotiated transactions. Once the repurchase program is effective, the repurchase program will continue until the earlier of the completion of the repurchase or 12 months after the effective date, depending upon market conditions.\n\n**Non-GAAP Financial Measures**\n\nIn addition to results presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), this press release contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Management has presented these non-GAAP financial measures in this earnings release because it believes that they provide useful and comparative information to assess trends in Riverview's core operations reflected in the current quarter's results and facilitate the comparison of our performance with the performance of our peers. However, these non-GAAP financial measures are supplemental and are not a substitute for any analysis based on GAAP. Where applicable, comparable earnings information using GAAP financial measures is also presented. Because not all companies use the same calculations, our presentation may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures as calculated by other companies. For a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures, see the tables below.\n\n**Tangible shareholders' equity to tangible assets and tangible book value per share:**  \n---  \n(Dollars in thousands)| **September 30, 2024**| **June 30, 2024**| **September 30, 2023**| **March 31, 2024**  \nShareholders' equity (GAAP)| $| 160,774| $| 155,908| $| 152,039| $| 155,588  \nExclude: Goodwill| (27,076| )| (27,076| )| (27,076| )| (27,076| )  \nExclude: Core deposit intangible, net| (221| )| (246| )| (325| )| (271| )  \nTangible shareholders' equity (non-GAAP)| $| 133,477| $| 128,586| $| 124,638| $| 128,241  \nTotal assets (GAAP)| $| 1,548,397| $| 1,538,260| $| 1,583,733| $| 1,521,529  \nExclude: Goodwill| (27,076| )| (27,076| )| (27,076| )| (27,076| )  \nExclude: Core deposit intangible, net| (221| )| (246| )| (325| )| (271| )  \nTangible assets (non-GAAP)| $| 1,521,100| $| 1,510,938| $| 1,556,332| $| 1,494,182  \nShareholders' equity to total assets (GAAP)| 10.38| %| 10.14| %| 9.60| %| 10.23| %  \nTangible common equity to tangible assets (non-GAAP)| 8.78| %| 8.51| %| 8.01| %| 8.58| %  \nShares outstanding| 21,096,968| 21,111,043| 21,125,889| 21,111,043  \nBook value per share (GAAP)| $| 7.62| $| 7.39| $| 7.20| $| 7.37  \nTangible book value per share (non-GAAP)| $| 6.33| $| 6.09| $| 5.90| $| 6.07  \n**Pre-tax, pre-provision income**  \n**Three Months Ended**| **Six Months Ended**  \n(Dollars in thousands)| **September 30, 2024**| **June 30, 2024**| **September 30, 2023**| **September 30, 2024**| **September 30, 2023**  \nNet income (GAAP)| $| 1,557| $| 966| $| 2,472| $| 2,523| $| 5,315  \nInclude: Provision for income taxes| 425| 253| 697| 678| 1,520  \nInclude: Provision for credit losses| 100| -| -| 100| -  \nPre-tax, pre-provision income (non-GAAP)| $| 2,082| $| 1,219| $| 3,169| $| 3,301| $| 6,835  \n**Allowance for credit losses reconciliation, excluding Government Guaranteed loans**  \n(Dollars in thousands)| **September 30, 2024**| **June 30, 2024**| **September 30, 2023**| **March 31, 2024**  \nAllowance for credit losses| $| 15,466| $| 15,364| $| 15,346| $| 15,364  \nLoans receivable (GAAP)| $| 1,060,977| $| 1,045,065| $| 1,015,625| $| 1,024,013  \nExclude: Government Guaranteed loans| (49,983| )| (50,438| )| (53,572| )| (51,013| )  \nLoans receivable excluding Government Guaranteed loans (non-GAAP)| $| 1,010,994| $| 994,627| $| 962,053| $| 973,000  \nAllowance for credit losses to loans receivable (GAAP)| 1.46| %| 1.47| %| 1.51| %| 1.50| %  \nAllowance for credit losses to loans receivable excluding Government Guaranteed loans (non-GAAP)| 1.53| %| 1.54| %| 1.60| %| 1.58| %  \n**Non-performing loans reconciliation, excluding Government Guaranteed Loans**  \n**Three Months Ended**  \n(Dollars in thousands)| **September 30, 2024**| **June 30, 2024**| **September 30, 2023**  \nNon-performing loans (GAAP)| $| 450| $| 461| $| 198  \nLess: Non-performing Government Guaranteed loans| (301| )| (301| )| -  \nAdjusted non-performing loans excluding Government Guaranteed loans (non-GAAP)| $| 149| $| 160| $| 198  \nNon-performing loans to total loans (GAAP)| 0.04| %| 0.04| %| 0.02| %  \nNon-performing loans, excluding Government Guaranteed loans to total loans (non-GAAP)| 0.01| %| 0.02| %| 0.02| %  \nNon-performing loans to total assets (GAAP)| 0.03| %| 0.03| %| 0.01| %  \nNon-performing loans, excluding Government Guaranteed loans to total assets (non-GAAP)| 0.01| %| 0.01| %| 0.01| %  \n  \n**About Riverview**\n\nRiverview Bancorp, Inc.

(Nasdaq GSM: RVSB) (“Riverview” or the “Company”) headquartered in Vancouver, WA, the holding company parent of Riverview Bank, announced that on September 25, 2024, its Board of Directors adopted a stock repurchase program. Under this repurchase program, the Company may repurchase up to $2.0 million of the Company’s outstanding shares of common stock, in the open market, based on prevailing market prices, or in privately negotiated transactions. Once the repurchase program is effective, the repurchase program will continue until the earlier of the completion of the repurchase or 12 months after the effective date, depending upon market conditions.\n\n“When the opportunity to repurchase common stock results in enhancing shareholder value, we believe capitalizing on this opportunity is a prudent way of deploying excess capital,” said Nicole Sherman, Chief Executive Officer and President.\"\n\nThe Board of Directors of the Company also authorized management to enter into a trading plan with Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc. in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, to facilitate repurchases of its common stock as part of the stock repurchase program (the “Rule 10b5-1 plan”). The Rule 10b5-1 plan would allow the Company to execute trades during periods when it might otherwise not be permitted to do so because it may be in possession of material non-public information, because of insider trading laws or Company-imposed trading blackout periods. Under the Rule 10b5-1 plan, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc. would have the authority, subject to the terms and limitations set forth in the Rule 10b5-1 plan, to repurchase shares on the Company’s behalf. There is no guarantee as to the number of shares that the Company may ultimately repurchase. The Company may suspend or discontinue the repurchase program at any time.\n\n**About Riverview** Riverview Bancorp, Inc.

Dan Cox who served as the Company’s acting CEO/President will now focus full-time on his role as EVP, Chief Operating Officer.\n\n“Loan growth was strong during the quarter, as we continue to maintain solid credit quality metrics. Further, the balance sheet restructuring that took place during the preceding quarter has already improved our net interest margin and helped stabilize our interest rate risk position,” said Dan Cox. “While we are still operating in a very challenging interest rate environment, we are encouraged as we look forward to the future,” stated Nicole Sherman. “We remain focused on improving our performance metrics, and ultimately increasing profitability in the year ahead.”\n\n**First Quarter Highlights (at or for the period ended June 30, 2024)**\n\n  * Net interest income was $8.8 million for the quarter, compared to $8.6 million in the preceding quarter and $10.4 million in the first fiscal quarter a year ago.\n  * Net interest margin (“NIM”) was 2.47% for the quarter, compared to 2.32% in the preceding quarter and 2.79% for the year ago quarter.\n  * Asset quality remained strong, with non-performing assets at $461,000, or 0.03% of total assets at June 30, 2024.\n  * Riverview recorded no provision for credit losses during the current quarter, the preceding quarter, or in the year ago quarter.\n  * The allowance for credit losses was $15.4 million, or 1.47% of total loans.\n  * Total loans increased $21.1 million during the quarter to $1.05 billion at June 30, 2024, compared to $1.02 billion at March 31, 2024, and increased $40.7 million compared to $1.00 billion at June 30, 2023.\n  * Total deposits were $1.22 billion, compared to $1.23 billion three months earlier and $1.24 billion a year earlier.\n  * Riverview has approximately $456.3 million in available liquidity at June 30, 2024, including $164.4 million of borrowing capacity from the FHLB and $291.9 million from the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco (“FRB”).

The increase compared to the preceding quarter was driven by organic loan growth and higher interest earning asset yields and lower overall interest expense due to the utilization of the proceeds from the sale of investment securities in the prior quarter to paydown outstanding borrowings. The decrease in net interest income compared to the year ago quarter was driven primarily by an increase in interest expense on deposits due to higher interest rates and interest rate expense related to borrowings. Investment income decreased compared to the preceding quarter due to the strategic investment restructuring that was executed in the prior quarter. Additionally, Riverview sold a portion of its converted Visa A shares (formerly Visa B shares) during the first quarter which generated $193,000 of income.\n\nRiverview’s NIM was 2.47% for the first quarter of fiscal 2025, a 15 basis-point increase compared to 2.32% in the preceding quarter and a 32 basis-point decrease compared to 2.79% in the first quarter of fiscal 2024. “Our NIM is showing signs of stabilizing, expanding 15 basis points compared to the linked quarter, boosted by loan growth and higher interest earning asset yields,” said David Lam, EVP and Chief Financial Officer. “The decrease compared to the year ago quarter was primarily due to the increase in our cost of deposits and borrowings due to the high interest rate environment.”\n\nInvestment securities decreased $9.5 million during the quarter to $363.2 million at June 30, 2024, compared to $372.7 million at March 31, 2024, and decreased $81.0 million compared to $444.2 million at June 30, 2023. The average securities balances for the quarters ended June 30, 2024, March 31, 2024, and June 30, 2023, were $391.3 million, $444.1 million, and $476.1 million, respectively. The weighted average yields on securities balances for those same periods were 2.11%, 2.02%, and 2.05%, respectively. The duration of the investment portfolio at June 30, 2024, was approximately 5.1 years. The anticipated investment cashflows over the next twelve months is approximately $52.9 million.\n\nRiverview’s yield on loans improved to 4.70% during the first fiscal quarter, compared to 4.63% in the preceding quarter, and 4.50% in the first fiscal quarter a year ago. While loan yields improved during the current quarter, they remain under pressure due to the concentration of fixed-rate loans in the Company’s portfolio. Deposit costs increased to 1.14% during the first fiscal quarter compared to 1.00% in the preceding quarter, and 0.44% in the first fiscal quarter a year ago.\n\nNon-interest income increased to $3.4 million during the first fiscal quarter of 2025 compared to $494,000 in the preceding quarter and $3.3 million in the first fiscal quarter of 2024. Non-interest income for the preceding quarter included the $2.7 million loss on sale of investment securities resulting from the strategic balance sheet restructuring that occurred. Excluding the securities loss, non-interest income for the fourth fiscal quarter of 2024 would have been $3.2 million. Higher fees and service charges related to interchange income and brokered loan fee income contributed to the increase during the quarter.\n\nAsset management fees continue to perform well due to new client relationships and a strong equity market performance during the first quarter. Asset management fees were $1.6 million during the first fiscal quarter, compared to $1.4 million in both the preceding quarter, and in the first fiscal quarter a year ago. Riverview Trust Company’s assets under management were $897.9 million at June 30, 2024, compared to $961.8 million at March 31, 2024, and $901.6 million at June 30, 2023.\n\nNon-interest expense was $11.0 million during the first quarter, compared to $13.1 million in the preceding quarter and $10.0 million in the first fiscal quarter a year ago. Included in other expenses for the preceding quarter included the $2.3 million litigation expense recorded in the prior quarter. Salary and employee benefits were up during the current quarter compared to the preceding quarter, as a result of salary increases, higher health insurance costs and higher payroll taxes. Occupancy and depreciation costs increased during the quarter due to updates and modernization of Riverview’s facilities. The efficiency ratio was 90.0% for the first fiscal quarter. This compared to 144.9% for the previous quarter (91.8% excluding the securities loss and litigation) and 73.1% in the first fiscal quarter a year ago.\n\nRiverview’s effective tax rate for the first quarter of fiscal 2025 was 20.8%, compared to (27.0)% for the preceding quarter and 22.4% for the year ago quarter.\n\n**Balance Sheet Review**\n\n“We posted strong quarterly loan growth during the first quarter, which was due to a combination of organic growth and construction draws, as well as the purchase of $5.0 million in consumer loans,” said Mike Sventek, EVP and Chief Lending Officer. Total loans increased $21.1 million during the quarter to $1.05 billion at June 30, 2024, compared to $1.02 billion three months earlier and increased $40.7 million compared to $1.00 billion a year earlier. Riverview’s loan pipeline was $32.3 million at June 30, 2024, compared to $18.4 million at the end of the prior quarter. New loan originations during the quarter increased to $23.2 million, compared to $12.7 million in the preceding quarter and $20.3 million in the first quarter a year ago.\n\nUndisbursed construction loans totaled $48.0 million at June 30, 2024, compared to $58.3 million at March 31, 2024, with the majority of the undisbursed construction loans expected to be funded over the next several quarters. Undisbursed homeowner association loans for the purpose of common area maintenance and repairs totaled $14.5 million at June 30, 2024, compared to $16.4 million at March 31, 2024. Revolving commercial business loan commitments totaled $50.7 million at June 30, 2024, compared to $50.4 million at March 31, 2024. Utilization on these loans totaled 32.07% at June 30, 2024, compared to 14.61% at March 31, 2024. The weighted average rate on loan originations during the quarter was 8.06% compared to 8.41% in the preceding quarter.\n\nThe office building loan portfolio totaled $113.4 million at June 30, 2024, compared to $114.7 million at March 31, 2024. The average loan balance of the office building loan portfolio was $1.5 million with an average loan-to-value ratio of 54.7% and an average debt service coverage ratio of 1.96%.\n\nTotal deposits decreased $12.0 million during the quarter to $1.22 billion at June 30, 2024, compared to $1.23 billion at March 31, 2024, and decreased $23.6 million compared to $1.24 billion a year ago. The decrease during the current quarter was in part due to customers continuing to use up deposit balances instead of borrowing due to the higher interest rate environment.\n\nNon-interest checking and interest checking accounts, as a percentage of total deposits, totaled 50.9% at June 30, 2024, compared to 51.9% at March 31, 2024, and 50.1% at June 30, 2023.\n\nFHLB advances increased $25.2 million during the quarter to $113.5 million at June 30, 2024, compared to $88.3 million at March 31, 2024. Proceeds from the securities sale during the prior quarter were used to pay down borrowings. FHLB advances were utilized to partially offset the decrease in deposit balances and to fund the increase in loans receivable.\n\nShareholders’ equity was $155.9 million at June 30, 2024, compared to $155.6 million three months earlier and $154.1 million one year earlier. Tangible book value per share (non-GAAP) was $6.09 at June 30, 2024, compared to $6.07 at March 31, 2024, and $6.00 at June 30, 2023. Riverview paid a quarterly cash dividend of $0.02 per share on July 22, 2024, to shareholders of record on July 10, 2024.\n\n**Credit Quality**\n\nAsset quality remained strong, with non-performing loans, excluding SBA and USDA government guaranteed loans (“government guaranteed loans”) (non-GAAP), at $160,000 or 0.02% of total loans as of June 30, 2024, compared to $173,000, or 0.02% of total loans at March 31, 2024, and $210,000, or 0.02% of total loans at June 30, 2023. There was one non-performing government guaranteed loan totaling $301,000 at June 30, 2024, and one non-performing government guaranteed loan totaling $5,000 at March 31, 2024. At June 30, 2024, including government guaranteed loans, non-performing assets were $461,000, or 0.03% of total assets.\n\nRiverview recorded zero net loan charge offs for the first fiscal quarter. This compared to net loan recoveries of $3,000 for the preceding quarter. Riverview recorded no provision for credit losses for the first fiscal quarter, or for the preceding quarter.\n\nClassified assets were $228,000 at June 30, 2024, compared to $723,000 at March 31, 2024, and $1.1 million at June 30, 2023. The classified asset to total capital ratio was 0.1% at June 30, 2024, compared to 0.4% at March 31, 2024, and 0.6% a year earlier. Criticized assets were $37.7 million at June 30, 2024, compared to $36.7 million at March 31, 2024, and $24.5 million at June 30, 2023. The increase in criticized assets compared to a year ago was mainly due to one relationship downgrade which has plans in place to pay off outstanding loans or meet certain loan covenants. The Company does not believe this is a systemic credit issue.\n\nThe allowance for credit losses was $15.4 million at June 30, 2024, which was unchanged compared to March 31, 2024, and an increase compared to $15.3 million one year earlier. The allowance for credit losses represented 1.47% of total loans at June 30, 2024, compared to 1.50% at March 31, 2024, and 1.53% a year earlier. The allowance for credit losses to loans, net of government guaranteed loans (non-GAAP), was 1.54% at June 30, 2024, compared to 1.58% at March 31, 2024, and 1.62% a year earlier.\n\n**Capital**\n\nRiverview continues to maintain capital levels well in excess of the regulatory requirements to be categorized as “well capitalized” with a total risk-based capital ratio of 16.18% and a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 10.67% at June 30, 2024. Tangible common equity to average tangible assets ratio (non-GAAP) was 8.51% at June 30, 2024.\n\n**Non-GAAP Financial Measures**\n\nIn addition to results presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), this press release contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Management has presented these non-GAAP financial measures in this earnings release because it believes that they provide useful and comparative information to assess trends in Riverview's core operations reflected in the current quarter's results and facilitate the comparison of our performance with the performance of our peers.
