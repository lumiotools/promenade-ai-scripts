(QNTM) is a clinical-stage biotechnology company dedicated to pioneering treatments for\ncritical gaps in brain disorders and alcohol health. The company boasts a strong pipeline of innovative therapies.\nCurrently, it has two candidates at varying stages of development – 1) Lucid-MS, a unique proprietary compound\ndesigned to address progressive Multiple Sclerosis (MS); and 2) unbuzzd™, an exclusive formulation comprising natural\ningredients, vitamins, and minerals. This formulation aids in expediting alcohol metabolism, thus lowering Blood Alcohol\nContent. Of these, the near-term catalyst is the anticipated launch of unbuzzdTM in August 2024. unbuzzd™ is\nspearheaded by marketing luminary Kevin Harrington and former CEO of Celsius Holdings, Inc., Gerry David. Together,\nthey have collectively generated billions of dollars in sales and brand value for shareholders. The market potential is\nimmense, and QNTM stands poised to reap substantial benefits upon the product's commercial launch.\nWe maintain our Buy-Venture rating and adjust our price target to $12.80 per share.\nQ2:24 Financial Performance\nThe Company does not report any revenues. Quantum Biopharma reported G&A expenses of $2.31 million in Q2:24, an\nincrease of 23% compared to $1.87 million in Q2:23. The increase is attributable to higher professional fees and investor\nrelations expenses, partially offset by a decrease in salaries and wages, general office expenditures, and lower consulting\nfees. Though, going forward we expect general and administrative expenses to increase as QNTM increases its\nheadcount to grow the business. QNTM incurred a 44% YOY decline in total R&D expenditure to $0.89 million primarily\ndue to recovery in R&D fees because of credits received from contract research organizations that can be applied against\nfuture services.\nNet loss was $3.3 million versus a loss of $5.4 million in Q2:23. Net loss per share was $(0.08) in Q2:24. The Company\nnoted that it has sufficient liquidity to meet its obligations and day-to-day expenditures over the next twelve months.\nNotably, the cash and cash equivalents (including finance receivables) were $15.3 million as of August 13, 2024, nearly\n3x the current market cap of the Company. Our cash factors in $5.5 million of proceeds raised via an ATM agreement\npost Q2:24.\nLaunch of unbuzzdTM: Quantum noted that it has successfully completed the first production run of unbuzzdTM stick\npacks and is on track to commercially launch unbuzzdTM by the end of August 2024. The initial launch will comprise\nslender packs which will be easy to carry in a pocket or purse. Celly Nutrition intends to introduce 12oz Ready to Drink\n(RTD) cans to the unbuzzd™ product range later this year.\nName Change and Share Consolidation. The Company announced its name change to Quantum BioPharma Ltd. under\na new ticker, QNTM. The Company also announced a share consolidation in the ratio of 65:1 post the share\nconsolidation, the total number of shares (both class A and B) were 1,300,729.\nEthics Approval for Phase-1 Multiple Ascending Dose Study for Lucid-MS. Quantum has received approval from the\nHuman Ethics Review Committee (HREC) in Australia to conduct a Phase 1 study aimed at evaluating the safety and\npharmacokinetics of multiple ascending doses of Lucid-21-302 (Lucid-MS) in healthy adults. This clinical study expands\nupon the previous Phase 1 study of Lucid-21-302. In a previous Phase 1 study involving single ascending doses, Lucid-\n21-302 demonstrated safety and good tolerance within the 50-300 mg p.o. dose range when administered once to healthy\nadults. Importantly, there were no discernible differences in pharmacokinetics between fed and fasted states. Compared\nto the single ascending dose in the prior Phase 1 study, the new study will focus on multiple ascending doses and\nsignifies a crucial step in the progress towards development of a novel treatment for multiple sclerosis.\nValuation\nWe value each of the Company’s leading drug candidates – Lucid-MS and unbuzzdTM to arrive at a final value for QNTM.\nWe value Lucid-MS using a risk-adjusted DCF, while unbuzzdTM is valued using a peer comparable methodology.\nLucid-MS: We have estimated revenue for Lucid-MS based on the targeted disease incidence rates and the Company’s\nability to capture market share. We model the U.S. and the EU market for Multiple Sclerosis (MS), where the Company is\n2 | Quantum BioPharma Ltd. BJ Cook, CFA\ncurrently targeting to advance the drug. For Lucid-MS, we have assumed a probability of success of 10%. Furthermore,\nwe have accounted for the royalty and milestone payments to UHN. We assume a royalty rate of 3%. We assume a 15%\nmarket penetration to incorporate Lucid-MS’s attractive value proposition which includes its non-immunomodulatory\nresponse and superior efficacy given its ability prevent and reverse myelin degradation. We assume that Quantum\nBioPharma does not out-license Lucid-MS to other large pharma companies upon the release of positive results from its\nongoing clinical trials.\nA 30% discount rate is assumed to reflect the heightened risk of a clinical-stage drug development company.

In our\ncomparable company analysis, we screened for companies in the alcohol hangover cure sector. We value Unbuzzd™ at\n0.9x 2027E sales of $327 million, at a 50% discount to the peer group owing to its smaller size as well as its early stage in\nits business cycle with no revenue.

(NASDAQ; HUGE; CSE: HUGE - $1.30)\nIndustry: Biopharmaceuticals Price Target: $4.60\nCOMPANY SNAPSHOT INVESTMENT HIGHLIGHTS\nFSD Pharma is a biopharmaceutical company The two lead product candidates in HUGE’s two\nbuilding a portfolio of innovative assets and biotech business lines, which represent unmet needs,\nsolutions. Through its wholly owned subsidiary, are poised to achieve substantial growth and\nLucid Psycheceuticals Inc., FSD is focused on the market penetration. HUGE will commence\ndevelopment of its lead compound, Lucid-MS, a commercialization in early 2024 in one business line\npatented new chemical entity shown to prevent and and launch a 2H24 Phase II clinical trial in the other.\nreverse myelin degradation, the underlying\nmechanism of multiple sclerosis. FSD is also Its lead biopharmaceutical candidate to treat MS,\nfocused on the research and development of Lucid-MS, has generated encouraging interim\nUNBUZZD™, a proprietary formulation of natural data results in its Phase I clinical trial. Given\ningredients, vitamins, and minerals to help with liver unique characteristics such as mechanism of action,\nand brain function for the purposes of quickly and the ability to potentially reduce myelin\nrelieving individuals from the effects of alcohol degradation, the orally administered Lucid-MS could\nconsumption. ultimately receive FDA approval in 2027.\nKEY STATISTICS UNBUZZD™ is a new functional beverage that\nseeks, for the first time, to provide relief from\nPrice as of 11/22/23 $1.30 inebriation and truly accelerate alcohol\nmetabolism. This leads to reduced Breath Alcohol\n52 Week High – Low $2.10 - $0.618\nConcentration (BrAC) and a faster path to sobriety.\nEst.

A new share dividend\nCOMPANY INFORMATION\narrangement is set to occur next week whereby\nHUGE shareholders will receive 1:1 shares of Celly\nFSD Pharma, Inc.\nNu, a rare and major reward, given the potential\n199 Bay Street Suite 4000\nvalue of Celly Nu.\nToronto, ON M5L 1A9 Canada\nOur 12-month price target of $4.60 is based on\nWeb: www.FSDPharma.com the future value of the UNBUZZD™ business,\nEmail: ir@fsdpharma.com and a NPV estimate of the Lucid-MS product.\nPhone : 416.854.8884 These forecasts are based on projected sales of\nUNBUZZD™ and Lucid-MS.\nwww.goldmanresearch.com\nCopyright © Goldman Small Cap Research, 2023 Page 2 of 23\nInvestment and Company Research\nOpportunity Research\nCOMPANY REPORT\nCOMPANY OVERVIEW\nThe View from 40,000 Feet\nGiven its enviable positioning, low valuation, and a pending transaction designed to reward its shareholders, it\nis easy to see why we view FSD Pharma, Inc. (NASDAQ: HUGE; CSE: HUGE) as a rare opportunity and our\npick of the year for 2024. HUGE has two products under development each representing multiple billion-dollar\nmarkets, and unmet needs. One product is a patented, innovative oral ethical drug treatment for Multiple\nSclerosis (MS) slated to commence Phase II clinical trials in 2H24. The other product is slated for commercial\nlaunch in 1Q24 and is a proprietary functional beverage formulation designed to quickly relieve individuals from\nthe effects of alcohol consumption. In our view, both products offer significant value to HUGE and its\nshareholders with the underlying and future valuations of the businesses poised to benefit from a stock dividend,\nwhose ex-dividend date is November 27, 2023. This means that in order for prospective HUGE shareholders to\nbenefit, they must own HUGE common (Class B) shares before November 27. The distribution date is November\n29, 2023. With multiple catalysts and valuation drivers ahead, our 12-month target price is $4.60, a roughly three-\nfold jump from the recent close. Plus, we believe additional upside exists to this target.\nUNBUZZD™: Innovative Product, Unmatched Leadership, Celly Nu Dividend\nThe Product\nUNBUZZD™ could be the elixir society has been seeking to reduce the\neffects of alcohol assumptions. This new functional beverage seeks to\nprovide relief from inebriation and accelerate alcohol metabolism\nleading to reduced Breath Alcohol Concentration (BrAC) and a faster\npath to sobriety. The active ingredients in UNBUZZD™’s proprietary\nnatural ingredients-based formula helps restore mental alertness post-\nalcohol consumption in an average of about 15-30 minutes. Small focus\ngroup research indicates UNBUZZD™ reduced BrAC faster than what\nthe body would do naturally. Clinical trials are being planned for further\nvalidation.\nA plethora of statistics exists regarding alcohol consumption, high intensity drinking, and binge drinking. Recent\ndata from the US Department of Health & Human Services indicates that People experiencing high intensity\ndrinking were 70x more likely to have an alcohol-related Emergency Room (ER) visit compared to people that\ndon’t binge drink. Unfortunately, time-honored methods and customs for reaching sobriety faster are just bunk\nas only “time” can truly allow the liver to filter blood and process alcohol, and the time is a bit different for each\nperson. With UNBUZZD™, the “time hurdle” appears to have been overcome.\nClearly, this consumer product could prove to be a revolutionary, widely available offering that emerges as the\ngo-to and must-have source to reduce alcohol effects. While the initial offering will be made for sale in virtually\nan entire spectrum of retail and online outlets, potential clinical trial success could lead UNBUZZD™ to be “on\nthe shelves” in emergency rooms across the US. As a result, the bottleneck of drunk patients in emergency\nwww.goldmanresearch.com\nCopyright © Goldman Small Cap Research, 2023 Page 3 of 23\nInvestment and Company Research\nOpportunity Research\nCOMPANY REPORT\nrooms while waiting to be sober can be favorably reduced to make them more effective. And additional verticals\ncould emerge as utilization increases.\nLeadership\nThe Company, which has the rights to the UNBUZZD™ formulation, has licensed it to Celly Nutrition Corp. (Celly\nNU), who will produce it, market and sell it, and pay HUGE a 7% royalty on sales. The leadership of Celly Nu\nshould give industry pundits a great deal of confidence in the product’s potential success. Celly Nu’s Chairman\nis Gerry David, the former CEO of Celsius (NASDAQ:CELH), who took the company from the brink of bankruptcy\nto $9B in annual sales. The CEO is John Duffy, a Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) veteran with a tremendous track record\nin the industry. Last, and certainly not least, is Kevin Harrington, head of marketing of Celly Nu. Kevin is the\noriginal “shark” on Shark Tank. Importantly, his legendary work behind the scenes of business ventures has\nproduced more than $5 billion in global sales, and the launch of more than 500 consumer products. One would\nbe hard pressed to find an early-stage firm with a stronger executive team.\nThe Dividend: A Rare Opportunity\nAbout a week ago, HUGE securityholders voted on an innovative arrangement with Celly Nu which will result in\nHUGE shareholders receiving one share of Celly Nu for each Class B common share (and warrants) of HUGE,\nwith an ex-dividend date of November 27th, a record date of November 28th and a distribution date of November\n29th. HUGE will still own a significant minority stake in Celly Nu-post-dividend.\nIn our view, this dividend is a creative bonus to its loyal and opportunistic shareholders. We forecast substantial\nrevenue for UNBUZZD™ and for those HUGE shareholders fortunate to directly own shares, future liquidity via\nan IPO or acquisition could be a boon. Emerging functional beverage companies often trade over 2.5x revenue;\ntherefore, the value of the Celly Nu stock could be considerable. It is a rare event that shareholders can be\nrewarded with stock in a company at such a key inflection point, led by industry leaders. Still, HUGE shareholders\nwho purchase he stock after the ex-dividend date can still indirectly benefit from HUGE’s ownership in Celly Nu\nand its future high-level, prospective valuation growth.\nHUGE Lead Drug Candidate: Lucid-MS\nLucid-MS is a patented neuroprotective, orally administered compound that has demonstrated in preclinical\nmodels to prevent and reverse myelin degradation, a core driver of the symptoms of Multiple Sclerosis, as well\nas other neurodegenerative diseases and conditions. The Company’s unique mechanism of action to prevent\nand reduce demyelination has demonstrated it can help preserve neuronal health and accelerate functional\nrecovery. Moreover, this compound offers no suppression of the immune system and no immunomodulation.\nA Phase I clinical trial has been completed and interim results indicate favorable safety, and tolerability,\nleveraging its pharmakinetic profile. Prior to the commencement of the Phase I trial, Lucid-MS demonstrated\nexcellent results in several animal models. In fact, there is over 12 years of data.\nThe Company’s Clinical Research Organization (CRO) published an interim blinded report for the first 4 cohorts\nof this trial. It is the first-in-human single ascending dose Phase I clinical trial evaluating the Company's novel\ndrug candidate, Lucid-MS, which is an orally-administered treatment for MS. Going forward, FSD Pharma’s\nwww.goldmanresearch.com\nCopyright © Goldman Small Cap Research, 2023 Page 4 of 23\nInvestment and Company Research\nOpportunity Research\nCOMPANY REPORT\nwholly owned subsidiary, Lucid Psycheceuticals, will continue to development Lucid-MS for potential treatment\nof progressive MS, an indication where there is an unmet need for novel, non-immunomodulatory treatments. A\nPhase II trial with a primary and secondary objectives of tolerability, dosage (leveraging the ascending dosage\nin Phase I) and myelin degradation prevention efficacy is planned to commence in 2H24.\nIf future results match the Phase I and the animal models, Lucid-MS could become a multi-billion-dollar treatment\nfor nearly 2M sufferers in North America and the EU alone. The unique efficacious nature of an oral compound\nat the heart of the progressive MS strain versus the symptoms would be a major win for the Company. For now,\nthe Company is on track to potentially complete a Phase II and t Phase III clinical process and we believe FDA\napproval could occur in 2027, with sales to begin later that year.\nFinancial Forecasts & Valuation\nAt present, we forecast royalty revenue of UNBUZZD™ to jump from $2.9M in 2024 to $9.7M in 2025 on total\nsales of $42M and $138.7M, respectively. As a pure royalty stream, HUGE does not record any cost of goods\nsold, a nice feature of the business model. We should note that in 2025 we expect sales to the hospital and other\ninstitutional verticals should begin, helping to drive overall unit sales. We project operating losses due to\nexpenses related to the Lucid-MS research and development.\nOur 12-month price target of $4.60 is based on our valuation assessments for both lines of business. For the\nfunctional beverage side, we assign a 2x revenue multiple on 2025E total sales, a discount to the typical pubco\nindustry valuations. By applying a 35% rate of ownership in the business, we arrive at a value of roughly $97M\nFor Lucid-MS, we elected to utilize a Net Present Value (NPV) on a 1x price/revenue basis. This assumes a\nmodest market penetration in 5 years with 2028 sales of $752.5M discounted back at a 40% rate. We thus arrive\nat a NPV of $134M.\nBy adding both values together we arrive at a 12-month valuation of $231M and based on a future share count,\nour target of $4.60 is derived. It should be noted that we built in upside potential related to UNBUZZD™ unit\nsales and pricing. Plus, our MS patient forecast and oral treatment pricing is admittedly conservative. Previous\nFDA-approved treatments, especially oral compounds, enjoyed very swift patient signups and high pricing, until\ngenerics were authorized and entered the market. We would not be surprised to see a similar outcome with\nLucid-MS in the early stages, if it were to achieve FDA approval.\nTHE HUGE DIFFERENCE\nFSD Pharma, Inc. is a biopharmaceutical company building a portfolio of innovative assets and biotech solutions.\nThrough its wholly owned subsidiary, Lucid Psycheceuticals Inc., FSD Pharma is focused on the development\nof its lead compound, Lucid-MS, a patented new chemical entity shown to prevent and reverse myelin\ndegradation, the underlying mechanism of multiple sclerosis. FSD is also focused on the research and\ndevelopment of UNBUZZD™, a proprietary formulation of natural ingredients, vitamins, and minerals to help with\nliver and brain function for the purposes of quickly relieving individuals from the effects of alcohol consumption.\nwww.goldmanresearch.com\nCopyright © Goldman Small Cap Research, 2023 Page 5 of 23\nInvestment and Company Research\nOpportunity Research\nCOMPANY REPORT\nUNBUZZD™: The Space and Competitive Advantages\nExcessive consumption of alcohol is a pervasive problem in which we are all aware.\nAlcohol, also known with its chemical name ethanol, is metabolized by several processes or pathways in our\nbody. Most commonly, ethanol is broken down by alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) and metabolizes into\nacetaldehyde, a toxic substance and a known carcinogen. Although the compound is short lived, acetaldehyde\nis responsible for the psychological effects, inebriation, and potential liver damage from increased alcohol\nconsumption.\nAlcohol consumption interferes with the brain’s communication pathways, altering the way the brain functions.\nThe disrupted pathways reduce function of key areas of the brain responsible for motor skills such as balance\nand coordination, and one’s judgment.\nMADD (Mothers Against Drunk Driving) reports that 2/3 of people will be affected by drunk driving in their lifetime.\nTo that end, every 45 minutes someone is killed in a drunk driving crash. These figures are further bolstered by\na 2021 National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) by the US Department of Health and Human Services\n(www.samhsa.gov). This survey reported that over half of people aged 19+ reported that they drank in the past\nmonth, and nearly 1 in 4 reported engaging in binge drinking in the past month.\nConsuming alcohol causes a rise in BrAC, a well-established estimate of BAC (Blood Alcohol Concentration). In\n49 states in the USA, a BrAC reading of 0.08 and above can result in criminal charges. In Utah, the illegal BrAC\nlevel is 0.05 and above. Across the entire U.S., drivers can also face charges for sub-0.08 BrAC readings under\nappropriate impaired driving laws.\nwww.goldmanresearch.com\nCopyright © Goldman Small Cap Research, 2023 Page 6 of 23\nInvestment and Company Research\nOpportunity Research\nCOMPANY REPORT\nUnfortunately, these statistics dovetail with today’s recovery drinks, whose sole objective is to relieve undeniable\ndiscomfort after a night out of drinking. Most current products for sale utilize herbal and plant-based ingredients,\nsuch as ginseng, turmeric, and milk thistle, to manufacture hangover cure products. Despite this singular focus,\nthe industry is large and growing quickly. According to Grandview Research, the Global Hangover Cure Products\nmarket size was valued at $1.56 billion in 2020 and is expected to expand at a CAGR of 14.6% from 2021 to\n2028, reaching a $4.67B market size.\nTo date, there has yet to be a product backed by strong clinical data that targets reducing BAC (BrAC) levels\nand Mental Alertness, directly and efficiently. Unfortunately, time-honored methods and customs for reaching\nsobriety faster are just bunk as only “time” can truly allow the liver to filter blood and process alcohol, and the\ntime is a bit different for each person.\nWith UNBUZZD™, the “time hurdle” appears to have been overcome.\nUNBUZZD™ is more than a hangover cure product. Through its ethanol-eliminating technology, the creators of\nthe product seek to offer relief from inebriation in few minutes and shorten the time to lower BrAC (sober up a\nperson), along with helping mitigate hangover severity. This approach can reduce the burden of the aftermath\neffects of excess alcohol consumption on society since one person’s inebriation can impact others.\nThe Company’s formulation was curated through scientific research to expediate recovery from inebriation and\nto accelerate ethanol metabolism in the body, and provide support to the brain and cells, potentially eliminating\nany performance concerns today or tomorrow. FSD Pharma has spun out UNBUZZD™ development through\nCelly Nutrition Corp. This 35%-owned subsidiary, is planning human trials to clinically validate this method of\naction, which would represent a potential industry breakthrough.\nSince the product is already served as a liquid, the onset of action can be expedited when compared to tablets,\ncapsules, pills. While there are few advantages to tablets/pills/capsules, when consumed, they need to\ndisintegrate to be available in the blood stream for absorption. Conversely, oral liquids are either in a dissolved\nor a dispersed state resulting in a quicker start or onset of action. The current target market includes traditional\nconsumers as well as the institutional/emergency rooms. For the Hospital Market, the Company may help an\nunmet need in the ER and other healthcare settings, reducing costs and burden on healthcare resources/staff\nwith a new product (REKVRY™). First Responders – Police, Fire and Ambulance are constantly having to deal\nwith people who have drunk excessively, tying up precious human and financial resources.\nMilestones\nAt present, the Company has been finalizing the formulations, product design, co-packaging, logistics,\nmanufacturing, QA, warehousing, etc. It is anticipated that a direct-to-consumer website (on the Amazon\nplatform) will launch in 1Q24. Following the ecommerce site, we anticipate that the Celsius team will leverage its\nbroad distribution contacts, long with retail, convenience stores, hotel, drug stores, and others. Plus, Celly\nNutrition will work with multiple agencies to lock down each component, including social media, search,\necommerce marketing, Google, Facebook, etc. In addition, management will use targeted influencers, content\ncreators, ambassadors and others to broaden the marketing reach.\nwww.goldmanresearch.com\nCopyright © Goldman Small Cap Research, 2023 Page 7 of 23\nInvestment and Company Research\nOpportunity Research\nCOMPANY REPORT\nEarlier this year, HUGE granted exclusive consumer rights to the revolutionary recreational alcohol misuse\ntechnology to Celly Nutrition led by John Duffy (20 Years at Coca-Cola), Gerry David (Founding Ex-CEO of\nCelsius) and Kevin Harrington. In exchange for this transaction HUGE is entitled to a 7% royalty on gross revenue\nof the product as well as 100% rights for healthcare and medical markets.\nMeanwhile, a definitive arrangement agreement with Celly Nu for 45,714,621 of FSD Pharma’s Celly Nu shares\nto be distributed to HUGE shareholders is nearly effective, with the Company slated to retain 35%. The ex-\ndividend date is November 27th with distribution on November 29th.\nIn our view, this dividend is a creative and rare opportunity for its loyal and opportunistic shareholders. We\nforecast substantial revenue for UNBUZZD™ and for those HUGE shareholders fortunate to directly own shares,\nfuture liquidity via an IPO or acquisition could be a boon. Emerging functional beverage companies often trade\nover 2.5x revenue; therefore, the value of the Celly Nu stock could be considerable. It is an unusual event that\nshareholders can be rewarded with stock in a company at such a key inflection point, led by industry leaders.\nStill, HUGE shareholders who purchase he stock after the ex-dividend date can still indirectly benefit from\nHUGE’s ownership in Celly Nu and its future high-level, prospective valuation growth.\nThe leadership of Celly Nu should give industry pundits a great deal of confidence in the product’s potential\nsuccess. One would be hard pressed to find an early-stage firm with a stronger executive team and our financial\nforecasts reflect this situation.\nA Quick MS Primer\nOur forecasts and data regarding some of the industry information regarding multiple sclerosis focuses on the\nNorth American market, primarily, and Europe on a secondary basis. For example, the current number of patients\nin North America afflicted with the disease is just over 1M, with Europe accounting for around 845,000. According\nto a recent report by Fortune Business Insights, MS Drug Sales in North America represented $10.7B in 2022,\nwith the market to essentially double by 2030.\nThe Mayo Clinic offers a concise description of MS:\n“Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a potentially disabling disease of the brain and spinal cord (central nervous system).\nIn MS, the immune system attacks the protective sheath (myelin) that covers nerve fibers and causes\ncommunication problems between your brain and the rest of the body. Eventually, the disease can cause\npermanent damage or deterioration of the nerve fibers.\nSigns and symptoms of MS vary widely between patients and depend on the location and severity of nerve\nfiber damage in the central nervous system. Some people with severe MS may lose the ability to walk\nindependently or ambulate at all. Other individuals may experience long periods of remission without any new\nsymptoms depending on the type of MS they have. There's no cure for multiple sclerosis. However, there are\ntreatments to help speed the recovery from attacks, modify the course of the disease and manage symptoms.\nThe cause of multiple sclerosis is unknown. It's considered an immune mediated disease in which the body's\nimmune system attacks its own tissues. In the case of MS, this immune system malfunction destroys the fatty\nsubstance that coats and protects nerve fibers in the brain and spinal cord (myelin). Myelin can be compared\nwww.goldmanresearch.com\nCopyright © Goldman Small Cap Research, 2023 Page 8 of 23\nInvestment and Company Research\nOpportunity Research\nCOMPANY REPORT\nto the insulation coating on electrical wires. When the protective myelin is damaged and the nerve fiber is\nexposed, the messages that travel along that nerve fiber may be slowed or blocked.\nCommon symptoms include numbness/weakness in one or more limbs that typically occurs on one side of your\nbody at a time, tingling, electric-shock sensations that occur with certain neck movements, lack of coordination,\nunsteady gait or inability to walk.”\nLucid-MS: The Next High Profile MS Treatment\nLucid-MS is a patented neuroprotective, orally administered compound that has demonstrated in preclinical\nmodels to prevent and reverse myelin degradation, a core driver of the symptoms of Multiple Sclerosis, as well\nas other neurodegenerative diseases and conditions.

Previous FDA-approved treatments, especially oral compounds,\nenjoyed substantial patient signups and sales despite the high pricing, until generics were authorized and\nentered the market. We would not be surprised to see a similar early outcome with Lucid-MS, if it were to achieve\nFDA approval.

We\nshould note that our 4M institutional/hospital unit sales forecast for 2025 may carry a price tag of $10 per unit.\nwww.goldmanresearch.com\nCopyright © Goldman Small Cap Research, 2023 Page 15 of 23\nInvestment and Company Research\nOpportunity Research\nCOMPANY REPORT\nTable I.

Since the Celly\nNu royalty carries a 7% rate, we project HUGE royalty revenue of $2.94M in 2024 and $9.7M in 2025. As this is\npure royalty revenue the P&L, found later in this report, indicates there are no COGS, a nice positive to the\nbusiness model. While this top-line growth rate is very strong, it is possible that HUGE may seek to consolidate\nrevenue and related expenses, with the balance offset by minority interests in the P&L and balance sheet.\nRecording these higher consolidated sales may generate higher than average industry price/sales multiples\n(currently around 2.25 – 2.5x). Thus, the valuation for HUGE itself could be favorably impacted.\nThe Valuation\nOur 12-month price target of $4.60 is based on our valuation assessments for both lines of business. For the\nfunctional beverage side, we assign a 2x revenue multiple on 2025E total sales, a discount to the typical pubco\nindustry valuations. By applying a 35% rate of ownership in the business, we arrive at a value of roughly $97M.\nFor Lucid-MS, we elected to utilize a Net Present Value (NPV) on a 1x price/revenue basis. This assumes a\nmodest market penetration in 5 years with 2028 sales of $752.5M discounted back at a 40% rate. We thus arrive\nat a NPV of $134M.\nBy adding both values together we arrive at a 12-month valuation of $231M and based on a future share count,\nof 50M, our target of $4.60 is derived. As noted above, we built in upside potential related to UNBUZZD™ unit\nsales and pricing. Plus, our MS patient forecast and oral treatment pricing is admittedly conservative. Previous\nFDA-approved treatments, especially oral compounds, enjoyed substantial patient signups and sales despite\nthe high pricing, until generics were authorized and entered the market. We would not be surprised to see a\nsimilar early outcome with Lucid-MS, if it were to achieve FDA approval.\nwww.goldmanresearch.com\nCopyright © Goldman Small Cap Research, 2023 Page 16 of 23\nInvestment and Company Research\nOpportunity Research\nCOMPANY REPORT\nTable II.

These include the core consumer product,\nLucid-MS development, and corporate/capital markets.\nOn the UNBUZZD™ front, we envision a series of risks. These risks include slower than expected market\npenetration beyond early adopters, distribution hurdles, less than favorable reception due to unrealistic efficacy\nperformance, or perhaps simply flavor or pricing. Another risk relates to clinical study or clinical trial outcomes\nwhich could negatively impact sales into the institutional/hospital market.\nOn the biopharmaceutical front, the Company’s biggest risk is related to future clinical trial results, notably\ncontinued safety and tolerability, but especially efficacy. Oral administration, while a popular approach, can carry\nperformance issues due to bioavailability of compounds. Immunosuppression may also occur at higher dosage\nlevels. If approved, the next major risk is related to the timing and magnitude of the sales and marketing ramp,\nand subsequent broad implementation/utilization of the proprietary product, perhaps due to pricing. Competitive\nrisks include lower pricing, more effective sales/marketing, greater efficacy.\nThe aforementioned risks for both business lines could come from larger competitors, existing firms, or new\nentrants. Still, these future concerns are consistent with firms of HUGE’s size and standing. Moreover, we believe\nthat HUGE’s seasoned management team is prepared to overcome these hurdles and generate significant top-\nline growth and product deployment and utilization.\nVolatility and liquidity are typical concerns for microcap stocks that trade under $5. Although the number of\nshares outstanding has been little changed recently, management may seek to capital to fund its R&D efforts,\ncorporate expansion, or potential M&A. An overriding financial benefit as a public company is the favorable\naccess to and the availability of capital to fund product development and launches, consistent marketing\nwww.goldmanresearch.com\nCopyright © Goldman Small Cap Research, 2023 Page 17 of 23\nInvestment and Company Research\nOpportunity Research\nCOMPANY REPORT\ncampaigns and other initiatives. Since the proceeds of any future funding would be used in large part to advance\nmajor business development and sales, we believe that any dilutive effect from such a funding could be offset\nby related increases in market value.\nFinally, we should note that HUGE has been the target of lawsuits in the past, with some outcomes in favor of\nHUGE and others with no current disposition. We do not know what a potential outcome of litigation could be but\nwe believe it is a risk commensurate with firms in HUGE’s segments.\nCONCLUSION\nThe two lead product candidates in HUGE’s two business lines, which represent unmet needs, are poised to\nachieve substantial growth and market penetration. HUGE will commence commercialization in early 2024 in\none business line and launch a 2H24 Phase II clinical trial in the other. Its lead biopharmaceutical candidate to\ntreat MS, Lucid-MS, has generated encouraging interim data results in its Phase I clinical trial. Given unique\ncharacteristics such as mechanism of action, and the ability to potentially reduce myelin degradation, the orally\nadministered Lucid-MS could ultimately receive FDA approval in 2027.\nUNBUZZD™ is a new functional beverage that seeks, for the first time, to provide relief from inebriation and truly\naccelerate alcohol metabolism. This leads to reduced Breath Alcohol Concentration (BrAC) and a faster path to\nsobriety. The start of major royalty revenue is set to occur in 1Q24.\nUNBUZZD™’s parent, Celly Nutrition, 35% owned by HUGE, is led by superstars in the consumer space,\nspecifically the functional beverage industry. A new share dividend arrangement is set to occur next week\nwhereby HUGE shareholders will receive 1:1 shares of Celly Nu, a rare and major reward, given the potential\nvalue of Celly Nu.\nOur 12-month price target of $4.60 is based on the future value of the UNBUZZD™ business, and a NPV\nestimate of the Lucid-MS product. These forecasts are based on projected sales of UNBUZZD™ and Lucid-MS.\nwww.goldmanresearch.com\nCopyright © Goldman Small Cap Research, 2023 Page 18 of 23\nInvestment and Company Research\nOpportunity Research\nCOMPANY REPORT\nTable III.
