(NASDAQ: CSTE), a leading developer and manufacturer of high-quality engineered surfaces, today reported financial results for its third quarter ended September 30, 2024. \n\nYos Shiran, Caesarstone’s Chief Executive Officer commented, “Our third quarter results reflect revenue pressure across all our regional markets, putting weight on our business. The entire Caesarstone team’s unwavering commitment to our success remains evident with our transformation initiatives and optimized manufacturing footprint helping to drive a higher gross margin year-over-year. Our team is making progress in a difficult environment and maintaining tight control of operating expenses. That operational discipline and working capital management generated positive cash flow this quarter, keeping us on track for another full year of positive operating cash flow. With meaningful savings realized from our ongoing restructuring actions, we continue to make targeted investments in innovative products, brand development and marketing programs to help stimulate demand. We are confident in the direction of the Company and will continue to take decisive actions to restore profitable growth.” \n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Results**\n\n**Revenue** in the third quarter of 2024 was $107.6 million, compared to $142.4 million in the prior year quarter. On a constant currency basis, third quarter revenue was down 24.8% year-over-year primarily due to lower volumes. Volumes were primarily impacted by global economic headwinds, particularly in renovation and remodeling channels, across the Company’s main regions resulting in lower demand accompanied by greater competitive pressures. \n\n**Gross margin** in the third quarter of 2024 improved to 19.9% compared to 19.1% in the prior year quarter. Adjusted gross margin in the third quarter was 19.8%, stable with the prior year quarter. Gross margin was stable on lower revenues mainly due to the benefits of an improved production footprint, partially offset by unfavorable product mix and increased shipping and material costs. \n\n**Operating expenses** in the third quarter of 2024 were $25.4 million, or 23.6% of revenue, compared to $29.2 million, or 20.5% of revenue in the prior year quarter. The higher percentage is primarily due to lower revenues. Restructuring expenses during the quarter included a capital gain of $6.9 million from the sale of undeveloped land at the Company’s Richmond Hill Facility. Excluding legal settlements and loss contingencies and restructuring expenses, operating expenses were 28.1% of revenue, compared to 23.7% in the prior year quarter. \n\n**Operating loss** in the third quarter of 2024 was $4.1 million compared to $2.0 million in the prior year quarter, with the difference primarily reflecting lower gross profit. \n\n**Adjusted EBITDA** in the third quarter of 2024, which excludes expenses for non-cash share-based compensation, legal settlements and loss contingencies, and other non-recurring items, was a loss of $4.1 million, compared to a gain of $1.9 million in the prior year quarter. \n\n**Finance income** in the third quarter of 2024 was $0.3 million compared to $1.3 million in the prior year quarter. The difference primarily reflects foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. \n\n**Net loss attributable to controlling interest** for the third quarter of 2024 was $4.2 million compared to net loss of $0.9 million in the prior year quarter. Net loss per share for the third quarter was $0.12 compared to net loss per share of $0.03 in the prior year quarter. Adjusted diluted net loss per share for the third quarter was $0.24 on 34.8 million shares, compared to Adjusted diluted net loss per share of $0.20 in the prior year quarter on 34.6 million shares. \n\n**Balance Sheet & Liquidity**\n\nOn June 26, 2024, Caesarstone entered into an agreement for the sale of 69 acres of undeveloped land associated with its Richmond Hill Facility located in Bryan County for approximately $10.0 million. The transaction closed in the third quarter of 2024. The Company continues to look for avenues to monetize the remainder of the property, consisting of 51 acres of developed land and associated structures. \n\nDuring the third quarter of 2024, the Company generated positive cash flow from operations of $16.3 million, mainly attributable to the land sale and working capital improvements, compared to operating cash flow of $28.2 million in the third quarter of 2023. As of September 30, 2024, the Company’s balance sheet included cash, cash equivalents and short-term bank deposits of $114.1 million and total debt to financial institutions of $5.2 million. The Company’s net cash position as of September 30, 2024, was $108.9 million compared to $83.5 million as of December 31, 2023. \n\n**US Legal Proceedings Update**\n\nThe Company is one of several defendants named in 79 pending lawsuits in the United States alleging injury associated with exposure of fabricators and their employees to respirable crystalline silica dust. On August 8, 2024, the Company filed a Form 6-K in connection with a single claim in the U.S. following a jury decision against the Company. Adequate provisions and insurance receivables related to this decision were recorded by the Company during the third quarter. While this single decision will not have a material adverse effect on the Company, the Company cannot provide assurance as to the outcome of other pending litigation or that such litigation will not have a material adverse impact on its business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows. \n\n**Outlook**\n\nThe Company reaffirms its expectation to deliver positive operating cash flow for the full year 2024, with cash generated in the first nine months more than offsetting a modest decline in the fourth quarter. The Company reiterates its expectation to realize restructuring-related cost savings of approximately $20.0 million in full year 2024 and $35.0 million thereafter compared to full year 2023. Given persistent macroeconomic pressures across the Company’s global footprint and increased shipping and material costs in the second half of 2024, Caesarstone now expects its full year Adjusted EBITDA loss to be in the range of $10 to $11 million. \n\n**Webcast and Conference Call Details**\n\nThe Company will host a webcast and conference call today, November 13, 2024, at 8:30 a.m. ET to discuss the results, followed by a question and answer session for the investment community.

Reconciliations of GAAP gross profit to Adjusted gross profit, GAAP net income (loss) to Adjusted net income (loss) and net income (loss) to Adjusted EBITDA are provided in the schedules to this release. To calculate revenues growth rates that exclude the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, the Company converts actual reported results from local currency to U.S. dollars using constant foreign currency exchange rates in the current and comparable period. The Company provides these non-GAAP financial measures because it believes that they present a better measure of the Company's core business and management uses the non-GAAP measures internally to evaluate the Company's ongoing performance. Accordingly, the Company believes that they are useful to investors in enhancing an understanding of the Company's operating performance. \n\n**Forward-Looking Statements**\n\nInformation provided in this press release may contain statements relating to current expectations, estimates, forecasts and projections about future events that are \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of the “safe harbor” provisions of the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

(NASDAQ: CSTE), a leading developer and manufacturer of high-quality engineered surfaces, today reported financial results for its second quarter ended June 30, 2024. \n\nYos Shiran, Caesarstone’s Chief Executive Officer commented, “Our improved gross margin in the second quarter compared to last year demonstrates the positive impact of our strategic restructuring actions. Our efforts to optimize our production footprint and strengthen relationships with our manufacturing partners are yielding tangible benefits. We continue to make progress on our strategic transformation, focusing on cost efficiencies, strengthening our sales and marketing efforts, and investing in R&D and innovation. Additionally, during July we increased our stake in Lioli Ceramica to 81%, which underscores our commitment to enhancing our porcelain business. Furthermore, our agreement to sell the undeveloped land parcel at our Richmond Hill Facility reflects our diligent efforts to monetize this asset. As we navigate through the remainder of 2024, we remain focused on improving the trajectory of our profitability while positioning Caesarstone for long-term growth.\" \n\n**Second Quarter 2024 Results**\n\n**Revenue** in the second quarter of 2024 was $119.4 million, compared to $143.7 million in the prior year quarter. On a constant currency basis, second quarter revenue was down 16.3% year-over-year due to lower volumes. Volumes were primarily impacted by global economic headwinds, particularly in renovation and remodeling channels, across the Company’s main regions resulting in lower demand accompanied by greater competitive pressures. \n\n**Gross margin** in the second quarter of 2024 improved to 22.9% compared to 8.3% in the prior year quarter. Adjusted gross margin in the second quarter was 23.8% compared to 9.6% in the prior year quarter. The increase in gross margin was mainly due to the benefits of an improved production footprint, partially offset by unfavorable product mix. Gross margin in second quarter of 2023 included a number of transitory factors that increased manufacturing unit costs mainly associated with the Sdot-Yam Facility closure and operational investments related to the Australian market. \n\n**Operating expenses** in the second quarter of 2024 were $36.6 million, or 30.6% of revenue, compared to $58.8 million, or 40.9% of revenue in the prior year quarter. The lower percentage is primarily attributable to the reduction in impairment and restructuring related expenses recorded during the second quarter 2023 in connection with the Sdot-Yam Facility closure. Excluding legal settlements and loss contingencies and restructuring expenses, operating expenses were 28.2% of revenue, compared to 24.3% in the prior year quarter. \n\n**Operating loss** in the second quarter of 2024 was $9.3 million compared to $46.9 million in the prior year quarter, with the improvement primarily reflecting higher gross margin and the impairment charges recorded in the second quarter of 2023. \n\n**Adjusted EBITDA** in the second quarter of 2024, which excludes expenses for non-cash share-based compensation, legal settlements and loss contingencies, and other non-recurring items, was a loss of $0.1 million, compared to a loss of $13.4 million in the prior year quarter. \n\n**Finance income** in the second quarter of 2024 was $1.8 million compared to $1.2 million in the prior year quarter. The difference primarily reflects foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and higher income on bank deposits. \n\n**Net loss attributable to controlling interest** for the second quarter of 2024 was $9.2 million compared to net loss of $52.5 million in the prior year quarter. Net loss per share for the second quarter was $0.27 compared to net loss per share of $1.52 in the prior year quarter. Adjusted diluted net loss per share for the second quarter was $0.14 on 35.0 million shares, compared to adjusted diluted net loss per share of $0.69 in the prior year quarter on 34.6 million shares. \n\n**Balance Sheet & Liquidity**\n\nDuring the second quarter of 2024, the Company generated positive cash flow from operations of $10.0 million mainly driven by inventory reductions, compared to operating cash flow of $17.2 million in the second quarter of 2023. As of June 30, 2024, the Company’s balance sheet included cash, cash equivalents and short-term bank deposits of $103.6 million and total debt to financial institutions of $5.9 million. The Company’s net cash position as of June 30, 2024, was $97.7 million compared to $83.5 million as of December 31, 2023. \n\nOn June 26, 2024, Caesarstone entered into an agreement for the sale of 69 acres of undeveloped land associated with its Richmond Hill Facility located in Bryan County for approximately $10.0 million. The transaction is expected to close in the third quarter of 2024 and is subject to due diligence. The Company continues to look for avenues to monetize the remainder of the property, consisting of 51 acres of developed land and associated structures. \n\n**Outlook**\n\nThe Company reaffirms its expectation to deliver positive operating cash flow for the full year 2024, primarily weighted towards the first half of the year. The Company now expects full year adjusted EBITDA to be a loss in the mid-single-digit million-dollar range, mainly due to increased shipping and material costs in the second half of 2024. The Company also reiterates its expectation to realize restructuring-related cost savings of approximately $20.0 million in full year 2024 and $30.0 million thereafter compared to full year 2023. \n\n**Webcast and Conference Call Details**\n\nThe Company will host a webcast and conference call today, August 7, 2024, at 8:30 a.m. ET to discuss the results, followed by a question and answer session for the investment community.

Reconciliations of GAAP gross profit to adjusted gross profit, GAAP net income (loss) to adjusted net income (loss) and net income (loss) to adjusted EBITDA are provided in the schedules to this release. To calculate revenues growth rates that exclude the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, the Company converts actual reported results from local currency to U.S. dollars using constant foreign currency exchange rates in the current and comparable period. The Company provides these non-GAAP financial measures because it believes that they present a better measure of the Company's core business and management uses the non-GAAP measures internally to evaluate the Company's ongoing performance. Accordingly, the Company believes that they are useful to investors in enhancing an understanding of the Company's operating performance. \n\n**Forward-Looking Statements**\n\nInformation provided in this press release may contain statements relating to current expectations, estimates, forecasts and projections about future events that are \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of the “safe harbor” provisions of the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

(NASDAQ: CSTE), a leading developer and manufacturer of high-quality engineered surfaces, today reported financial results for its third quarter ended September 30, 2024. \n\nYos Shiran, Caesarstone’s Chief Executive Officer commented, “Our third quarter results reflect revenue pressure across all our regional markets, putting weight on our business. The entire Caesarstone team’s unwavering commitment to our success remains evident with our transformation initiatives and optimized manufacturing footprint helping to drive a higher gross margin year-over-year. Our team is making progress in a difficult environment and maintaining tight control of operating expenses. That operational discipline and working capital management generated positive cash flow this quarter, keeping us on track for another full year of positive operating cash flow. With meaningful savings realized from our ongoing restructuring actions, we continue to make targeted investments in innovative products, brand development and marketing programs to help stimulate demand. We are confident in the direction of the Company and will continue to take decisive actions to restore profitable growth.” \n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Results**\n\n**Revenue** in the third quarter of 2024 was $107.6 million, compared to $142.4 million in the prior year quarter. On a constant currency basis, third quarter revenue was down 24.8% year-over-year primarily due to lower volumes. Volumes were primarily impacted by global economic headwinds, particularly in renovation and remodeling channels, across the Company’s main regions resulting in lower demand accompanied by greater competitive pressures. \n\n**Gross margin** in the third quarter of 2024 improved to 19.9% compared to 19.1% in the prior year quarter. Adjusted gross margin in the third quarter was 19.8%, stable with the prior year quarter. Gross margin was stable on lower revenues mainly due to the benefits of an improved production footprint, partially offset by unfavorable product mix and increased shipping and material costs. \n\n**Operating expenses** in the third quarter of 2024 were $25.4 million, or 23.6% of revenue, compared to $29.2 million, or 20.5% of revenue in the prior year quarter. The higher percentage is primarily due to lower revenues. Restructuring expenses during the quarter included a capital gain of $6.9 million from the sale of undeveloped land at the Company’s Richmond Hill Facility. Excluding legal settlements and loss contingencies and restructuring expenses, operating expenses were 28.1% of revenue, compared to 23.7% in the prior year quarter. \n\n**Operating loss** in the third quarter of 2024 was $4.1 million compared to $2.0 million in the prior year quarter, with the difference primarily reflecting lower gross profit. \n\n**Adjusted EBITDA** in the third quarter of 2024, which excludes expenses for non-cash share-based compensation, legal settlements and loss contingencies, and other non-recurring items, was a loss of $4.1 million, compared to a gain of $1.9 million in the prior year quarter. \n\n**Finance income** in the third quarter of 2024 was $0.3 million compared to $1.3 million in the prior year quarter. The difference primarily reflects foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. \n\n**Net loss attributable to controlling interest** for the third quarter of 2024 was $4.2 million compared to net loss of $0.9 million in the prior year quarter. Net loss per share for the third quarter was $0.12 compared to net loss per share of $0.03 in the prior year quarter. Adjusted diluted net loss per share for the third quarter was $0.24 on 34.8 million shares, compared to Adjusted diluted net loss per share of $0.20 in the prior year quarter on 34.6 million shares. \n\n**Balance Sheet & Liquidity**\n\nOn June 26, 2024, Caesarstone entered into an agreement for the sale of 69 acres of undeveloped land associated with its Richmond Hill Facility located in Bryan County for approximately $10.0 million. The transaction closed in the third quarter of 2024. The Company continues to look for avenues to monetize the remainder of the property, consisting of 51 acres of developed land and associated structures. \n\nDuring the third quarter of 2024, the Company generated positive cash flow from operations of $16.3 million, mainly attributable to the land sale and working capital improvements, compared to operating cash flow of $28.2 million in the third quarter of 2023. As of September 30, 2024, the Company’s balance sheet included cash, cash equivalents and short-term bank deposits of $114.1 million and total debt to financial institutions of $5.2 million. The Company’s net cash position as of September 30, 2024, was $108.9 million compared to $83.5 million as of December 31, 2023. \n\n**US Legal Proceedings Update**\n\nThe Company is one of several defendants named in 79 pending lawsuits in the United States alleging injury associated with exposure of fabricators and their employees to respirable crystalline silica dust. On August 8, 2024, the Company filed a Form 6-K in connection with a single claim in the U.S. following a jury decision against the Company. Adequate provisions and insurance receivables related to this decision were recorded by the Company during the third quarter. While this single decision will not have a material adverse effect on the Company, the Company cannot provide assurance as to the outcome of other pending litigation or that such litigation will not have a material adverse impact on its business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows. \n\n**Outlook**\n\nThe Company reaffirms its expectation to deliver positive operating cash flow for the full year 2024, with cash generated in the first nine months more than offsetting a modest decline in the fourth quarter. The Company reiterates its expectation to realize restructuring-related cost savings of approximately $20.0 million in full year 2024 and $35.0 million thereafter compared to full year 2023. Given persistent macroeconomic pressures across the Company’s global footprint and increased shipping and material costs in the second half of 2024, Caesarstone now expects its full year Adjusted EBITDA loss to be in the range of $10 to $11 million. \n\n**Webcast and Conference Call Details**\n\nThe Company will host a webcast and conference call today, November 13, 2024, at 8:30 a.m. ET to discuss the results, followed by a question and answer session for the investment community.

Reconciliations of GAAP gross profit to Adjusted gross profit, GAAP net income (loss) to Adjusted net income (loss) and net income (loss) to Adjusted EBITDA are provided in the schedules to this release. To calculate revenues growth rates that exclude the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, the Company converts actual reported results from local currency to U.S. dollars using constant foreign currency exchange rates in the current and comparable period. The Company provides these non-GAAP financial measures because it believes that they present a better measure of the Company's core business and management uses the non-GAAP measures internally to evaluate the Company's ongoing performance. Accordingly, the Company believes that they are useful to investors in enhancing an understanding of the Company's operating performance. \n\n**Forward-Looking Statements**\n\nInformation provided in this press release may contain statements relating to current expectations, estimates, forecasts and projections about future events that are \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of the “safe harbor” provisions of the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

Forward-looking statements may be identified\nby the use of words such as “goals,\" “intend,” “seek,” “anticipate,” “believe,” “could,” “continue,” “expect,” “estimate,” “may,” “plan,” “outlook,” “future” and “project” and other similar\nexpressions that predict, project or indicate future events or trends or that are not statements of historical matters. Such forward-looking statements include statements regarding\nthe Company’s goals and plans, intentions, expectations, assumptions, goals and beliefs regarding the Company’s business. Actual results may differ materially from those\nprojections and estimates due to various risks and uncertainties, both known or unknown. These factors include, but are not limited to: the effects of global and regional economy\nand geo-politics on the Company’s business and operations including the length, duration and impact of the war in Israel, the Houthi’s disruption to the movement of goods in the\nRed Sea and trade disruptions such as Turkey’s decision not to trade with Israel; the outcome of silicosis and other bodily injury claims, and the availability relevant insurance;\nregulatory changes and requirements relating to the manufacturing and fabrication of our products; the outcome of our restructuring efforts, of the closure of the Sdot Yam and\nRichmond Hill Facilities, the estimated closure costs and the estimated potential savings relating to said closures, the ability to sell or sublease all or part of these facilities; our\nability to effectively collaborate with production business partners; our R&D and product introduction efforts, managing constraints in the global supply chain and effectively\nprocuring raw materials and goods as well as fluctuations in their price; our ability to protect our brand, technology and intellectual property, as well as our freedom to operate;\ncompetitive pressures; disruptions to our information technology systems, fluctuations in currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar; our ability to successfully integrate our\nacquisitions; our ability to meet ESG goals and targets; and other risks and uncertainties discussed under the sections \"Risk Factors\" and “Special Note Regarding Forward-\nLooking Statements and Risk Factor Summary” in our most recent annual report on Form 20-F filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on March 6, 2024,\nand in other documents filed by Caesarstone with the SEC, which are available free of charge at www.sec.gov. These forward-looking statements are made only as of the date\nhereof,andtheCompanyundertakesnoobligationtoupdateorrevisetheforward-lookingstatements,whetherasaresultofnewinformation,futureeventsorotherwise.\nThis presentation includes certain non-GAAP measures, which should all be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, comparable GAAP measures. A reconciliation\nof GAAP net income to adjusted EBITDA, reconciliation of GAAP gross profit to adjusted gross profit, and adjusted net income are provided below. To calculate revenues growth\nrates that exclude the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, the Company converts actual reported results from local currency to U.S. dollars using constant\nforeign currency exchange rates in the current and comparable period.
