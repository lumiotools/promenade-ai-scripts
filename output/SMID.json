The Company’s precast, licensing, and barrier rental customers are\nprimarily general contractors and federal, state, and local transportation authorities located in the Mid-Atlantic, Northeastern,\nMidwestern and Southeastern regions of the United States. The Company’s operating strategy has involved producing and\nmarketing innovative and proprietary products, including SlenderWall®, a patented, lightweight, energy efficient concrete\nand steel exterior wall panel for use in building construction; J-J Hooks® Highway Safety Barrier, a patented, positive-\nconnected highway safety barrier; SoftSound™, a proprietary sound absorptive finish used on the face of sound barriers to\nabsorb traffic noise; Sierra Wall™, a patented sound barrier primarily for roadside use; Easi-Set® and Easi-Span® patented\ntransportable concrete buildings; and Beach Prisms™ erosion mitigating modules. In addition, the Company’s precast\nsubsidiaries produce farm products such as cattleguards and water and feed troughs, custom order precast concrete products\nwith various architectural surfaces, and generic highway sound barriers, retaining walls and utility vaults.\nThe Company was incorporated in Delaware on August 2, 1994. Prior to a corporate reorganization completed in October\n1994, the Company conducted its business primarily through Smith-Midland Virginia, which was incorporated in 1960 as\nSmith Cattleguard Company, a Virginia corporation, and which subsequently changed its name to Smith-Midland\nCorporation in 1985. The Company’s principal offices are located at 5119 Catlett Road, Midland, Virginia 22728 and its\ntelephone number is 540-439-3266. As used in this report, unless the context otherwise requires, the term the “Company”\nrefers to Smith-Midland Corporation and its subsidiaries. The Company’s wholly owned subsidiaries consist of Smith-\nMidland Corporation, a Virginia corporation; Smith-Carolina Corporation, a North Carolina corporation; Smith-Columbia\nCorporation, a South Carolina corporation, Easi-Set Industries, Inc., a Virginia corporation doing business as Easi-Set\nWorldwide; Concrete Safety Systems, Inc., a Virginia corporation; and Midland Advertising and Design, Inc., a Virginia\ncorporation doing business as Midland Advertising + Design.\nMarket\nThe Company’s precast concrete products market and barrier rental market primarily consists of general contractors\nperforming public and private construction contracts, including the construction of commercial buildings, public and private\nroads and highways, and airports, municipal utilities, and federal, state, and local transportation authorities, primarily located\nin the Mid-Atlantic, Northeastern, Midwestern and Southeastern states. Due to the lightweight characteristics of the\nSlenderWall® exterior cladding system, the Company has expanded its competitive services outside of the Mid-Atlantic\nstates. The Company’s licensing subsidiary licenses its proprietary products to precast concrete manufacturers nationwide\nand internationally in Canada, Belgium, New Zealand, Australia, Mexico, and Trinidad.\nThe precast concrete products market is affected by the cyclical nature of the construction industry. In addition, the demand\nfor construction varies depending upon weather conditions, the availability of financing at reasonable interest rates, overall\nfluctuations in the national and regional economies, past overbuilding, labor relations in the construction industry, and the\navailability of material and energy supplies. A substantial portion of the Company’s business is derived from local, state, and\nfederal building projects, which are further dependent upon budgets and, in some cases, voter-approved bonds.\nProducts\nThe Company’s precast concrete products are cast in manufacturing facilities and delivered to a site for installation, in\ncontrast to ready-mix concrete, which is produced offsite in a “batch plant,” and delivered with a concrete mixer truck where\nit is mixed and delivered to a construction site to be poured and set at the site. Precast concrete products are used primarily as\nparts of buildings or highway structures, and may be used architecturally, as a decorative wall of a building. Structural uses\ninclude building walls, frames, floors, or roofs. The Company currently manufactures and sells a wide variety of products for\nuse in the construction, transportation, and utility industries.\n3\nSlenderWall® Lightweight Construction Panels\nThe SlenderWall® system is a patented prefabricated, energy-efficient, lightweight exterior cladding system that is offered as\na cost-effective alternative to the traditional cladding used for the exterior walls of buildings. The Company’s SlenderWall®\nsystem combines the essential components of a wall system into a single panel ready for interior drywall mounting upon\ninstallation. The base components of each SlenderWall® panel consists of a galvanized stud frame with an exterior surface of\napproximately two-inch thick, steel reinforced, high-density, precast concrete (with integral water repellent), a thermal break,\nand various architectural surfaces. The exterior architectural concrete facing is attached to the interior steel frame by use of\ncoated stainless steel fasteners that position the exterior concrete away from the steel frame to provide improved thermal\nperformance.\nSlenderWall® panels are approximately one-third the weight of traditional precast concrete walls of equivalent size, and are\nalso significantly improved as to permanence and durability. The lighter weight translates into reduced construction costs\nresulting from less onerous structural and foundation requirements as well as lower shipping costs. Additional savings result\nfrom reduced installation time, ease of erection, and the use of smaller cranes for installation. Closed-cell foam insulation and\nwindows can be plant-installed further reducing cost and construction schedules.\nThe Company custom designs, manufactures, installs, and licenses the SlenderWall® exterior cladding system. The exterior\nof the SlenderWall® system can be produced in a variety of architectural finishes, such as concrete, exposed stone, granite,\nmetal, or thin brick and can be integrated with other cladding materials.\nSierra Wall™\nThe Sierra Wall™ (“Sierra Wall”) combines the strength and durability of precast concrete with a variety of finishes to\nprovide an effective and attractive sound and sight barrier for use alongside highways around residential, industrial, and\ncommercial properties. With additional reinforcement, Sierra Wall can also be used as a retaining wall to retain earth in both\nhighway and residential construction. Sierra Wall is typically constructed of four-inch thick, steel-reinforced concrete panels\nwith an integral column creating a tongue and groove connection system. This tongue and groove connection system and its\nfoundation connection make Sierra Wall easy to install and move if boundaries change or highways are relocated after the\ncompletion of a project. The patented Sierra Wall II one-piece extended post and panel design reduces installation time and\ncost.\nThe Company custom designs and manufactures Sierra Wall components to conform to the specifications provided by the\ncontractor. The width, height, strength, and exterior finish of each wall varies depending upon the terrain and application. The\nCompany also produces generic post and panel design sound barrier wall systems. These systems are constructed of steel or\nprecast concrete columns (the Company manufactures the precast or prestressed columns) with precast concrete panels which\nslide down into the groove in each column.\nSierra Wall is used primarily for highway projects as a noise barrier as well as for residential purposes, such as privacy walls\nbetween homes, security walls or windbreaks, and for industrial or commercial purposes, such as to screen and protect\nshopping centers, industrial operations, institutions or highways. The variety of available finishes enables the Company to\nblend the Sierra Wall with local architecture, creating an attractive, as well as functional, barrier.\nJ-J Hooks® Highway Safety Barrier\nThe J-J Hooks® highway safety barriers (the “J-J Hooks Barriers”) are crash-tested (privately funded), positively connected,\nsafety barriers that the Company sells, rents, delivers, installs, and licenses for use on roadways to separate lanes of traffic (in\nfree-standing, bolted, or pinned installations) in construction work zones or for traffic control. Barriers are deemed to be\npositively connected when the connectors on each end of the barrier sections are interlocked with one another. J-J Hooks\nBarriers interlock without the need for a separate locking device. The primary advantage of a positive connection is that a\nbarrier with such a connection can withstand vehicle crashes at higher speeds without separating. The Federal Highway\nAdministration (“FHWA”) requires that states use only positively connected barriers, which meet NCHRP-350 or MASH\ncrash test requirements. J-J Hooks Barriers that meet NCHRP-350 and MASH TL3 requirements are deemed eligible by the\nFHWA for federal-aid reimbursement. The Company has been issued patents with respect to J-J Hooks in the United States,\nCanada, and other countries.\n4\nThe Company has received “design protection” in the U.S for the “end taper” on each end of the barrier sections. The United\nStates has issued a “trade dress” registration for the “end taper” design feature. Accordingly, in the United States, these\nfeatures cannot be legally copied by others.\nThe proprietary feature of J-J Hooks Barrier is the design of its positive connection. Protruding from each end of a J-J Hooks\nBarrier section is a fabricated bent steel connector; rolled in toward the end of the barrier, resembling the letter “J” when\nviewed from directly above. The connector protruding from each end of the barrier is rolled identically so that when one end\nof a barrier faces the end of another, the resulting “J-Hook” face each other. To connect one section of a J-J Hooks Barrier to\nanother, a contractor simply positions the J-Hook of an elevated section of the barrier above the J-Hook of a set section and\nlowers the elevated section into place. The positive connection is automatically engaged using the cast-in alignment slot.\nThe Company believes that the J-J Hooks Barrier load transfer connection design is superior to other highway safety barriers\nthat were positively connected through the “eye and pin” technique. Barriers incorporating this technique have eyes or loops\nprotruding from each end of the barrier, which must be aligned during the setting process. Once set, a crew inserts pins or\nlong bolts through the eyes which connects and bolts the barrier sections together. Compared to this technique, the J-J Hooks\nBarriers are easier and faster to install and remove, require a smaller crew, and eliminates the need for loose hardware to\nmake the connection.\nIn March 1999, the FHWA approved the free-standing J-J Hooks Barrier (tested in accordance with NCHRP-350 Test Level\n3) following successful crash testing in accordance with National Cooperative Highway Research Program requirements. In\nDecember 2012 the FHWA approved the pinned and bolted J-J Hooks and in March 2018 approved the free-standing J-J\nHooks. In September 2018 the FHWA approved a 20-foot design originally tested to NCHRP-350 TL3 requirements and\napproved by the FHWA (tested in accordance with MASH Test Level 3) for use on federally aided highway projects\nfollowing the successful completion of crash testing based on criteria from the AASHTO Manual for Assessing Safety\nHardware.\nJ-J Hooks NCHRP-350 free-standing barrier has been approved for use on state and federally funded projects by 42 states,\nplus Washington, D.C. The Company is in various stages of the application process in additional states and believes that\napproval in some of the states will be granted; however no assurance can be given that approval will be received from any or\nall of the remaining states or that such approval will result in the J-J Hooks Barrier being used in such states. In addition, J-J\nHooks Barrier has been approved by the appropriate authorities for use in the countries of Canada (Alberta, Nova Scotia,\nNew Brunswick and Ontario), Australia, New Zealand, Spain, Portugal, Belgium, Germany and Chile.\nJ-J Hooks restrained (pinned or bolted) barrier successfully passed the MASH TL3 tests in August of 2012 and received\nFHWA Eligibility Letters in December 2012. Currently 42 states have approved the MASH restrained barrier and 42 states\nhave approved the MASH free-standing design as an alternate to their state standard. New Zealand, Australia, and the\nCanadian provinces of Alberta and Nova Scotia, have approved the MASH tested barrier. The new J-J Hooks free-standing\nbarrier successfully passed the two required MASH TL3 tests and in January 2018 and August 2018 received the FHWA\nfederal-aid eligibility letters. The FHWA Eligibility letters B300 and B307 have been issued as of February 2018 and\nSeptember 2018, respectively.\nEasi-Set Precast Buildings and Easi-Span® Expandable Precast Buildings\nEasi-Set Precast Buildings are transportable, prefabricated, single-story, all concrete buildings designed to be adaptable to a\nvariety of uses ranging from housing communications operations, traffic control systems, mechanical and electrical stations,\nto inventory or supply storage, restroom facilities or kiosks. Easi-Set Precast Buildings and Restrooms are available in a\nvariety of exterior finishes and in 38 standard sizes, or can be custom sized. The roof and floor of each Easi-Set Building is\nmanufactured using the Company’s second generation post-tensioned system, which helps seal the buildings against\nmoisture. As freestanding units, the Easi-Set Buildings require no poured foundations or footings and can be easily installed\nwithin a few hours. After installation the buildings can be moved, if desired, and reinstalled in a new location. The Company\nhas been issued patents in connection with this product in the United States and Canada.\nThe Company also offers Easi-Span® a line of expandable precast concrete buildings. Easi-Span® incorporates the\ntechnology of the Easi-Set Buildings, but are available in larger sizes and, through its modular construction, can be combined\nin varied configurations to permit expansion capabilities. Since these larger buildings have less competition from other\nmaterials and methods, they produce higher profit margins. Both the Easi-Span and Easi-Set Buildings offer lines of fully-\noutfitted restrooms with over a dozen standard models.\n5\nEasi-Set Utility Vault\nThe Company produces a line of precast concrete underground utility vaults ranging in size from 27 to 1,008 cubic feet. Each\nEasi-Set utility vault normally comes with a manhole opening on the top for ingress and egress and openings around the\nperimeter, in accordance with the customer’s specifications, to access water and gas pipes, electrical power lines,\ntelecommunications cables, or other such media of transfer. The utility vaults may be used to house equipment such as cable,\ntelephone or traffic signal equipment, and for underground storage. The Company also manufactures custom-built utility\nvaults for special needs.\nSoftSound™ Soundwall Panels\nSoftSound™ soundwall panels utilize a “wood chip aggregate” material applied to the face of soundwall panels, which is\nused to absorb highway noise. SoftSound™ is a proprietary product developed and tested by the Company and is currently\napproved for use in Virginia, Maryland, seven additional states, and the provinces of Ontario and Quebec, Canada. Approvals\nare still pending in a number of additional states. The Company introduced this product line into its licensing program and is\nin the process of seeking to obtain approvals in all 50 states and the Canadian Provinces.\nBeach Prisms™ Erosion Control Modules\nBeach Prisms™ is a shoreline erosion control product that uses the preferred natural “soft” approach as opposed to the “hard”\napproach of seawalls and jetties, to solve this worldwide problem. Beach Prisms™ work by reducing the amount of energy in\nincoming waves before the waves reach the shoreline. Waves pass through the specially designed slots in the triangular 3-4\nfoot tall by 10 foot long Beach Prisms™ modules. The success of a Beach Prisms™ installation is dependent on the\nprevailing wind in relation to the shoreline, the tides, the fetch and the availability of sand in the surf. Beach Prisms™ are\nprimarily for river- and bay-front property owners who want an alternative to traditional armor stone, or groins and\njetties. The Company received “design protection” in the United States for the Beach Prisms™ in 2010. State and local\napprovals are necessary for installation of the product, and the Company has experienced challenges receiving approvals in\ntheir local markets.\nH2Out™ Secondary Drainage System\nH2Out™ is the first “in the caulk joint” secondary drainage and street level leak detection product for panelized exterior\ncladding. A second line of caulking and drainage strip located behind the exterior line of caulking exits all water leakage to\nthe exterior of the building preventing moisture and mold, and hence deterring lawsuits from tenants and owners of\nbuildings. H2Out™ has been added as a feature of the SlenderWall® system and is being included in the product literature,\nwebsite, and all sales presentations.\nAlthough the Company is optimistic about the success of Beach Prisms™ and H2Out™, there can be no assurance of the\ncommercial acceptance of these products and, in the case of Beach Prisms™, there can be no assurance of regulatory\napprovals.\nSources of Supply\nAll of the raw materials necessary for the manufacture of the Company’s products are available from multiple sources. To\ndate, the Company has experienced minor delays in obtaining materials, but believes that it will be able to obtain required\nmaterials from a number of suppliers at commercially reasonable prices.\nLicensing\nThe Company presently grants licenses through its wholly-owned subsidiary Easi-Set Industries for the manufacturing and\nsale rights for certain proprietary products, such as the J-J Hooks® Barrier, Easi-Set®/Easi-Span® Precast Buildings,\nSlenderWall®, SoftSound™ and Beach Prisms™. Generally, licenses are granted for a point of manufacture. The Company\nreceives an initial one-time training and administration license fee varying on the product licensed. License royalties vary\ndepending upon the product licensed, and typically range from 4% to 6% of the net sales of the licensed product. In addition,\nEasi-Set®/Easi-Span® Buildings and SlenderWall® licensees pay the Company a monthly fee for co-op advertising &\npromotional programs. The Company produces and distributes advertising & promotional materials and promotes the\nlicensed products through its own advertising subsidiary, Midland Advertising + Design.\nThe Company maintains 56 licensing agreements in the United States, 8 in Canada, 2 in New Zealand, and 1 each in\nAustralia, Belgium, Mexico, and Trinidad, for a total of 70 licenses worldwide.\nThe Company is continually discussing new license arrangements with potential precast companies and, although no\nassurance can be given, expects to increase its licensing activities.\n6\nMarketing and Sales\nThe Company uses an in-house sales force and, to a lesser extent, independent sales representatives to market its precast\nconcrete products through trade show attendance, sales presentations, virtual meetings, advertisements in trade publications,\nand direct mail to end users.\nThe Company has also established a cooperative advertising program in which the Company and its Easi-Set®/Easi-Span®\nBuildings and SlenderWall® licensees combine resources to promote certain precast concrete products. Licensees pay a\nmonthly fee and the Company pays any additional amounts required to advertise the products across the country. Although\nthe Company advertises nationally, the Company’s precast subsidiaries marketing efforts are concentrated within a 450 mile\nradius from its facilities, which includes the majority of the eastern United States.\nThe Company’s precast product sales and barrier rental sales result primarily from the submission of estimates or proposals\nto general contractors who then include the estimates in their overall bids to various government agencies and other end users\nthat solicit construction contracts through a competitive bidding process. In general, these contractors solicit and obtain their\nconstruction contracts by submitting the most attractive bid to the party desiring the construction. The Company’s role in the\nbidding process is to provide estimates to the contractors desiring to include the Company’s products or services in the\ncontractor’s bid. If a contractor who accepts the Company’s bid is selected to perform the construction, the Company\nprovides the agreed upon products or services. In many instances, the Company provides estimates to more than one of the\ncontractors bidding on a single project. The Company also occasionally negotiates with and sells directly to end-users.\nCompetition\nThe precast concrete industry is highly competitive and consists of a few large companies and many small to mid-size\ncompanies, several of which have substantially greater financial and other resources than the Company. Nationally, several\nlarge companies dominate the precast concrete market. However, due to the weight and costs of delivery of precast concrete\nproducts, competition in the industry tends to be limited by geographical location and distance from the construction site and\nis fragmented with numerous manufacturers in a large local area.\nThe Company believes that the principal competitive factors for its precast products are price, durability, ease of use and\ninstallation, speed of production and delivery time, ability to customize, FHWA and state approval, and customer\nservice. The Company believes that its plants in Midland, Virginia, Reidsville, North Carolina and Hopkins (Columbia),\nSouth Carolina compete favorably with respect to each of these factors in the Mid-Atlantic and Southeastern regions of the\nUnited States. Finally, the Company believes it offers a broad range of products that are highly competitive in these markets.\nIntellectual Property\nThe Company seeks to protect our intellectual property rights by relying on federal, state and common law rights in the\nUnited States and other countries, as well as contractual restrictions. Our intellectual property assets include patents, patent\napplications, trade secrets, trademarks, trade dress, copyrights, operating and instruction manuals, crash tests, non-disclosure\nand other contractual arrangements.\nWhile the Company intends to vigorously enforce its patent rights against infringement by third parties, no assurance can be\ngiven that the patents or the Company’s patent rights will be enforceable or provide the Company with meaningful protection\nfrom competitors or that its patent applications will be allowed. Even if a competitor’s products were to infringe patents held\nby the Company, enforcing the patent rights in an enforcement action could be very costly, and assuming the Company has\nsufficient resources, would divert funds and resources that otherwise could be used in the Company’s operations. No\nassurance can be given that the Company would be successful in enforcing such rights, that the Company’s products or\nprocesses do not infringe the patent or intellectual property rights of a third party, or that if the Company is not successful in\na suit involving patents or other intellectual property rights of a third party, that a license for such technology would be\navailable on commercially reasonable terms, if at all.\n7\nGovernment Regulation\nThe Company frequently supplies products and services pursuant to agreements with general contractors who have entered\ninto contracts with federal or state governmental agencies. The successful completion of the Company’s obligations under\nsuch contracts is often subject to the satisfactory inspection or approval of such products and services by a representative of\nthe contracting agency. Although the Company targets to satisfy the requirements of each such contract to which it is a party,\nno assurance can be given that the necessary approval of its products and services will be granted on a timely basis or at all\nand that the Company will receive any payments due to it. Any failure to obtain such approval and payment may have a\nmaterial adverse effect on the Company’s business.\nThe Company’s operations are subject to extensive and stringent governmental regulations including regulations related to\nthe Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA) and environmental protection. The Company believes that it is substantially\nin compliance with all applicable regulations. The cost of maintaining such compliance is not considered by the Company to\nbe significant.\nThe Company’s employees in its manufacturing division operate complicated machinery that may cause substantial injury or\ndeath upon malfunction or improper operation. The Company’s manufacturing facilities are subject to the workplace safety\nrules and regulations of OSHA. The Company believes that it is in compliance with the requirements of OSHA.\nDuring the normal course of its operations, the Company uses and disposes of materials, such as solvents and lubricants used\nin equipment maintenance, that are classified as hazardous by government agencies that regulate environmental quality. The\nCompany attempts to minimize the generation of such waste as much as possible, and to recycle such waste where\npossible. Remaining wastes are disposed of in permitted disposal sites in accordance with applicable regulations.\nIn the event that the Company is unable to comply with the OSHA or environmental requirements, the Company could be\nsubject to substantial sanctions, including restrictions on its business operations, monetary liability and criminal sanctions,\nany of which could have a material adverse effect upon the Company’s business.\nHuman Capital Resources\nAs of March 13, 2023, the Company had a total of 232 employees, of which 178 are full-time, 11 are part-time, and 43 are\ntemporary workers, with 162 located at the Company’s Midland, Virginia facility, 39 are located at the Company’s facility in\nReidsville, North Carolina and 31 are located at the Company’s facility in Hopkins (Columbia), South Carolina. None of the\nCompany’s employees are represented by labor organizations and the Company is not aware of any activities seeking such\norganization. Employees are competitively compensated with the local job markets at each facility. The Company considers\nits relationships with its employees to be satisfactory.\nWe manage our Company according to our vision, mission, and core principles. Included among these principles are respect\nfor people, lead with humility, kaizen spirit, focus on process, seek perfection, assure quality at the source, create consistency\nof purpose, embrace scientific thinking, think systemically, and create value for the customer. We continue to focus on\ntraining and development of our associates at every level in the organization, and pride ourselves on safety, quality, delivery,\nmorale, and cost. We expect that these approaches to leading and empowering our associates will create trust with our\ncustomers, creating sustainability and growth of the business.\nThe Company is committed to creating and maintaining a safe work-environment for all employees, customers, contractors,\nvendors, and the community. Through shared experiences and resources across all three facilities, the Company has\ncultivated a safety-first culture for all stakeholders.\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\nNot applicable.\nItem 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments\nNot applicable.\n8\nItem 2. Properties\nFacilities\nThe Company operates three manufacturing facilities. The largest manufacturing operations facility is a 44,000 square foot\nmanufacturing plant located on approximately 58 acres of land in Midland, Virginia, which the Company owns. The\nmanufacturing facility houses two concrete mixers and one concrete blender. The plant also includes two environmentally\ncontrolled casting areas, three batch plants, a form fabrication shop, a welding and metal fabrication facility, a carpentry\nshop, a quality control center and a covered steel reinforcing fabrication area of approximately 8,000 square feet. The\nCompany’s Midland facility also includes a large storage yard for inventory and stored materials.\nThe Company owns an additional 19 acres in Midland, Virginia, approximately two miles from the operations facility, of\nwhich 3 acres is developed as a storage yard for the rental barrier division. The Company is currently developing additional\nacreage at this lot for additional storage for the rental barrier division and it is expected to be completed in 2023.\nThe Company’s second manufacturing facility is located in Reidsville, North Carolina on 46 acres of owned land and\nincludes a 15,000 square foot manufacturing plant and administrative offices with additional space for future expansion. The\nfacility began production in the fourth quarter 2021. The previous North Carolina facility, on 10 acres of owned land,\nincluding an 8,000 square foot manufacturing plant with administrative offices, remains operational with future use not\ndetermined at this time.\nThe Company’s third manufacturing facility is located in Hopkins (Columbia), South Carolina. The facility is located on 39\nacres of land owned by the Company and has approximately 40,000 square feet of production space and administrative\noffices. The South Carolina facility gives the Company sufficient capacity to cover additional territory from the Atlantic\nCoast region to the northern part of Florida.\nThe Company’s present facilities are adequate for its current needs.\nItem 3. Legal Proceedings\nThe Company is not presently involved in any litigation of a material nature.\nItem 4. Mine Safety Disclosures\nNot applicable.\nPART II\nItem 5. Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity\nSecurities.\nThe Company’s Common Stock trades on the NASDAQ Capital Market under the symbol “SMID”.\nAs of March 13, 2023, there were approximately 40 record holders of the Company’s Common Stock. Management believes\nthere are at least 1,000 beneficial owners of the Company’s Common Stock.\nDividends\nAlthough the Company has historically paid special dividends, the Company did not declare a dividend in 2022. The\nCompany cannot guarantee payment of dividends due to the internal need for funds in the development and expansion of its\nbusiness. The declaration of dividends in the future will be at the election of the Board of Directors and will depend upon\nearnings, capital requirements and financial position of the Company, bank loan covenants, general economic conditions,\npotential coronavirus outbreak concerns, and other pertinent factors.\nItem 6. Reserved\n9\nItem 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company\n(including the Notes thereto) included elsewhere in this report. Dollar amounts are in thousands, except for per share\namounts.\nThe Company generates revenues primarily from the sale, leasing, licensing, shipping and installation of precast concrete\nproducts and systems for the construction, utility and farming industries. The Company’s operating strategy has involved\nproducing and marketing innovative and proprietary products, including SlenderWall™, a patent pending, lightweight,\nenergy efficient concrete and steel exterior wall panel for use in building construction; J-J Hooks® Barrier, a patented\npositive-connected highway safety barrier; Sierra Wall™, a patented sound barrier primarily for roadside use; transportable\nconcrete buildings; and SoftSound™, a highway sound attenuation system. In addition, the Company produces utility vaults;\nfarm products such as cattleguards; and custom order precast concrete products with various architectural surfaces.\nAs a part of the construction industry, the Company’s sales and net income may vary greatly from quarter to quarter over a\ngiven year. Because of the cyclical nature of the construction industry, many factors outside of the Company’s control, such\nas weather and project delays, affect the Company’s production schedule, possibly causing a momentary slowdown in sales\nand net income. As a result of these factors, the Company is not always able to earn a profit for each period, therefore, please\nread Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and the accompanying\nfinancial statements with these factors in mind.\nOn January 30, 2020, the World Health Organization (“WHO”) announced a global health emergency because of a new strain\nof coronavirus originating in Wuhan, China (the “COVID-19 outbreak”) and the risks to the international community as the\nvirus spread globally beyond its point of origin. In March 2020, the WHO classified the COVID-19 outbreak as a pandemic,\nbased on the rapid increase in exposure globally.\nThe full impact of the COVID-19 outbreak continues to evolve as of the date of this report. As such, it is uncertain as to the\nfull magnitude that the pandemic will have on the Company’s financial condition, liquidity, and future results of operations.\nThe Company had previously experienced an adverse impact to its business by a reduction in revenues in 2020 from that of\n2019, a reduction in backlog during 2020 from that in 2019, lower production volumes, employee absences during 2020 and\n2021, and bidding restrictions within certain key states such as Maryland and North Carolina. The Company is currently\nexperiencing minor delays in receipt of materials through its supply chain. The Company may be further negatively impacted\nin the following respects:\na) by the potential inability of customers of the Company to pay amounts owed to the Company for products\nor services already provided should their businesses suffer setbacks; this risk is heightened by the relatively long lag time\nexperienced by the Company in collecting accounts receivable (see “Liquidity and Capital Resources” below);\nb) by potential supply side issues should our vendors experience hardships, and have to reduce or terminate\noperations, due to the COVID-19 outbreak, impacting the Company’s sourcing of materials;\nc) by increased adverse effects on our workforce due to contracting or taking care of a relative who has\ncontracted COVID-19, or have been quarantined by a medical professional; in this respect, our workforce had been impacted\nat all locations in prior years, but this impact has substantially diminished in the current reporting year, but no assurance can\nbe provided as to future impacts, particularly in view of potential new coronavirus outbreaks;\nd) in the event that any of the three states in which we have facilities provide for the quarantine of our\nmanufacturing employees, our production manufacturing will be significantly affected;\ne) in the event that any of the states in which we sell our products and services may eliminate, cancel, or\ndelay projects due to monetary limitations resulting from the COVID-19 outbreak; in this respect, the Company had\npreviously seen a reduction in bidding activity;\nf) the reduction of state infrastructure budgets due to the reduction in funding through the gas tax, or other\nfunding sources;\ng) the increase in the overall loan defaults, which in turn impacts the banking sector’s ability to fund projects\nin which the Company’s products may be utilized; and\nh) in the event that economic hardships force the Company to default on loan payments, our loans may be\ncalled and our ability to borrow under our bank line of credit could cease;\n10\nManagement is actively monitoring the global situation on its financial condition, liquidity, operations, suppliers, industry,\nand workforce. Although the Company experienced a loss in the first quarter of 2020 and reduced revenues for the year 2020\nas compared to 2019, as well as experiencing factors described above, given the daily evolution of the COVID-19 outbreak\nand the global responses to curb its spread, the Company is not able to ultimately estimate the effects of the COVID-19\noutbreak on its results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity for future years.\nThe discussions below, including without limitation with respect to liquidity, are subject to the future effects of the COVID-\n19 outbreak. In this respect, should the outbreak cause serious economic harm in our areas of operation, our revenue\nexpectations are unlikely to be fulfilled.\nOverview\nOverall, the Company’s financial bottom line performance was lower in 2022 when compared to 2021. The Company had net\nincome for 2022 of $800 compared to net income of $7,570 for 2021. Sales decreased by $511 to $50,131 in 2022 from\n$50,642 in 2021. The decrease in sales is mainly from a decrease in barrier rentals and, to a lesser extent, a decrease in\nsoundwall sales. The decrease in barrier rentals is attributed to a decrease in barrier rentals from short-term special barrier\nrental projects. Despite the decrease in total barrier rentals, barrier rental revenue from the core rental fleet increased 11% for\nthe year ended December 31, 2022 from the year ended December 31, 2021. The decrease in soundwall sales was due to\ndelays in approvals of customer drawings and therefore delays in production. Royalty income and shipping and installation\nrevenue also increased in 2022 as compared to 2021. The increase in cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenue, not\nincluding royalties, for 2022 compared to 2021 is due to increased material and labor costs. Additionally, there were more\nshort-term special barrier rental projects that occurred throughout 2021 than 2022, which carry higher margins than product\nsales. Operating expenses for 2022 increased over 2021 mainly due to increased selling costs associated with additional sales\npersonnel and an increase in bad debt expense. Fourth quarter 2022 revenues were $14,487 compared to $10,017 in the fourth\nquarter 2021. The increase in revenue for the fourth quarter 2022 as compared to the fourth quarter 2021 was primarily due to\nan increase in barrier sales and an increase in shipping and installation. As of March 13, 2023, the Company’s sales backlog\nwas approximately $52.4 million, as compared to approximately $29.0 million around the same time in the prior year. The\nCompany anticipates greater sales volumes throughout 2023, although no assurance can be provided. The Company\ncontinues to increase marketing and sales efforts towards SlenderWall sales and barrier rentals, in line with long-term\nstrategic objectives.\nResults of Operations\nYear ended December 31, 2022 compared to the year ended December 31, 2021\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company had total revenue of $50,131 compared to total revenue of $50,642 for\nthe year ended December 31, 2021, a decrease of $511 or 1%. Revenue includes product sales, barrier rentals, royalty\nincome, and shipping and installation revenues. Product sales are further divided into soundwall, architectural and\nSlenderWall™ panels, miscellaneous wall panels, highway barriers, Easi-Set®/Easi-Span® buildings, utility products, and\nmiscellaneous precast products. The following table summarizes the revenue by type and a comparison for the years ended\nDecember 31, 2022 and 2021 (in thousands):\nRevenue by Type (Disaggregated Revenue) 2022 2021 Change % Change\nProduct Sales:\nSoundwall Sales ............................................................................. $ 4,128 $ 8,025 $ (3,897) (49)%\nArchitectural Sales ......................................................................... 4,269 4,932 (663) (13)%\nSlenderWall Sales .......................................................................... 1,489 1,795 (306) (17)%\nMiscellaneous Wall Sales .............................................................. 3,475 2,352 1,123 48%\nBarrier Sales .................................................................................. 6,717 4,686 2,031 43%\nEasi-Set and Easi-Span Building Sales .......................................... 4,089 3,036 1,053 35%\nUtility Sales ................................................................................... 2,023 2,468 (445) (18)%\nMiscellaneous Sales ....................................................................... 1,631 1,206 425 35%\nTotal Product Sales ..................................................................... 27,821 28,500 (679) (2)%\nBarrier Rentals .............................................................................. 6,545 9,925 (3,380) (34)%\nRoyalty Income .............................................................................. 2,498 2,216 282 13%\nShipping and Installation Revenue ................................................ 13,267 10,001 3,266 33%\nTotal Service Revenue ................................................................. 22,310 22,142 168 1%\nTotal Revenue............................................................................... $ 50,131 $ 50,642 $ (511) (1)%\n11\nThe revenue items: soundwall sales, architectural panel sales, SlenderWall sales, miscellaneous wall sales, miscellaneous\nsales, barrier rentals, and royalty income are recognized as revenue over time. The revenue items: barrier sales, Easi-Set and\nEasi-Span building sales, utility sales, and shipping and installation revenue are recognized as revenue at a point in time.\nSoundwall Sales – Soundwall panel sales decreased by 49% in 2022 compared to 2021 primarily due to decreased production\nduring 2022 at all facilities. Production for several projects concluded towards the end of 2021 at all facilities. Additionally,\nthe Company experienced delays in customer drawing approvals throughout 2022 causing delays in production. The\nCompany expects soundwall panel sales to be similar in 2023 as compared to 2022, although no assurance can be provided.\nArchitectural Sales – Architectural panel sales decreased by 13% in 2022 compared to 2021. The Company was awarded a\nlarge architectural project, which began production in the fourth quarter of 2020 and the majority of production occurred in\n2021. Architectural sales are expected to decrease during 2023, as compared to 2022, with an anticipated shift to more\nSlenderWall sales, although no assurance can be provided.\nSlenderWall Sales – SlenderWall panel sales decreased by 17% in 2022 compared to 2021. The decrease is mainly\nattributable to one large project, which started production in the second quarter of 2021 and concluded in the second quarter\nof 2022. Currently, the Company has the largest quantity of bids out for the SlenderWall product in history and expects to be\nawarded multiple projects in the near future. The Company continues to focus sales initiatives on SlenderWall, but no\nassurance can be given as to the success of this endeavor.\nMiscellaneous Wall Sales – Miscellaneous wall sales can be highly customized precast concrete products or retaining and\nlagging panels that do not fit other product categories. Miscellaneous wall sales increased by 48% in 2022 when compared to\n2021 due to the increased amount of retaining wall projects in production. Miscellaneous sales are expected to trend similar\nin 2023, as compared to 2022, although no assurance can be provided.\nBarrier Sales – Barrier sales increased by 43% in 2022 when compared to 2021. The main reason for the increase is due to\nlarge barrier projects in North Carolina and South Carolina. The Company continues to focus on shifting barrier sales to\nbarrier rentals in the Delaware to Virginia region. Barrier sales are expected to trend lower in 2023 than previous years as the\nCompany continues to shift from barrier sales to barrier rentals.\nEasi-Set® and Easi-Span® Building Sales – The Easi-Set® Buildings program includes Easi-Set®, plant assembled and\nEasi-Span®, site assembled, and an extensive line of pre-engineered restrooms. Building sales increased by 35% in 2022 as\ncompared to 2021 due to increased sales at all locations. Building and restroom sales are expected to continue to trend similar\nduring 2023 as compared to 2022, although no assurance can be provided.\nUtility Sales – Utility products are mainly comprised of underground utility vaults used in infrastructure construction. Utility\nproduct sales decreased by 18% in 2022 compared to 2021. The Company continues to competitively bid on utility projects\nto gain market share and has recently won multiple data center projects increasing the sales volume of dry utility vaults.\nUtility sales are expected to trend similar during 2023 as compared to 2022, although no assurance can be provided.\nMiscellaneous Product Sales – Miscellaneous products are products that are produced or sold that do not meet the criteria\ndefined for other revenue categories. Examples would include precast concrete slabs, blocks or small add-on items. For 2022,\nmiscellaneous product sales increased by 35% when compared to 2021. The change is mainly attributed to specialty products\nproduced at the South Carolina plant throughout 2022. Miscellaneous product sales are expected to trend lower during 2023\nas compared to 2022, although no assurance can be provided.\nBarrier Rentals – Barrier rentals decreased by 34% in 2022 as compared to 2021. While both 2022 and 2021 barrier rentals\nincluded short-term special projects, 2022 had less rental revenue from short-term special barrier projects. As indicated\nabove, the Company is continuing to shift its focus to barrier rentals compared to barrier sales with the significant increase in\nthe rental fleet that occurred during 2022. Barrier rental revenue, excluding revenue from special barrier projects, is expected\nto trend higher in 2023 as compared to barrier rental revenue, excluding revenue from special barrier projects, in 2022,\nalthough no assurance can be given.\nRoyalty Income – Royalties increased by 13% in 2022 as compared to 2021. The increase in royalties is mainly due to the\nincrease in barrier royalties during 2022 compared to 2021. Infrastructure spending continues to drive royalties, and the\nCompany anticipates 2023 royalties to increase compared to 2022, although no assurance can be given.\n12\nShipping and Installation – Shipping revenue results from shipping our products to the customers’ final destination and is\nrecognized when the shipping services take place. Installation activities include installation of our products at the customers’\nconstruction site. Installation revenue results when attaching architectural wall panels to a building, installing an Easi-Set®\nbuilding at a customers’ site, setting highway barrier, or setting any of our other precast products at a site specific to the\nrequirements of the owner. Shipping and installation revenues increased by 33% for 2022 when compared to 2021. The\nincrease is mainly attributed to the increase in shipping and installation of SlenderWall and architectural panels. This is\nassociated with the increased production of SlenderWall and architectural panels that occurred in the third and fourth quarters\nof 2021.\nCost of Goods Sold – Total cost of goods sold for the year ended December 31, 2022 was $40,662, an increase of $4,440, or\n12%, from $36,222 for the year ended December 31, 2021. Total cost of goods sold as a percentage of total revenue, not\nincluding royalties, increased to 85% for the year ended December 31, 2022 from 75% for the year ended December 31,\n2021. The increase in cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenue, not including royalties, is mainly due to the decrease in\nshort-term special barrier rental projects, which carry higher margins than standard barrier rental projects due to the\ncomplexity and risk of the projects. Further, cost of goods sold for the year ended December 31, 2022 increased, as compared\nto the same period in 2021, due to inflationary impacts on material and labor costs.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses – For the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company’s general and administrative\nexpenses increased by $135, or 2%, to $5,551 from $5,416 during the same period in 2021. The increase is mainly attributed\nto an increase in bad debt expense driven by the increase in accounts receivable. The increase was partially offset by a\ndecrease in salaries and wages. General and administrative expense as a percentage of total revenue was 11% for the years\nended December 31, 2022 and 2021.\nSelling Expenses – Selling expenses for the year ended December 31, 2022 increased by $228, or 8%, to $3,064 from $2,836\nfor the year ended December 31, 2021. Selling expenses increased during 2022 due to additional salespersons hired and\nincreased advertising expenses. The Company expects selling expenses to increase in future periods with the plan for\nadditional sales associates and increased advertising spending aligning with the strategy to increase SlenderWall sales and\nbarrier rentals.\nOperating Income – The Company had operating income for the year ended December 31, 2022 of $854 compared to\noperating income of $6,168 for the year ended December 31, 2021, a decrease of $5,314, or 86%. The decrease in operating\nincome was mainly due to the decrease in gross profit associated with the decrease in total revenue deriving from barrier\nrentals. Operating results for 2022 were also adversely impacted by rising costs of material and labor due to inflation.\nInterest Expense – Interest expense was $260 for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to $190 for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2021. The increase of $70, or 37%, was due primarily to the increased level of indebtedness from the financing\nthat occurred in the first quarter of 2022 for the real property acquired in the fourth quarter 2021.\nIncome Tax Expense – The Company had income tax expense of $145 for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to\nincome tax expense of $1,524 for the year ended December 31, 2021. The Company had an effective rate of 15.4% for the\nyear ended December 31, 2022 compared to an effective rate of 16.8% for the same period in 2021. The decrease in the\neffective tax rate is attributed to current year tax credits and a decrease in the Company’s state tax liability.\nNet Income – The Company had net income of $800 for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to net income of\n$7,570 for the same period in 2021. Net income in 2021 included a gain of $2,692 for forgiveness of a Paycheck Protection\nProgram loan. The basic and diluted earnings per share was $0.15 for 2022 compared to basic and diluted earnings per share\nof $1.45 for the year ended December 31, 2021. There were 5,233 basic and 5,253 diluted weighted average shares\noutstanding in 2022, and 5,205 basic and 5,232 diluted weighted average shares outstanding in 2021.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe Company financed its capital expenditures requirements for 2022 with cash balances on hand and notes payable to a\nbank. The Company had $6,416 of debt obligations at December 31, 2022, of which $626 is scheduled to mature within\ntwelve months. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, the Company made repayments of outstanding debt in\nthe amount $581 and received $2,805 in proceeds of borrowings related to the financing that occurred in the first quarter of\n2022 for the real property acquired during the fourth quarter of 2021.\n13\nThe Company has a mortgage note payable to Summit Community Bank (the “Bank”) for the construction of its North\nCarolina facility. The note carries a ten year term at a fixed interest rate of 3.64% annually per the Promissory Note Rate\nConversion Agreement, with monthly payments of $22, and is secured by all of the assets of Smith-Carolina and a guarantee\nby the Company. The balance of the note payable at December 31, 2022 was $1,609.\nOn March 27, 2020, the Company completed the refinancing of existing loans with a note payable to the Bank in the amount\nof $2,701. A portion of the funds in the amount of $678 were secured for improvements to an existing five acre parcel for\nadditional storage at the Midland, Virginia plant. The loan is collateralized by a first lien position on the Virginia property,\nbuilding, and assets. The refinance also released the lien on the Smith-Columbia plant in Hopkins, South Carolina\n(Columbia). The interest rate per the Promissory Note is fixed at 3.99% per annum, with principal and interest payments\npayable monthly over 120 months in the amount of $27. The loan matures on March 27, 2030. The balance of the note\npayable at December 31, 2022 was $2,064.\nOn February 10, 2022, the Company completed the financing for its prior acquisition of certain real property in\nMidland, VA totaling approximately 29.8 acres with a note payable to the Bank in the amount of $2,805. The loan is\ncollateralized by a first lien position on the related real property. The interest rate is fixed at 4.09% per annum, with principal\nand interest payments payable monthly over 180 months for $21. The loan matures on February 10, 2037. The balance of the\nnote payable on December 31, 2022 was $2,692.\nThe Company additionally has two smaller installment loans with annual interest rates of 2.90% and 3.99%, maturing in\n2025, with balances totaling $51.\nUnder the loan covenants with the Bank, the Company is limited to annual capital expenditures of $5,000 and must maintain\ntangible net worth of $10,000. The Company received a special exception to the capital expenditure covenant from the Bank\nto purchase barrier during 2022 for $5,000 (see Note 7, Commitments and Contingencies, of the Financial Statements). The\nCompany is in compliance with all covenants pursuant to the loan agreements as of December 31, 2022.\nIn addition to the notes payable discussed above, the Company has a $5,000 line of credit with the Bank with no balance\noutstanding as of December 31, 2022. The line of credit is evidenced by a commercial revolving promissory note, which\ncarries a variable interest rate of prime, with a floor of 3.50%, and matures on October 1, 2023. The loan is collateralized by a\nfirst lien position on the Company’s accounts receivable and inventory and a second lien position on all other business assets.\nKey provisions of the line of credit require the Company (i) to obtain bank approval for capital expenditures in excess of\n$5,000 during the term of the loan and (ii) to obtain bank approval prior to its funding of any acquisition. On October 1,\n2022, the Company received a Commitment Letter from the Bank to provide a guidance line of credit specifically to purchase\nbusiness equipment in an amount up to $1,500. The commitment provides for the purchase of equipment for which a note\npayable will be executed with a term not to exceed five years with an interest rate at the Wall Street Journal prime rate plus\n0.50% with a floor of 3.50% per annum. The loan is collateralized by a first lien position on all equipment purchased under\nthe line. The commitment for the guidance line of credit matures on October 1, 2023. As of December 31, 2022, the\nCompany had not purchased any equipment pursuant to the $1,500 commitment.\nAt December 31, 2022, the Company had cash totaling $6,726 compared to cash totaling $13,492 at December 31, 2021. The\ndecrease in cash is primarily the result of higher accounts receivable at December 31, 2022 than at December 31, 2021 and\nfrom investing activities which used $2,631 in cash primarily for the purchase of rental barrier, manufacturing equipment,\nand a vehicle. Financing activities provided $2,199 in cash in 2022 mainly from the financing of real property purchased in\nthe fourth quarter of 2021.\nCapital spending, including financed additions, decreased from $5,367 in 2021 to $5,264 in 2022. Capital expenditures in\n2022 were primarily related to spending for the buy-back of barrier for the barrier rental fleet. The Company anticipates\ncapital spending for 2023 to be approximately $5,000, which includes a new batch plant system, completion of yard\ndevelopment, completion of the barrier buy-back, and miscellaneous manufacturing equipment. Anticipated capital\nexpenditures excludes acquisitions and plant expansions.\nThe Company’s notes payable are financed at fixed rates of interest. This leaves the Company almost impervious to\nfluctuating interest rates. Increases in such rates will only affect the interest paid by the Company if new debt is obtained, or\nthe available line of credit is drawn upon, with a variable interest rate.\n14\nThe Company’s cash flow from operations is affected by production schedules set by contractors, which generally provide\nfor payment 45 to 75 days after the products are produced and with some contracts, retainage may be held until the entire\nproject is completed. This payment schedule could result in liquidity problems for the Company because it must bear the cost\nof production for its products before it receives payment. The Company’s days sales outstanding (DSO) in 2022 and 2021\nwere 99 and 91 days, respectively. Although no assurances can be given, the Company believes that its current cash\nresources, anticipated cash flow from operations, and the availability under the line of credit will be sufficient to finance the\nCompany’s operations for at least the next 12 months.\nThe Company’s accounts receivable balances, net of allowance for doubtful accounts, at December 31, 2022 was $16,223,\ncompared to $10,013 at December 31, 202. The increase is primarily the result of turnover of the accounts receivable position\nthroughout the later part of 2022 until the first quarter of 2023. The Company expects accounts receivable balances to trend\ndownwards, beginning in the second quarter of 2023, with increased collection efforts as a result of the fulfillment of the\naccounts receivable position, although no assurance can be provided.\nThe Company’s inventory at December 31, 2022 was $3,818 and at December 31, 2021 was $2,845, an increase of $974. The\nannual inventory turns for 2022 and 2021 were 14.1 and 15.4, respectively. Finished goods inventory slightly increased for\n2022 as compared to 2021.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe Company’s significant accounting policies are more fully described in its Summary of Accounting Policies to the\nCompany’s consolidated financial statements. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting\nprinciples generally accepted within the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions\nin certain circumstances that affect amounts reported in the accompanying financial statements and related notes. In preparing\nthese consolidated financial statements, management has made its best estimates and judgments of certain amounts included\nin the consolidated financial statements, giving due consideration to materiality. The Company does not believe there is a\ngreat likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported related to the accounting policies described below,\nhowever, application of these accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment and the use of assumptions as to future\nuncertainties and as a result, actual results could differ from these estimates.\nThe Company evaluates the adequacy of its allowance for doubtful accounts at the end of each quarter. In performing this\nevaluation, the Company analyzes the payment history of its significant past due accounts, subsequent cash collections on\nthese accounts, comparative accounts receivable aging statistics, and other customer specific considerations existing and\nknown as of the time of the analysis. Based on this information, along with other related factors, the Company develops what\nit considers to be a reasonable estimate of the uncollectible amounts included in accounts receivable. This estimate involves\nsignificant judgment by the management of the Company. Actual uncollectible amounts may differ from the Company’s\nestimate.\nThe Company recognizes revenue on the sale of its standard precast concrete products, and the associated shipping and\ninstallation revenue, at shipment date, including revenue derived from any projects to be completed under short-term\ncontracts. Leasing and royalties are recognized as revenue over time. Certain sales of soundwall, SlenderWall, and other\narchitectural concrete products are recognized over time because as the Company’s performance creates or enhances\ncustomer controlled assets or creates or enhances an asset with no alternative use, and the Company has an enforceable right\nto receive compensation. Over time product contracts are estimated based on the number of units produced (output method)\nduring the period multiplied by the unit rate stated in the contract. As the output method is driven by units produced, the\nCompany recognizes revenues based on the value transferred to the customer relative to the remaining value to be transferred.\nThe Company also matches the costs associated with the units produced. If a contract is projected to result in a loss, the entire\ncontract loss is recognized in the period when the loss was first determined and the amount of the loss updated in subsequent\nreporting periods. Revenue recognition also includes an amount related to a contract asset or contract liability. If the\nrecognized revenue is greater than the amount billed to the customer, a contract asset is recorded in accounts receivable trade\n- unbilled. Conversely, if the amount billed to the customer is greater than the recognized revenue, a contract liability is\nrecorded in customer deposits. Changes in the job performance, job conditions and final contract settlements are factors that\ninfluence management’s assessment of total contract value and therefore, profit and revenue recognition.\n15\nSeasonality\nThe Company services the construction industry primarily in areas of the United States where construction activity may be\ninhibited by adverse weather during the winter. As a result, the Company may experience reduced revenues from December\nthrough February and realize the substantial part of its revenues during the other months of the year. The Company may\nexperience lower profits, or losses, during the winter months, and as such, must have sufficient working capital to fund its\noperations at a reduced level until the spring construction season. The failure to generate or obtain sufficient working capital\nduring the winter may have a material adverse effect on the Company.\nInflation\nManagement believes that the Company’s operations were affected by inflation in 2022 and 2021, particularly in the\npurchases of certain raw materials such as cement, aggregates, and steel, and with labor costs. The Company believes that\nraw material pricing and labor costs will increase in 2023, although no assurance can be given regarding future pricing or\ncosts.\nBacklog\nAs of March 13, 2023, the Company’s sales backlog was approximately $52.4 million as compared to approximately $29.0\nmillion at approximately the same time in 2022. It is estimated that most of the projects in the sales backlog will be produced\nwithin 12 months, but a few will be produced over multiple years. The increase in backlog was due to an increase in orders\nfor products to be produced at all three manufacturing facilities, as well as an increase in the barrier rental backlog, as\ncompared to the prior year. The Company expects the backlog to increase with continued bidding on large infrastructure and\nSlenderWall/architectural projects, although no assurance can be given.\nThe risk exists that recessionary economic conditions and the coronavirus outbreak may adversely affect the Company more\nthan it has experienced to date. To mitigate these economic and other risks, the Company has a broader product offering than\nmost competitors and has historically been a leader in innovation and new product development in the industry. The\nCompany is continuing this strategy through the development, marketing and sales efforts for its new products.\nThe Company continues to evaluate both production and administrative processes, and has streamlined many of these\nprocesses through lean activities. During 2022 and 2021, the Company, through lean activities, continued to see positive\neffects in production and office areas. The lean business philosophy is a long-term, customer focused approach to continuous\nimprovement by eliminating waste and providing value. It is management’s intention to continue on the lean journey while\nimplementing a lean culture throughout the Company to help reach our goals for 2023. The Company’s lean efforts are aimed\nto increase quality to the customer, significantly reduce defects, while increasing production capacity and sales volume. In\norder to meet these goals, substantial improvements through lean tools and lean thinking are being implemented company\nwide.\nItem 7A.

Changes In and Disagreements With Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure\nNot applicable.\n16\nItem 9A. Controls and Procedures\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nIn connection with the preparation of this report, an evaluation was carried out by certain members of the Company’s\nmanagement, with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and the Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”), of the\neffectiveness of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Securities and Exchange Commission’s\n(SEC) Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”)) as of December 31,\n2022. Disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports filed or\nsubmitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the\nSEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the CEO and\nthe CFO, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.\nDue to a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting described below, management concluded that the\nCompany’s disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of December 31, 2022. Notwithstanding the existence of\nthis material weakness, management believes that the consolidated financial statements in this annual report filed on Form\n10-K present, in all material respects, the Company’s financial condition as reported, in conformity with United States\nGenerally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”).\nManagement’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nManagement is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in\nRules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to\nprovide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of the financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for\nexternal purposes in accordance with GAAP. This process includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the\nmaintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets;\n(ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in\naccordance with GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our\nmanagement and directors; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized\nacquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,\nprojections of any evaluation of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to risk that the\ninternal control may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with policies or\nprocedures may deteriorate.\nManagement has completed an assessment of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as\nof December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the\nCommittee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”). As a result of this assessment,\nmanagement has concluded controls were not effective due to an identified material weakness in internal control over\nfinancial reporting. A material weakness is a control deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over\nfinancial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company’s annual or interim\nfinancial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. The Company identified a material weakness in the\nmethodology initially used to estimate the allowance for doubtful accounts related to the fourth quarter 2022.\nAs a result of this material weakness, the Company’s management has concluded that, as of December 31, 2022 the\nCompany’s internal control over financial reporting was not effective based on the criteria in Internal Control – Integrated\nFramework (2013) issued by the COSO.\nManagement communicated the results of its assessment to the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. As a “smaller\nreporting company”, the Company is exempt from the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley\nAct of 2002. As a result, the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm has not audited or issued an\nattestation report with respect to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022.\n17\nRemediation Efforts\nManagement is committed to the remediation of the material weakness described above. To address the material weakness\nassociated with the estimation of the allowance for doubtful accounts, management has revised its methodology applied for\nthe fourth quarter. Further, the methodology for calculating the allowance has been further revised in 2023 in consideration of\nASU No. 2016-13, “Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments.” Refer to Recently Adopted Accounting\nPronouncement in the Financial Statements of the Company set forth herein, for additional information.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nOther than as described above, there were no other changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting\nidentified in management’s evaluation pursuant to Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act during the quarter\nended December 31, 2022 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal\ncontrol over financial reporting.\nItem 9B.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in\nall material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022, and the results of its operations and\ncash flows for the year ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United\nStates of America.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express\nan opinion on the Company’s consolidated financial statements based on our audit.\nWe are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)\n(“PCAOB”) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities\nlaws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform\nthe audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material\nmisstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit\nof its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audit, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal\ncontrol over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s\ninternal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial\nstatements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures include\nexamining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audit\nalso included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating\nthe overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our\nopinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the consolidated financial\nstatements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the Audit Committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or\ndisclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective,\nor complex judgments. The communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the\nconsolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below,\nproviding a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts\nAs of December 31, 2022, the Company’s allowance for doubtful accounts was approximately $781 thousand. The\ndetermination of the allowance for doubtful accounts has been identified by the Company as a critical accounting policy. As\nfurther described in the Company’s Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, exposure to losses on receivables, arising\nfrom the Company’s operations, are principally dependent on each customer’s financial condition and the Company monitors\nits exposure to credit losses and maintains allowances for anticipated losses. The Company reviews accounts receivable on a\nregular basis to determine the probability of collection. In performing its evaluation, the Company analyzes the payment\nhistory and its significant past due accounts, subsequent cash collections, comparative accounts receivable aging statistics,\nand other customer-specific considerations existing and known as of the time of the analysis. Based on this information,\nalong with other related factors, the Company develops an estimate of the uncollectible amounts included in accounts\nreceivable.\nWe identified the Company’s estimate of the allowance for doubtful accounts as a critical audit matter. The principal\nconsiderations for that determination were the degree of subjectivity and judgement required to audit management’s estimate,\nwhich incorporates historical experience, current economic conditions, and specific customer considerations, such as\nreceivables that are outstanding for longer periods of time as a result of ongoing projects or possible disputes. Also included\nin our principal considerations for determining this as a critical audit matter was the identified material weakness over\nmanagement’s methodology of the allowance for doubtful accounts, specifically the consideration over aged receivables\noutstanding, which impacted the nature, timing, and extent of our audit procedures.\nF-2\nThe primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included the following:\n Obtained an understanding of management’s allowance for doubtful accounts methodology.\n Performed a retrospective review of historical write-offs and recalculated the mathematical accuracy of\nmanagement’s calculation of the allowance for doubtful accounts.\n Inspected current and historical financial results, including the aging of accounts receivable in the current year\ncompared to the average historical aging from prior years.\n Evaluated the reasonableness of the allowance on specific accounts receivable balances, including those\noutstanding for longer periods of time as a result of ongoing projects or possible disputes, by testing a sample\nof collections subsequent to yearend, inspecting customer correspondence, performing inquiries of\nmanagement and obtaining corroborating evidence.\n/s/ FORVIS, LLP\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2022.\nRichmond, Virginia\nApril 17, 2023\nF-3\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nShareholders and Board of Directors\nSmith-Midland Corporation\nMidland, Virginia\nOpinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Smith-Midland Corporation and subsidiaries (the\n“Company”) as of December 31, 2021, the related consolidated statements of income, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows\nfor the year then ended, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our\nopinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at\nDecember 31, 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended, in conformity with accounting\nprinciples generally accepted in the United States of America.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management.

We are a public accounting firm\nregistered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”) and are required to be\nindependent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and\nregulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB.

The Company’s wholly-owned subsidiaries consist of Smith-Midland Corporation, a Virginia\ncorporation, Smith-Carolina Corporation, a North Carolina corporation, Smith-Columbia Corporation, a South Carolina\ncorporation, Easi-Set Industries, Inc., a Virginia corporation, Concrete Safety Systems, Inc., a Virginia corporation, and\nMidland Advertising and Design, Inc., doing business as Midland Advertising + Design, a Virginia corporation. All material\nintercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nCash\nCash is maintained at financial institutions and, at times, balances may exceed federally insured limits. The Company has not\nexperienced any losses related to these balances.\nInventories\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost, using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method, or net realizable value. Inventory\nreserves (in thousands) were approximately $88 and $74 at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment is stated at cost. Expenditures for ordinary maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. Costs\nof improvements, renewals, and major replacements are capitalized. At the time properties are retired or otherwise disposed\nof, the related cost and allowance for depreciation are eliminated from the accounts and any gain or loss on disposition is\nreflected in income.\nDepreciation expense is computed using the straight-line method over the following estimated useful lives:\nYears\nBuildings and improvements ............................................................................................................................... 10-40\nTrucks and automotive equipment ....................................................................................................................... 3-10\nShop machinery and equipment ........................................................................................................................... 3-10\nLand improvements ............................................................................................................................................. 10-15\nRental equipment ................................................................................................................................................. 5-10\nOffice equipment ................................................................................................................................................. 3-10\nIncome Taxes\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the\nfinancial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and\nliabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary\ndifferences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is\nrecognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.\nThe Company files tax returns in the U.S. Federal and various state jurisdictions. The Company recognizes, when applicable,\ninterest and penalties related to income taxes in other income (expense) in its consolidated statement of income. The\nCompany is no longer subject to U.S. or state tax examinations for the years prior to 2019. The Company does not have any\nuncertain tax positions as of December 31, 2022, and believes there will be no material changes in unrecognized tax positions\nover the next twelve months.\nF-11\nStock Compensation\nOn October 13, 2016, the Board of Directors of the Company adopted the 2016 Equity Incentive Plan which allows the\nCompany to grant up to 400,000 shares of common stock of the Company to employees, officers, directors and consultants.\nThe grants may be in the form of restricted or performance shares of common stock of the Company. The fair value of each\nrestricted stock grant is estimated to be the sales price of the common stock at the close of business on the day of the grant.\nRevenue Recognition\nProduct Sales - Over Time\nUnder Topic 606, the Company recognizes revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount that\nreflects the consideration the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for goods or services provided. Revenue\nassociated with contracts with customers for customized products is recognized over time as the Company’s performance\ncreates or enhances customer-controlled assets or creates or enhances an asset with no alternative use, which the Company\nhas an enforceable right to receive compensation as defined under the contract for performance completed. To determine the\namount of revenue to recognize over time, the Company recognizes revenue over the contract terms based on the output\nmethod. The Company applied the “as invoiced” practical expedient as the amount of consideration the Company has the\nright to invoice corresponds directly with the value of the Company’s performance to date.\nAs the output method is driven by units produced, the Company recognizes revenues based on the value transferred to the\ncustomer relative to the remaining value to be transferred. The Company also matches the costs associated with the units\nproduced. If a contract is projected to result in a loss, the entire contract loss is recognized in the period when the loss was\nfirst determined and the amount of the loss is updated in subsequent reporting periods. Revenue recognition also includes an\namount related to a contract asset or contract liability. If the recognized revenue is greater than the amount billed to the\ncustomer, a contract asset is recorded in accounts receivable trade - unbilled. Conversely, if the amount billed to the customer\nis greater than the recognized revenue, a contract liability is recorded in customer deposits. Changes in the job performance,\njob conditions, and final contract settlements are factors that influence management’s assessment of total contract value and\ntherefore, profit and revenue recognition.\nA portion of the work the Company performs requires financial assurances in the form of performance and payment bonds at\nthe time of execution of the contract. Some contracts include retention provisions of up to 10%, which are generally withheld\nfrom each progress payment as retainage until the contract work has been completed and approved.\nProduct Sales - Point in Time\nFor certain product sales that do not meet the over time criteria, under Topic 606 the Company recognizes revenue when the\nproduct has been shipped to the destination in accordance with the terms outlined in the contract where a present obligation to\npay exists and the customers have gained control of the product.\nAccounts Receivable and Contract Balances\nThe timing of when we bill our customers is generally dependent upon advance billing terms, milestone billings based on the\ncompletion of certain phases of the work, or when services are provided or products are shipped. Projects with performance\nobligations recognized over time that have costs and estimated earnings recognized to date in excess of cumulative billings\nare reported on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as “Accounts receivable trade - unbilled” (contract assets). Projects with\nperformance obligations recognized over time that have cumulative billings in excess of costs and estimate earnings\nrecognized to date, are reported on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as “Customer deposits” (contract liabilities). For the year\nended December 31, 2022, the Company recognized $983 of revenue related to contract liabilities reported as of December\n31, 2021.\nAny uncollected billed amounts for our performance obligations recognized over time, including contract retentions, are\nrecorded within accounts receivable trade - billed. At December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, accounts receivable\nincluded contract retentions (in thousands) of approximately $932 and $1,139, respectively, which are considered contract\nassets. It is expected that substantially all of the outstanding retainage balance outstanding as of December 31, 2022 will be\ncollected within one year.\nOur billed and unbilled revenue may be exposed to potential credit risk if our customers should encounter financial\ndifficulties, and we maintain reserves for potentially uncollectible receivables. At December 31, 2022 and December 31,\n2021, our allowances for doubtful accounts (in thousands) were $781 and $437, respectively.\nF-12\nSale to Customer with a Buy-Back Guarantee - Lease Income\nThe Company entered into a buy-back agreement with one specific customer. Under this agreement, the Company guaranteed\nto buy-back barrier at a predetermined price at the end of the long-term project, subject to the condition of the product.\nAlthough the Company received payment in full when the product was produced, we were required to account for these\ntransactions as operating leases. The amount of sale proceeds equal to the buy-back obligation, included in “Deferred buy-\nback lease obligation” in the liabilities section of the consolidated balance sheet, was deferred until the buy-back was\nexecuted. The remaining sale proceeds were deferred in the same account and recognized on a straight-line basis over the\nusage period, such usage period commencing on delivery to the job-site and ending at the time the buy-back was executed.\nThe Company capitalized the cost of the product on the consolidated balance sheet shown in “Deferred buy-back lease asset,\nnet”, and depreciated the value, less residual value, to cost of leasing revenue in “Cost of goods sold” over the estimated\nuseful life of the asset.\nPursuant to an amendment entered into by the Company with the customer on April 13, 2022, the Company agreed to\npurchase barrier back in the amount equal to the buy-back guarantee. Accordingly, the Company settled any remaining\ndeferred balances, in excess of the buy-back payment, to leasing revenue, and reclassified the net book value of the purchased\nproduct to “Property and equipment, net”. The revenue is being recognized in accordance with Topic 842, Leases. See Note\n7. Commitments for additional information regarding the amendment.\nBarrier Rentals - Lease Income\nLeasing fees are paid by customers at the beginning of the lease agreement and are recorded as deferred revenue. The\ndeferred revenue is then recognized each month as lease income for the duration of the lease, in accordance with Topic 842,\nLeases.\nRoyalty Income\nThe Company licenses certain products to other precast companies to produce the Company’s products to engineering\nspecifications under the licensing agreements. The agreements are typically for five-year terms and require royalty payments\nfrom 4% to 6% of total sales of licensed products, which are paid every month. The revenues from licensing agreements are\nrecognized in the month earned, in accordance with Topic 606-10-55-65.\nShipping and Installation\nShipping and installation revenues are recognized as a distinct performance obligation in the period the shipping and\ninstallation services are provided to the customer, in accordance with Topic 606.\nDisaggregation of Revenue\nIn the following table, revenue is disaggregated by primary sources of revenue (in thousands):\nRevenue by Type (Disaggregated Revenue) 2022 2021 Change % Change\nProduct Sales:\nSoundwall Sales ............................................................................. $ 4,128 $ 8,025 $ (3,897 ) (49) %\nArchitectural Sales ......................................................................... 4,269 4,932 (663 ) (13) %\nSlenderWall Sales .......................................................................... 1,489 1,795 (306 ) (17) %\nMiscellaneous Wall Sales .............................................................. 3,475 2,352 1,123 48%\nBarrier Sales .................................................................................. 6,717 4,686 2,031 43%\nEasi-Set and Easi-Span Building Sales .......................................... 4,089 3,036 1,053 35%\nUtility Sales ................................................................................... 2,023 2,468 (445 ) (18) %\nMiscellaneous Sales ....................................................................... 1,631 1,206 425 35%\nTotal Product Sales ..................................................................... 27,821 28,500 (679 ) (2) %\nBarrier Rentals .............................................................................. 6,545 9,925 (3,380 ) (34) %\nRoyalty Income .............................................................................. 2,498 2,216 282 13%\nShipping and Installation Revenue ................................................ 13,267 10,001 3,266 33%\nTotal Service Revenue ................................................................. 22,310 22,142 168 1%\nTotal Revenue............................................................................... $ 50,131 $ 50,642 $ (511 ) (1) %\nF-13\nSmith-Midland products are typically sold pursuant to an implicit warranty as to merchantability only. Warranty claims are\nreviewed and resolved on a case by case method. Although the Company does incur costs for warranty claims, historically\nsuch amounts are minimal.\nThe revenue items: soundwall sales, architectural sales, SlenderWall sales, miscellaneous wall sales, miscellaneous sales,\nbarrier rentals, and royalty income are recognized as revenue over time. The revenue items: barrier sales, Easi-Set and Easi-\nSpan building sales, utility sales, and shipping and installation revenue are recognized as revenue at a point in time.\nConcentration of Risk\nHistorically, various customers have comprised greater than 10% of revenue during a given quarter or year. These customers\nare typically not the same quarter to quarter or year to year. The Company views revenue details by jobs, and not by\ncustomers. In the event a customer were to go out of business during a project, it is likely that the owner of the project would\nassign a new contractor to the job, and the Company would complete its scope of work. Therefore, the Company believes that\nit does not have a short-term vulnerability of severe impact to operations. In cases where customers are less than 10% of\nrevenue, the Company assesses if there is a near term severe impact. The Company has determined that no customer, if lost,\nwould result in a near term severe impact to the Company’s operations.\nSales and Use Taxes\nThe Company excludes sales taxes as part of revenue, and includes use taxes on construction materials reported in cost of\ngoods sold.\nSegment Reporting\nOperating segments are defined as components of an enterprise for which separate financial information is available and\nevaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker, or decision making group, in deciding how to allocate resources\nand assess performance. The Company currently operates in one operating and reportable business segment for financial\nreporting purposes.\nRisks and Uncertainties\nOn January 30, 2020, the World Health Organization (“WHO”) announced a global health emergency because of a new strain\nof coronavirus originating in Wuhan, China (the “COVID-19 outbreak”) and on March 11, 2020, the WHO classified the\nCOVID-19 outbreak as a pandemic. Management is actively monitoring the global situation on its financial condition,\nliquidity, operations, suppliers, industry, and workforce. Given the daily evolution of the COVID-19 outbreak and the global\nresponses to curb its spread, the Company is not able to estimate the effects of the COVID-19 outbreak on its results of\noperations, financial condition, or liquidity for fiscal year 2022.\nThe Company sells products to highway contractors operating under government funded highway programs and other\ncustomers and extends credit based on an evaluation of the customer’s financial condition, generally without requiring\ncollateral. Exposure to losses on receivables is principally dependent on each customer’s financial condition. The Company\nmonitors its exposure to credit losses and maintains allowances for anticipated losses. Management reviews accounts\nreceivable on a regular basis to determine the probability of collection. In performing this evaluation, the Company analyzes\nthe payment history and its significant past due accounts, subsequent cash collections on these accounts, comparative\naccounts receivable aging statistics, and other customer-specific considerations existing and known as of the time of the\nanalysis. Based on this information, along with other related factors, the Company develops an estimate of the uncollectible\namounts included in accounts receivable. Management believes the allowance for doubtful accounts at December 31, 2022 is\nadequate. However, actual write-offs may exceed the recorded allowance.\nDue to inclement weather, the Company may experience reduced revenue from December through February and may realize\na substantial part of its revenue during the other months of the year.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nThe carrying value for each of the Company’s financial instruments except for long-term debt approximates fair value\nbecause of the short-term nature of those instruments. The Company’s long-term debt has a carrying value of $6,365 based\non the fixed rates applicable to the related loans compared to a fair market value of approximately $6,535.\nF-14\nEstimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP)\nrequires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date\nof the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period.\nActual results could differ from those estimates.\nAdvertising Costs\nThe Company expenses all advertising costs as incurred. Advertising expense (in thousands) was approximately $421 and\n$459 in 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nEarnings Per Share\nEarnings per share are based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock and dilutive common stock\nequivalents outstanding. Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by the\nweighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings per share reflect the potential\ndilution of securities that could share in earnings of the Company.\nLong-Lived Assets\nThe Company reviews the carrying values of its long-lived assets including identifiable intangible assets for possible\nimpairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of assets may not be recoverable\nbased on undiscounted estimated future operating cash flows. When any such impairment exists, the related assets will be\nwritten down to fair value. No impairment losses have been recorded during the two years ended December 31, 2022.\nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncement\nThe FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, “Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments.” This standard replaces the\nincurred loss impairment methodology in current U.S. GAAP with a methodology that reflects estimates of expected credit\nlosses over their contractual life that are recorded at inception based on historical information, current conditions, and\nreasonable and supportable forecasts. The pronouncement is effective for smaller reporting companies for fiscal years\nbeginning after December 15, 2022. We adopted this standard, and all related amendments, effective January 1, 2023, on a\nmodified retrospective basis. We are finalizing our evaluation of the impact that the adoption of this accounting guidance will\nhave on the consolidated financial statements.\nF-15\nSMITH-MIDLAND CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n1.

The PPP provides for loans\nto qualifying businesses, the proceeds of which may only be used for payroll costs, rent, utilities, mortgage interest, and\ninterest on other pre-existing indebtedness. The interest rate per the promissory note, dated April 16, 2020 and executed by\nthe Company in favor of the Bank, was fixed at 1.00% per annum, with principal and interest payments starting thirty (30)\ndays after the amount of forgiveness is determined under section 1106 of the CARES Act. The proceeds of the loan were\nrequired to be utilized pursuant to the requirements of the PPP, and all or a portion of the loan could be forgiven in\naccordance with the PPP applicable rules, regulations, and guidelines. On July 9, 2021, the Company received loan\nforgiveness for the full amount of the loan of $2,692.\nThe Company’s notes payable includes certain restrictive covenants, which require the Company to maintain minimum levels\nof tangible net worth, places limits on annual capital expenditures, and limits on the payment of cash dividends.

The state NOLs begin expiring at various times between 2028\nand 2037.\nF-18\nSmith-Midland Corporation\nand Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(continued)\n5. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS\nThe Company has a savings plan that qualifies under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code (“IRC”). Participating\nemployees may elect to contribute a percentage of their salary, subject to certain limitations. The Company contributes 50%\nof the participant’s contribution, up to 4% of the participant’s compensation, as a matching contribution. Total match\ncontributions (in thousands) by the Company for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 were approximately $225 and\n$211, respectively.\n6. STOCK COMPENSATION\nOn October 13, 2016, the Board of Directors of the Company adopted the 2016 Equity Incentive Plan, which allows the\nCompany to grant up to 400,000 shares of restricted common stock of the Company to employees, officers, directors and\nconsultants. The grants may be in the form of restricted or performance shares of common stock of the Company. The total\nintrinsic value (in thousands) of the outstanding shares of restricted stock at December 31, 2022 and 2021 is $608 and\n$1,027, respectively.\nThe fair value of restricted stock awards is estimated to be the market price of the Company’s common stock at the close of\ndate of grant. The Company assumes no forfeitures as they are granted to key executives and board members.\nRestricted stock activity during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2022 is as follows:\nWeighted\nAverage\nGrant Date\nNumber of Fair Value\nShares per Share\nNon-vested, December 31, 2020 .................................................................................................. 36,336 $ 8.98\nGranted .......................................................................................................................................... 73,684 13.94\nVested ............................................................................................................................................ 27,500 11.84\nNon-vested, December 31, 2021 .................................................................................................. 82,520 12.45\nVested ............................................................................................................................................ 26,755 12.01\nForfeited ......................................................................................................................................... 7,906 12.50\nNon-vested, December 31, 2022 .................................................................................................. 47,859 $ 12.70\nThe actual number of performance-based shares of common stock of the Company, if any, to be earned by the award\nrecipients is determined over a three year performance measurement period based on measures that include Earnings Before\nInterest Taxes Depreciation and Amortization (“EBITDA”) margin, revenue growth, and free cash flow. The EBITDA\nmargin and revenue growth performance targets have been set for each of the Minimum, Target, and Maximum levels. The\nactual performance amount received is determined by the Compensation Committee and may be adjusted for items\ndetermined to be unusual in nature or infrequent in occurrence. A smaller portion is also earned based on Board discretion\nand continued service. The stock compensation cost is recognized over the requisite performance/service period using the\nstraight-line method and can be periodically adjusted for the probable number of shares to be awarded.\nAwards are being amortized to expense ratably, based upon the vesting schedule. Stock compensation (in thousands) for the\nyears ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 were approximately $505 and $531, respectively, based upon the value at the date\nof grant. There was $316 of unrecognized compensation cost related to the non-vested restricted stock as of December 31,\n2022.\nF-19\nSmith-Midland Corporation\nand Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(continued)\n7. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\nOn April 13, 2022, the Company and its customer entered into an amendment to the buy-back agreement described in\n‘Revenue Recognition-Sale to Customer with a Buy-Back Guarantee - Lease Income’. Pursuant to the amendment, the\nCompany agreed to purchase all of the barrier subject to the buy-back agreement, 210,000 linear feet, as well as\napproximately an additional 115,000 linear feet. The total estimated purchase price is $5,000, representing the barrier,\nassociated loading, freight, and yarding. In accordance with ASC 842 Leases, a portion of the total $5,000 buy-back was\npreviously recorded as a deferred buy-back obligation on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The deferred buy-back lease asset\nand obligation are reduced as the Company picks up the original 210,000 linear feet. Costs in excess of the original deferred\nbuy-back obligation will be capitalized for as incurred.\nThe Company is party to legal proceedings and disputes which may arise in the ordinary course of business. In the opinion of\nthe Company, it is unlikely that liabilities, if any, arising from legal disputes will have a material adverse effect on the\nconsolidated financial position of the Company.\n8.
