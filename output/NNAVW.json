Reports Third Quarter 2024 Results\n\n11/13/2024\n\n_The Brattle Group Analysis Finds Total Quantified Value of Having a GPS Backup is $14.6 billion_\n\n_NextNav Continues Engineer-to-Engineer Dialogue with Appropriate Stakeholders_\n\nRESTON, Va., Nov. 13, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- NextNav Inc. (NASDAQ: NN) a leader in next generation positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT) and 3D geolocation, today reported financial results for NextNav’s third quarter ended September 30, 2024.\n\nMariam Sorond, NextNav CEO said, “In the third quarter, we continued efforts to advance our strategic vision and address the critical need for a terrestrial complement and backup to GPS. The NextNav team continues to hold active discussions with the appropriate stakeholders through engineer-to-engineer dialogue in support of our petition. We believe that collaborative analysis is essential to achieving an outcome that best serves the public interest and solves a national security problem.\n\n“We are also excited about the outcome of the recent Brattle Group report whose analysis estimates a total quantified value of a having a terrestrial backup to GPS at $14.6 billion. Moving forward, we are committed to advancing our mission and working closely with the appropriate stakeholders, as well as the relevant government agencies, to deliver a solution that will provide enormous public benefit.”\n\n**Recent Operational Highlights**\n\n  * **NextNav Submits Filings in Support of 3D Terrestrial PNT Solution:** In response to the FCC’s Public Notice issued on August 6, 2024, NextNav filed [comments](https://www.fcc.gov/ecfs/document/109060100813880/1) on September 5, 2024, followed by [reply comments](https://www.fcc.gov/ecfs/document/109210013201773/1) on September 20, 2024, with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in support of the Company’s petition to reconfigure the Lower 900 MHz Band to enable a 5G-based terrestrial Positioning, Navigation and Timing service.\n\n\n  * **The Brattle Group Issues Economic Report:** On October 21, 2024, The Brattle Group issued a [report](https://nextnav.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/NextNav-October-21-2024.pdf) finding that the adoption of NextNav’s proposal to reconfigure the Lower 900 MHz offers the US economy the equivalent of a $10.8 billion insurance policy to protect against GPS outages without taxpayer funding, plus additional benefits of $3.8 billion from increased resiliency. This brings the total quantified value of having a backup to GPS to $14.6 billion, according to The Brattle Group’s analysis.\n\n\n  * **Rear Admiral David Simpson (Ret.) Argues for Greater PNT Resiliency in the U.S.:** In a [white paper](https://nam04.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwireless.vt.edu%2Fnews%2Fa-day-without-space-simpson.html&data=05%7C02%7Chwaterma%40nextnav.com%7C60ef995b0b344a3263f808dcf386dd22%7C207ec3d33ddb4d3b8b9189f1306ec59e%7C0%7C0%7C638653007773435510%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=oVIcqcxGCOYTYy0kAGT%2F8VxtSpQi9NpM6uKwbK4zXZA%3D&reserved=0) issued on September 3, 2024 by Virginia Tech University, Rear Admiral, USN (ret.) David Simpson discusses the critical role of PNT services, with a focus on U.S. dependency on space-based systems like GPS.

Reports Third Quarter 2024 Results\n\n11/13/2024\n\n_The Brattle Group Analysis Finds Total Quantified Value of Having a GPS Backup is $14.6 billion_\n\n_NextNav Continues Engineer-to-Engineer Dialogue with Appropriate Stakeholders_\n\nRESTON, Va., Nov. 13, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- NextNav Inc. (NASDAQ: NN) a leader in next generation positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT) and 3D geolocation, today reported financial results for NextNav’s third quarter ended September 30, 2024.\n\nMariam Sorond, NextNav CEO said, “In the third quarter, we continued efforts to advance our strategic vision and address the critical need for a terrestrial complement and backup to GPS. The NextNav team continues to hold active discussions with the appropriate stakeholders through engineer-to-engineer dialogue in support of our petition. We believe that collaborative analysis is essential to achieving an outcome that best serves the public interest and solves a national security problem.\n\n“We are also excited about the outcome of the recent Brattle Group report whose analysis estimates a total quantified value of a having a terrestrial backup to GPS at $14.6 billion. Moving forward, we are committed to advancing our mission and working closely with the appropriate stakeholders, as well as the relevant government agencies, to deliver a solution that will provide enormous public benefit.”\n\n**Recent Operational Highlights**\n\n  * **NextNav Submits Filings in Support of 3D Terrestrial PNT Solution:** In response to the FCC’s Public Notice issued on August 6, 2024, NextNav filed [comments](https://www.fcc.gov/ecfs/document/109060100813880/1) on September 5, 2024, followed by [reply comments](https://www.fcc.gov/ecfs/document/109210013201773/1) on September 20, 2024, with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in support of the Company’s petition to reconfigure the Lower 900 MHz Band to enable a 5G-based terrestrial Positioning, Navigation and Timing service.\n\n\n  * **The Brattle Group Issues Economic Report:** On October 21, 2024, The Brattle Group issued a [report](https://nextnav.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/NextNav-October-21-2024.pdf) finding that the adoption of NextNav’s proposal to reconfigure the Lower 900 MHz offers the US economy the equivalent of a $10.8 billion insurance policy to protect against GPS outages without taxpayer funding, plus additional benefits of $3.8 billion from increased resiliency. This brings the total quantified value of having a backup to GPS to $14.6 billion, according to The Brattle Group’s analysis.\n\n\n  * **Rear Admiral David Simpson (Ret.) Argues for Greater PNT Resiliency in the U.S.:** In a [white paper](https://nam04.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwireless.vt.edu%2Fnews%2Fa-day-without-space-simpson.html&data=05%7C02%7Chwaterma%40nextnav.com%7C60ef995b0b344a3263f808dcf386dd22%7C207ec3d33ddb4d3b8b9189f1306ec59e%7C0%7C0%7C638653007773435510%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=oVIcqcxGCOYTYy0kAGT%2F8VxtSpQi9NpM6uKwbK4zXZA%3D&reserved=0) issued on September 3, 2024 by Virginia Tech University, Rear Admiral, USN (ret.) David Simpson discusses the critical role of PNT services, with a focus on U.S. dependency on space-based systems like GPS.

Moving forward, we are committed to advancing our mission and working closely with the appropriate stakeholders, as well as the relevant government agencies, to deliver a solution that will provide enormous public benefit.”\n\n**Recent Operational Highlights**\n\n  * **NextNav Submits Filings in Support of 3D Terrestrial PNT Solution:** In response to the FCC’s Public Notice issued on August 6, 2024, NextNav filed [comments](https://www.fcc.gov/ecfs/document/109060100813880/1) on September 5, 2024, followed by [reply comments](https://www.fcc.gov/ecfs/document/109210013201773/1) on September 20, 2024, with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in support of the Company’s petition to reconfigure the Lower 900 MHz Band to enable a 5G-based terrestrial Positioning, Navigation and Timing service.\n\n\n  * **The Brattle Group Issues Economic Report:** On October 21, 2024, The Brattle Group issued a [report](https://nextnav.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/NextNav-October-21-2024.pdf) finding that the adoption of NextNav’s proposal to reconfigure the Lower 900 MHz offers the US economy the equivalent of a $10.8 billion insurance policy to protect against GPS outages without taxpayer funding, plus additional benefits of $3.8 billion from increased resiliency. This brings the total quantified value of having a backup to GPS to $14.6 billion, according to The Brattle Group’s analysis.\n\n\n  * **Rear Admiral David Simpson (Ret.) Argues for Greater PNT Resiliency in the U.S.:** In a [white paper](https://nam04.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwireless.vt.edu%2Fnews%2Fa-day-without-space-simpson.html&data=05%7C02%7Chwaterma%40nextnav.com%7C60ef995b0b344a3263f808dcf386dd22%7C207ec3d33ddb4d3b8b9189f1306ec59e%7C0%7C0%7C638653007773435510%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=oVIcqcxGCOYTYy0kAGT%2F8VxtSpQi9NpM6uKwbK4zXZA%3D&reserved=0) issued on September 3, 2024 by Virginia Tech University, Rear Admiral, USN (ret.) David Simpson discusses the critical role of PNT services, with a focus on U.S. dependency on space-based systems like GPS. Admiral Simpson highlights the vulnerabilities of GPS and stresses the need for the U.S. to develop a robust terrestrial complement and backup to GPS to ensure resiliency in critical infrastructure and military operations.\n\n\n\n**Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Financial Highlights**\n\n  * **Revenue:** was $1.6 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to $1.0 million in the prior year period.
