Our forward-looking statements are generally, but not always, accompanied by words such as, but not limited to, “aim,”\n“anticipate,” “believe,” “can,” “continue,” “could,” “estimate,” “expect,” “goal,” “intend” “may,” “might,” “ongoing,” “plan,” “possible,” “potential,” “predict,” “project,” “seek,” “should,” “strategy,” “target,” “will,” “would” and similar expressions or\nphrases, or the negative of those expressions or phrases, or other words that convey the uncertainty of future events or outcomes, which are intended to identify forward-looking statements, although not all forward-looking statements contain these words. We\nhave based these forward-looking statements on our current expectations, guidance and projections and related assumptions about future events and financial trends. While our management considers these expectations, guidance, projections and assumptions\nto be reasonable, they are inherently subject to significant business, economic, competitive, regulatory and other risks, contingencies and uncertainties, most of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond our control. There can be no\nassurance that actual developments will be as we anticipate. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in these statements as a result of significant risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to:\n• our ability to qualify for and obtain broadband licenses in a timely manner or at all from the Federal Communications Commission (the “FCC”) in accordance with the requirements of the Report and Order approved by the FCC on May 13, 2020\n(the “Report and Order”);\n• our ability to successfully commercialize our spectrum assets to our targeted utility and critical infrastructure customers, including those customers that are above the Demonstrated Intent threshold, on a timely basis, and on commercially favorable\nterms consistent with our business plan and assumptions;\n• our ability to develop, market and sell new products and services, in addition to our spectrum assets, to our targeted and critical infrastructure customers;\n• our ability to correctly estimate our cash receipts, revenues and operating expenses and our future financial needs;\n• our ability to achieve our operating and financial projections and guidance;\n• our ability to support our future operations and business plans and return capital to our stockholders through our share repurchase program with our existing cash resources and the proceeds we generate from our commercial operations without\nraising additional capital through the issuance of stock or debt securities;\n• the extent and duration of the impact of macroeconomic pressures, including but not limited to pandemics, inflation, regulatory and policy changes, and geopolitical matters, on our business and on our potential customers’ businesses;\n• our ability to retune, protect or acquire Covered Incumbent narrowband licenses, including Complex Systems, in a timely manner and on commercially reasonable terms, or at all;\n• our ability to satisfy our obligations, including the delivery of cleared spectrum and broadband licenses, and the other contingencies required by our commercial agreements with our customers on a timely basis and on commercially reasonable\nterms;\n• whether federal and state agencies and commissions will support the deployment of broadband networks and services by our targeted customers;\n• our ability to maintain any narrowband and broadband licenses that we own, acquire and/or obtain;\n• government regulations or actions taken by governmental bodies could adversely affect our business prospects, liquidity and results of operations, including any changes by the FCC to the Report and Order or to the FCC rules and regulations\ngoverning the 900 MHz band;\n• our ability to successfully compete against third parties who offer spectrum and communication technologies, products and solutions to our targeted customers;\n• our ability to retain executive officers and key personnel and attract, retain and motivate qualified talent;\n• our ability to successfully manage our planned growth;\n• the ability to develop and sustain a robust market for our common stock;\n3\nTable of Contents\n• we may not be able to predict, influence or control factors that may cause volatility of our common stock price or cause the value of our common stock to decline;\n• the expected timing, the amount of repurchases and the related impact to our common stock relating to our share repurchase program; and\n• how the concentrated ownership of our common stock may limit other stockholders’ ability to influence corporate matters.\nThe matters discussed in these forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those projected, anticipated or implied in the forward-looking statements. Many of these\nrisks, uncertainties and other factors are beyond our ability to control, influence, or predict. The most significant of these risks, uncertainties and other factors are described in “Item 1A—Risk Factors” in Part II of this Quarterly Report and in our Annual\nReport on Form 10-K for the year ended March 31, 2024, filed with the SEC on June 26, 2024. As a result, investors are urged not to place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements reflect our views and\nassumptions only as of the date such forward-looking statements were made. Except to the limited extent required by applicable law, we undertake no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information,\nfuture events or otherwise.\n4\nTable of Contents\nPART I.

Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Unaudited)\n1. Nature of Operations and Basis of Presentation\nAnterix Inc (the “Company”) is the utility industry’s partner, empowering enhanced visibility, control and security for a modern grid. The Company’s vision is to deliver secure, scalable solutions enabled by private wireless broadband connectivity, for\nthe benefit of utilities and the communities that they serve. As the largest holder of licensed spectrum in the 900 MHz band (896-901/935-940 MHz) throughout the contiguous United States, plus Hawaii, Alaska and Puerto Rico, the Company is\nuniquely positioned to deliver solutions that support secure, resilient and customer-controlled operations. The Company is focused on commercializing its spectrum assets and expanding the benefits and solutions it offers to enable the Company’s\ntargeted utility and critical infrastructure customers to deploy private broadband networks.\nBusiness Developments\nIn June 2024, the Company entered into a license purchase agreement with Oncor Electric Delivery Company LLC (“Oncor”) for total estimated consideration of $102.5 million under which Oncor will purchase 900 MHz spectrum licenses covering\n95 counties to deploy a private wireless broadband network in its transmission and distribution service area (the “Oncor Agreement”).The total payment of $102.5 million comprises an initial payment of $10.0 million received in June 2024 and\nremaining payments that are due to the Company for each county, at closing. The timing and rights to milestone payments could vary as 900 MHz broadband licenses are granted by the FCC, broadband licenses are assigned to Oncor and incumbents\nare cleared by the Company. Oncor operates more than 143,000 circuit miles of transmission and distribution lines in Texas, delivering electricity to more than four million homes and businesses across a service territory that has an estimated\npopulation of approximately 13 million people. See Note 10 Contingencies and Guaranty for further discussion on the Oncor Agreement.\nBasis of Presentation and Use of Estimates\nThe consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”) for interim financial information. Pursuant to the rules and\nregulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in annual consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP have been condensed or\nomitted, these unaudited consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2024,\nfiled with the SEC on June 26, 2024 (the “2024 Annual Report”). In the Company’s opinion all normal and recurring adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation of the financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the periods\npresented have been included. The Company believes that the disclosures made in the unaudited consolidated interim financial statements are adequate to make the information not misleading. The results of operations for the interim periods presented\nare not necessarily indicative of the results for the year. The Company is also required to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts. These estimates and assumptions are reviewed periodically, and the effects of revisions\nare reflected in the financial statements in the applicable period. Accordingly, actual results could materially differ from those estimates.\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\n11\nTable of Contents\n2. Revenue\nThe following table provides information regarding the Company’s revenue for each of the services it provides pursuant to its spectrum revenue agreements for the three and six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (in thousands):\nThree months ended September 30, Six months ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nSpectrum revenue\n900 MHz Broadband Spectrum Revenue\nAmeren Corporation $ 182 $ 152 $ 338 $ 304\nEvergy 385 274 771 548\nXcel Energy (1) 802 444 1,603 444\nNarrowband Spectrum Revenue\nMotorola 182 182 364 364\nTotal spectrum revenue (2) $ 1,551 $ 1,052 $ 3,076 $ 1,660\n1. The Company commenced revenue recognition in connection with the delivery of cleared 900 MHz Broadband Spectrum and the associated broadband leases to Xcel Energy in September 2023.\n2. Revenue recognized during the three and six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was included in deferred revenue at the beginning of the respective periods.\nSpectrum Revenue Agreements\nRefer to the Company’s 2024 Annual Report for a description of the Company’s spectrum revenue agreements entered into prior to March 31, 2024.\nCapitalized Contract Costs\nThe Company capitalizes incremental costs associated with obtaining a spectrum revenue agreement with a customer, which generally includes sales commissions. The Company’s capitalized contract costs consisted of the following activity during the\nthree and six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (in thousands):\nThree months ended September 30, Six months ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nBalance at the beginning of the period $ 1,023 $ 888 $ 1,027 $ 870\nAdditions 90 5 116 33\nAmortization (11) (9) (41) (19)\nBalance at the end of the period 1,102 884 1,102 884\nLess amount classified as current assets (1) (676) (423) (676) (423)\nNoncurrent assets (1) $ 426 $ 461 $ 426 $ 461\n1. Current assets are recorded as prepaid expenses and other current assets and noncurrent assets are recorded as other assets on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n12\nTable of Contents\nContract Liabilities\nContract liabilities primarily relate to advanced consideration received from customers in connection with spectrum revenue agreements, for which revenue is recognized over the term of each delivered broadband lease. The Company’s contract\nliabilities consisted of the following activity during the three and six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (in thousands):\nThree months ended September 30, Six months ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nBalance at the beginning of the period $ 120,687 $ 60,151 $ 122,212 $ 60,759\nNet additions (1) 7,491 21,166 7,491 21,166\nRevenue recognized (1,551) (1,052) (3,076) (1,660)\nBalance at the end of the period 126,627 80,265 126,627 80,265\nLess amount classified as current liabilities (2) (5,915) (5,281) (5,915) (5,281)\nNoncurrent liabilities (2) $ 120,712 $ 74,984 $ 120,712 $ 74,984\n1. Represents milestone payments received from customer contracts pursuant to the terms of the associated spectrum revenue agreements, net of delivery delay adjustments.\n2. Current liabilities and noncurrent liabilities are recorded as deferred revenue on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nRemaining Performance Obligations\nRevenue allocated to remaining performance obligations of the Company’s contracts represent contracted revenue that will be recognized in future periods. Total performance obligations include deferred revenue (i.e., contract liabilities) as well as\namounts that will be invoiced and recognized in future periods. Revenue allocated to remaining performance obligations was $184.3 million as of September 30, 2024, which will be recognized over the remaining contract terms up to 30 years.\n3. Escrow Deposits\nEscrow deposits are considered restricted cash as the deposits are restricted from use until the terms of the escrow agreement are met. Escrow deposits are classified as current assets on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nIn connection with the Lower Colorado River Authority Agreement (the “LCRA Agreement”), the Company and Lower Colorado River Authority (“LCRA”) entered into an escrow agreement. Pursuant to the escrow agreement, the escrow funds shall\nbe held and invested in a money market deposit account. All interest and other income earned shall be allocated to the Company, payable with the final distribution of the escrow funds. The escrow funds shall be distributed upon written request by both\nthe Company and LCRA pursuant to the terms within the LCRA Agreement. In December 2023, the Company received $15.0 million, of which $7.5 million was deposited in an escrow account. As of September 30, 2024, the Company’s escrow\ndeposit balance on the Consolidated Balance Sheets is $7.6 million.\n4. Intangible Assets\nWireless licenses are considered indefinite-lived intangible assets. Indefinite-lived intangible assets are not subject to amortization but instead are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently if an event indicates that the asset might be\nimpaired. There were no impairment charges related to the Company’s indefinite-lived intangible assets during the three and six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.\n13\nTable of Contents\nIntangible assets consist of the following activity for the six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (in thousands):\n2024 2023\nBalance at the beginning of period $ 216,743 $ 202,044\nAcquisitions and transfers 5,027 8,022\nSale of intangible assets — (31,798)\nExchanges - licenses received 126 24,146\nExchanges - licenses surrendered (33) (4,848)\nBalance at the end of period $ 221,863 $ 197,566\nPurchases of intangible assets, including refundable deposits, retuning costs and swaps\nDuring the six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company entered into agreements with several third parties in multiple U.S. markets to acquire, retune or swap wireless licenses for cash consideration (“deals”) and made Anti-Windfall\nPayments to the US Treasury Department. The initial deposits to incumbents are recorded as spectrum receivable on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets and are refundable if the FCC does not approve the sale, retuning or swap of the\nspectrum. The initial deposits are transferred to deferred broadband cost or intangible assets in the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets, as applicable, upon meeting the relevant deal milestones. The final payments related to closed retuning or\nswap deals are recorded as deferred broadband costs on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets. The final payments for license purchases or Anti-Windfall Payments are recorded as intangible assets on the Company’s Consolidated Balance\nSheets.\nBroadband License Exchanges\nDuring the six months ended September 30, 2024, the Company was granted by the FCC, a broadband license for 1 county. The Company recorded the new broadband license at its estimated accounting cost basis of approximately $0.1 million. In\nconnection with receiving the broadband license, the Company disposed of a de minimis amount related to the value ascribed to the narrowband license it relinquished to the FCC for the same 1 county. The total carrying value of the narrowband\nlicense included the cost to acquire the original narrowband license, Anti-Windfall Payments paid to cover the shortfall in this county and the clearing costs. The Company did not have any exchanges for the three months ended September 30, 2024.\nThe Company recorded a gain on disposal of intangible assets of $0.1 million for the six months ended September 30, 2024.\nDuring the six months ended September 30, 2023, the Company was granted by the FCC, broadband licenses for 14 counties. The Company recorded the new broadband licenses at their estimated accounting cost basis of approximately $24.1 million.\nIn connection with receiving the broadband licenses, the Company disposed of $4.8 million, related to the value ascribed to the narrowband licenses it relinquished to the FCC for the same 14 counties. The total carrying value of narrowband licenses\nincluded the cost to acquire the original narrowband licenses, Anti-Windfall Payments paid to cover the shortfall in each county and the clearing costs. As a result of the exchange of narrowband licenses for broadband licenses, the Company recorded a\ngain on disposal of intangible assets of $8.5 million and $19.3 million for the three and six months ended September 30, 2023, respectively.\nBroadband License Sale\nDuring the quarter ended September 30, 2023, the Company transferred to SDG&E the San Diego County broadband license for total cumulative payments of $44.0 million net of delivery delay adjustments of $1.1 million. As a result, the Company\nrecognized a reduction in intangible assets of $31.8 million and recorded a $7.3 million gain on sale of intangible assets on the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nAs part of the SDG&E Agreement, SDG&E has an option to pursue additional spectrum with the Company. In accordance with ASC 606, the Company recorded a $4.9 million deferred gain on sale of intangible assets on the Company’s Consolidated\nBalance Sheets as of September 30, 2024, related to this option, which expires in September 2028.\n14\nTable of Contents\n5. Related Party Transactions\nRefer to the Company’s 2024 Annual Report for a more complete description of the nature of its related party transactions prior to March 31, 2024. During the three and six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company did not have any\nrelated party transactions.\n6. Leases\nAll the leases in which the Company is the lessee comprised corporate office space and tower space. The Company is obligated under certain lease agreements for office space with lease terms expiring on various dates from October 31, 2024 through\nJanuary 31, 2029, which includes lease extensions for its corporate headquarters ranging from three to ten years. The Company entered into multiple lease agreements for tower space. The lease expiration dates range from November 30, 2024 to\nSeptember 3, 2031.\nSubstantially all of the Company’s leases are classified as operating leases. Operating lease agreements are required to be recognized on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets as right of use (“ROU”) assets and corresponding lease liabilities.\nROU assets include any prepaid lease payments and exclude any lease incentives and initial direct costs incurred. Lease expense for minimum lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The lease terms may include\noptions to extend or terminate the lease if it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise that option.\nWeighted-average remaining lease term and incremental borrowing rate for the Company’s operating leases are as follows:\nSix months ended September 30,\n2024 2023\nWeighted average term - operating lease liabilities 3.55 years 2.65 years\nWeighted average incremental borrowing rate - operating lease liabilities 9% 12%\nThe following table presents total lease cost for the three and six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (in thousands):\nThree months ended September 30, Six months ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nLease cost\nOperating lease cost $ 485 $ 471 $ 986 $ 978\nShort term lease cost — — — —\nTotal lease cost* $ 485 $ 471 $ 986 $ 978\n* Total lease cost is included in general and administrative expenses on the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nThe following table presents supplemental balance sheet information as of September 30, 2024 and March 31, 2024 (in thousands):\nSeptember 30, 2024 March 31, 2024\nNon-current assets - right of use assets, net $ 4,987 $ 4,432\nCurrent liabilities - operating lease liabilities $ 1,806 $ 1,850\nNon-current liabilities - operating lease liabilities $ 3,845 $ 3,446\n15\nTable of Contents\nFuture minimum payments under existing non-cancelable leases for office and tower spaces (exclusive of real estate tax, utilities, maintenance and other costs borne by the Company) for the remaining terms of the leases following the six months\nended September 30, 2024, are as follows (in thousands):\nOperating\nFiscal Year Leases\n2025 (excluding the six months ended September 30, 2024) $ 1,139\n2026 1,880\n2027 1,478\n2028 1,142\n2029 586\nAfter 2029 265\nTotal future minimum lease payments 6,490\nAmount representing interest (839)\nPresent value of net future minimum lease payments $ 5,651\n7. Income Taxes\nThe Company used a discrete effective tax rate method to calculate taxes for the three and six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, which were a result of its inability to use some portion of its federal and state net operating losses (“NOLs”)\ncarryforwards against the deferred tax liability created by the amortization of indefinite-lived intangible assets and the change in the state effective tax rate. The Company determined that applying an estimate of the annual effective tax rate would not\nprovide a reasonable estimate as small changes in estimated “ordinary” loss could result in significant changes in the estimated annual effective tax rate. Accordingly, for the three and six months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded a\ntotal tax expense of $0.2 million and $1.5 million, respectively. For the three and six months ended September 30, 2023, the Company recorded a total tax expense of $0.6 million and $0.4 million, respectively. The effective income tax rates for the\nthree months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 26.6% and 25.6%, respectively. The increase in the effective tax rate was the result of higher state effective tax rate due to taxable income related to customer milestone payments.\nThe Company’s NOLs generated after March 31, 2018 may be used as an indefinite-lived asset to offset its deferred tax liability but are limited to 80% of future taxable income. The deferred tax liabilities as of September 30, 2024 are approximately\n$3.4 million for federal and $4.3 million for state. The deferred tax liabilities as of March 31, 2024 were approximately $3.1 million for federal and $3.2 million for state.\n8. Stockholders’ Equity\nThe Company adopted a new equity-based compensation plan known as the Anterix Inc. 2023 Stock Plan on August 8. 2023 (the “Effective Date”), which was amended on August 6, 2024 to increase the number of shares available thereunder by\n1,100,000 shares (as amended, the “2023 Stock Plan”). The 2023 Stock Plan permits the Company to grant equity compensation awards to employees, consultants and non-employee directors of the Company. As of the Effective Date, no additional\nawards may be granted under the Anterix Inc. 2014 Stock Plan (the “2014 Stock Plan”). The 2023 Stock Plan authorizes 1,350,000 shares of common stock of the Company (“Shares”) for grant. Additionally, 388,151 Shares remaining for grant under\nthe 2014 Stock Plan immediately prior to the Effective Date, Shares subject to outstanding stock awards granted under the 2014 Stock Plan that, following the Effective Date, expire or are terminated or cancelled without having been exercised or\nsettled in full, and Shares acquired pursuant to an award subject to forfeiture or repurchase that are forfeited or repurchased by the Company for an amount not greater than the recipient’s purchase price, are issuable under the 2023 Stock Plan. As of\nSeptember 30, 2024, under the 2023 Stock Plan, 1,348,107 shares are available for future issuance of which up to 112,500 shares which may be granted upon meeting certain performance levels above 100% for performance stock unit awards.\nDuring the six months ended September 30, 2024 and the year ended March 31, 2024, a total of 227,834 and 266,539 shares, respectively, were issued in connection with the vesting, conversion and or exercise of grants under the 2014 Stock Plan and\nthe 2023 Stock Plan.\n16\nTable of Contents\nCumulative Spectrum Proceeds Monetized\nThe performance-based restricted units were to vest on a determination date of June 24, 2024 (“Determination Date”), based on the Cumulative Spectrum Proceeds Monetized (“CSPM”) metric over a four-year measurement period commencing on\nJune 24, 2020, with 15,025 units vesting if the minimum CSPM level is achieved, 30,049 units vesting if the target CSPM metric is achieved and up to 60,098 vesting if the maximum CSPM metric is achieved. Due to the timing of the execution of the\nOncor Agreement, the Company entered into an amendment agreement, effectively extending the Determination Date to June 27, 2024. The amendment resulted in 15,800 shares vesting based on the CSPM level achieved.\nShare Repurchase Program\nIn September 2023, the Board authorized the 2023 Share Repurchase Program (the “2023 Share Repurchase Program”) pursuant to which the Company may repurchase up to $250.0 million of the Company’s common stock on or before September 21,\n2026. The Company may repurchase shares of its common stock via the open market and/or privately negotiated transactions. Repurchases will be made in accordance with applicable securities laws and may be effected pursuant to Rule 10b5-1 trading\nplans. The manner, timing and amount of any share repurchases will be determined by the Company based on a variety of factors, including proceeds from customer contracts, the timing of which is unpredictable, as well as general business and market\nconditions, the Company’s capital position, and other strategic considerations. The 2023 Share Repurchase Program does not obligate the Company to repurchase any particular amount of its common stock.\nThe Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, which was enacted into law on August 16, 2022, imposed a nondeductible 1% excise tax on the net value of certain stock repurchases made after December 31, 2022. Excise tax accrued for the six months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 was approximately $0.1 million.\nThe following table presents the share repurchase activity for the three and six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (in thousands, except per share data):\nThree months ended September 30, Six months ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nNumber of shares repurchased and retired — 333 63 333\nAverage price paid per share* $ — $ 32.69 $ 32.47 $ 32.69\nTotal cost to repurchase $ — $ 10,735 $ 2,027 $ 10,735\n* Average price paid per share includes costs associated with the repurchases.\nAs of September 30, 2024, $234.0 million is remaining under the share repurchase program.\n9. Net Income (Loss) Per Share of Common Stock\nBasic net income (loss) per common share is calculated by dividing the net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period, without consideration for potentially\ndilutive securities. For purposes of the diluted net income (loss) per share calculation, stock options and restricted stock units and awards are considered to be potentially dilutive securities. Diluted earnings per share is computed using the treasury\nstock method.\n17\nTable of Contents\nThe following table reconciles net income (loss) and weighted-average common shares used to compute basic and diluted net income (loss) per share:\nThree months ended September 30, Six months ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nNet (loss) income: $ (12,766) $ 2,073 $ (28,290) $ (45)\nWeighted-average common shares:\nBasic weighted-average shares 18,586,075 18,921,126 18,531,169 18,935,929\nAdd: dilutive effect of stock options and restricted stock units — 188,268 — —\nDiluted weighted-average common shares 18,586,075 19,109,394 18,531,169 18,935,929\nFor the three and six months ended September 30, 2024 there were 239,688 and 259,649 potentially dilutive stock options and restricted stock units outstanding, respectively, excluded from the calculation of diluted weighted-average shares as their\neffects are anti-dilutive because the Company reported a net loss. For the three months ended September 30, 2023, there were 1,176,107 stock options and restricted stock units outstanding, excluded from the calculation of diluted weighted-average\nshares because the effect was anti-dilutive. For the six months ended September 30, 2023, there were 193,437 potentially dilutive stock options and restricted stock units outstanding, excluded from the calculation of diluted weighted-average shares as\ntheir effects are antidilutive because the Company reported a net loss for the six months ended September 30, 2023.\n10. Contingencies and Guaranty\nContingent Liabilities\nSDG&E Refund Obligations\nIn February 2021, the Company entered into an agreement with SDG&E, San Diego Gas & Electric Company, a subsidiary of Sempra Energy (“SDG&E”), to sell 900 MHz Broadband Spectrum throughout SDG&E’s California service territory,\nincluding San Diego and Imperial Counties and portions of Orange County (the “SDG&E Agreement,”), for a total payment of $50.0 million. The total payment of $50.0 million is comprised of an initial payment of $20.0 million received in February\n2021 and the remaining payments which are due as the Company delivers the relevant cleared 900 MHz Broadband Spectrum and the associated broadband licenses to SDG&E. As the Company is required to refund payments it has received from\nSDG&E in the event of termination or non-delivery of the specific county’s full 900 MHz Broadband Spectrum, it recorded the initial payments as contingent liability on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets. A reduction in the contingent\nliability and a gain or loss on the sale of spectrum will be recognized for each county once the Company delivers the full cleared 900 MHz Broadband Spectrum and the associated broadband license(s) to SDG&E.\nIn September 2022, the Company transferred to SDG&E 1.4 x 1.4 cleared 900 MHz Broadband Spectrum and the associated broadband license related to Imperial County and received a milestone payment of $0.2 million. In September 2023, the\nCompany transferred to SDG&E the San Diego County broadband license and received a milestone payment of $25.2 million net of delivery delay adjustments of $1.1 million. In December 2023, the Company transferred to SDG&E the remainder of\nthe cleared 900 MHz Broadband Spectrum and the associated broadband license related to Imperial County and received a milestone payment of $0.2 million. This resulted in the recognition of a gain on the sale of spectrum and derecognition of the\ncontingent liability associated with San Diego County and Imperial County. See Note 4 Intangible Assets for further discussion on the sale of intangible assets.\nSubsequent to the derecognition of the contingent liability related to the delivery of San Diego County and Imperial County licenses, the remaining contingent liability related to SDG&E of $1.0 million for Orange County is classified as a short-term\nliability due to the expected timing of delivery.\nLCRA Refund Obligation\nIn April 2023, the Company entered into the LCRA Agreement for a total payment of $30.0 million, to be paid through fiscal year 2026 pursuant to the terms of the agreement. In December 2023, the Company received $15.0 million in milestone\npayments, of which $7.5 million was deposited in an escrow account. The remaining payments are due as the Company delivers the relevant cleared 900 MHz Broadband Spectrum and the associated broadband licenses to LCRA. As the Company is\nrequired to refund the deposit it has received from LCRA in the\n18\nTable of Contents\nevent of termination or non-delivery of the specific county’s full cleared 900 MHz Broadband Spectrum, it recorded the initial payments as contingent liability on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets. A reduction in the contingent liability and\na gain or loss on the sale of spectrum will be recognized for each county once the Company delivers the full cleared 900 MHz Broadband Spectrum and the associated broadband license(s) to LCRA. See Note 3 Escrow Deposits for further discussion\non the escrow deposit.\nOncor Refund Obligation\nIn June 2024, the Company entered into the Oncor Agreement for a total payment of $102.5 million, to be paid through fiscal year 2026 pursuant to the terms of the agreement. In June 2024, the Company received an initial payment of $10.0 million\nwith remaining payments due to the Company for each county, at closing. The timing and rights to milestone payments could vary as 900 MHz broadband licenses are granted by the FCC, broadband licenses are assigned to Oncor and incumbents are\ncleared by the Company. As the Company is required to refund the deposit it has received from Oncor in the event of termination or non-delivery of the specific county’s full cleared 900 MHz Broadband Spectrum, it recorded the initial payment as\ncontingent liability on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets. A reduction in the contingent liability and a gain or loss on the sale of spectrum will be recognized for each county once the Company delivers the full cleared 900 MHz Broadband\nSpectrum and the associated broadband license(s) to Oncor.\nXcel Energy Guaranty\nIn October 2022, the Company entered into an agreement with Xcel Energy Services Inc. (“Xcel Energy”) providing Xcel Energy dedicated long-term usage of the Company’s 900 MHz Broadband Spectrum for a term of 20 years throughout Xcel\nEnergy’s service territory in eight states (the “Xcel Energy Agreement”). In connection with Xcel Energy Agreement, the Company entered into a guaranty agreement, under which the Company guaranteed the delivery of the relevant 900 MHz\nBroadband Spectrum and the associated broadband licenses in Xcel Energy’s service territory in eight states along with other commercial obligations. In the event of default or non-delivery of the specific territory’s 900 MHz Broadband Spectrum, the\nCompany is required to refund payments it has received. In addition, to the extent Anterix has performed any obligations, the Company’s liability and remaining obligations under the Xcel Energy Agreement will extend only to the remaining\nunperformed obligations. The Company recorded $67.1 million in deferred revenue in connection with the prepayments received as of September 30, 2024. The Company commenced delivery of the relevant cleared 900 MHz Broadband Spectrum and\nthe associated broadband leases in the first quarter of fiscal year 2024 and will continue through 2029. The revenue recognized for the three and six months ended September 30, 2024, was approximately $0.8 million and $1.6 million, respectively. As\nof September 30, 2024, the maximum potential liability of future undiscounted payments under this agreement is approximately $63.6 million.\nLitigation\nFrom time to time, the Company may be involved in litigation that arises from the ordinary operations of the business, such as contractual or employment disputes or other general actions. The Company is not involved in any material legal proceedings\nat this time.\nPandemic and Macroeconomic Conditions\nRecent macroeconomic events, inflation and geopolitical matters, have increased operating costs or resulted in delays in customer contracting or impacted the availability of equipment necessary for the deployment of the Company’s target customers’\nplanned PLTE projects. The Company continues to closely monitor these risks. Although difficult to quantify, the Company believes the current macroeconomic environment, including inflation, may have an adverse effect on the Company’s target\ncustomers’ businesses, which may harm the Company’s commercialization efforts and negatively impact the Company’s revenues and liquidity. If the Company is not able to control its operating costs or if the Company’s commercialization efforts are\nslowed or negatively impacted, continued periods of high inflation could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, operating results and financial condition.\n11. Concentrations of Credit Risk and Significant Customers\nFinancial instruments which potentially expose the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents. The Company places its cash and temporary cash investments with financial institutions\n19\nTable of Contents\nfor which credit loss is not anticipated. As of September 30, 2024 and March 31, 2024, substantially all of the Company’s cash balance exceeded the federally insured limits. For the six months ended September 30, 2024 each of the Company’s\ncustomers accounted for greater than 10% of total revenue.\nAs of September 30, 2024 and March 31, 2024, the Company does not have an outstanding accounts receivable balance.\n12. Subsequent Events\nChief Executive Officer Transition\nOn October 8, 2024, the Company announced the appointment of Scott Lang as President and Chief Executive Officer, to succeed Robert Schwartz effective November 1, 2024. Mr. Schwartz stepped down from the President and Chief Executive\nOfficer role after a decade of leadership and provided support to Mr. Lang and served as an advisor to the Board to assist in a successful leadership transition (the “CEO Transition”). During this CEO Transition and through November 1, 2024 (the\n“Separation Date”), Mr. Schwartz continued to receive his then current base salary and was eligible for any benefits he was entitled to receive as an executive of the Company. In connection with the CEO Transition, Mr. Schwartz also resigned from\nhis service on the Company’s Board.\nIn connection with his resignation, the Company negotiated a Transition and Separation Agreement with Mr. Schwartz (the “Transition Agreement”), which provides the following benefits (subject to effectiveness and the terms and conditions of the\nTransition Agreement), (i) two times the sum of his annualized salary and target bonus, for an aggregate amount of approximately $2.2 million, (ii) a pro-rata target bonus for fiscal year 2025, less amount previously paid for fiscal year 2025, for an\naggregate amount of approximately $0.2 million and (iii) a subsidized COBRA continuation coverage for 18 months.\nAdditionally, the 68,788 unvested time-based awards and 33,417 performance-based awards accelerated and vested. Mr. Schwartz was also granted an option exercise period extension for each of his outstanding stock option awards equal to the lessor\nof two years from the Separation Date or the applicable expiration term of the stock option awards.\nThe foregoing severance benefits will be offered under the Transition Agreement in exchange for a release and waiver of claims and continued obligations related to the Company’s proprietary information. Further, pursuant to the Transition\nAgreement, for a period of 24 months following the Separation Date, Mr. Schwartz agreed to certain non-solicitation provisions relating to the Company’s employees, the Company’s business and current or potential customers, and agreed to not invest,\ncounsel, advise or otherwise be engaged or be employed by, a competitor of the Company as defined in the Transition Agreement.\nFurther, as part of the CEO Transition, the Board also designated Mr. Lang as the Company’s principal executive officer for purposes of the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Due to his service as an executive of the\nCompany, effective as of the date of his appointment, Mr. Lang resigned from serving on the Board’s Audit Committee and Nominating and Governance Committee.\n20\nTable of Contents\nItem 2: Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThis discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations of Anterix Inc. (“Anterix,” the “Company”, “we”, “us”, or “our”) should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and notes thereto included in this Quarterly\nReport on Form 10-Q (this “Quarterly Report”) and the audited financial statements and notes thereto included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended March 31, 2024, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on\nJune 26, 2024 (the “2024 Annual Report”). In addition to historical information, this discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties, and assumptions. Our actual results may differ materially from those\nanticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors including, but not limited to, those identified or referenced in “Item 1A—Risk Factors” in Part II of this Quarterly Report. As a result, investors are urged not to place undue\nreliance on any forward-looking statements. Except as required by applicable law, we do not undertake any obligation to update forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances occurring after the date of this Quarterly Report.\nOverview\nAnterix Inc (“Anterix,” “we,” “our,” or the “Company”) is the utility industry’s partner, empowering enhanced visibility, control and security for a modern grid. Our vision is to deliver secure, scalable solutions enabled by private wireless broadband\nconnectivity, for the benefit of utilities and the communities that they serve. As the largest holder of licensed spectrum in the 900 MHz band (896-901/935-940 MHz) throughout the contiguous United States, plus Hawaii, Alaska and Puerto Rico, we are\nuniquely positioned to deliver solutions that support secure, resilient and customer-controlled operations. We are focused on commercializing our spectrum assets and expanding the benefits and solutions we offer to enable our targeted utility and critical\ninfrastructure customers to deploy private broadband networks.\nRefer to our 2024 Annual Report for a more complete description of the nature of our business, including details regarding the process and costs to secure our broadband licenses.\nBusiness Developments\nIn June 2024, we entered into a license purchase agreement with Oncor Electric Delivery Company LLC (“Oncor”) for total estimated consideration of $102.5 million under which Oncor will purchase 900 MHz spectrum licenses covering 95 counties to\ndeploy a private wireless broadband network in its transmission and distribution service area (the “Oncor Agreement”). The total payment of $102.5 million comprises an initial payment of $10.0 million received in June 2024 and remaining payments that are\ndue to us for each county, at closing. The timing and rights to milestone payments could vary as 900 MHz broadband licenses are granted by the FCC, broadband licenses are assigned to Oncor, and incumbents are cleared by us. Oncor operates more than\n143,000 circuit miles of transmission and distribution lines in Texas, delivering electricity to more than four million homes and businesses across a service territory that has an estimated population of approximately 13 million people.\n21\nTable of Contents\nResults of Operations\nA discussion and analysis of the primary factors contributing to our results of operations are presented below. The following tables summarize our results of operations and financial data for the three and six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. The\nfollowing data should be read in conjunction with our Notes to the Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements contained within this Quarterly Report.\nThree months ended September 30, Six months ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nSpectrum revenue $ 1,551 $ 1,052 $ 3,076 $ 1,660\nOperating expenses\nGeneral and administrative 11,397 11,905 24,248 23,578\nSales and support 1,357 1,310 3,207 2,585\nProduct development 1,776 1,147 3,526 2,216\nDepreciation and amortization 151 209 330 455\nOperating expenses 14,681 14,571 31,311 28,834\nGain on disposal of intangible assets, net — (8,513) (93) (19,298)\nGain on sale of intangible assets, net — (7,332) — (7,332)\nLoss from disposal of long-lived assets, net — 67 — 36\n(Loss) gain from operations (13,130) 2,259 (28,142) (580)\nInterest income 585 396 1,279 782\nOther income 9 63 25 158\n(Loss) income before income taxes (12,536) 2,718 (26,838) 360\nIncome tax expense 230 645 1,452 405\nNet (loss) income $ (12,766) $ 2,073 $ (28,290) $ (45)\nSummary\nOur net loss for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased by approximately $14.8 million to $12.8 million net loss from $2.1 million net income for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in net loss was primarily due to the\nfollowing:\n• Spectrum revenues increased by $0.5 million, or 47%, to $1.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from $1.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in our spectrum revenue was primarily\nattributable to revenue recognized in connection with our agreement with Xcel Energy of approximately $0.4 million and our agreement with Evergy of approximately $0.1 million.\n• Product development expenses increased by $0.6 million, or 55%, to $1.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from $1.1 million for three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase primarily resulted from $0.4 million\nhigher headcount related costs and $0.2 million in IT related costs.\n• Gain on disposal of intangible assets, net decreased by $8.5 million, or 100%, to $0.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from $8.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. During the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 we did not exchange our narrowband licenses for broadband licenses. During the three months ended September 30, 2023, we exchanged our narrowband licenses for broadband licenses in 5 counties. In connection with the\nexchange, we recorded an estimated accounting cost basis of $10.8 million for the new broadband licenses and disposed of $2.3 million related to the value ascribed to the narrowband licenses we relinquished to the FCC for those same 5 counties.\nAs a result, we recorded a $8.5 million non-monetary gain on disposal of the intangible assets on our Consolidated Statements of Operations.\n• Interest income increased by $0.2 million, or 48%, to $0.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from $0.4 million for three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily attributable to a higher average cash\nbalance during the period.\n22\nTable of Contents\n• Income tax expense decreased by $0.4 million, or 64%, to $0.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from $0.6 million for three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily attributable to prior year higher state\neffective tax rate due to taxable income related to the sale of intangible assets.\nOur net loss for the six months ended September 30, 2024 increased by approximately $28.2 million to $28.3 million from $45 thousand for the six months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in net loss was primarily due to the following:\n• Spectrum revenues increased by $1.4 million, or 85%, to $3.1 million for the six months ended September 30, 2024 from $1.7 million for the six months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in our spectrum revenue was primarily attributable to\nrevenue recognized in connection with our agreement with Xcel Energy of approximately $1.2 million and our agreement with Evergy of approximately $0.2 million.\n• Product development expenses increased by $1.3 million, or 59%, to $3.5 million for the six months ended September 30, 2024 from $2.2 million for six months ended September 30, 2023. The increase primarily resulted from $0.5 million higher\ncontract consulting fees, $0.4 million in higher headcount related costs and $0.4 million in IT related costs.\n• Sales and support expense increased by $0.6 million, or 24%, to $3.2 million for the six months ended September 30, 2024 from $2.6 million for six months ended September 30, 2023. The increase primarily resulted from $0.5 million higher\nheadcount related costs, $0.3 million fees related to the Oncor Agreement, partially offset by $0.2 million in lower contract consulting fees.\n• Gain on disposal of intangible assets, net decreased by $19.2 million, or 100%, to $0.1 million for the six months ended September 30, 2024 from $19.3 million for the six months ended September 30, 2023. During the six months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 we exchanged our narrowband license for a broadband license in 1 county. In connection with the exchange, we recorded an estimated accounting cost basis of $0.1 million for the new broadband license and relinquished to the\nFCC narrowband license for the same 1 county with de minimis value. As a result, we recorded a $0.1 million non-monetary gain on disposal of the intangible assets on our Consolidated Statements of Operations. During the six months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023, we exchanged our narrowband licenses for broadband licenses in 14 counties. In connection with the exchange, we recorded an estimated accounting cost basis of $24.1 million for the new broadband licenses and disposed of\n$4.8 million related to the value ascribed to the narrowband licenses we relinquished to the FCC for those same 14 counties. As a result, we recorded a $19.3 million non-monetary gain on disposal of the intangible assets on our Consolidated\nStatements of Operations.\n• Interest income increased by $0.5 million, or 64%, to $1.3 million for the six months ended September 30, 2024 from $0.8 million for six months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily attributable to a higher average cash balance\nduring the period.\n• Income tax expense increased by $1.0 million, or 259%, to $1.5 million for the six months ended September 30, 2024 from $0.4 million for six months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily attributable to higher state effective tax\nrate due to taxable income related to customer milestone payments.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur principal source of liquidity is our cash and cash equivalents generated from customer contract proceeds. At September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of $43.1 million.\nWe believe our cash and cash equivalents on hand, along with contracted proceeds from customers, will be sufficient to meet our financial obligations through at least 12 months from the date of this Quarterly Report. As noted above, our future capital\nrequirements will depend on a number of factors, including among others, future customer contracts, the costs and timing of our spectrum retuning activities, spectrum acquisitions and the Anti-Windfall Payments to the U.S. Treasury, our operating activities,\nany cash proceeds we generate through our commercialization activities, our ability to timely deliver broadband licenses to our customers in accordance with our contractual obligations and our obligation to refund payments or pay penalties if we do not meet\nour commercial obligations. We deploy this capital at our determined pace based on several key ongoing factors, including customer demand, market opportunity, and offsetting income from spectrum leases. We cannot reasonably estimate any potential\nimpact to our results of operations, commercialization efforts and financial condition arising from changes to our macroeconomic, legal or regulatory environment, including potential legislation affecting the energy or utility industry, the telecommunications\nenvironment, or supply chains. We are actively managing our business to maintain our cash flow and believe that we currently have adequate liquidity. To implement our business\n23\nTable of Contents\nplans and initiatives, however, we may need to raise additional capital. We cannot predict with certainty the exact amount or timing for any future capital raises. See “Risk Factors” in Item 1A of Part II of this Quarterly Report for a reference to the risks and\nuncertainties that could cause our costs to be more than we currently anticipate and/or our revenue and operating results to be lower than we currently anticipate. If required, we intend to raise additional capital through debt or equity financing or through\nsome other financing arrangement. However, we cannot be sure that additional financing will be available if and when needed, or that, if available, we can obtain financing on terms favorable to our stockholders and to us. Any failure to obtain financing when\nrequired will have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition and liquidity.\nCash Flows from Operating, Investing and Financing Activities\nSix months ended September 30,\n(in thousands) 2024 2023\n(Unaudited) (Unaudited)\nNet cash (used in) provided by operating activities $ (5,009) $ 2,213\nNet cash (used in) provided by investing activities $ (10,945) $ 14,889\nNet cash used in financing activities $ (1,433) $ (11,750)\nNet cash (used in) provided by operating activities\nOur principal source of cash provided by operating activities is our customer contract proceeds in the form of advanced payments. For spectrum revenue agreements, we record these advanced payments as deferred revenue on our Consolidated Balance\nSheets and recognize revenue over the term of the lease, which is typically 20 to 30 years. For spectrum sale agreements, we record advanced payments as a contingent liability on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and derecognize this liability upon closing of\nthe sale along with recording a gain or loss on sale. In addition, our cash flows reflect a non-cash gain or loss on disposal of intangible assets for the difference in cost basis as we exchange narrowband licenses for broadband licenses. We expect net cash\nprovided by (used in) operating activities to be affected by the progress on our customer agreements as well as changes in other operating assets and liabilities. The following represents our changes in net cash (used in) provided by operating activities for the\nsix months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.\nNet cash used in operating activities was approximately $5.0 million for the six months ended September 30, 2024. The net cash used in operating activities for the six months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to the following:\n• $28.3 million decrease related to our operating loss, which includes $10.2 million of non-cash items (refer to the Results of Operations);\n• $1.5 million decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses primarily due to annual bonus payments;\n• $4.4 million increase in deferred revenue due to $7.5 million cash proceeds from Ameren Corporation related to our 900 MHz Broadband Spectrum contract offset by $3.1 million in revenue recognition in connection with the delivery of cleared 900\nMHz Broadband Spectrum; and\n• $10.0 million increase in contingent liability related to the Oncor Agreement.\nNet cash provided by operating activities was approximately $2.2 million for the six months ended September 30, 2023. The net cash provided by operating activities for the six months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to the following:\n• $45 thousand decrease related to our operating loss, which includes $17.1 million of non-cash items (refer to the Results of Operations); and\n• $19.5 million increase in deferred revenue due to $21.2 million cash proceeds from our 900 MHz Broadband Spectrum customer prepayments offset by $1.7 million in revenue recognition in connection with the delivery of cleared 900 MHz\nBroadband Spectrum.\nNet cash (used in) provided by investing activities\nOur principal outflow of cash used in investing activities is our purchases of intangible assets, including refundable deposits, retuning costs and swaps, which represent our spectrum clearing efforts as we work toward the conversion from narrowband to\nbroadband spectrum. The purchases of intangible assets may be offset by current period cash proceeds from the sale of intangible assets, with a potential non-cash derecognition of the contingent liability for any proceeds received and recognized in operating\nactivities in a prior period. We expect net cash provided by (used in) investing activities to be affected by the timing of our spectrum clearing efforts and the closing of our sale transactions and the related transfer of\n24\nTable of Contents\nbroadband licenses. The following represents our changes in net cash (used in) provided by investing activities for the six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $10.9 million for the six months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to net cash provided by investing activities of $14.9 million for the six months ended September 30, 2023. For the six months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024, net cash used in investing activities was primarily from $10.9 million payments made to acquire, swap or retune wireless licenses in markets across the United States. For the six months ended September 30, 2023, net cash provided by\ninvesting activities was primarily from $25.2 million sale of spectrum related to our transfer of the San Diego County broadband license to SDG&E partially offset by $10.1 million payments made to acquire, swap or retune wireless licenses in markets\nacross the United States.\nNet cash used in financing activities\nOur principal outflow of cash used in financing activities is a result of our equity transactions, including repurchases of common stock and taxes and fees associated with the issuance of restricted stock awards, offset by proceeds from stock options exercised\nin the period. We expect net cash used in financing activities to be affected by the timing of future equity transactions including the timing of our repurchases of common stock. The following represents our changes in net cash used in financing activities for\nthe six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.\nNet cash used in financing activities was $1.4 million and $11.8 million for the six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. For the six months ended September 30, 2024, net cash used in financing activities was primarily for the\nrepurchases of common stock of $2.0 million, payments of withholding tax on net issuance of restricted stock of $1.4 million, partially offset by the proceeds from stock option exercises of $2.0 million. For the six months ended September 30, 2023, net cash\nused in financing activities was from the repurchase of common stock of $10.7 million and payments of withholding tax on net issuance of restricted stock of $1.0 million.\nMaterial Cash Requirements\nOur future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including: costs and time related to the commercialization of our spectrum assets; and our ability to sign customer contracts and generate revenues from the license or transfer of any broadband\nlicenses we secure; our ability to timely deliver broadband licenses and clear spectrum to our customers in accordance with our contractual obligation; any requirement to refund payments or pay penalties if we do not satisfy our contractual obligations; the\ntimeline and costs to acquire broadband licenses pursuant to the Report and Order, including the costs to acquire additional spectrum, the costs related to retuning, or swapping spectrum held by 900 MHz site-based licensees in the broadband segment that is\nrequired under section 90.621(b) to be protected by a broadband licensee with a base station at any location within the county, or any 900 MHz geographic-based SMR licensee in the broadband segment whose license area completely or partially overlaps the\ncounty, and the costs of paying Anti-Windfall Payments to the U.S. Treasury.\nWe are obligated under certain lease agreements for office space with lease terms expiring on various dates from October 31, 2024 through January 31, 2029, which includes a three to ten-year lease extension for our corporate headquarters. We have also\nentered into multiple lease agreements for tower space related to our spectrum holdings. The lease expiration dates range from November 30, 2024 to September 3, 2031. Total estimated payments for these lease agreements are approximately $6.5 million\n(exclusive of real estate taxes, utilities, maintenance and other costs borne by us). We also have an obligation to clear the tower site locations, for which we recorded an asset retirement obligation (the “ARO”). Total estimated payments as a result of the ARO\nis approximately $0.7 million. In addition to the lease payments and ARO for our tower site locations, we entered into agreements with several third parties in multiple U.S. markets to acquire, retune or swap wireless licenses for cash consideration (“deals”).\nAs of September 30, 2024, our total estimated future payments for these agreements with incumbents are approximately $9.4 million.\nXcel Energy Guaranty\nIn October 2022, we entered into an agreement with Xcel Energy Services Inc. (“Xcel Energy”) providing Xcel Energy dedicated long-term usage of our 900 MHz Broadband Spectrum for a term of 20 years throughout Xcel Energy’s service territory in eight\nstates (the “Xcel Energy Agreement”). In connection with Xcel Energy Agreement, we entered into a guaranty agreement, under which we guaranteed the delivery of the relevant 900 MHz Broadband Spectrum and the associated broadband licenses in Xcel\nEnergy’s service territory in eight states along with other commercial obligations. In the event of default or non-delivery of the specific territory’s 900 MHz Broadband Spectrum, we are required to refund payments we have received. In addition, to the extent\nwe have performed any obligations, our liability and remaining obligations under the Xcel Energy Agreement will extend only to the remaining unperformed obligations. We recorded\n25\nTable of Contents\n$67.1 million in deferred revenue in connection with the prepayments received as of September 30, 2024. We commenced delivery of the relevant cleared 900 MHz Broadband Spectrum and the associated broadband leases in the first quarter of fiscal year\n2024 and will continue through 2029. The revenue recognized for the three and six months ended September 30, 2024, was approximately $0.8 million and $1.6 million, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, the maximum potential liability of future\nundiscounted payments under this agreement is approximately $63.6 million.\nShare Repurchase Program\nIn September 2023, our Board authorized the 2023 Share Repurchase Program (the “2023 Share Repurchase Program”) pursuant to which we may repurchase up to $250.0 million of our common stock on or before September 21, 2026. We may repurchase\nshares of our common stock via the open market and/or privately negotiated transactions. Repurchases will be made in accordance with applicable securities laws and may be effected pursuant to Rule 10b5-1 trading plans. The manner, timing and amount of\nany share repurchases will be determined by us based on a variety of factors, including proceeds from customer contracts, the timing of which is unpredictable, as well as general business and market conditions, our capital position, and other strategic\nconsiderations. The 2023 Share Repurchase Program does not obligate us to repurchase any particular amount of our common stock.\nThe Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, which was enacted into law on August 16, 2022, imposed a nondeductible 1% excise tax on the net value of certain stock repurchases made after December 31, 2022. Excise tax accrued for the six months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 was approximately $0.1 million.\nThe following table presents the share repurchase activity for the three and six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (in thousands, except per share data):\nThree months ended September 30, Six months ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nNumber of shares repurchased and retired — 333 63 333\nAverage price paid per share* $ — $ 32.69 $ 32.47 $ 32.69\nTotal cost to repurchase $ — $ 10,735 $ 2,027 $ 10,735\n* Average price paid per share includes costs associated with the repurchases.\nAs of September 30, 2024, $234.0 million is remaining under the share repurchase program.\nOff-balance sheet arrangements\nAs of September 30, 2024 and March 31, 2024, we did not have and do not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships that were established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in the rules\nand regulations of the SEC.\nItem 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\nInterest Rate Risk\nOur financial instruments consist of cash, cash equivalents, trade accounts receivable and accounts payable. We consider investments in highly liquid instruments purchased with original maturities of 90 days or less to be cash equivalents. Our primary\nexposure to market risk is interest income sensitivity, which is affected by changes in the general level of U.S. interest rates. However, because of the short-term nature of the highly liquid instruments in our portfolio, a 10% change in market interest rates\nwould not be expected to have a material impact on our financial condition and/or results of operations.\nForeign Currency Exchange Rate Fluctuations\nOur operations are based in the United States and, accordingly, all of our transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars. We are currently not exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency.\n26\nTable of Contents\nInflation Risk\nInflationary factors may adversely affect our operating results. As a result of recent increases in inflation, certain of our operating expenses have increased. Additionally, although difficult to quantify, we believe that the current macroeconomic environment,\nincluding inflation, could have an adverse effect on our target customers’ businesses, which may harm our commercialization efforts and negatively impact our revenues. Continued periods of high inflation could have a material adverse effect on our\nbusiness, operating results and financial condition if we are not able to control our operating costs or if our commercialization efforts are slowed or negatively impacted, continued periods of high inflation could have a material adverse effect on our business,\noperating results and financial condition.\nWe continue to monitor our market risk exposure, including any adverse impacts related to health pandemics or the current macroeconomic environment, which has resulted in significant market volatility.\nItem 4. Controls and Procedures\nDisclosure Controls and Procedures\nOur management, with the participation of our President and Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act) as of\nthe end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report. Based on that evaluation, our management, including our President and Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as\nof the end of such period.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nIn connection with the evaluation required by Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(d), our management, including our President and Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, concluded that no changes in our internal control over financial reporting\noccurred during the period covered by this report that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nInherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls\nOur management, including our President and Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, do not expect that our disclosure controls or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all error and all fraud. A control system, no\nmatter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system’s objectives will be met. The design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that the benefits of\ncontrols must be considered relative to their costs. Further, because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and\ninstances of fraud, if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Controls can also be circumvented by the\nindividual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance\nthat any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of controls to future periods are subject to risks. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes\nin conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures.\n27\nTable of Contents\nPART II – OTHER INFORMATION\nItem 1.

These documents\nare available on our website. Please note that we do not undertake any obligation to update these\nforward-looking statements.\nWith that, I will turn the call over to Scott.\nScott A. Lang\nCEO, President & Director\nGood morning, everyone, and thank you all for joining us today for our second quarter fiscal year 2025\nearnings call.\nToday marks a special milestone in my professional career as this is my first earnings call as the newly\nappointed President and CEO of Anterix. It is truly an honor to be leading this great organization, and\nI'm excited with all that lies ahead for the company. Since taking the helm in early October, I've enjoyed\ngetting to know our team and getting an in-depth appreciation for our company, our product and our\noffering. I've also had the pleasure of meeting with a number of investors and analysts, some new faces\nand some that I have worked with before as well as a range of current and future customers.\nOn today's call, I want to focus on two of the recurring questions I've been asked throughout these\nconversations, which I think will provide all of you with the picture of Anterix as I see the company and\nthe opportunity. The first question is, why am I excited to take this job? And the second is, why would the\nBoard choose me?\nLet's start with why I would take this job. Think about it. Put yourself in my shoes. I am taking over a\ncompany that has established itself as a preeminent technology solution for the utility sector. It has zero\ndebt, a great balance sheet, and expansive $3 billion pipeline of customer opportunities, a seasoned\nthought leadership position and an exceptionally talented and committed team, and we're just getting\nstarted.\nDig a little deeper, and it gets even more clear as to why I or anyone would want this job. First off, it's\nreally about our customers. They're going from the lab to actual deployments that are driving real results,\nCopyright © 2024 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 3\nANTERIX INC. FQ2 2025 EARNINGS CALL NOV 14, 2024\nvalidating our product offering. And they are becoming our greatest advocates as we witnessed again last\nweek at the Utility Broadband Alliance event.\nNext, it's about our spectrum asset. We have managed to enhance the value by making it 5G capable\nand have jointly filed with 9 other organizations a petition with the FCC to expand our offering from 3x3\nmegahertz to 5x5 megahertz.\nAnd regarding our market positioning, AMI became a movement that nearly touches every home and\nbusiness with advanced technology. It unlocked ways for utilities to deliver a better experience and more\nvalue to every customer in the United States.\nThere is a similar movement underway that we will look back on fueled by artificial intelligence and edge\ncomputing, that won't only touch every home and business, but also every device that controls, monitors\nor protects the flow of power across the United States. The powerful connectivity that Anterix provides\nwill enable this movement to happen. The totality of what I see is incredible. All of this with a market\ncapitalization that I believe is far below the value of what this company has achieved. The opportunities\nthat are in front of us to drive growth and enhance shareholder value are significant. It was an easy\ndecision for me to say yes to the Board.\nSo why me? Without sounding boastful, I believe I am uniquely qualified. I've been here before.\nI understand the complexities of working with the utility sector, but also recognize the incredible\nopportunities that this sector can deliver for our customers, for our partners, for our company and\nabsolutely for our shareholders. And I know how to run a company that is driving technology change. The\nexperiences and relationships that I have cultivated over my career have allowed me to step into this role\nwith a road map and a vision for success.\nI have been working around the energy and telecom space for over 30 years. During my tenure as CEO\nand Executive Chairman of Silver Spring Networks, I helped guide the development of the smart grid\nnetwork evolution for utilities and created deep, long-lasting relationships within the sector. Ultimately,\nthis led to successfully positioning Silver Spring as an innovative leader within the utility sector, placing\nadvanced wireless metering into more than 50 million homes and businesses across the country while\nworking with almost every utility in the nation. Silver Spring went public in 2013 and was subsequently\npurchased by Itron in 2018, with the technology still being used today.\nWe have moved from the smart meter to the smart grid. Anterix is perfectly positioned to enable this\nsmarter future. Just this week, the Wall Street Journal featured an article about the need for this smarter\nfuture and for me, highlighted the opportunity it presents for Anterix.\nBottom line, the reason I'm here is because I see significant opportunities for Anterix, for the utility sector\nand for our shareholders. As I outline my near-term priorities for the coming months, I want to share a\nfew key areas of focus. I have worked very closely with our sales team to understand the current position\nof our pipeline. It is incredible to think about the success we've had and yet recognize the amazing\nopportunity still in front of us.\nSo what is next? Turning to my top near-term priorities, first, we are going to be laser-focused on driving\nspectrum transactions. We are revisiting every element of our sales process. A key priority of mine is to\nexpand relationships with both existing and prospective customers. Our strong customer base represents\na powerful opportunity to advocate for our technology and enhance our brand visibility within the industry.\nNext, I've asked Tim to review our operating budget to identify opportunities for efficiencies and reduce\nour overall annual cash spend. We're then going to execute on these findings. And as we continue to focus\non the task of driving contracts and reducing spending where it makes sense, I see an opportunity to\nincrease our share buyback effort.\nWe have a robust buyback plan in place. I want to make sure that we pursue every opportunity to put that\nplan to work. At the current share price, I believe this is a great use of our contracted proceeds and can\nhelp drive significant shareholder value.\nCopyright © 2024 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 4\nANTERIX INC. FQ2 2025 EARNINGS CALL NOV 14, 2024\nBefore I wrap up, I want to share that these last 2 weeks alone confirmed everything I thought about\nthe company when I said yes to this opportunity. The UBBA Summit took place last week, where\nleading utilities and the industry ecosystem come together with a specific and valuable focus of sharing\nexperiences, use cases and plans to build private wireless broadband networks.\nThis year, Evergy, an Anterix customer, hosted this dynamic sold-out event, which took place in Kansas\nCity with over 600 participants in place, including representatives from more than 30 utilities and\nincreased C-level participation. To put it into perspective, the utilities that were in attendance represented\nmore than 60% of our spectrum value. The summit featured insightful discussions on the vital role of\nprivate networks with many of our customers sharing their journeys in adopting 900 megahertz private\nwireless broadband as the backbone of their network deployments. Our booth highlighted several mission-\ncritical use cases, reinforcing our leadership position in this space. The event was invaluable and provided\na platform for collaboration and innovation, setting the stage for our future growth.\nAnd earlier this week, I attended the Edison Electric Institute Financial Conference in Florida. It was\nawesome to be there and to visit with many of the utilities and people that I have worked with throughout\nmy career. In these conversations, we discussed how Anterix is perfectly suited to meet the challenge that\nthey now have in front of them to help them continue to deliver secure, reliable, cost-effective service for\nevery customer in the United States.\nAnd so when I said earlier that these events confirmed everything that I believe about this opportunity, it\nis these personal conversations that reinforce my excitement to be leading the Anterix team.\nWith that, I will turn over to Tim, and then we'll rejoin to share some closing remarks.\nTimothy A. Gray\nChief Financial Officer\nThanks, Scott. Before I begin, I want to share that I've had the opportunity to get to know Scott over\nthe course of the past few weeks, and I am truly looking forward to working with him as we execute on\nthe priorities that he outlined. It's also important to note that our balance sheet and our future incoming\nproceeds will continue to provide the opportunity for us to enhance shareholder value.\nTurning to our results, Anterix concluded its second quarter of fiscal year '25 in a strong financial position.\nWe detailed these results in our 10-Q, which was filed yesterday and is available on our website. I will\nspend a few moments here reviewing some of the key highlights from this quarter.\nWe ended our second quarter of fiscal year 2025 with more than $43 million in cash and no debt on our\nbalance sheet. We continue to strongly believe that being debt-free is a significant advantage for Anterix.\nIt is also important to note that we still have more than $168 million in contracted proceeds to be received\nover the next several years related to signed contracts with roughly $110 million to be received by the end\nof our fiscal 2026, which positions us to continue to return value to our shareholders.\nTurning to some of the priorities that Scott mentioned. With regards to our share repurchase program,\nwe will be pursuing additional opportunities to increase cash flow to fund additional buybacks in the near\nterm. One example of this is that our team is actively working with certain customers at their request to\ndeliver spectrum earlier than contractually required, which will help accelerate payment timing into this\nfiscal year.\nIn addition, we're also taking a hard look at our operating expenses to drive efficiencies. I expect to have\nmore to share on these initiatives on our next quarterly call. Let me conclude by reiterating that with the\ncash on our balance sheet and roughly $168 million in contracted payments to be received over the next\nseveral years, we're clearly in a solid financial position.\nWith that, I'll turn it back over to Scott.\nScott A. Lang\nCEO, President & Director\nCopyright © 2024 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 5\nANTERIX INC. FQ2 2025 EARNINGS CALL NOV 14, 2024\nThanks, Tim. With the right people, strong partnerships and innovative solutions, we are committed to\nsupporting our nation's utilities in their electric grid modernization efforts. We take great pride in our\naccomplishments to date and are excited about the opportunities that lie ahead. I look forward to sharing\nmore insights with you on our upcoming discussions.\nWith that, we'll now open the call to questions. Brian and Chris will also be joining Tim and I to provide\nadditional perspectives as well.\nOperator, please open the call for questions.\nCopyright © 2024 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 6\nANTERIX INC. FQ2 2025 EARNINGS CALL NOV 14, 2024\nQuestion and Answer\n....................................................................................................................................................................\nOperator\n[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from George Sutton of Craig-Hallum.\nGeorge Frederick Sutton\nCraig-Hallum Capital Group LLC, Research Division\nFirst, Scott, welcome. And in our intro call, one of the points you made, I thought was helpful, and I'd\nlike you to go into a little more detail, is that Silver Spring, you were working with a lot of these same\nutilities who had no tech at that time, you were providing them some initial tech. You are now in a position\nto take old technology and deliver to those same customers new technology. Can you just talk about the\ndifferences in those 2?\nScott A. Lang\nCEO, President & Director\nGeorge, thanks for that. I appreciate it. It's great to be here.\nYes, I remember the conversation we had and back in -- it was 20 years ago. Sometimes it's hard to\nimagine it was 20 years ago, that we truly pushed the limit of technology that was available to us. We\nleveraged the unlicensed spectrum of 902 to 928. And that technology is still in use today has touched,\nas I mentioned in the prepared remarks, more than 50 million homes and businesses across the United\nStates.\nAnd the movement we saw was very real. And now we're seeing even more demand, more use cases, a\nhigher bar that customers have of what they expect from the utilities and the solutions that we have now\nto extend that to make it more secure, more robust are really unlocked with the bandwidth that Anterix\nhas and our 5G capability that was not available 20 years ago.\nSo when I've started these conversations and having these conversations with our current clients, with\nprospective clients, the light goes on. And I think that the challenges that we faced getting the utility the\nmomentum to move from very low technology prior to 2004 to embracing change and crossing -- I used\nto think of it as crossing the bridge, it never crossed. And the bridge was connectivity to their point-of-sale\ndevice.\nI couldn't imagine back then ever running a business that you weren't connected other than a monthly\nmanual read to your point-of-sale device, that changed. Now the bar has gotten higher and the needs and\nthe demands for customers to protect the grid is much more valuable and is a higher risk today.\nWhat's available in the market? Solutions available in the market can be unlocked with the kind of\ncapability that Anterix brings to the table with 5G connection. I think that kind of captures some of the\nconversations you and I had, George. And since then, that was week 1, about a month ago. And since\nthen, those conversations have become real conversations just earlier this week on the back of EEI, and I\nbelieve it is a natural progression that they really understand that.\nGeorge Frederick Sutton\nCraig-Hallum Capital Group LLC, Research Division\nSuper. My other question is for Tim. And I have been on record as a believer that a more aggressive share\nbuyback program makes sense. So I'm interested in hearing about the delivery of spectrum earlier than\ncontracted. Just can you walk through the economic logic behind that? Is it much different? I just wanted\nto make sure we fully appreciated this concept.\nTimothy A. Gray\nChief Financial Officer\nCopyright © 2024 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 7\nANTERIX INC. FQ2 2025 EARNINGS CALL NOV 14, 2024\nYes, George, it's really being driven by the customer and their desire to move their networks along faster,\ndeploy the spectrum faster. And so we've had customers proactively ask us to deliver faster than was\ncontractually obligated, which will result in cash flow coming in earlier. So right now, our current projection\nis that in our fourth quarter of this current fiscal year, we'll receive another roughly $35 million that we\nhad planned on to come in next fiscal year. So with that additional cash flow in this fiscal year, we feel\nstronger that we can be much more aggressive with the buyback program in the near term. And I think\nyou'll see those results bear out as we release our numbers going forward over the next few quarters.\nChristopher Guttman-McCabe\nChief Regulatory & Communications Officer\nGeorge, it's Chris. And Tim referenced this, and I know you know this, but one of the things that makes\nour offering so unique is the ability to do exactly what Tim just described, right. The ability to be flexible\nto sort of turn on a $0.10 if a customer wants to accelerate or evolve their delivery decisions. And it's\none of the things that, again, makes our offering unique is the ability to match but we deliver to what the\nutility directly needs.\nOperator\n[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Mike Crawford from B. Riley.\nMichael Roy Crawford\nB. Riley Securities, Inc., Research Division\nJust to follow up on that. Tim, that $35 million you're talking about in fiscal Q4, is that plus the $10 million\nthat had been expected in that quarter or $35 million altogether in that quarter?\nTimothy A. Gray\nChief Financial Officer\nSo it's $35 million altogether in that quarter, Mike. So we've already received about $18 million this year\nand the $35 million will put us in the low 50s for the fiscal year on what we know based on contracts that\nwe've signed, we'll be receiving this fiscal year.\nMichael Roy Crawford\nB. Riley Securities, Inc., Research Division\nOkay. Excellent. And then Scott, can you share any low-hanging fruit that you've identified as you revisit\nyour sales process?\nScott A. Lang\nCEO, President & Director\nWhat was the first part of the question, Mike? Can I share any what?\nMichael Roy Crawford\nB. Riley Securities, Inc., Research Division\nYou said you've revisiting every element of your sales process. So as you embarked upon this investigation\nof your sales process, is there anything that you've identified already that you think you can improve\nupon?\nScott A. Lang\nCEO, President & Director\nYes, there it is. One thing that comes to mind is when we met as an entire group a couple of weeks ago,\nand we were going around the room and the testimonials I was hearing them talk about with our current\nclients and our prospects, while they were good, as I hoped on that, the real story started to come out as\nwe layered that back and say, \"Well, why was it fantastic? What was unique about us?\"\nAnd we started to come up with these very long examples of why Anterix was uniquely positioned that\nnobody could offer the kind of security, the kind of ubiquity, the kind of control and protection that Anterix\nCopyright © 2024 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 8\nANTERIX INC. FQ2 2025 EARNINGS CALL NOV 14, 2024\nhas with our 5G platform. It reminded me of many of the things, the challenges we faced at Silver Spring\n20 years ago when everybody thought this would just be a carrier-led solution.\nAnd the fact is utilities love to own their private networks. They love to be able to call upon that\nconnectivity when they need it the most. And carriers cannot offer that. And carriers cannot offer the\nflexibility of pricing that we can offer. So those were some of the things, Mike, as we started to get into it\nand get into the details of the use cases, the benefits, the value that Anterix has.\nAnd so that was really something that stands out to me, that we are going to work on and take into\nthe market. And then that builds upon the -- getting our clients to be our biggest advocates. And I've\nseen this movie before. Utilities, they don't necessarily compete with each other but they really do like\nto use each other's reference and brag about the things that they're doing. And this company has a\ngreat opportunity to put our customers on stage explaining how they're taking this from the lab to actual\ndeployments, which we saw last week at UBBA.\nAnd I'm going to ask who Ryan was there. We had a lot of folks there. Maybe, Ryan, you want to add a\ncouple of those stories that you heard from UBBA.\nRyan Gerbrandt\nChief Operating Officer\nYes, I'd be happy to. Yes, UBBA, I mean, as you guys know, we've been tracking for a while, a trade\norganization that we founded with some like-minded partners several years ago now and then turned it\nover as a non-profit with the utility-run board has just continued to be a real remarkable organization\nwhere the entire life cycle of this conversation and the ability for utilities to share their testimonials,\ntheir experiences, their lessons learned, frankly, has been fantastic. And last week in Kansas City was no\nexception.\nAnd like with anything, the organization has really evolved with the life cycle as we've seen these\ndeployments played out. So the conversations that we were having 2 years ago were really about\nunderstanding technology. This year, I got to say the focus was really on trying to learn and experience\nthe successes that so many different customers are having by having their networks being deployed,\nhaving devices in the field and getting applications onboarded.\nEvergy as the host utility did a remarkable job really sharing their experiences and the key applications\nthat they saw. They had a booth on display that everybody was surrounding and able to engage with and\ntalk to them about showcasing real applications that they're already taking value of, that 900 megahertz\nLTE was able to unlock.\nAnd these fall in the domain, Mike, of things like SCADA, FLISR, which is fault location, isolation and\nservice restoration, really an advanced kind of grid application. They were showing security cameras,\ndevice management, pole tilt sensors, different line sensors. These are kind of the building blocks of the\nbread and butter of what we think about when we articulate smart technology that needs to get enabled\non the grid, and there will be thousands and thousands of these kinds of devices as the grid continues to\nmodernize and utilities put them on it.\nAnd that's just one example of the many conversations we had over 3 days in Kansas City. But I'm excited\nby Scott's idea as well. I've said it before, there's no better salesperson in the industry than your past\ncustomer who's raving your successes. And our ability to capture that excitement, get that voice out there\nin front of the next in line is going to be a very powerful tool for us to lean into.\nScott A. Lang\nCEO, President & Director\nAnd Mike, I'll just pile on. Some of the exciting use cases that are now going in the lab and will ultimately\nbe deployed are around AI and intelligence at the last mile of the grid. And what is exciting for me to see\nis the technology we deployed unlocked a manual occasional data point to hundreds and thousands of data\npoints per day.\nCopyright © 2024 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 9\nANTERIX INC. FQ2 2025 EARNINGS CALL NOV 14, 2024\nThe AI chips that are being tested at the endpoint that we enable because of our spectrum and our\nsecurity and that connectivity takes it to millions. And the amount of information that unlocks, the value\nthat, that brings, the security of the way utilities can now protect their grid is very exciting. And I think\nthat we will continue to see that deployed and tested and talked about as the utilities start to embrace it in\ntheir deployments.\nMichael Roy Crawford\nB. Riley Securities, Inc., Research Division\nOne last question for me. Any changes in perspective from the FCC under potentially a Brendan Carr led\nadministration as you look to seek approval to offer 5x5 LTE instead of just 3x3?\nScott A. Lang\nCEO, President & Director\nChris and I have had some great conversations with it, and he and his team are doing a terrific job. Chris,\nwhy don't you respond to that, please?\nChristopher Guttman-McCabe\nChief Regulatory & Communications Officer\nYes. Thanks, Scott. And Mike, I think the first thing to recall is our initial 3x3 was a 50 vote. And one of\nthe commissioners that voted for it was Commissioner Carr. So I don't see anything about our multiparty\npetition that is political in nature. And I'm excited to see the movement of the petition through the\nprocess. And I believe we will very likely get the support of Commissioner Carr if he moves into the acting\nChair and ultimately, the Chair role. So I'm excited.\nHe and his team have been strong supporters of what we were able to do. You could just go back to his\nstatement 4 or 5 years ago where he said, \"This band is small, but we, at the FCC, could help make it\nmighty.\" I think we've delivered on that. So as the evolution happens on January 20, I think we're well\npositioned, not just Anterix, but our 9 co-petitioners to help move this forward.\nOperator\nThis concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Scott\nLang for any closing remarks.\nScott A. Lang\nCEO, President & Director\nI would like to conclude today with thanking all of you for your support and stay tuned. We're excited to\nbe here. I'm excited to be here and look forward to following up with many of you over the coming weeks.\nHave a great rest of your week, everybody.\nOperator\nThe conference has now concluded.
