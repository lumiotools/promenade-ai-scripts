(NASDAQ: ADN) (\"Advent \"or the \"Company\"), an innovation-driven leader in the fuel cell and hydrogen technology space, is pleased to announce significant performance breakthroughs for its Membrane Electrode Assembly (\"Advent MEA G2\") technology. The Advent MEA G2 technology has already been provided for testing to select strategic partners, in the automotive and aerospace industries. It is being developed within the framework of L'Innovator, the Company's joint development program with the U.S. Department of Energy's Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL), Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL), and National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL). \n\nHT-PEM fuel cell technology enables the use of green eFuels (eMethanol), renewable natural gas, or hydrogen on board. Furthermore, the HT-PEM fuel cells are highly efficient in terms of thermal management and highly resilient under extreme environmental conditions. The problem with the legacy HT-PEM MEAs was that they'd exhibit low power density and low lifetime compared to LT-PEM fuel cells. Advent has been developing the G2 MEA to overcome these problems. \n\nThe MEA developed with LANL technology is now in its second generation (\"Advent MEA G2\") and has achieved the following results vs. state-of-the-art \"Legacy MEAs\": \n\n**1. 2.5x Power Density vs. Legacy MEAs**\n\nAdvent MEA G2 operates ideally at 160 o C with nominal power produced at 0.35W/cm 2  (0.58V@0.60A) vs. 0.14W/cm 2 for the legacy MEAs. The Advent MEA G2 shows further potential for power generation when operating under pressure (1bar-2bar). Advent targets to achieve a performance of 0.7W/cm 2 in the G3 version of the MEA with the target of 0.7V@1A with pressure. \n\nThe power density of Advent MEA G2 is still lower than LT-PEM MEAs, but the advantages of using liquid fuels/eFuels (methanol/eMethanol) on-board, not carrying compressed hydrogen, and the elimination of water management and complex thermal management components, results in a simpler system. The expectation is that the HT-PEM fuel cells developed with Advent MEA will be on par with LT-PEM in cost and weight while addressing the significant disadvantages of LT-PEM technology. Specific stationary, portable, marine and off-grid power applications are ideal for use with the Advent MEA G2. \n\n\" _The off-grid, portable power and marine sectors need a liquid green fuel like eMethanol_ ,\" says Dr. Chris Kaskavelis, Advent's Chief Strategy Officer. \" _It is highly inefficient to decarbonize these sectors with compressed hydrogen. We see many applications in off-grid environments, buildings, and marine where hydrogen would be impossible to deliver for financial or safety reasons. Using eMethanol (an excellent liquid green hydrogen carrier) allows the HT-PEM fuel cell to break the vicious circle. We can decarbonize these sectors with green hydrogen without investing in prohibitively expensive hydrogen transportation, dispensing, and liquefaction infrastructure. The benefits are significant for the mobility sector as well. With the new Advent MEAs, we envision eFuel-based HEVs (hybrid E.V.s with HT-PEM fuel cells) that are entirely green, using small batteries and achieving long-range, with the optionality of charging vs refilling. We can refill with eMethanol, a green net-zero hydrogen carrier, at any existing fuel station and reuse the existing liquid fuel transportation and storage infrastructure. We are in technology assessments with some of the world's largest automotive manufacturers and are eager to move to joint development programs in 2025_ .\" \n\n**2. Significant Potential for Lifetime Improvement vs Legacy MEAs**\n\nThe Advent MEA G2 is a low-phosphoric acid, high-performance MEA that promises to increase the lifetime of fuel cell systems. \" _The lifetime of a system depends eventually on hundreds of engineering design factors, decisions, and operational processes, but a resilient MEA is a must,_ \" says Emory DeCastro, Advent's Chief Technology Officer and the recipient of the 2024 U.S. Department of Energy's R&D award for commercializing LANL technology. \" _When operating at high power outputs, Advent MEAs degrade 4x slower (4.1µV/min. vs. 16µV/min.) than legacy MEAs used in previous HT-PEM systems, including Advent's 1,200 deployed systems. When combined with outstanding start-up/shut-down stability (0.02mV loss per cycle vs 0.50 mV loss, or a 25-fold improvement), we expect that we'll see fuel cell systems easily surpassing the 10,000-hour lifetime even when operating in extreme conditions, and soon, 15,000 hours of operation._ \" \n\n**3. Superior Heat Rejection and Management Properties**\n\nMass market penetration for LT-PEM is limited by inferior heat rejection, especially when ambient temperatures exceed 35 _ o _ C. \" _Simply put, we don't have radiators or cooling systems to drive trucks in Arizona or India in hot weather or fly airplanes with LT-PEM fuel cells,\" says Emory DeCastro, \"The 2025 U.S. DoE target for heat rejection for heavy-duty mobility (275 kW power), which is essential for cost-efficient, safe, and simplified system operation, is a ΔQ/T of 3.3kW/ o C. The LT-PEM system's current performance is around 3.6 kW/ o C , and the fundamental issue is that when operating with a low-temperature MEA, it is physically impossible to improve this metric. Advent's system operating at 160-180 o C optimally has already surpassed the U.S. DoE heat rejection goal, achieving ΔQ/T of 1.1 kW/  o C. When we consider the complete system-level operation in real-world conditions vs. stack-only at ideal conditions, the HT-PEM technology is, in our opinion, superior and provides a path for mass adoption in sectors where batteries are not enough. _ \" \n\n**Commercial Progress:**\n\n  * Advent is already using the Advent MEA G2 for the U.S. Army Honeybadger project and all its technology assessments and joint development programs in the stationary, automotive, marine, and aerospace sectors. \n  * The Company is designing and developing a next-generation fuel cell stack based on the Advent MEA G2, with targets of 2x performance improvement in power density and 3x in lifetime vs. legacy HT-PEM systems. \n  * Advent will invite select industry-leading OEMs to collaborate in developing complete fuel cell system solutions leveraging Advent's MEAs, fuel cell stacks, and the Company's expertise in system development. Advent intends to manufacture only the MEA and the fuel cell stack rather than the complete system that varies widely for each application. \n\n\n\nDr. Vasilis Gregoriou, Advent's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, said, _\"We have achieved the MEA performance that will enable leading OEMs to manufacture fuel cells that last at least three times as long and have double the power density of our previous systems. We aim to enable OEMs to manufacture fuel cell systems that use eFuels like eMethanol for a capex cost below $0.1/kWh. If we add the cost of eMethanol (in the interim, low-cost methanol), we have a highly competitive green solution that beats diesel gensets and combustion engines in terms of cost. We have repeatedly seen that despite the global need to decarbonize, the solutions that make progress are low-cost, and that's what we intend to have with HT-PEM. OEM partnerships are essential for speeding up the next phase of commercial development, and we will focus our business development efforts there.\"_\n\nHighlighting the progress on the development of the new Advent MEA G2, Dr. DeCastro stated, \" _We are excited about the progress of the L'Innovator program and our long-term partnership with Los Alamos National Laboratory as we expand our understanding of the fundamentals of this new approach to HT-PEM._ \" \n\n**About Advent Technologies Holdings, Inc.**\n\nAdvent Technologies Holdings, Inc. is a U.S. corporation operating in the fuel cell, methanol, and hydrogen technology space.

The project continued as planned without delays.\n  * Met milestones with the U.S. Department of Defense on two previously awarded contracts for portable power systems.\n  * Continued Technology Assessment Work for four of the largest 15 automotive manufacturers in the world.\n  * Continued streamlining operations to significantly reduce OPEX and non-R&D development costs, primarily associated with overhead, facilities, and administrative personnel.\n\n\n\nLIVERMORE, Calif., Oct. 15, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Advent Technologies Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ: ADN) (“Advent” or the “Company”), an innovation-driven leader in the fuel cell and hydrogen technology space, today announced consolidated financial results for the three months ended June 30, 2024. All amounts are in U.S. dollars unless otherwise noted and have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”).\n\n**Q2** **2024** **Financial** **Highlights**\n\n(All comparisons are to Q2 2023, unless otherwise stated)\n\n  * Revenue of $0.8 million and income from grants of $0.7 million, for a total of $1.5 million.\n  * Operating expenses of $10.0 million, a year-over-year decrease of $1.2 million, primarily related to the streamlining of operations.\n  * Net loss in Q2 of $(11.3) million or $(4.28) per share.\n  * Unrestricted cash reserves were $0.7 million as of June 30, 2024, a decrease of $0.1 million from March 31, 2024.\n\n\n\n“We are on the road to becoming a much leaner and focused company with the goal to substantially reduce our cash burn. We aim to soon rely mostly on customer revenue and R&D grants for our operations rather than on fundraising. Towards that goal, we are focusing our activities on our Livermore and Patras offices that are leading the US Army, Airbus, and R&D product development efforts. Technology-wise, we have made great progress with the Advent MEA and expect to announce strong performance improvements to the market by year-end. I am thankful to our employees in the USA and Greece for performing excellent work during these hard financial times and meeting all customer milestones and requirements,” said Dr. Vasilis Gregoriou, Chairman and CEO of Advent Technologies.\n\n**Business****Updates**\n\nAirbus: The second quarter milestones were completed successfully, and the cooperation between the two companies continues to be strong. Aviation has by far the most challenging requirements compared to any other market. Advent believes that the benchmark performance achieved through this project will also be instrumental in achieving the performance requirements of other markets, especially stationary power, marine, and automotive.\n\nThe project aims to accelerate the development of Advent’s MEA and benchmark the Ion Pair MEA against aviation requirements and current/expected technological limits. HT-PEM MEAs operating at temperatures higher than 180°C (360°F) aim to solve one of the largest challenges in aviation fuel cell use: thermal management. High-temperature fuel cells allow increased performance, increased passenger carrying capability, and increased range compared to low-temperature fuel cell stack technology.\n\nUS Army: Work continued at a good pace in the two new contracts with the U.S. Department of Defense (“DoD”) ($2.2m and $2.8m awarded in 2023). Advent has successfully met all program milestones so far (on time or with minor delays) and the demanding mission requirements of the U.S. Army. These contracts are the continuation of a series of past contracts with the U.S. DoD, and their primary objective is to further optimize Advent’s proprietary Honey Badger 50™ (“HB50”) portable fuel cell system by integrating the Company’s innovative Ion Pair MEA technology. Upon the completion of these contracts, Advent and the U.S. DoD aim to reinforce their long-term collaboration by focusing on the further optimization of the HB50 and also on low-volume production manufacturing capacity.\n\nAdvent continued work for the ten EU-received R&D grants that are already ongoing and met milestones in multi-partner projects focused on further developing its technology and accelerating its product development roadmap.\n\nAdvent continued work on developing the Advent MEA with the goal to eventually achieve three times (3x) the power density performance and the 3x the lifetime performance of the legacy MEA that has been used for the last years across the line of Serene products. Advent believes that the development of the MEA is essential to continue and precede mass market efforts. The experience with the Serene systems is that despite their design and system maturity they remain too expensive for the markets intended (especially telecom power backup in Asia and Africa). The expected introduction of the Advent MEA into new fuel cell systems codeveloped with OEMs can bring the cost three times down effectively creating an inflection point for mass adoption.\n\nOther Updates\n\nReverse Stock Split: On May 1, 2024, Advent announced that it would move forward with a 1-for-30 reverse stock split of its issued and outstanding common stock. The reverse stock split was approved on April 30, 2024 by Advent’s Board of Directors, following approval by the Company's stockholders at a special meeting held on April 29, 2024. The reverse stock split brought Advent back into compliance with Nasdaq's $1.00 per share minimum bid price requirement for continued listing and to make the Company's stock more attractive to a broader range of institutional and other investors. On May 9, 2024 Advent announced that it would file a Certificate of Amendment to its Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation with the Secretary of State of Delaware after the close of business on Monday, May 13, 2024 to effectuate its previously announced 1-for-30 reverse stock split of its issued and outstanding common stock (the “Reverse Split”).\n\nDr. Gregoriou concluded, “We have continued our work on important projects with Airbus, US Army, Hyundai, and other automotive manufacturers. We are happy to report that despite financial difficulties, we have put our full focus and effort into these projects, and we have done our best work to date, meeting all the milestones. On the contrary, the Advent Denmark subsidiary has had poor financial and technology delivery performance, leading us to implement more cuts there. We intend to continue to reduce costs and focus our operations and people on what is truly world-changing and a competitive advantage for the company, and that is our Advent MEA technology. Furthermore, we are currently in talks with OEMs with the intention to enter into technology transfer agreements.”\n\n**About** **Advent** **Technologies** **Holdings,** **Inc.**\n\nAdvent Technologies Holdings, Inc.

These measures are EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income / (Loss), which we use to evaluate our operating performance, for business planning purposes and to measure our performance relative to that of our peers. These non-GAAP measures do not have any standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and therefore may differ from similar measures presented by other companies and may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures. We believe these measures are useful in evaluating the operating performance of Advent’s ongoing business. These measures should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for net income, operating expense and income, cash flows and other measures of financial performance and liquidity reported in accordance with GAAP. The calculation of these non-GAAP measures has been made on a consistent basis for all periods presented.\n\n**EBITDA** **and** **Adjusted** **EBITDA**\n\nThese supplemental non-GAAP measures are provided to assist readers in determining our operating performance. We believe this measure is useful in assessing performance and highlighting trends on an overall basis. We also believe EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are frequently used by securities analysts and investors when comparing our results with those of other companies. EBITDA differs from the most comparable GAAP measure, net income / (loss), primarily because it does not include interest, income taxes, depreciation of property, plant and equipment, and amortization of intangible assets. Adjusted EBITDA adjusts EBITDA for items such as one-time transaction costs, asset impairment charges, and fair value changes in the warrant liability.\n\nThe following tables show a reconciliation of net loss to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023.\n\n**EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA**| **Three months ended****June 30,**(Unaudited)| **Six months ended****June 30,**(Unaudited)  \n---|---|---  \n_(in Millions of US dollars)_| **2024**| **2023**| **$ change**| **2024**| **2023**| **$ change**  \n**Net loss**| **$**| **(11.27**| **)**| **$**| **(21.83**| **)**| **10.56**| **$**| **(20.63**| **)**| **$**| **(33.82**| **)**| **13.19**  \nDepreciation of property and equipment| $| 0.40| $| 0.81| (0.41| )| $| 1.12| $| 1.21| (0.09| )  \nAmortization of intangibles| $| -| $| 0.19| (0.19| )| $| -| $| 0.41| (0.41| )  \nFinance income / (expenses), net| $| 0.06| $| (0.01| )| 0.07| $| 0.29| $| (0.12| )| 0.41  \nLoss contingency| $| (0.04| )| $| -| (0.04| )| $| 4.87| $| -| 4.87  \nOther income / (expenses), net| $| 2.46| $| 0.81| 1.65| $| 2.48| $| 0.76| 1.72  \nForeign exchange differences, net| $| 0.16| $| (0.16| )| 0.32| $| 0.17| $| (0.12| )| 0.29  \nIncome taxes| $| -| $| -| -| $| (0.06| )| $| 0.80| (0.86| )  \n**EBITDA**| **$**| **(8.23**| **)**| **$**| **(20.19**| **)**| **11.96**| **$**| **(11.76**| **)**| **$**| **(30.88**| **)**| **19.12**  \nNet change in warrant liability| $| -| $| (0.10| )| 0.10| $| (0.06| )| $| (0.49| )| 0.43  \nImpairment losses| $| -| $| 9.76| (9.76| )| $| -| $| 9.76| (9.76| )  \n**Adjusted EBITDA**| **$**| **(8.23**| **)**| **$**| **(10.53**| **)**| **2.30**| **$**| **(11.82**| **)**| **$**| **(21.61**| **)**| **9.79**  \n  \nThis supplemental non-GAAP measure is provided to assist readers in determining our financial performance.

(NASDAQ: ADN) (“Advent” or the “Company”), an innovation-driven leader in the fuel cell and hydrogen technology space, today announced consolidated financial results for the three months ended March 31, 2024. All amounts are in U.S. dollars unless otherwise noted and have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”).\n\n**Q1** **2024** **Financial** **Highlights**\n\n(All comparisons are to Q1 2023, unless otherwise stated)\n\n  * Revenue of $3.5 million and income from grants of $1.4 million, for a total of $4.9 million.\n  * Operating expenses of $8.3 million, a year-over-year decrease of $3.3 million, primarily related to the streamlining of operations.\n  * Net loss in Q1 of $(9.4) million or $(3.62) per share.\n  * Unrestricted cash reserves were $0.8 million as of March 31, 2024, a decrease of $2.8 million from December 31, 2023.\n\n\n\n“The consolidation of our global operations continued during Q1 2024, which has driven efficiencies and contributed to the reduction of our cash burn. We will concentrate our efforts toward the development and manufacturing of the Advent MEA which is the core component of HT-PEM fuel cells, and on developing fuel cell stacks and licensing out fuel cell system technology through technology transfer agreements,” said Dr. Vasilis Gregoriou, Chairman and CEO of Advent Technologies. “Our HT-PEM technology is ideal for the stationary and portable power sector (including backup and primary power, data center power, and portable power for construction and other off-grid markets). The transportation sector has also shown great interest, as evidenced by the maritime, aviation, and automotive Joint Development Agreements and Technology Assessments underway. Our goal is to forge strong partnerships with OEMs, which will provide financial support and accelerate market adoption of the HT-PEM technology at a large scale. These partnerships will actively support our R&D and investment efforts and provide a clear path to commercialization.”\n\n**Business****Updates**\n\nAfter signing the contract with Airbus, Advent began implementation of the MEA benchmarking project in 2024. The first milestones were completed successfully and the cooperation between the two companies continues strong.\n\nThe project aims to accelerate the development of Advent’s MEA and benchmark the Ion Pair MEA against aviation requirements and current/expected technological limits. HT-PEM MEAs operating at temperatures higher than 180°C (360°F) aim to solve one of the largest challenges in aviation fuel cell use: thermal management. High-temperature fuel cells allow increased performance, increased passenger carrying capability, and increased range compared to low-temperature fuel cell stack technology. Advent believes that HT-PEM is a superior option not only for aviation but also for heavy-duty trucks, the automotive industry, and marine use.\n\nUS Army: Work continued at a good pace in the two new contracts with the U.S. Department of Defense (“DoD”) ($2.2m and $2.8m awarded in 2023). Advent has successfully met all program milestones so far (on time or with minor delays) and the demanding mission requirements of the U.S. Army. These contracts are the continuation of a series of past contracts with the U.S. DoD, and their primary objective is to further optimize Advent’s proprietary Honey Badger 50™ (“HB50”) portable fuel cell system by integrating the Company’s innovative Ion Pair MEA technology. Upon the completion of these contracts, Advent and the U.S. DoD aim to reinforce their long-term collaboration by focusing on the further optimization of the HB50 and also on low-volume production manufacturing capacity.\n\nAdvent continued work for the ten EU-received R&D grants that are already ongoing and met milestones in multi-partner projects focused on further developing its technology and accelerating its product development roadmap.\n\nAdvent continued work on developing the Advent MEA with the goal to achieve eventually 3 times (3x) the power density performance and the 3x the lifetime performance of the legacy MEA that has been used for the last years across the line of Serene products in Denmark. Advent expects that the 3x-3x target will address the needs of heavy-duty mobility, effectively bringing a new-world-class technology in the market. A more immediate target of 2x-2x MEA performance improvement vs. the legacy MEAs will significantly drop the total cost of ownership (TCO) per kWh making the Advent fuel cell solutions not only green, but also lower cost than diesel generators.\n\nCFO update: On January 5, 2024, Kevin L. Brackman, Chief Financial Officer of Advent Technologies Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the “Company” or “Advent”), resigned from all his positions at the Company and its subsidiaries, effective immediately. Advent offered the CFO position to Mr. Naiem Hussain, its Chief Investment Officer, but the decision was later reversed, and Mr. Hussain’s resignation was unanimously accepted by the Board on March 11, 2024. Since then, the Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Gregoriou has been serving as the Acting CFO.\n\nDr. Gregoriou concluded, “The Advent HT-PEM technology driven by the Advent MEA can become one of the key decarbonization pillars of the next decade. We are big believers that hydrogen is essential for achieving net-zero targets by 2050. Furthermore, we see many markets where green hydrogen will not be deployed in its compressed or liquefied form, but as a derivative alternative liquid e-Fuel (e-Methanol). The HT-PEM technology has clearly demonstrated throughout the last decade that it is ideal for use with e-Methanol (a virtually net-zero eFuel made from green hydrogen). The HT-PEM technology also provides superior heat-management and many of our partners in Technology or Benchmarking projects are actively evaluating it for this exact reason. Our goal is to push the MEA technology to the performance that is required to bring green and low-cost HT-PEM solutions to the mass market in the near future.”\n\n**About** **Advent** **Technologies** **Holdings,** **Inc.**\n\nAdvent Technologies Holdings, Inc. (a U.S. corporation) is an advanced materials and technology development company operating in the fuel cell, methanol, and hydrogen technology space. Advent is a world-leading company in the development of the HT-PEM technology (with more than 100 patents issued, pending, or licensed worldwide). The HT-PEM fuel cell technology developed by Advent enables off-grid power systems to produce clean power from various green fuels (hydrogen, methanol, bio and eMethanol, and renewable natural gas) and to function with higher efficiency at extreme ambient temperatures and in general extreme environmental conditions (humidity, air pollution). Advent’s main operations focus on developing and manufacturing the Membrane Electrode Assembly (MEA), which is the core electrochemical element and the most critical component of the fuel cell. The MEA largely determines lifetime, power density, efficiency, and overall cost of installation and operation for all applications. Advent is working with world-leading market-leading OEMs with the goal of bringing to the market complete fuel cell systems for a range of applications in the stationary power markets (backup, off-grid, and portable power) and the heavy-duty mobility markets (automotive, aviation, marine).\n\nFor more information, please visit [www.advent.energy](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=LjzkrGTt3fiB0OplgiEvdtpsLQjKEQiGxkaCMoshWQWCh4GWvUxLy6Umo5r-YUqQ_z_ud2dHU2ms7uW9mG_lke8pwkahjU88GXzoIrloJDyvMytGght19rMA4-Oj4G4vHWoIL78s9IjYICCWSoYargXjv5FC2HDnc_zl-nPTNX28kxJRI_a5cLCsdcst8HhLKrRLGu261twIB9FFJBxKHITkZP_yrU9HeNFuZtg-zD9tBI7tN-5_HzbhN-3F7NO4CBpOp1VIWitNY-lVn0cHzF71WrogeLUDDATP6pp-E0zBK61I4-YihSUNmkuY3RxUINcnObOxUB_VV4eJ3hlWOw==).\n\n**Cautionary** **Note** **Regarding** **Forward-Looking** **Statements**\n\nThis press release includes forward-looking statements.

The Company uses these non-GAAP financial measures for business planning purposes and in measuring its performance relative to that of its competitors. The Company believes that these non-GAAP financial measures are useful financial metrics to assess its operating performance from period-to- period by excluding certain items that the Company believes are not representative of its core business. These non- GAAP financial measures are not intended to replace, and should not be considered superior to, the presentation of the Company’s financial results in accordance with GAAP. The use of the terms Adjusted Net Income / (Loss) and Adjusted EBITDA may differ from similar measures reported by other companies and may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures. These measures are reconciled from the respective measures under GAAP in the appendix below.\n\n**ADVENT TECHNOLOGIES HOLDINGS, INC.****CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS**(**Amounts in USD thousands, except share and per share amounts)**  \n---  \n**As of**  \n**March 31,****2024**| **December 31,****2023**  \n(Unaudited)  \n**ASSETS**  \n**Current assets:**  \nCash and cash equivalents| $| 774| $| 3,562  \nRestricted cash, current| 98| 100  \nAccounts receivable, net| 1,085| 191  \nContract assets| 11| 21  \nInventories| 2,077| 2,707  \nPrepaid expenses and Other current assets| 3,184| 2,254  \n**Total current assets**| **7,229**| **8,835**  \n**Non-current assets:**  \nIntangibles, net| 77| 79  \nProperty and equipment, net| 20,749| 21,549  \nRight-of-use assets| 3,046| 3,216  \nRestricted cash, non-current| 750| 750  \nOther non-current assets| 301| 308  \nAvailable for sale financial asset| -| -  \n**Total non-current assets**| **24,923**| **25,902**  \n**Total assets**| **$**| **32,152**| **$**| **34,737**  \n**LIABILITIES AND STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY**  \n**Current liabilities:**  \nTrade and other payables| $| 5,679| $| 5,087  \nDeferred income from grants, current| 7| 530  \nContract liabilities| 2,280| 2,015  \nLoss contingency liabilities| 5,140| -  \nOther current liabilities| 1,816| 1,916  \nOperating lease liabilities| 2,164| 2,186  \nIncome tax payable| 176| 179  \n**Total current liabilities**| **17,262**| **11,913**  \n**Non-current liabilities:**  \nWarrant liability| -| 59  \nLong-term operating lease liabilities| 7,852| 8,230  \nDefined benefit obligation| 86| 83  \nDeferred income from grants, non-current| 202| 320  \nOther long-term liabilities| 671| 684  \n**Total non-current liabilities**| **8,811**| **9,376**  \n**Total liabilities**| **26,073**| **21,289**  \n**Commitments and contingent liabilities**  \n**Stockholders’ equity**  \nCommon stock ($0.0001 par value per share;

These measures are EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income / (Loss), which we use to evaluate our operating performance, for business planning purposes and to measure our performance relative to that of our peers. These non-GAAP measures do not have any standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and therefore may differ from similar measures presented by other companies and may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures. We believe these measures are useful in evaluating the operating performance of Advent’s ongoing business. These measures should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for net income, operating expense and income, cash flows and other measures of financial performance and liquidity reported in accordance with GAAP. The calculation of these non-GAAP measures has been made on a consistent basis for all periods presented.\n\n**EBITDA** **and** **Adjusted** **EBITDA**\n\nThese supplemental non-GAAP measures are provided to assist readers in determining our operating performance. We believe this measure is useful in assessing performance and highlighting trends on an overall basis. We also believe EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are frequently used by securities analysts and investors when comparing our results with those of other companies. EBITDA differs from the most comparable GAAP measure, net income / (loss), primarily because it does not include interest, income taxes, depreciation of property, plant and equipment, and amortization of intangible assets. Adjusted EBITDA adjusts EBITDA for items such as one-time transaction costs, asset impairment charges, and fair value changes in the warrant liability.\n\nThe following tables show a reconciliation of net loss to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA for the three months ended March, 2024 and 2023.\n\n**EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA**| **Three months ended****March 31,**(Unaudited)  \n---|---  \n_(in Millions of US dollars)_| **2024**| **2023**| **$ change**  \n**Net loss**| **$**| **(9.36**| **)**| **$**| **(11.99**| **)**| **2.63**  \nDepreciation of property and equipment| $| 0.72| $| 0.40| 0.32  \nAmortization of intangibles| $| -| $| 0.22| (0.22| )  \nFinance income / (expenses), net| $| 0.23| $| (0.11| )| 0.34  \nLoss contingency| $| 4.91| $| -| 4.91  \nOther income / (expenses), net| $| 0.02| $| (0.17| )| 0.19  \nForeign exchange differences, net| $| 0.01| $| 0.04| (0.03| )  \nIncome taxes| $| (0.06| )| $| 0.80| (0.86| )  \n**EBITDA**| **$**| **(3.53**| **)**| **$**| **(10.81**| **)**| **7.28**  \nNet change in warrant liability| $| (0.06| )| $| (0.39| )| 0.33  \n**Adjusted EBITDA**| **$**| **(3.59**| **)**| **$**| **(11.20**| **)**| **7.61**  \n  \nThis supplemental non-GAAP measure is provided to assist readers in determining our financial performance.

Adjusted Net Loss differs from the most comparable GAAP measure, net loss, primarily because it does not include one-time transaction costs, asset impairment charges and warrant liability changes. The following table shows a reconciliation of net loss to Adjusted Net Loss for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023.\n\n**Adjusted Net Loss**| **Three months ended****March 31,**(unaudited)  \n---|---  \n_(in Millions of US dollars)_| **2024**| **2023**| **$ change**  \n**Net loss**| **$**| **(9.36**| **)**| **$**| **(11.99**| **)**| **2.63**  \nNet change in warrant liability| $| (0.06| )| $| (0.39| )| 0.33  \n**Adjusted Net Loss**| **$**| **(9.42**| **)**| **$**| **(12.38**| **)**| **2.96**  \n  \nAdvent Technologies Holdings, Inc.\n\nDr. Vasilis Gregoriou [press@advent.energy](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=CpAC4t2SmpjwoooF03rnzsFTi6ab7aNMIWd8BFkdRxMUabgpbRW7ZtMarAZfTeyYOxoj4evaIZbk9TxfGizTBdJVBioOMn0rcsE68VhiQHY=)\n\nSource: Advent Technologies Holdings, Inc.\n\n![](https://www.globenewswire.com/newsroom/ti?nf=OTI1NjAxNyM2NTMyMzM0IzIyOTU2MzA=) ![](https://ml.globenewswire.com/media/ZjkxZGY1MWYtMzNhMS00MTNjLTkyNzYtMTRiMzllNmQyODY2LTEzMDcxODA=/tiny/Advent-Technologies-Holdings-I.png)\n\n[![Primary Logo](https://ml.globenewswire.com/media/e7558df7-45a6-41c9-8284-5e53d7bf13b6/small/advent-logo-png.png)](https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/e7558df7-45a6-41c9-8284-5e53d7bf13b6)\n\nSource: Advent Technologies Holdings, Inc.\n\n[View All News](https://ir.advent.energy/news/default.aspx)\n\n[ ![Advent Technologies Inc.

The project continued as planned without delays.\n● Met milestones with the U.S. Department of Defense on two previously awarded contracts for\nportable power systems.\n● Continued Technology Assessment Work for four of the largest 15 automotive manufacturers in the\nworld.\n● Continued streamlining operations to significantly reduce OPEX and non-R&D development costs,\nprimarily associated with overhead, facilities, and administrative personnel.\nLIVERMORE, Calif., Oct. 15, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE)-- Advent Technologies Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:\nADN) (“Advent” or the “Company”), an innovation-driven leader in the fuel cell and hydrogen technology\nspace, today announced consolidated financial results for the three months ended June 30, 2024. All\namounts are in U.S. dollars unless otherwise noted and have been prepared in accordance with U.S.\ngenerally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”).\nQ2 2024 Financial Highlights\n(All comparisons are to Q2 2023, unless otherwise stated)\nRevenue of $0.8 million and income from grants of $0.7 million, for a total of $1.5 million.\nOperating expenses of $10.0 million, a year-over-year decrease of $1.2 million, primarily related to the\nstreamlining of operations.\nNet loss in Q2 of $(11.3) million or $(4.28) per share.\nUnrestricted cash reserves were $0.7 million as of June 30, 2024, a decrease of $0.1 million from March\n31, 2024.\n“We are on the road to becoming a much leaner and focused company with the goal to substantially reduce\nour cash burn. We aim to soon rely mostly on customer revenue and R&D grants for our operations rather\nthan on fundraising. Towards that goal, we are focusing our activities on our Livermore and Patras offices that\nare leading the US Army, Airbus, and R&D product development efforts. Technology-wise, we have made\ngreat progress with the Advent MEA and expect to announce strong performance improvements to the\nmarket by year-end. I am thankful to our employees in the USA and Greece for performing excellent work\nduring these hard financial times and meeting all customer milestones and requirements,” said Dr. Vasilis\nGregoriou, Chairman and CEO of Advent Technologies.\nBusiness Updates\nAirbus: The second quarter milestones were completed successfully, and the cooperation between the two\ncompanies continues to be strong. Aviation has by far the most challenging requirements compared to any\nother market. Advent believes that the benchmark performance achieved through this project will also be\ninstrumental in achieving the performance requirements of other markets, especially stationary power,\nmarine, and automotive.\nThe project aims to accelerate the development of Advent’s MEA and benchmark the Ion Pair MEA against\naviation requirements and current/expected technological limits. HT-PEM MEAs operating at temperatures\nhigher than 180°C (360°F) aim to solve one of the largest challenges in aviation fuel cell use: thermal\nmanagement. High-temperature fuel cells allow increased performance, increased passenger carrying\ncapability, and increased range compared to low-temperature fuel cell stack technology.\nUS Army: Work continued at a good pace in the two new contracts with the U.S. Department of Defense\n(“DoD”) ($2.2m and $2.8m awarded in 2023). Advent has successfully met all program milestones so far\n(on time or with minor delays) and the demanding mission requirements of the U.S. Army. These contracts\nare the continuation of a series of past contracts with the U.S. DoD, and their primary objective is to further\noptimize Advent’s proprietary Honey Badger 50™ (“HB50”) portable fuel cell system by integrating the\nCompany’s innovative Ion Pair MEA technology. Upon the completion of these contracts, Advent and the\nU.S. DoD aim to reinforce their long-term collaboration by focusing on the further optimization of the HB50\nand also on low-volume production manufacturing capacity.\nAdvent continued work for the ten EU-received R&D grants that are already ongoing and met milestones in\nmulti-partner projects focused on further developing its technology and accelerating its product\ndevelopment roadmap.\nAdvent continued work on developing the Advent MEA with the goal to eventually achieve three times (3x)\nthe power density performance and the 3x the lifetime performance of the legacy MEA that has been used\nfor the last years across the line of Serene products. Advent believes that the development of the MEA is\nessential to continue and precede mass market efforts. The experience with the Serene systems is that\ndespite their design and system maturity they remain too expensive for the markets intended (especially\ntelecom power backup in Asia and Africa). The expected introduction of the Advent MEA into new fuel cell\nsystems codeveloped with OEMs can bring the cost three times down effectively creating an inflection point\nfor mass adoption.\nOther Updates\nReverse Stock Split: On May 1, 2024, Advent announced that it would move forward with a 1-for-30 reverse\nstock split of its issued and outstanding common stock. The reverse stock split was approved on April 30,\n2024 by Advent’s Board of Directors, following approval by the Company's stockholders at a special meeting\nheld on April 29, 2024. The reverse stock split brought Advent back into compliance with Nasdaq's $1.00 per\nshare minimum bid price requirement for continued listing and to make the Company's stock more attractive\nto a broader range of institutional and other investors. On May 9, 2024 Advent announced that it would file a\nCertificate of Amendment to its Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation with the Secretary\nof State of Delaware after the close of business on Monday, May 13, 2024 to effectuate its previously\nannounced 1-for-30 reverse stock split of its issued and outstanding common stock (the “Reverse Split”).\nDr. Gregoriou concluded, “We have continued our work on important projects with Airbus, US Army,\nHyundai, and other automotive manufacturers. We are happy to report that despite financial difficulties, we\nhave put our full focus and effort into these projects, and we have done our best work to date, meeting all\nthe milestones. On the contrary, the Advent Denmark subsidiary has had poor financial and technology\ndelivery performance, leading us to implement more cuts there. We intend to continue to reduce costs and\nfocus our operations and people on what is truly world-changing and a competitive advantage for the\ncompany, and that is our Advent MEA technology. Furthermore, we are currently in talks with OEMs with the\nintention to enter into technology transfer agreements.”\nAbout Advent Technologies Holdings, Inc.\nAdvent Technologies Holdings, Inc. (a U.S. corporation) is an advanced materials and technology\ndevelopment company operating in the fuel cell, methanol, and hydrogen technology space.

These measures are EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income / (Loss),\nwhich we use to evaluate our operating performance, for business planning purposes and to measure our\nperformance relative to that of our peers. These non-GAAP measures do not have any standardized\nmeaning prescribed by GAAP and therefore may differ from similar measures presented by other\ncompanies and may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures. We believe these measures are\nuseful in evaluating the operating performance of Advent’s ongoing business. These measures should be\nconsidered in addition to, and not as a substitute for net income, operating expense and income, cash flows\nand other measures of financial performance and liquidity reported in accordance with GAAP. The\ncalculation of these non-GAAP measures has been made on a consistent basis for all periods presented.\nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA\nThese supplemental non-GAAP measures are provided to assist readers in determining our operating\nperformance. We believe this measure is useful in assessing performance and highlighting trends on an\noverall basis. We also believe EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are frequently used by securities analysts and\ninvestors when comparing our results with those of other companies. EBITDA differs from the most\ncomparable GAAP measure, net income / (loss), primarily because it does not include interest, income\ntaxes, depreciation of property, plant and equipment, and amortization of intangible assets. Adjusted\nEBITDA adjusts EBITDA for items such as one-time transaction costs, asset impairment charges, and fair\nvalue changes in the warrant liability.\nThe following tables show a reconciliation of net loss to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA for the three and six\nmonths ended June 30, 2024 and 2023.\nThreemonths\nended Sixmonthsended\nJune 30, June 30,\nEBITDAandAdjustedEBITDA (Unaudited) (Unaudited)\n$ $\n(inMillionsofUSdollars) 2024 2023 change 2024 2023 change\nNetloss $ (11.27) $ (21.83) 10.56 $ (20.63) $ (33.82) 13.19\nDepreciationofpropertyandequipment $ 0.40 $ 0.81 (0.41) $ 1.12 $ 1.21 (0.09)\nAmortizationofintangibles $ - $ 0.19 (0.19) $ - $ 0.41 (0.41)\nFinanceincome/(expenses),net $ 0.06 $ (0.01) 0.07 $ 0.29 $ (0.12) 0.41\nLosscontingency $ (0.04) $ - (0.04) $ 4.87 $ - 4.87\nOtherincome/(expenses),net $ 2.46 $ 0.81 1.65 $ 2.48 $ 0.76 1.72\nForeignexchangedifferences,net $ 0.16 $ (0.16) 0.32 $ 0.17 $ (0.12) 0.29\nIncometaxes $ - $ - - $ (0.06) $ 0.80 (0.86)\nEBITDA $ (8.23) $ (20.19) 11.96 $ (11.76) $ (30.88) 19.12\nNetchangeinwarrantliability $ - $ (0.10) 0.10 $ (0.06) $ (0.49) 0.43\nImpairmentlosses $ - $ 9.76 (9.76) $ - $ 9.76 (9.76)\nAdjustedEBITDA $ (8.23) $ (10.53) 2.30 $ (11.82) $ (21.61) 9.79\nThis supplemental non-GAAP measure is provided to assist readers in determining our financial\nperformance. We believe this measure is useful in assessing performance and highlighting trends on an\noverall basis. Adjusted Net Loss differs from the most comparable GAAP measure, net loss, primarily\nbecause it does not include one-time transaction costs, asset impairment charges and warrant liability\nchanges.
