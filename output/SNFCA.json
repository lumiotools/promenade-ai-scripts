For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, after tax earnings increased 128% to $26,578,000 from $11,634,000 in 2023.\n\nScott M. Quist, President of the Company, said:\n\n“I continue to be pleased with our Company’s financial performance in 2024. To have a 128% increase in net income resulting in a nearly 11% return on equity for the first 9 months is an excellent performance in my view. By the numbers, our net income improved from $11.6 million in 2023 to $26.6 million in 2024. We have some definite bright spots in our 3rd quarter performance. Mortgage Segment revenues improved 20.5% during the quarter, showing some growing momentum and probable increase in market share, and the Mortgage Segment was profitable for the second quarter in a row. Our Mortuary and Cemetery revenues improved 15% for the quarter, also showing good and growing momentum. Again, speaking of the quarter, those growing revenues gave us a nearly $3.5 million dollar improvement in income for our Mortgage Segment, and a nearly $1.1 million dollar improvement for our Mortuaries and Cemeteries. It should be noted that for the 9 months our Mortgage Segment has improved its profitability by $9.4 million dollars, reflecting significant expense-reduction work along with the improved revenues. Our Life Insurance Segment revenues are arguably flat, being up only 3.8%, but the Life Insurance Segment’s profitability improved over 40% to $28 million dollars. Driving that profitability increase were decreasing death claims, including a return to more normal age distributions following COVID, and a decrease in the amortization of deferred acquisition costs which is related to the improved profit margins on our products. As a Company, our investment income has certainly benefitted from the higher interest rate environment (although that high-rate environment without question significantly harmed our Mortgage Segment), but our cash balances are probably now too high, so work is needed on that front. All in all, to have a 128% increase in net income and a nearly 11% return on equity is a very credible 9-month performance.”\n\nSNFC has three business segments. The following table shows the revenues and earnings before taxes for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 2023, for each of the three business segments:\n\nRevenues | Earnings before Taxes  \n---|---  \n2024 | 2023 | 2024 | 2023  \nLife Insurance | $ | 48,853,000 | $ | 47,200,000 | 3.5 | % | $ | 12,358,000 | $ | 7,175,000 | 72.2 | %  \nCemeteries/Mortuaries | $ | 8,543,000 | $ | 7,416,000 | 15.2 | % | $ | 2,841,000 | $ | 1,470,000 | 93.3 | %  \nMortgages | $ | 30,878,000 | $ | 25,626,000 | 20.5 | % | $ | 16,000 | $ | (3,486,000 | ) | 100.5 | %  \nTotal | $ | 88,274,000 | $ | 80,242,000 | 10.0 | % | $ | 15,215,000 | $ | 5,159,000 | 194.9 | %  \n  \nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024:\n\nRevenues | Earnings before Taxes  \n---|---  \n2024 | 2023 | 2024 | 2023  \nLife Insurance | $ | 146,061,000 | $ | 140,686,000 | 3.8 | % | $ | 28,053,000 | $ | 20,017,000 | 40.1 | %  \nCemeteries/Mortuaries | $ | 25,608,000 | $ | 23,427,000 | 9.3 | % | $ | 7,984,000 | $ | 6,083,000 | 31.3 | %  \nMortgages | $ | 83,584,000 | $ | 79,476,000 | 5.2 | % | $ | (1,813,000 | ) | $ | (11,207,000 | ) | 83.8 | %  \nTotal | $ | 255,253,000 | $ | 243,589,000 | 4.8 | % | $ | 34,224,000 | $ | 14,893,000 | 129.8 | %  \n  \nNet earnings per common share was $1.11 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to net earnings of $.49 per share for the prior year, as adjusted for the effect of annual stock dividends.

For the six months ended June 30, 2024, after tax earnings increased 94% to $14,746,000 from $7,593,000 in 2023.\n\nScott M. Quist, President of the Company, said:\n\n“I am quite pleased with our Company’s financial performance in the first half of 2024. To have a 95% increase in pretax income over 2023 is an excellent performance. In my view our operational income was even better. Because we have substantial real estate investments, sometimes the associated investment income can be a little “lumpy”, just given its nature. This lumpiness occurred, especially in our Life Insurance and Memorial segments, comparing 2024 to 2023. From an operational perspective our Memorial Team achieved an admirable 20% plus improvement in the first half of the year in both mortuary and cemetery operations. Our Insurance Team continued to hold costs steady in the inflationary environment and improved our premium rates significantly. The improved premium rates will not show up in the financial statement for a while since they apply only to new business, but they nevertheless represent significant effort and achievement in understanding and adapting to our changing markets. Our Mortgage Segment, through extraordinary continuous effort, achieved the first quarter of profitability in the last nine quarters. As an instructional backdrop, the Mortgage Bankers Association reports an unprecedented 8 consecutive quarters of industry-wide negative production profit. Previously the MBA had never reported 2 consecutive quarters of negative production profit and only 3 total quarters going back to Q3 2008. To say that the mortgage market has been challenged over the last two years is an understatement. Our Mortgage Team continues to tackle costs which are still arguably high, but coming down, and have attracted new top-notch talent in both production and back-office roles. To have achieved a $4,000,000 improvement in income on essentially the same loan volume is noteworthy. I believe 2024 again demonstrates the financially balanced nature of our Company and the excellent and continuously improving quality of our teams, which enable us to thrive in a variety of economic climates.” \n\nSNFC has three business segments.
