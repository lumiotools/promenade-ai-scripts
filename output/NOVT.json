(Nasdaq: NOVT) (“Novanta” or the “Company”), a trusted technology partner to medical and advanced technology equipment manufacturers, today reported financial results for the third quarter 2024. \n\n**Financial Highlights** |  **Three Months Ended**  \n---|---  \n(In millions, except per share amounts)  |  **September 27,** |  **September 29,**  \n**2024** |  **2023**  \n**GAAP**  \nRevenue  |  $  |  244.4  |  $  |  221.5   \nOperating Income  |  $  |  32.6  |  $  |  30.3   \nNet Income  |  $  |  19.2  |  $  |  21.2   \nDiluted EPS  |  $  |  0.53  |  $  |  0.59   \n**Non-GAAP***  \nAdjusted Operating Income  |  $  |  46.8  |  $  |  43.0   \nAdjusted Diluted EPS  |  $  |  0.85  |  $  |  0.85   \nAdjusted EBITDA  |  $  |  57.0  |  $  |  52.2   \n  \n*Reconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures, as well as definitions for the non-GAAP financial measures included in this press release and the reasons for their use, are presented below. \n\n“Our team delivered strong third quarter results, at the top end of our guidance range, driven by the strength of our diversified business and the Novanta Growth System operating model,” said Matthijs Glastra, Chair and Chief Executive Officer. “The third quarter demonstrated continued sequential improvement in our revenue growth rate, and customer bookings increased 13% year-over-year for our core businesses. We also saw our minimally invasive surgery products achieve a book-to-bill ratio of 1.4 in the quarter, signaling positive momentum with our new product launches.” \n\n** Third Quarter **\n\nDuring the third quarter of 2024, Novanta generated GAAP revenue of $244.4 million, an increase of $22.9 million, or 10.3%, versus the third quarter of 2023. The Company’s acquisition activities resulted in an increase in revenue of $21.1 million, or 9.5%, compared to the third quarter of 2023. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates favorably impacted revenue by $1.8 million, or 0.8%, during the third quarter of 2024. Organic Revenue Growth, which excludes the net impact of acquisitions and changes in foreign currency exchange rates, was 0.0% for the third quarter of 2024 (see “Organic Revenue Growth” in the non-GAAP reconciliations below). \n\nIn the third quarter of 2024, GAAP operating income was $32.6 million, compared to $30.3 million in the third quarter of 2023. GAAP net income was $19.2 million in the third quarter of 2024, compared to $21.2 million in the third quarter of 2023. GAAP diluted earnings per share (“EPS”) was $0.53 in the third quarter of 2024, compared to $0.59 in the third quarter of 2023. Diluted weighted average shares outstanding was 36.1 million in the third quarter of 2024. \n\nAdjusted Diluted EPS was $0.85 in the third quarter of 2024, compared to $0.85 in the third quarter of 2023. Adjusted EBITDA was $57.0 million in the third quarter of 2024, compared to $52.2 million in the third quarter of 2023. \n\nOperating cash flow for the third quarter of 2024 was $23.0 million, compared to $44.6 million for the third quarter of 2023. \n\n** Financial Guidance **\n\n“While the macroeconomic environment throughout 2024 created some challenging dynamics with the timing of capital equipment purchases in the year, we believe we are well-positioned to benefit from a recovering investment climate in 2025 and beyond. Our Novanta team and our customers both remain committed to driving positive momentum from new product launches, which we believe will result in an improving and accelerating revenue and profit growth in 2025. Based on our customers’ expectations, backlog, and product launches, we expect Organic Revenue growth of up to 10% in 2025 compared to 2024.” \n\nFor the fourth quarter of 2024, the Company expects GAAP revenue of approximately $237 million to $242 million. The Company expects Adjusted Gross Profit Margin to be approximately 46.0%. The Company expects Adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $50 million to $52 million and Adjusted Diluted EPS to be in the range of $0.70 to $0.74. The Company’s guidance assumes no significant changes in foreign exchange rates. \n\nFor the full year 2024, the Company expects GAAP revenue of approximately $948 million to $953 million. The Company expects Adjusted Gross Profit Margin to be approximately 46.3%. The Company expects Adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $208 million to $210 million and Adjusted Diluted EPS to be in the range of $3.02 to $3.06. The Company’s guidance assumes no significant changes in foreign exchange rates. \n\nNovanta provides earnings guidance on a non-GAAP basis and does not provide earnings guidance on a GAAP basis, with the exception of GAAP revenue guidance. A reconciliation of the Company’s forward-looking Adjusted Gross Profit Margin, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Diluted EPS guidance to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures is not provided because of the inherent difficulty in forecasting and quantifying certain amounts that are necessary for such reconciliations, including acquisitions and related expenses; impact of purchase price allocations for recently completed acquisitions; future changes in the fair value of contingent considerations; future restructuring expenses; foreign exchange gains/(losses); significant discrete income tax expenses (benefits); benefits or expenses associated with the completion of tax audits; divestitures and related expenses; gains and losses from sale of real estate assets; costs related to product line closures; intangible asset impairment charges and related asset write-offs; and other charges reflected in the Company’s reconciliation of historical non-GAAP financial measures, the amounts of which, based on past experience, could be material. For additional information regarding Novanta’s non-GAAP financial measures, see “Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below. \n\n**Conference Call Information**\n\nThe Company will host a conference call on Tuesday, November 5, 2024 at 10:00 a.m. ET to discuss these results and to provide a business update. To access the call, please dial (888) 346-3959 prior to the scheduled conference call time. Alternatively, the conference call can be accessed online via a live webcast on the Events & Presentations page of the Investors section of the Company’s website at [www.novanta.com](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.novanta.com&esheet=54146889&newsitemid=20241105162002&lan=en-US&anchor=www.novanta.com&index=1&md5=391c84e2fd2e7eb3a1eaf5fec4c088d9). \n\nA replay of the audio webcast will be available approximately three hours after the conclusion of the call in the Investor Relations section of the Company’s website at [www.novanta.com](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.novanta.com&esheet=54146889&newsitemid=20241105162002&lan=en-US&anchor=www.novanta.com&index=2&md5=d8936c35cc5652338770a27c516fec01). The replay will remain available until Wednesday, January 1, 2025. \n\n**Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures**\n\nThe non-GAAP financial measures used in this press release are Organic Revenue Growth, Adjusted Gross Profit, Adjusted Gross Profit Margin, Adjusted Operating Income, Adjusted Operating Margin, Adjusted Income Before Income Taxes, Adjusted Income Tax Provision/(Benefit) and Effective Tax Rate, Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted Diluted EPS, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, Free Cash Flow, Free Cash Flow as a Percentage of Net Income, and Net Debt. \n\nThe Company believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful and supplementary information to investors regarding the operating performance of the Company. It is management’s belief that these non-GAAP financial measures would be particularly useful to investors because of the significant changes that have occurred outside of the Company’s day-to-day business in accordance with the execution of the Company’s strategy. This strategy includes streamlining the Company’s existing operations through site and functional consolidations, strategic divestitures and product line closures, expanding the Company’s business through significant internal investments, and broadening the Company’s product and service offerings through acquisitions of innovative and complementary technologies and solutions. The financial impact of certain elements of these activities, particularly acquisitions, divestitures, and site and functional restructurings, is often large relative to the Company’s overall financial performance and can adversely affect the comparability of its operating results and investors’ ability to analyze the business from period to period. \n\nThe Company’s Adjusted EBITDA, Organic Revenue Growth and Adjusted Gross Profit Margin are used by management to evaluate operating performance, communicate financial results to the Board of Directors, benchmark results against historical performance and the performance of peers, and evaluate investment opportunities, including acquisitions and divestitures. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA, Organic Revenue Growth and Adjusted Gross Profit Margin are used to determine bonus payments for senior management and employees. The Company has also used in the past, and may use in the future, Adjusted Diluted EPS and Adjusted EBITDA as performance targets for certain performance-based restricted stock units. Accordingly, the Company believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide greater transparency and insight into management’s method of analysis. \n\nNon-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as substitutes for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. They are limited in value because they exclude charges that have a material effect on the Company’s reported results and, therefore, should not be relied upon as the sole financial measures to evaluate the Company’s financial results. The non-GAAP financial measures are meant to supplement, and to be viewed in conjunction with, GAAP financial measures. Investors are encouraged to review the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures as provided in the tables accompanying this press release. \n\n**Safe Harbor and Forward-Looking Information**\n\n_Certain statements in this release are “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. All statements contained in this news release that do not relate to matters of historical fact should be considered forward-looking statements, and are generally identified by words such as “expect,” “intend,” “anticipate,” “estimate,” “believe,” “future,” “could,” “should,” “plan,” “aim,” and other similar expressions. These forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements regarding anticipated financial performance and financial position, including our financial outlook for the full years 2024 and 2025 and fourth quarter of 2024; expectations for our end markets and market position; macroeconomic expectations; our competitive position, including our positioning for long-term growth, capital spending and momentum from new product launches; and other statements that are not historical facts._\n\n_These forward-looking statements are neither promises nor guarantees, but involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements for many reasons, including, but not limited to, the following: economic and political conditions and the effects of these conditions on our customers’ businesses, capital expenditures and level of business activities; risks associated with epidemics, pandemics or other public health crises; our dependence upon our ability to respond to fluctuations in product demand; our ability to continuously innovate, to introduce new products in a timely manner, and to manage transitions to new product innovations effectively; customer order timing and other similar factors; disruptions or breaches in security of our or our third-party providers’ information technology systems; risks associated with our operations in foreign countries; our increased use of outsourcing in foreign countries; risks associated with increased outsourcing of components manufacturing; our exposure to increased tariffs, trade restrictions or taxes on our products; violations of our intellectual property rights and our ability to protect our intellectual property against infringement by third parties; risk of losing our competitive advantage; our failure to successfully integrate recent and future acquisitions into our business; our ability to attract and retain key personnel; our restructuring and realignment activities; product defects or problems integrating our products with other vendors’ products; disruptions in the supply of certain key components and other goods from our suppliers; our failure to accurately forecast component and raw material requirements leading to additional costs and significant delays in shipments; production difficulties and product delivery delays or disruptions; our exposure to extensive medical device regulations, which may impede or hinder the approval, certification or sale of our products and, in some cases, may ultimately result in an inability to obtain approval or certification of certain products or may result in the recall or seizure of previously approved or certified products; potential penalties for violating foreign and U.S. federal and state healthcare laws and regulations; impact of healthcare industry cost containment and healthcare reform measures; changes in governmental regulations related to our business or products; actual or perceived failures to comply with applicable data protection, privacy and security laws, regulations, standards, and other requirements; our failure to implement new information technology systems successfully; changes in foreign currency rates; our failure to realize the full value of our intangible assets; our reliance on original equipment manufacturer customers; increasing scrutiny and changing expectations from investors, customers, governments and other stakeholders and third parties with respect to corporate sustainability policies and practices; the effects of climate change and related regulatory responses; our exposure to the credit risk of some of our customers and in weakened markets; being subject to U.S. federal income taxation even though we are a non-U.S. corporation; changes in tax laws and fluctuations in our effective tax rates; any need for additional capital to adequately respond to business challenges or opportunities and repay or refinance our existing indebtedness, which may not be available on acceptable terms or at all; our existing indebtedness limiting our ability to engage in certain activities; volatility in the market price for our common shares; and our failure to maintain appropriate internal controls in the future._\n\n_Other important risk factors that could affect the outcome of the events set forth in these statements and that could affect the Company’s operating results and financial condition are discussed in Part I, Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, as updated by our subsequent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Such statements are based on the Company’s beliefs and assumptions and on information currently available to the Company. The Company disclaims any obligation to publicly update or revise any such forward-looking statements as a result of developments occurring after the date of this document except as required by law._\n\n**About Novanta**\n\nNovanta is a leading global supplier of core technology solutions that give medical and advanced industrial original equipment manufacturers a competitive advantage.

Net Income** |  101.4  |  %  |  178.3  |  %   \n  \n** Non-GAAP Financial Measures **\n\n_The following provides additional explanations for non-GAAP financial measures used by the Company, including explanations for certain non-GAAP adjustments that may not be present in the quarterly disclosures included in the current earnings release but have been used by the Company in the two most recent fiscal years. See the tables above for the calculations of the non-GAAP financial measures used in this earnings release._\n\n**Organic Revenue Growth**\n\nThe Company defines the term “organic revenue” as revenue excluding the impact from business acquisitions, divestitures, product line discontinuations, and the effect of foreign currency translation. The Company uses the related term “organic revenue growth” to refer to the financial performance metric of comparing current period organic revenue with the reported revenue of the corresponding period in the prior year. The Company believes that this non-GAAP financial measure, when taken together with our GAAP financial measures, allows the Company and its investors to better measure the Company’s performance and evaluate long-term performance trends. Organic revenue growth also facilitates easier comparisons of the Company’s performance with prior and future periods and relative comparisons to its peers. The Company excludes the effect of foreign currency translation from these measures because foreign currency translation is subject to volatility and can obscure underlying business trends. The Company excludes the effect of acquisitions and divestitures because these activities can vary dramatically between reporting periods and between the Company and its peers, which the Company believes makes comparisons of long-term performance trends difficult for management and investors. Organic Revenue Growth is also used as a performance metric to determine bonus payments for senior management and employees. \n\n**Adjusted Gross Profit and Adjusted Gross Profit Margin**\n\nThe calculation of Adjusted Gross Profit and Adjusted Gross Profit Margin excludes amortization of acquired intangible assets because: (i) the amounts are non-cash; (ii) the Company cannot influence the timing and amount of future expense recognition; and (iii) excluding such expenses provides investors and management better visibility into the underlying trends and performance of our businesses. \n\n**Adjusted Operating Income and Adjusted Operating Margin**\n\nThe calculation of Adjusted Operating Income and Adjusted Operating Margin excludes amortization of acquired intangible assets for the reasons described above for Adjusted Gross Profit and Adjusted Gross Profit Margin. The Company also excludes officer transition costs, restructuring, and acquisition and related costs due to the significant changes that have occurred outside of the Company’s day-to-day business for the reasons described above in the introductory paragraphs of the “Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures.” \n\n**Adjusted Income Before Income Taxes**\n\nThe calculation of Adjusted Income Before Income Taxes excludes amortization of acquired intangible assets, officer transition costs, and restructuring, and acquisition and related costs for the reasons described above for Adjusted Operating Income and Adjusted Operating Margin. The Company also excludes foreign exchange transaction gains (losses) from the calculation of Adjusted Income Before Income Taxes as the Company cannot fully influence the timing and amount of foreign exchange transaction gains (losses). \n\n**Non-GAAP Income Tax Provision/(Benefit) and Effective Tax Rate**\n\nNon-GAAP Income Tax Provision/(Benefit) and Effective Tax Rate are calculated based on the Adjusted Income Before Income Taxes by jurisdiction, the applicable tax rates in effect for the respective jurisdictions and the income tax effect of non-GAAP adjustments discussed above. In addition, the Company excludes significant discrete income tax expenses (benefits) related to releases of valuation allowances and uncertain tax positions, tax audits, certain changes in tax laws, and acquisition related tax planning actions on the Company’s effective tax rate. \n\n**Adjusted Net Income**\n\nBecause Income Before Income Taxes is included in determining Net Income, the calculation of Adjusted Net Income also excludes amortization of acquired intangible assets, officer transition costs, restructuring, acquisition and related costs, and foreign exchange transaction gains (losses) for the reasons described above for Adjusted Income Before Income Taxes. In addition, the Company excludes (i) significant discrete income tax expenses (benefits) related to releases of valuation allowances and uncertain tax positions, tax audits or amendments to prior year returns, certain changes in tax laws, and acquisition related tax planning actions on the Company’s effective tax rate; and (ii) the income tax effect of non-GAAP adjustments discussed above. \n\n**Adjusted Diluted EPS**\n\nBecause Net Income is used in the calculation of Diluted EPS, Adjusted Diluted EPS excludes: (i) amortization of acquired intangible assets; (ii) officer transition costs; (iii) restructuring, acquisition and related costs; (iv) foreign exchange transaction gains (losses); (v) significant discrete income tax expenses (benefits) related to releases of valuation allowances, uncertain tax positions, tax audits or amendments to prior year returns, certain changes in tax laws, and acquisition related tax planning actions on the Company’s effective tax rate; and (vi) the income tax effect of non-GAAP adjustments for the reasons described above for Adjusted Net Income. \n\n**Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin**\n\nThe Company defines Adjusted EBITDA as income before deducting interest (income) expense, income tax provision (benefit), depreciation, amortization, non-cash share-based compensation, restructuring, acquisition and related costs, other non-operating (income) expense items, including foreign exchange transaction (gains) losses and net periodic pension costs of the Company’s frozen U.K. defined benefit pension plan for the reasons described above in the introductory paragraphs of the “Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures.” \n\nAdjusted EBITDA Margin is defined as Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of Revenue. \n\nIn evaluating Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin, you should be aware that in the future the Company may incur expenses that are the same as, or similar to, some of the adjustments in this presentation. \n\n**Free Cash Flow and Free Cash Flow as a Percentage of Net Income**\n\nThe Company defines Free Cash Flow as net cash provided by operating activities less cash paid for purchases of property, plant and equipment and plus cash proceeds from sales of property, plant and equipment. Free Cash Flow as a Percentage of Net Income is defined as Free Cash Flow divided by Net Income. Management believes these non-GAAP financial measures are important indicators of the Company’s liquidity as well as its ability to service its outstanding debt and to fund future growth. \n\n**Net Debt**\n\nThe Company defines Net Debt as its total debt as reported on the consolidated balance sheet plus unamortized deferred financing costs and less its cash and cash equivalents as of the end of the period presented. Management uses Net Debt to monitor the Company’s outstanding debt obligations that could not be satisfied by its cash and cash equivalents on hand. \n\n![](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=bwnews&sty=20241105162002r1&sid=q4-prod&distro=nx&lang=en)\n\n**Novanta Inc.** Investor Relations: Ray Nash (781) 266-5137 \n\nSource: Novanta Inc.\n\n[View All News](https://investors.novanta.com/news/default.aspx)\n\n## Contact Us\n\nRay Nash Corporate Finance Leader 781-266-5137  InvestorRelations@novanta.com\n\n## Quick Links\n\n  * [SEC Filings](https://investors.novanta.com/financials/sec-filings/default.aspx)\n  * [Annual Reports](https://investors.novanta.com/financials/annual-reports/default.aspx)\n  * [Financial Tables](https://investors.novanta.com/financials/financial-tables/default.aspx)\n  * [Investor Factsheet](//s24.q4cdn.com/409314640/files/doc_downloads/2023/06/Novanta-Inc_Investor-Fact-Sheet_June-2023.pdf)\n  * [Investor FAQs](https://investors.novanta.com/resources/investor-faqs/default.aspx)\n\n\n\n## Investor Email Alerts\n\nTo opt-in for investor email alerts, please enter your email address in the field below and select at least one alert option.

These forward-looking statements include, but are notlimited to, statements regarding anticipated financial performance and financial position, including our financial outlook\nfor the full year of 2024; expectations for our end markets and market position; our competitive position, including our positioning for long-term growth and other statements that are not historical facts.\nThese forward-looking statements are neither promises nor guarantees, but involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. Our actual results could differ\nmaterially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements for many reasons, including, but not limited to, the following: economic and political conditions and the effects of these conditions on our customers’ businesses, capital\nexpenditures and level of business activities; risks associated with epidemics, pandemics or other public health crises, suchasthe COVID-19 pandemic; our dependence upon our ability to respond to fluctuations in product demand; our ability to\ncontinuously innovate, to introduce new products in a timely manner, and to manage transitions to new product innovations effectively; customer order timing and other similar factors; disruptions or breaches in security of our or our third-party\nproviders’ information technology systems; risks associated with our operations in foreign countries; our increased use of outsourcing in foreign countries; risks associated with increased outsourcing of components manufacturing; our exposure to\nincreased tariffs, trade restrictions or taxes on our products; violations of our intellectual property rights and our ability to protect our intellectual property against infringement by third parties; risk of losing our competitive advantage; our failureto\nsuccessfully integrate recent and future acquisitions into our business; our ability to attract and retain key personnel; ourrestructuring and realignment activities; product defects or problems integrating our products with other vendors’ products;\ndisruptions in the supply of certain key components and other goods from our suppliers; our failure to accurately forecast component and raw material requirements leading to additional costs and significant delays in shipments; production\ndifficulties and product delivery delays or disruptions; our exposure to extensive medical device regulations, which may impede or hinder the approval, certification or sale of our products and, in some cases, may ultimately result in an inability to\nobtain approval or certification of certain products or may result in the recall or seizure of previously approved or certified products; potential penalties for violating foreign and U.S. federal and state healthcare laws and regulations; impact of\nhealthcare industry cost containment and healthcare reform measures; changes in governmental regulations related to our businessor products; actual or perceived failures to comply with applicable data protection, privacy and security laws,\nregulations, standards, and other requirements; our failure to implement new information technology systems successfully; changes in foreign currency rates; our failure to realize the full value of our intangible assets; our reliance on original\nequipment manufacturer customers; increasing scrutiny and changing expectations from investors, customers, governments and otherstakeholders and third parties with respect to corporate sustainability policies and practices; the effects of\nclimate change and related regulatory responses; our exposure to the credit risk of some of our customers and in weakened markets; being subject to U.S. federal income taxation even though we are a non-U.S. corporation; changes in tax laws and\nfluctuations in our effective tax rates; any need for additional capital to adequately respond to business challenges or opportunities and repay or refinance our existing indebtedness, which may not be available on acceptable terms or at all; our\nexisting indebtedness limiting our ability to engage in certain activities; volatility in the market price for our common shares; and our failure to maintain appropriate internal controls in the future.\nAny or all of our forward-looking statements may turn out to be inaccurate, and there are no guarantees about our performance. The factors identified above are not exhaustive. We operate in a dynamic business environment in which new risks\nmay emerge frequently. Accordingly, you should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the dates on which they are made. In addition, results for prior periods are not necessarily indicative of results that\nmay be expected for any future period.\nOther important risk factors that could affect the outcome of the events set forth in these statements and that could affect theCompany’s operating results and financial condition are discussed in Part I, Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K\nfor the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, as updated by our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 27, 2024 and as further updated by our subsequent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Such\nstatements are based on the Company’s beliefs and assumptions and on information currently available to the Company. The Companydisclaims any obligation to publicly update or revise any such forward-looking statements as a result of\ndevelopments occurring after the date of this document except as required by law.\nIn this presentation, we present the non-GAAP financial measure of Adjusted EBITDA and AdjustedGross Profit Margin.

It is management’s belief that these non-\nGAAP financial measures would be particularly useful to investors because of the significant changes that have occurred outside of the Company’s day-to-day business in accordance with the execution of the Company’s\nstrategy. This strategy includes streamlining the Company’s existing operations through site and functional consolidations, strategic divestitures and product line closures, expanding the Company’s business through\nsignificant internal investments, and broadening the Company’s product and service offerings through acquisitions of innovative and complementary technologies and solutions. The financial impact of certain elements of\nthese activities, particularly acquisitions, divestitures, and site and functional restructurings, is often large relative tothe Company’s overall financial performance and can adversely affect the comparability of its operating\nresults and investors’ ability to analyze the business from period to period.\nThe Company defines Adjusted EBITDA as operating income (loss) from continuing operations before deducting depreciation, amortization, non-cash share-based compensation, costs directly related to employee COVID-19\ntesting, restructuring, acquisition, divestiture and other costs, impairment of goodwill and intangible assets, acquisition fairvalue adjustments, CEO transition costs, and inventory related charges associated with product line\nclosures.\nThe calculation of Adjusted Gross Profit Margin excludes amortization of acquired intangible assets and inventory fair value adjustments related to business acquisitions because: (i) the amounts are non-cash; (ii) the Company\ncannot influence the timing and amount of future expense recognition; and (iii) excluding such expenses provides investors and management better visibility into the underlying trends and performance of our businesses.\nThe Company’s Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Gross Margin are used by management to evaluate operating performance, communicatefinancial results to the Board of Directors, benchmark results against historical\nperformance and the performance of peers, and evaluate investment opportunities, including acquisitions and divestitures. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Gross Margin are financial performance metrics used to\ndetermine incentive compensation payments for senior management and employees. Accordingly, the Company believes that this non-GAAP financial measure provides greater transparency and insight into management’s\nmethod of analysis.\nNon-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as substitutes for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. They are limited in value because they exclude charges that\nhave a material effect on the Company’s reported results and, therefore, should not be relied upon as the sole financial measures to evaluate the Company’s financial results. The non-GAAP financial measures are meant to\nsupplement, and to be viewed in conjunction with, GAAP financial measures. Investors are encouraged to review the reconciliationof these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial\nmeasures as provided in the tables accompanying this document.\nNovanta provides earnings guidance on a non-GAAP basis and does not provide earnings guidance on a GAAP basis, with the exception of GAAP revenue guidance. A reconciliation of the Company’s forward-looking Adjusted\nEBITDA guidance to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures is not provided because of the inherent difficulty inforecasting and quantifying certain amounts that are necessary for such reconciliations, including\nacquisitions and related expenses; impact of purchase price allocations for recently completed acquisitions; future changes in the fair value of contingent considerations; future restructuring expenses; foreign exchange\ngains/(losses); significant discrete income tax expenses (benefits); benefits or expenses associated with the completion of tax audits; divestitures and related expenses; gains and losses from sale of real estate assets; costs\nrelated to product line closures; intangible asset impairment charges and related asset write-offs; and other charges reflected in the Company’s reconciliation of historical non-GAAP financial measures, the amounts of which,\nbased on past experience, could be material.\nCONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 18\nNon-GAAP Reconciliation\nNINE\n(in thousands of dollars) TWELVE MONTHS ENDED MONTHS\nENDED\nDec 31, Dec 31, Dec 31, Dec 31, Dec 31, Dec 31, Dec 31, Dec 31, Dec 31, Dec31, Dec 31, Dec. 31, Sep 27,\n2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024\nREVENUE\nRevenue (GAAP) $243,796 $316,910 $364,706 $373,598 $384,758 $521,290 $614,337 $626,099 $590,623 $706,793 $860,903 $881,662 $711,184\nADJUSTED EBITDA\nOperating income (loss) from continuing operations\n$20,798 $19,951 ($16,729) $29,304 $32,955 $57,566 $71,013 $55,282 $55,888 $64,054 $103,079 $110,496 $83,878\n(GAAP)\nDepreciation and amortization 12,458 19,570 23,797 19,114 20,357 30,758 37,052 38,280 38,293 43,126 53,158 46,612 41,200\nShare-based compensation 4,534 5,442 4,329 4,387 4,293 5,493 7,647 9,340 22,535 22,557 23,108 25,588 18,672\nImpairment of goodwill and intangible assets - - 41,442 - - - - - - - - - -\nRestructuring, acquisition, divestiture and other\n4,369 5,387 3,091 8,273 7,945 7,542 8,041 16,574 3,810 18,020 4,384 13,060 8,747\ncosts\nInventory related charges associated with product\n- - - - 1,370 - - - - - - 473 2,493\nline closures\nAcquisition fair value adjustments 965 596 358 205 4,754 - 1,270 188 1,411 160 - 2,777\nCEO transition costs - - - - 1,306 - - - - - - - -\nEmployee COVID-19 testing costs - - - - - - - - 275 3,568 240 - -\nAdjusted EBITDA (Non-GAAP) $42,159 $51,315 $56,526 $61,436 $68,431 $106,113 $123,753 $120,746 $120,989 $152,736 $184,129 $196,229 $157,768\nCONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 19"

(Nasdaq: NOVT) (“Novanta” or the “Company”), a trusted technology partner to medical and advanced technology equipment manufacturers, today reported financial results for the third quarter 2024. \n\n**Financial Highlights** |  **Three Months Ended**  \n---|---  \n(In millions, except per share amounts)  |  **September 27,** |  **September 29,**  \n**2024** |  **2023**  \n**GAAP**  \nRevenue  |  $  |  244.4  |  $  |  221.5   \nOperating Income  |  $  |  32.6  |  $  |  30.3   \nNet Income  |  $  |  19.2  |  $  |  21.2   \nDiluted EPS  |  $  |  0.53  |  $  |  0.59   \n**Non-GAAP***  \nAdjusted Operating Income  |  $  |  46.8  |  $  |  43.0   \nAdjusted Diluted EPS  |  $  |  0.85  |  $  |  0.85   \nAdjusted EBITDA  |  $  |  57.0  |  $  |  52.2   \n  \n*Reconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures, as well as definitions for the non-GAAP financial measures included in this press release and the reasons for their use, are presented below. \n\n“Our team delivered strong third quarter results, at the top end of our guidance range, driven by the strength of our diversified business and the Novanta Growth System operating model,” said Matthijs Glastra, Chair and Chief Executive Officer. “The third quarter demonstrated continued sequential improvement in our revenue growth rate, and customer bookings increased 13% year-over-year for our core businesses. We also saw our minimally invasive surgery products achieve a book-to-bill ratio of 1.4 in the quarter, signaling positive momentum with our new product launches.” \n\n** Third Quarter **\n\nDuring the third quarter of 2024, Novanta generated GAAP revenue of $244.4 million, an increase of $22.9 million, or 10.3%, versus the third quarter of 2023. The Company’s acquisition activities resulted in an increase in revenue of $21.1 million, or 9.5%, compared to the third quarter of 2023. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates favorably impacted revenue by $1.8 million, or 0.8%, during the third quarter of 2024. Organic Revenue Growth, which excludes the net impact of acquisitions and changes in foreign currency exchange rates, was 0.0% for the third quarter of 2024 (see “Organic Revenue Growth” in the non-GAAP reconciliations below). \n\nIn the third quarter of 2024, GAAP operating income was $32.6 million, compared to $30.3 million in the third quarter of 2023. GAAP net income was $19.2 million in the third quarter of 2024, compared to $21.2 million in the third quarter of 2023. GAAP diluted earnings per share (“EPS”) was $0.53 in the third quarter of 2024, compared to $0.59 in the third quarter of 2023. Diluted weighted average shares outstanding was 36.1 million in the third quarter of 2024. \n\nAdjusted Diluted EPS was $0.85 in the third quarter of 2024, compared to $0.85 in the third quarter of 2023. Adjusted EBITDA was $57.0 million in the third quarter of 2024, compared to $52.2 million in the third quarter of 2023. \n\nOperating cash flow for the third quarter of 2024 was $23.0 million, compared to $44.6 million for the third quarter of 2023. \n\n** Financial Guidance **\n\n“While the macroeconomic environment throughout 2024 created some challenging dynamics with the timing of capital equipment purchases in the year, we believe we are well-positioned to benefit from a recovering investment climate in 2025 and beyond. Our Novanta team and our customers both remain committed to driving positive momentum from new product launches, which we believe will result in an improving and accelerating revenue and profit growth in 2025. Based on our customers’ expectations, backlog, and product launches, we expect Organic Revenue growth of up to 10% in 2025 compared to 2024.” \n\nFor the fourth quarter of 2024, the Company expects GAAP revenue of approximately $237 million to $242 million. The Company expects Adjusted Gross Profit Margin to be approximately 46.0%. The Company expects Adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $50 million to $52 million and Adjusted Diluted EPS to be in the range of $0.70 to $0.74. The Company’s guidance assumes no significant changes in foreign exchange rates. \n\nFor the full year 2024, the Company expects GAAP revenue of approximately $948 million to $953 million. The Company expects Adjusted Gross Profit Margin to be approximately 46.3%. The Company expects Adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $208 million to $210 million and Adjusted Diluted EPS to be in the range of $3.02 to $3.06. The Company’s guidance assumes no significant changes in foreign exchange rates. \n\nNovanta provides earnings guidance on a non-GAAP basis and does not provide earnings guidance on a GAAP basis, with the exception of GAAP revenue guidance. A reconciliation of the Company’s forward-looking Adjusted Gross Profit Margin, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Diluted EPS guidance to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures is not provided because of the inherent difficulty in forecasting and quantifying certain amounts that are necessary for such reconciliations, including acquisitions and related expenses; impact of purchase price allocations for recently completed acquisitions; future changes in the fair value of contingent considerations; future restructuring expenses; foreign exchange gains/(losses); significant discrete income tax expenses (benefits); benefits or expenses associated with the completion of tax audits; divestitures and related expenses; gains and losses from sale of real estate assets; costs related to product line closures; intangible asset impairment charges and related asset write-offs; and other charges reflected in the Company’s reconciliation of historical non-GAAP financial measures, the amounts of which, based on past experience, could be material. For additional information regarding Novanta’s non-GAAP financial measures, see “Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below. \n\n**Conference Call Information**\n\nThe Company will host a conference call on Tuesday, November 5, 2024 at 10:00 a.m. ET to discuss these results and to provide a business update. To access the call, please dial (888) 346-3959 prior to the scheduled conference call time. Alternatively, the conference call can be accessed online via a live webcast on the Events & Presentations page of the Investors section of the Company’s website at [www.novanta.com](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.novanta.com&esheet=54146889&newsitemid=20241105162002&lan=en-US&anchor=www.novanta.com&index=1&md5=391c84e2fd2e7eb3a1eaf5fec4c088d9). \n\nA replay of the audio webcast will be available approximately three hours after the conclusion of the call in the Investor Relations section of the Company’s website at [www.novanta.com](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.novanta.com&esheet=54146889&newsitemid=20241105162002&lan=en-US&anchor=www.novanta.com&index=2&md5=d8936c35cc5652338770a27c516fec01). The replay will remain available until Wednesday, January 1, 2025. \n\n**Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures**\n\nThe non-GAAP financial measures used in this press release are Organic Revenue Growth, Adjusted Gross Profit, Adjusted Gross Profit Margin, Adjusted Operating Income, Adjusted Operating Margin, Adjusted Income Before Income Taxes, Adjusted Income Tax Provision/(Benefit) and Effective Tax Rate, Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted Diluted EPS, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, Free Cash Flow, Free Cash Flow as a Percentage of Net Income, and Net Debt. \n\nThe Company believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful and supplementary information to investors regarding the operating performance of the Company. It is management’s belief that these non-GAAP financial measures would be particularly useful to investors because of the significant changes that have occurred outside of the Company’s day-to-day business in accordance with the execution of the Company’s strategy. This strategy includes streamlining the Company’s existing operations through site and functional consolidations, strategic divestitures and product line closures, expanding the Company’s business through significant internal investments, and broadening the Company’s product and service offerings through acquisitions of innovative and complementary technologies and solutions. The financial impact of certain elements of these activities, particularly acquisitions, divestitures, and site and functional restructurings, is often large relative to the Company’s overall financial performance and can adversely affect the comparability of its operating results and investors’ ability to analyze the business from period to period. \n\nThe Company’s Adjusted EBITDA, Organic Revenue Growth and Adjusted Gross Profit Margin are used by management to evaluate operating performance, communicate financial results to the Board of Directors, benchmark results against historical performance and the performance of peers, and evaluate investment opportunities, including acquisitions and divestitures. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA, Organic Revenue Growth and Adjusted Gross Profit Margin are used to determine bonus payments for senior management and employees. The Company has also used in the past, and may use in the future, Adjusted Diluted EPS and Adjusted EBITDA as performance targets for certain performance-based restricted stock units. Accordingly, the Company believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide greater transparency and insight into management’s method of analysis. \n\nNon-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as substitutes for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. They are limited in value because they exclude charges that have a material effect on the Company’s reported results and, therefore, should not be relied upon as the sole financial measures to evaluate the Company’s financial results. The non-GAAP financial measures are meant to supplement, and to be viewed in conjunction with, GAAP financial measures. Investors are encouraged to review the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures as provided in the tables accompanying this press release. \n\n**Safe Harbor and Forward-Looking Information**\n\n_Certain statements in this release are “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. All statements contained in this news release that do not relate to matters of historical fact should be considered forward-looking statements, and are generally identified by words such as “expect,” “intend,” “anticipate,” “estimate,” “believe,” “future,” “could,” “should,” “plan,” “aim,” and other similar expressions. These forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements regarding anticipated financial performance and financial position, including our financial outlook for the full years 2024 and 2025 and fourth quarter of 2024; expectations for our end markets and market position; macroeconomic expectations; our competitive position, including our positioning for long-term growth, capital spending and momentum from new product launches; and other statements that are not historical facts._\n\n_These forward-looking statements are neither promises nor guarantees, but involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements for many reasons, including, but not limited to, the following: economic and political conditions and the effects of these conditions on our customers’ businesses, capital expenditures and level of business activities; risks associated with epidemics, pandemics or other public health crises; our dependence upon our ability to respond to fluctuations in product demand; our ability to continuously innovate, to introduce new products in a timely manner, and to manage transitions to new product innovations effectively; customer order timing and other similar factors; disruptions or breaches in security of our or our third-party providers’ information technology systems; risks associated with our operations in foreign countries; our increased use of outsourcing in foreign countries; risks associated with increased outsourcing of components manufacturing; our exposure to increased tariffs, trade restrictions or taxes on our products; violations of our intellectual property rights and our ability to protect our intellectual property against infringement by third parties; risk of losing our competitive advantage; our failure to successfully integrate recent and future acquisitions into our business; our ability to attract and retain key personnel; our restructuring and realignment activities; product defects or problems integrating our products with other vendors’ products; disruptions in the supply of certain key components and other goods from our suppliers; our failure to accurately forecast component and raw material requirements leading to additional costs and significant delays in shipments; production difficulties and product delivery delays or disruptions; our exposure to extensive medical device regulations, which may impede or hinder the approval, certification or sale of our products and, in some cases, may ultimately result in an inability to obtain approval or certification of certain products or may result in the recall or seizure of previously approved or certified products; potential penalties for violating foreign and U.S. federal and state healthcare laws and regulations; impact of healthcare industry cost containment and healthcare reform measures; changes in governmental regulations related to our business or products; actual or perceived failures to comply with applicable data protection, privacy and security laws, regulations, standards, and other requirements; our failure to implement new information technology systems successfully; changes in foreign currency rates; our failure to realize the full value of our intangible assets; our reliance on original equipment manufacturer customers; increasing scrutiny and changing expectations from investors, customers, governments and other stakeholders and third parties with respect to corporate sustainability policies and practices; the effects of climate change and related regulatory responses; our exposure to the credit risk of some of our customers and in weakened markets; being subject to U.S. federal income taxation even though we are a non-U.S. corporation; changes in tax laws and fluctuations in our effective tax rates; any need for additional capital to adequately respond to business challenges or opportunities and repay or refinance our existing indebtedness, which may not be available on acceptable terms or at all; our existing indebtedness limiting our ability to engage in certain activities; volatility in the market price for our common shares; and our failure to maintain appropriate internal controls in the future._\n\n_Other important risk factors that could affect the outcome of the events set forth in these statements and that could affect the Company’s operating results and financial condition are discussed in Part I, Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, as updated by our subsequent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Such statements are based on the Company’s beliefs and assumptions and on information currently available to the Company. The Company disclaims any obligation to publicly update or revise any such forward-looking statements as a result of developments occurring after the date of this document except as required by law._\n\n**About Novanta**\n\nNovanta is a leading global supplier of core technology solutions that give medical and advanced industrial original equipment manufacturers a competitive advantage.

explanations for certain non-GAAP adjustments that may not be present in the quarterly disclosures included in the current earnings release but have been used by the Company in the two most recent fiscal years. See the tables above for the calculations of the non-GAAP financial measures used in this earnings release._\n\n**Organic Revenue Growth**\n\nThe Company defines the term “organic revenue” as revenue excluding the impact from business acquisitions, divestitures, product line discontinuations, and the effect of foreign currency translation. The Company uses the related term “organic revenue growth” to refer to the financial performance metric of comparing current period organic revenue with the reported revenue of the corresponding period in the prior year. The Company believes that this non-GAAP financial measure, when taken together with our GAAP financial measures, allows the Company and its investors to better measure the Company’s performance and evaluate long-term performance trends. Organic revenue growth also facilitates easier comparisons of the Company’s performance with prior and future periods and relative comparisons to its peers. The Company excludes the effect of foreign currency translation from these measures because foreign currency translation is subject to volatility and can obscure underlying business trends. The Company excludes the effect of acquisitions and divestitures because these activities can vary dramatically between reporting periods and between the Company and its peers, which the Company believes makes comparisons of long-term performance trends difficult for management and investors. Organic Revenue Growth is also used as a performance metric to determine bonus payments for senior management and employees. \n\n**Adjusted Gross Profit and Adjusted Gross Profit Margin**\n\nThe calculation of Adjusted Gross Profit and Adjusted Gross Profit Margin excludes amortization of acquired intangible assets because: (i) the amounts are non-cash; (ii) the Company cannot influence the timing and amount of future expense recognition; and (iii) excluding such expenses provides investors and management better visibility into the underlying trends and performance of our businesses. \n\n**Adjusted Operating Income and Adjusted Operating Margin**\n\nThe calculation of Adjusted Operating Income and Adjusted Operating Margin excludes amortization of acquired intangible assets for the reasons described above for Adjusted Gross Profit and Adjusted Gross Profit Margin. The Company also excludes officer transition costs, restructuring, and acquisition and related costs due to the significant changes that have occurred outside of the Company’s day-to-day business for the reasons described above in the introductory paragraphs of the “Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures.” \n\n**Adjusted Income Before Income Taxes**\n\nThe calculation of Adjusted Income Before Income Taxes excludes amortization of acquired intangible assets, officer transition costs, and restructuring, and acquisition and related costs for the reasons described above for Adjusted Operating Income and Adjusted Operating Margin. The Company also excludes foreign exchange transaction gains (losses) from the calculation of Adjusted Income Before Income Taxes as the Company cannot fully influence the timing and amount of foreign exchange transaction gains (losses). \n\n**Non-GAAP Income Tax Provision/(Benefit) and Effective Tax Rate**\n\nNon-GAAP Income Tax Provision/(Benefit) and Effective Tax Rate are calculated based on the Adjusted Income Before Income Taxes by jurisdiction, the applicable tax rates in effect for the respective jurisdictions and the income tax effect of non-GAAP adjustments discussed above. In addition, the Company excludes significant discrete income tax expenses (benefits) related to releases of valuation allowances and uncertain tax positions, tax audits, certain changes in tax laws, and acquisition related tax planning actions on the Company’s effective tax rate. \n\n**Adjusted Net Income**\n\nBecause Income Before Income Taxes is included in determining Net Income, the calculation of Adjusted Net Income also excludes amortization of acquired intangible assets, officer transition costs, restructuring, acquisition and related costs, and foreign exchange transaction gains (losses) for the reasons described above for Adjusted Income Before Income Taxes. In addition, the Company excludes (i) significant discrete income tax expenses (benefits) related to releases of valuation allowances and uncertain tax positions, tax audits or amendments to prior year returns, certain changes in tax laws, and acquisition related tax planning actions on the Company’s effective tax rate; and (ii) the income tax effect of non-GAAP adjustments discussed above. \n\n**Adjusted Diluted EPS**\n\nBecause Net Income is used in the calculation of Diluted EPS, Adjusted Diluted EPS excludes: (i) amortization of acquired intangible assets; (ii) officer transition costs; (iii) restructuring, acquisition and related costs; (iv) foreign exchange transaction gains (losses); (v) significant discrete income tax expenses (benefits) related to releases of valuation allowances, uncertain tax positions, tax audits or amendments to prior year returns, certain changes in tax laws, and acquisition related tax planning actions on the Company’s effective tax rate; and (vi) the income tax effect of non-GAAP adjustments for the reasons described above for Adjusted Net Income. \n\n**Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin**\n\nThe Company defines Adjusted EBITDA as income before deducting interest (income) expense, income tax provision (benefit), depreciation, amortization, non-cash share-based compensation, restructuring, acquisition and related costs, other non-operating (income) expense items, including foreign exchange transaction (gains) losses and net periodic pension costs of the Company’s frozen U.K. defined benefit pension plan for the reasons described above in the introductory paragraphs of the “Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures.” \n\nAdjusted EBITDA Margin is defined as Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of Revenue. \n\nIn evaluating Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin, you should be aware that in the future the Company may incur expenses that are the same as, or similar to, some of the adjustments in this presentation. \n\n**Free Cash Flow and Free Cash Flow as a Percentage of Net Income**\n\nThe Company defines Free Cash Flow as net cash provided by operating activities less cash paid for purchases of property, plant and equipment and plus cash proceeds from sales of property, plant and equipment. Free Cash Flow as a Percentage of Net Income is defined as Free Cash Flow divided by Net Income. Management believes these non-GAAP financial measures are important indicators of the Company’s liquidity as well as its ability to service its outstanding debt and to fund future growth. \n\n**Net Debt**\n\nThe Company defines Net Debt as its total debt as reported on the consolidated balance sheet plus unamortized deferred financing costs and less its cash and cash equivalents as of the end of the period presented. Management uses Net Debt to monitor the Company’s outstanding debt obligations that could not be satisfied by its cash and cash equivalents on hand. \n\n![](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=bwnews&sty=20241105162002r1&sid=q4-prod&distro=nx&lang=en)\n\n**Novanta Inc.** Investor Relations: Ray Nash (781) 266-5137 \n\nSource: Novanta Inc.\n\n[View All News](https://investors.novanta.com/news/default.aspx)\n\n## Contact Us\n\nRay Nash Corporate Finance Leader 781-266-5137  InvestorRelations@novanta.com\n\n## Quick Links\n\n  * [SEC Filings](https://investors.novanta.com/financials/sec-filings/default.aspx)\n  * [Annual Reports](https://investors.novanta.com/financials/annual-reports/default.aspx)\n  * [Financial Tables](https://investors.novanta.com/financials/financial-tables/default.aspx)\n  * [Investor Factsheet](//s24.q4cdn.com/409314640/files/doc_downloads/2023/06/Novanta-Inc_Investor-Fact-Sheet_June-2023.pdf)\n  * [Investor FAQs](https://investors.novanta.com/resources/investor-faqs/default.aspx)\n\n\n\n## Investor Email Alerts\n\nTo opt-in for investor email alerts, please enter your email address in the field below and select at least one alert option.

Basis of Presentation\nNovanta Inc. (collectively with its subsidiaries, referred to as “Novanta”, the “Company”, “we”, “us”, “our”) is a leading global supplier of core\ntechnology solutions that give medical and advanced industrial original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) a competitive advantage. Novanta combines deep\nproprietary technology expertise and competencies in precision medicine and manufacturing, medical solutions and robotics and automation with a proven\nability to solve complex technical challenges. This enables Novanta to engineer core components and sub-systems that deliver extreme precision and\nperformance, tailored to the customers’ demanding applications.\nThe accompanying unaudited interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared by the Company in United States (“U.S.”) dollars and\npursuant to the rules and regulations of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), the instructions to Form 10-Q and the provisions of\nRegulation S-X pertaining to interim financial statements. Accordingly, certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements\nprepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. have been condensed or omitted. The interim consolidated financial statements\nand notes included in this report should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes included in the Company’s Annual Report on\nForm 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. In the opinion of management, these interim consolidated financial statements include all adjustments and\naccruals of a normal and recurring nature necessary to fairly state the results of the interim periods presented. The results for interim periods are not necessarily\nindicative of results to be expected for the full year or for any future periods.\nThe Company’s unaudited interim consolidated financial statements are prepared for each quarterly period ending on the Friday closest to the end of the\ncalendar quarter, with the exception of the fourth quarter which always ends on December 31.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and\nassumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements, and\nthe reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. Estimates and assumptions are reviewed on an on-going basis and the effects of\nrevisions are reflected in the period in which such revisions are deemed to be necessary. The Company evaluates its estimates based on historical experience,\ncurrent conditions, and various other assumptions that it believes are reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ significantly from these\nestimates.\n6\nNOVANTA INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nAS OF SEPTEMBER 27, 2024\n(Unaudited)\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nThe following table provides a brief description of recent Accounting Standards Updates (“ASU”) issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board\n(“FASB”):\nEffect on the Financial Statements or\nStandard Description Effective Date Other Significant Matters\nIn November 2023, the FASB ASU 2023-07 clarifies or improves The amendments in ASU 2023-07 are The Company is currently evaluating\nissued ASU 2023-07, financial reporting by requiring disclosure effective for fiscal years beginning after the impact of ASU 2023-07 on its\n\"Segment Reporting (Topic of incremental segment information.

Revenue\nThe Company accounts for its revenue transactions in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 606, “Revenue from Contracts\nwith Customers,” which requires entities to recognize revenue in a way that depicts the transfer of control over goods or services to customers at an amount that\nreflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.\nThe Company recognizes revenue when control of promised goods or services is transferred to the customer. The transfer of control generally occurs\nupon shipment when title and risk of loss pass to the customer. The vast majority of the Company’s revenue is generated from the sale of distinct products.\nRevenue is measured as the amount of consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for such products, which is generally at contractually stated\nprices. Sales taxes and value added taxes collected concurrently with revenue generating activities are excluded from revenue.\nPerformance Obligations\nSubstantially all of the Company’s revenue is recognized at a point in time, upon shipment, rather than over time.\nAt the request of its customers, the Company may perform professional services, generally for the maintenance and repair of products previously sold to\nthose customers and for engineering services. Professional services are typically short in duration and aggregate to less than 3% of the Company’s consolidated\nrevenue. Revenue is typically recognized at a point in time when control transfers to the customer upon completion of professional services. These services\ngenerally involve a single distinct performance obligation. The consideration expected to be received in exchange for such services is normally the contractually\nstated amount.\nThe Company occasionally sells separately priced non-standard/extended warranty services or preventative maintenance plans with the sale of products.\nThe transfer of control over the service plans is over time. The Company recognizes the related revenue\n7\nNOVANTA INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nAS OF SEPTEMBER 27, 2024\n(Unaudited)\nratably over the terms of the service plans. The transaction price of a contract is allocated to each performance obligation based on its relative standalone selling\nprice. Standalone selling prices are generally determined based on the prices charged to customers or using the expected cost plus a margin.\nShipping & Handling Costs\nThe Company accounts for shipping and handling activities that occur after the transfer of control over the related goods as fulfillment activities rather\nthan performance obligations. Shipping and handling fees charged to customers are recognized as revenue and the related costs are recorded in cost of revenue at\nthe time of transfer of control.\nWarranties\nThe standard warranty periods for the Company’s products are typically 12 months to 36 months. The Company recognizes estimated liabilities\nassociated with standard warranty periods for its products in accordance with the provisions of ASC 450, “Contingencies,” as the Company has the ability to\nascertain the likelihood of the liabilities and can reasonably estimate the amount of the liabilities. A provision for the estimated cost related to standard\nwarranties is recorded as cost of revenue at the time revenue is recognized. The Company’s estimate of the costs to service the warranty obligations is based on\nhistorical experience and expectations of future conditions. To the extent that the Company’s experience in warranty claims or costs associated with servicing\nthose claims differ from the original estimates, revisions to the estimated warranty liabilities are recorded at that time, with offsetting adjustments to cost of\nrevenue.\nPractical Expedients and Exemptions\nThe Company expenses incremental direct costs of obtaining a contract when incurred because the expected amortization period is typically one year or\nless. These costs are recorded within selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statement of operations.\nThe Company does not adjust the promised amount of consideration for the effects of a financing component because the transfer of a promised good to\na customer and the customer’s payment for that good are typically one year or less. The Company does not disclose the value of the remaining performance\nobligation for contracts with an original expected length of one year or less.\nContract Liabilities\nContract liabilities consist of deferred revenue and advance payments from customers, including amounts that are refundable. These contract liabilities\nare classified as either current or long-term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet based on the timing of when the Company expects to recognize the\nrelated revenue. As of September 27, 2024 and December 31, 2023, contract liabilities were $8.3 million and $5.8 million, respectively, and are included in\naccrued expenses and other current liabilities and other liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The increase in the contract liability balance\nduring the nine months ended September 27, 2024 is primarily due to cash payments received in advance of satisfying performance obligations, partially offset\nby $4.5 million of revenue recognized during the period that was included in the contract liability balance as of December 31, 2023.\nDisaggregated Revenue\nSee Note 16 for the Company’s disaggregation of revenue by segment, geography and end market.\n3. Business Combinations\nOn January 2, 2024, the Company completed the acquisition of Motion Solutions Parent Corp. (“Motion Solutions”), an Irvine, California-based provider\nof highly engineered integrated solutions, specializing in proprietary precision motion and advanced motion control solutions, for a total purchase price of\n$192.0 million in cash, net of working capital adjustments. The acquisition was financed with borrowings under the Company’s revolving credit facility. The\naddition of Motion Solutions enhances the Company’s product portfolio and further expands its presence in attractive medical and precision medicine spaces.\nMotion Solutions is included in the Medical Solutions reportable segment.\n8\nNOVANTA INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nAS OF SEPTEMBER 27, 2024\n(Unaudited)\nAllocation of Purchase Price\nThe acquisition of Motion Solutions has been accounted for as a business combination. The purchase price is allocated based upon a valuation of the fair\nvalues of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Assets acquired and liabilities assumed have been recorded at their estimated fair values as of the acquisition\ndate. The excess of the purchase price over the fair values of the acquired tangible assets, identifiable intangible assets and assumed liabilities was recorded as\ngoodwill. The fair values of identifiable intangible assets were based on valuations using an income approach, specifically the multi-period excess earnings\nmethod for customer relationships and the relief-from-royalty method for developed technologies. The process for estimating the fair values of identifiable\nintangible assets requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions, including revenue growth rates, customer attrition rates, royalty rates, discount rates,\ntechnology obsolescence curves, and EBITDA margins. The Company’s estimates and assumptions in determining the estimated fair value of certain assets and\nliabilities are subject to change within the measurement period (up to one year from the acquisition date) as a result of additional information to be obtained with\nregard to facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date.\nBased upon the Company’s preliminary valuation, the purchase price for Motion Solutions was allocated as follows (in thousands):\nPurchase Price\nAllocation\nCash $ 776\nAccounts receivable 8,515\nInventory 14,032\nProperty, plant and equipment 3,126\nOperating lease assets 8,076\nIntangible assets 83,000\nGoodwill 106,569\nOther assets 1,002\nTotal assets acquired 225,096\nAccounts payable 5,305\nOperating lease liabilities 8,514\nDeferred tax liabilities 18,171\nOther liabilities 1,130\nTotal liabilities assumed 33,120\nTotal assets acquired, net of liabilities assumed 191,976\nLess: cash acquired 776\nPurchase price, net of cash acquired $ 191,200\nThe purchase price allocation is preliminary as the Company is in the process of collecting additional information. The estimated purchase price\nallocation previously disclosed in the Form 10-Q for the period ended March 29, 2024 was revised during the second and third quarter of 2024 as new\ninformation was received and analyzed resulting in an increase in Inventory of $0.5 million, an increase in Intangible assets of $2.6 million, an increase in Other\nassets of $0.4 million, an increase in Deferred tax liabilities of $0.6 million, an increase in Other liabilities of $0.7 million and a decrease in Goodwill of $2.2\nmillion.\nThe fair value of intangible assets for Motion Solutions is comprised of the following:\nEstimated Fair Amortization\nValue\nPeriod\n(In thousands)\nDeveloped technologies $ 34,400 7 years\nCustomer relationships 43,100 13 years\nBacklog 5,500 1 year\nTotal $ 83,000\nThe preliminary purchase price allocation resulted in $83.0 million of identifiable intangible assets and $106.6 million of goodwill. As the Motion\nSolutions acquisition was structured as a stock acquisition for income tax purposes, the goodwill is not\n9\nNOVANTA INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nAS OF SEPTEMBER 27, 2024\n(Unaudited)\ndeductible. The goodwill recorded represents the anticipated incremental value of future cash flows potentially attributable to: (i) Motion Solution’s ability to\ngrow the business with existing and new customers, including leveraging the Company’s customer base; (ii) Motion Solution’s ability to grow the business\nthrough new product introductions; and (iii) cost improvements due to the integration of Motion Solution’s operations into the Company’s existing\ninfrastructure.\nThe operating results of Motion Solutions were included in the Company’s results of operations beginning January 2, 2024. Motion Solutions contributed\nrevenues of $62.6 million and a loss before income taxes of $1.3 million to the Company’s operating results for the nine months ended September 27, 2024. The\nloss before income taxes from Motion Solutions for the period from the acquisition date through September 27, 2024 included amortization of inventory fair\nvalue adjustments of $2.8 million and amortization of purchased intangible assets of $9.7 million.\nUnaudited Pro Forma Information\nThe pro forma information for all periods presented below includes the effect of business combination accounting resulting from the acquisition of\nMotion Solutions, including amortization of inventory fair value adjustments, amortization of intangible assets, interest expense on borrowings in connection\nwith the acquisition, and the related tax effects, assuming that the acquisition had been consummated as of January 1, 2023.

Earnings per Common Share\nBasic earnings per common share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period.\nFully vested restricted stock units and deferred stock units granted to members of the Company’s Board of Directors are included in the calculation of weighted\naverage number of common shares outstanding.\n10\nNOVANTA INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nAS OF SEPTEMBER 27, 2024\n(Unaudited)\nFor diluted earnings per common share, the denominator includes the dilutive effect of outstanding common share equivalents. The dilutive effects of\noutstanding common share equivalents, including outstanding service-based restricted stock units, stock options and performance-based restricted stock units,\nare determined using the treasury stock method. Performance-based restricted stock units are considered contingently issuable shares, the vesting of which may\nbe based on achievement of specified company financial performance metrics (“attainment-based PSUs”), certain market conditions (“market-based PSUs”) or a\nhybrid of company financial performance metrics and market conditions (“hybrid PSUs”). The dilutive effects of market-based PSUs are included in the\nweighted average common share calculation based on the number of shares, if any, that would be issuable as of the end of the reporting period, assuming the end\nof the reporting period is also the end of the performance period. The dilutive effects of attainment-based and hybrid PSUs are included in the weighted average\ncommon share calculation based on the cumulative achievement against the performance targets only when the performance targets have been achieved as of the\nend of the reporting period.\nThe following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per common share (amounts in thousands, except per share data):\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 27, September 29, September 27, September 29,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nNumerators:\nNet income $ 19,192 $ 21,223 $ 47,623 $ 60,367\nDenominators:\nWeighted average common shares outstanding— basic 35,959 35,856 35,940 35,839\nDilutive common share equivalents 170 185 176 185\nWeighted average common shares outstanding— diluted 36,129 36,041 36,116 36,024\nAntidilutive common share equivalents excluded from above 102 49 113 101\nEarnings per Common Share:\nBasic $ 0.53 $ 0.59 $ 1.33 $ 1.68\nDiluted $ 0.53 $ 0.59 $ 1.32 $ 1.68\nFor the three and nine months ended September 27, 2024, 174 thousand shares of attainment-based PSUs and hybrid PSUs were excluded from the\ncalculation of the denominator because they were considered contingently issuable shares and the related performance targets had not been achieved as of\nSeptember 27, 2024.\nFor the three and nine months ended September 29, 2023, 143 thousand shares of attainment-based PSUs and hybrid PSUs were excluded from the\ncalculation of the denominator because they were considered contingently issuable shares and the related performance targets had not been achieved as of\nSeptember 29, 2023.\n6. Fair Value Measurements\nASC 820, “Fair Value Measurements,” establishes a fair value hierarchy based on three levels of inputs, of which the first two are considered observable\nand the third is considered unobservable:\n• Level 1: Quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets which the Company can access\n• Level 2: Observable inputs other than those described in Level 1\n• Level 3: Unobservable inputs\nCurrent Assets and Liabilities\nThe Company’s cash equivalents are highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less, which represent assets measured at fair\nvalue on a recurring basis. The Company determines the fair value of cash equivalents using a market approach based on quoted prices in active markets. The\nfair values of cash equivalents, accounts receivable, income taxes receivable, accounts payable, income taxes payable and accrued expenses and other current\nliabilities approximate their carrying values because of their short-term nature.\n11\nNOVANTA INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nAS OF SEPTEMBER 27, 2024\n(Unaudited)\nForeign Currency Contracts\nThe Company addresses market risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates through a risk management program that includes the use of\nderivative financial instruments to mitigate certain balance sheet foreign currency transaction exposures. The Company uses foreign currency forward contracts\nas a part of its strategy to manage exposures related to foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities. The fair value of these foreign currency\nforward contracts is reported either in other current assets or in other current liabilities as of the end of the period.\nSummary by Fair Value Hierarchy\nThe following table summarizes the fair values of the Company’s assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of September 27,\n2024 (in thousands):\nQuoted Prices in Significant Other\nActive Markets for Significant Other Unobservable\nIdentical Assets Observable Inputs Inputs\nFair Value (Level 1) (Level 2) (Level 3)\nAssets\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets:\nForeign currency forward contracts $ 14 $ — $ 14 $ —\n$ 14 $ — $ 14 $ —\nLiabilities\nAccrued expenses and other current liabilities:\nContingent considerations - Current $ 48 $ — $ — $ 48\nForeign currency forward contracts 250 — 250 —\nOther liabilities:\nContingent considerations - Long-term 313 — — 313\n$ 611 $ — $ 250 $ 361\nThe following table summarizes the fair values of the Company’s assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31,\n2023 (in thousands):\nQuoted Prices in Significant Other\nActive Markets for Significant Other Unobservable\nIdentical Assets Observable Inputs Inputs\nFair Value (Level 1) (Level 2) (Level 3)\nAssets\nCash equivalents $ 1,392 $ 1,392 $ — $ —\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets:\nForeign currency forward contracts 379 — 379 —\n$ 1,771 $ 1,392 $ 379 $ —\nLiabilities\nAccrued expenses and other current liabilities:\nContingent considerations - Current $ 48 $ — $ — $ 48\nForeign currency forward contracts 312 — 312 —\nOther liabilities:\nContingent considerations - Long-term 311 — — 311\n$ 671 $ — $ 312 $ 359\n12\nNOVANTA INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nAS OF SEPTEMBER 27, 2024\n(Unaudited)\nChanges in the fair value of Level 3 contingent considerations during the nine months ended September 27, 2024 were as follows (in thousands):\nAmount\nBalance at December 31, 2023 $ 359\nPayments —\nFair value adjustments —\nEffect of foreign exchange rates 2\nBalance at September 27, 2024 $ 361\nSee Note 10 to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of the estimated fair value of the Company’s outstanding debt.\n7. Foreign Currency Contracts\nThe Company addresses market risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates through a risk management program that includes the use of\nderivative financial instruments to mitigate certain foreign currency transaction exposures from future settlement of non-functional currency monetary assets and\nliabilities as of the end of a period. The Company does not enter into derivative transactions for speculative purposes. Gains and losses on these derivative\nfinancial instruments substantially offset losses and gains on the underlying hedged exposures and are included in foreign exchange transaction gains (losses) in\nthe consolidated statements of operations. Furthermore, the Company manages its exposures to counterparty risks on derivative instruments by entering into\ncontracts with a diversified group of major financial institutions and by actively monitoring outstanding positions.\nAs of September 27, 2024, the aggregate notional amount and fair value of the Company’s foreign currency forward contracts was $187.9 million and a\nnet loss of $0.2 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2023, the aggregate notional amount and fair value of the Company’s foreign currency forward\ncontracts was $172.3 million and a net gain of $0.1 million, respectively.\nThe Company recognized an aggregate net gain of $2.1 million and $4.3 million for the three and nine months ended September 27, 2024. The Company\nrecognized an aggregate net loss of $0.2 million and an aggregate net gain of $2.5 million for the three and nine months ended September 29, 2023. These\namounts were included in foreign exchange transaction gains (losses) in the consolidated statements of operations.\n8. Goodwill and Intangible Assets\nGoodwill\nGoodwill is recorded when the consideration paid for a business combination exceeds the fair value of net tangible and identifiable intangible assets\nacquired. The Company tests its goodwill balances for impairment annually as of the beginning of the second quarter or more frequently if indicators are present\nor changes in circumstances suggest that an impairment may exist. The Company performed the most recent annual goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible\nasset impairment test as of the beginning of the second quarter of 2024 and noted no impairment.\nThe following table summarizes changes in goodwill during the nine months ended September 27, 2024 (in thousands):\nAmount\nBalance at beginning of the period $ 484,507\nGoodwill acquired from Motion Solutions acquisition 106,569\nEffect of foreign exchange rate changes 3,012\nBalance at end of the period $ 594,088\n13\nNOVANTA INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nAS OF SEPTEMBER 27, 2024\n(Unaudited)\nGoodwill by reportable segment as of September 27, 2024 was as follows (in thousands):\nReportable Segment\nPrecision Medicine Robotics and\nand Manufacturing Medical Solutions Automation Total\nGoodwill $ 213,407 $ 276,676 $ 255,234 $ 745,317\nAccumulated impairment of goodwill (102,461) (31,722) (17,046) (151,229)\nTotal $ 110,946 $ 244,954 $ 238,188 $ 594,088\nGoodwill by reportable segment as of December 31, 2023 was as follows (in thousands):\nReportable Segment\nPrecision Medicine Robotics and\nand Manufacturing Medical Solutions Automation Total\nGoodwill $ 211,380 $ 169,738 $ 254,618 $ 635,736\nAccumulated impairment of goodwill (102,461) (31,722) (17,046) (151,229)\nTotal $ 108,919 $ 138,016 $ 237,572 $ 484,507\nIntangible Assets\nIntangible assets as of September 27, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, are summarized as follows (in thousands):\nSeptember 27, 2024 December 31, 2023\nGross Carrying Accumulated Net Carrying Gross Carrying Accumulated Net Carrying\nAmount Amortization Amount Amount Amortization Amount\nAmortizable intangible assets:\nPatents and developed technologies $ 223,048 $ (158,765) $ 64,283 $ 187,092 $ (146,342) $ 40,750\nCustomer relationships 270,286 (158,032) 112,254 225,183 (142,478) 82,705\nCustomer backlog 5,500 (4,125) 1,375 — — —\nTrademarks and trade names 23,861 (16,406) 7,455 23,628 (15,088) 8,540\nAmortizable intangible assets 522,695 (337,328) 185,367 435,903 (303,908) 131,995\nNon-amortizable intangible assets:\nTrade names 13,027 — 13,027 13,027 — 13,027\nTotal intangible assets $ 535,722 $ (337,328) $ 198,394 $ 448,930 $ (303,908) $ 145,022\nAll definite-lived intangible assets are amortized either on a straight-line basis or an economic benefit basis over their remaining estimated useful life.\nAmortization expense for patents and developed technologies is included in cost of revenue in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.\nAmortization expense for customer relationships and definite-lived trademarks, trade names and other intangibles is included in operating expenses in the\naccompanying consolidated statements of operations.

In the U.K., where longer lease terms are more common, the Company has a land lease\nthat extends through 2078. Certain leases include one or more options to renew the lease terms from one to ten years and options to terminate the leases within\none year. The exercise of lease renewal or termination options is at the Company’s sole discretion; therefore, the majority of renewal options to extend the lease\nterms are not included in the Company’s right-of-use assets and operating lease liabilities as they are not reasonably certain of being exercised. The Company\nregularly evaluates the renewal options and includes the renewal periods in the lease term when they are reasonably certain of being exercised. The depreciable\nlives of the right-of-use assets and leasehold improvements are limited to the expected lease terms.\nThe following table summarizes the components of lease costs (in thousands):\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 27, September 29, September 27, September 29,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nOperating lease cost $ 3,466 $ 2,639 $ 9,267 $ 7,916\nFinance lease cost\nAmortization of right-of-use assets 151 150 452 452\nInterest on lease liabilities 58 68 180 208\nVariable lease cost 303 227 895 787\nTotal lease cost $ 3,978 $ 3,084 $ 10,794 $ 9,363\n17\nNOVANTA INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nAS OF SEPTEMBER 27, 2024\n(Unaudited)\nThe following table provides additional details of balance sheet information related to the Company’s leases (in thousands, except lease term and\ndiscount rate):\nSeptember 27, December 31,\n2024 2023\nOperating leases\nOperating lease right-of-use assets $ 44,645 $ 38,302\nCurrent portion of operating lease liabilities $ 9,981 $ 8,189\nOperating lease liabilities 42,672 37,345\nTotal operating lease liabilities $ 52,653 $ 45,534\nFinance leases\nProperty, plant and equipment, gross $ 9,582 $ 9,582\nAccumulated depreciation (6,724) (6,272)\nFinance lease assets included in property, plant and equipment, net $ 2,858 $ 3,310\nAccrued expenses and other current liabilities $ 749 $ 718\nOther liabilities 3,369 3,934\nTotal finance lease liabilities $ 4,118 $ 4,652\nWeighted-average remaining lease term (in years):\nOperating leases 7.5 7.6\nFinance leases 4.8 5.5\nWeighted-average discount rate:\nOperating leases 4.78% 4.84%\nFinance leases 5.54% 5.54%\nThe following table provides additional details of cash flow information related to the Company’s leases (in thousands):\nNine Months Ended\nSeptember 27, September 29,\n2024 2023\nCash paid for lease liabilities:\nOperating cash outflows related to finance leases $ 180 $ 208\nOperating cash outflows related to operating leases $ 6,723 $ 5,916\nFinancing cash outflows related to finance leases $ 534 $ 484\nSupplemental non-cash information:\nRight-of-use assets obtained in exchange for new operating lease liabilities(1) $ 12,733 $ 3,893\n(1)The amount for the nine months ended September 27, 2024 includes $8.1 million of right-of-use assets acquired as part of the Motion\nSolutions acquisition.\n18\nNOVANTA INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nAS OF SEPTEMBER 27, 2024\n(Unaudited)\nFuture minimum lease payments under operating and finance leases expiring subsequent to September 27, 2024, including operating leases associated\nwith facilities that have been vacated as a result of the Company’s restructuring actions, are summarized as follows (in thousands):\nYear Ending December 31, Operating Leases Finance Leases\n2024 (remainder of year) $ 1,866 $ 238\n2025 11,888 954\n2026 10,445 979\n2027 8,949 1,003\n2028 6,204 1,003\nThereafter 25,183 503\nTotal minimum lease payments 64,535 4,680\nLess: Interest (11,882) (562)\nPresent value of lease liabilities $ 52,653 $ 4,118\n12.

These PSUs generally cliff vest on the first day following the end of the specified performance period.\nThe number of common shares to be issued upon settlement following vesting of attainment-based PSUs is determined based on the Company’s financial\nperformance metrics over the specified performance period against the targets established by the Company’s Board of Directors at the time of grant and will be\nin the range of zero to 200% of the target number of shares. The Company recognizes the related compensation expense ratably over the performance period\nbased on the number of shares that are deemed probable of vesting at the end of the specified performance period. This probability assessment is performed\nquarterly and the cumulative effect of a change in the estimated compensation expense, if any, is recognized in the consolidated statement of operations in the\nperiod in which such determination is made.\nThe number of common shares to be issued upon settlement following vesting of market-based PSUs is determined based on the relative market\nperformance of the Company’s common stock compared to the Russell 2000 Index over the specified performance period using a payout formula established by\nthe Company’s Board of Directors at the time of grant and will be in the range of zero to 200% of the target number of shares. The Company recognizes the\nrelated compensation expense based on the fair value of the market-based PSUs, determined using the Monte-Carlo valuation method as of the grant date, on a\nstraight-line basis from the grant date to the end of the specified performance period. Compensation expense on market-based PSUs will not be affected by the\nnumber of shares that will ultimately vest at the end of the specified performance period.\nThe number of common shares to be issued upon settlement following vesting of PSU awards that are based on the achievement of a hybrid of company\nfinancial performance metrics and market conditions (“Hybrid PSUs”) is determined based on the Company's financial performance metrics achieved over the\nspecified performance period against the targets established by the Company's Board of Directors at the time of grant and a market-based multiplier based on the\npercentile ranking of the relative market performance of the Company’s common stock compared to the Russell 2000 Index companies. The payout will be in\nthe range of zero to 260% of the target number of shares. The Company determines the fair value of these Hybrid PSUs using the Monte-Carlo valuation method\nas of the grant date. The Company recognizes compensation expense associated with the Hybrid PSUs ratably over the performance period based on the fair\nvalue of the PSUs as of the grant date and the number of shares that are deemed probable of vesting based on the estimated achievement of the pertinent\ncompany financial performance metrics at the end of the specified performance period. The probability assessment is performed quarterly and the cumulative\neffect of a change in the estimated compensation expense, if any, is recognized in the consolidated statement of operations in the period in which such\ndetermination is made.\n20\nNOVANTA INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nAS OF SEPTEMBER 27, 2024\n(Unaudited)\nThe table below summarizes the activities relating to the performance-based awards issued and outstanding under the Company’s Amended and Restated\n2010 Incentive Plan during the nine months ended September 27, 2024:\nWeighted\nShares\nAverage Grant-\n(In thousands)\nDate Fair Value\nUnvested at December 31, 2023 205 $ 160.24\nGranted 80 $ 177.06\nPerformance adjustments(1) 16 $ 166.64\nVested (45) $ 168.60\nForfeited (11) $ 168.05\nUnvested at September 27, 2024 245 $ 165.03\nExpected to vest as of September 27, 2024 228\n(1) The amount shown represents performance adjustments related to the performance-based awards vested during the nine\nmonths ended September 27, 2024.\nThe unvested PSUs are shown at target payout levels in the table above. As of September 27, 2024, the maximum number of common shares that could\nbe earned under these PSU grants was approximately 470 thousand shares.\nThe total fair value of PSUs that vested during the nine months ended September 27, 2024 was $7.5 million based on the market price of the underlying\ncommon shares on the date of vesting.\nThe grant-date fair value per unit of the hybrid PSUs granted during the nine months ended September 27, 2024 was estimated using the Monte Carlo\nvaluation method with the following assumptions:\nNine Months Ended\nSeptember 27, 2024\nGrant-date stock price $ 157.48\nExpected volatility 36.90%\nRisk-free interest rate 4.35%\nExpected annual dividend yield —\nFair value $ 180.98\nStock Options\nIn February 2024, the Company granted 53 thousand nonqualified stock options to certain members of the executive management team to purchase\ncommon shares of the Company at a strike price equal to the closing market price on the date of grant. The stock options vest ratably over three years on the\nanniversary of the date of grant and expire on the seventh anniversary of the date of grant. The Company estimates the fair value of stock options using the\nBlack-Scholes valuation model. The Company recognizes compensation expense related to the stock options on a straight-line basis over the vesting period in\nthe consolidated statement of operations.\nThe table below summarizes the activities relating to stock options issued and outstanding under the Company’s Amended and Restated 2010 Incentive\nPlan during the nine months ended September 27, 2024:\nShares Weighted\n(In thousands) Average Exercise Price\nOutstanding as of December 31, 2023 132 $ 102.86\nGranted 53 $ 157.48\nExercised (15) $ 14.13\nForfeited or expired — $ —\nOutstanding as of September 27, 2024 170 $ 128.03\nExercisable as of September 27, 2024 72\nExpected to vest as of September 27, 2024 98\n21\nNOVANTA INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nAS OF SEPTEMBER 27, 2024\n(Unaudited)\nThe aggregate Black-Scholes fair value of $3.3 million for the stock options granted during the nine months ended September 27, 2024 was estimated\nusing the following assumptions as of the grant date:\nNine Months Ended\nSeptember 27, 2024\nExpected option term in years 4.5\nExpected volatility 40.3%\nRisk-free interest rate 4.2%\nExpected annual dividend yield —\nThe expected option term was calculated using the simplified method permitted under Codification of Staff Accounting Bulletins Topic 14, “Share-Based\nPayment”. The expected volatility was determined based on the historical volatility of the Company’s common shares over the expected option term. The risk-\nfree interest rate was based on treasury instruments whose terms were six months longer than the expected option term. The expected annual dividend yield is\nzero as the Company does not have plans to issue dividends.\n13. Income Taxes\nThe Company determines its estimated annual effective tax rate at the end of each interim period based on full year forecasted pre-tax income and facts\nknown at that time. The estimated annual effective tax rate is applied to the year-to-date pre-tax income at the end of each interim period with the cumulative\neffect of any changes in the estimated annual effective tax rate being recorded in the period in which the changes are determined. The tax effect of significant\nunusual items is reflected in the period in which they occur. Since the Company is incorporated in Canada, it is required to use Canada’s statutory tax rate of\n29.0% in the determination of the estimated annual effective tax rate.\nThe Company maintains a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets associated with certain U.S. state net operating losses, credits and certain non-U.S.\ntax attributes that the Company has determined are not more likely than not to be realized. A valuation allowance is required when, based upon an assessment of\nvarious factors, including recent operating loss history, anticipated future earnings, and prudent and reasonable tax planning strategies, it is more likely than not\nthat some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. In conjunction with the Company’s ongoing review of its actual results and anticipated future\nearnings, the Company continuously reassesses the possibility of adding a new or additional valuation allowance or releasing the valuation allowance currently\nin place on its deferred tax assets.\nThe Company’s effective tax rate of 20.8% for the three months ended September 27, 2024 differs from the Canadian statutory tax rate of 29.0%\nprimarily due to the mix of income earned in jurisdictions with varying tax rates, estimated deductions for Foreign Derived Intangible Income, U.K. patent box\ndeductions and R&D tax credits, partially offset by disallowed compensation deductions, uncertain tax position accruals, and Pillar Two inclusion.\nThe Company’s effective tax rate of 18.3% for the nine months ended September 27, 2024 differs from the Canadian statutory tax rate of 29.0%\nprimarily due to the mix of income earned in jurisdictions with varying tax rates, estimated deductions for Foreign Derived Intangible Income, U.K. patent box\ndeductions, R&D tax credits, and windfall tax benefits upon vesting of share-based compensation awards, partially offset by disallowed compensation\ndeductions, uncertain tax position accruals, and Pillar Two inclusion. For the nine months ended September 27, 2024, the tax benefits upon vesting of certain\nshare-based compensation awards had a benefit of 3.1% on the Company’s effective tax rate.\nThe Company’s effective tax rate of 7.7% for the three months ended September 29, 2023 differs from the Canadian statutory tax rate of 29.0% primarily\ndue to the mix of income earned in jurisdictions with varying tax rates, estimated deductions for Foreign Derived Intangible Income, U.K. patent box\ndeductions, R&D tax credits, and windfall tax benefits upon vesting of share-based compensation awards, partially offset by disallowed compensation\ndeductions and uncertain tax position accruals.\nThe Company’s effective tax rate of 11.2% for the nine months ended September 29, 2023 differs from the Canadian statutory tax rate of 29.0%\nprimarily due to the mix of income earned in jurisdictions with varying tax rates, estimated deductions for Foreign Derived Intangible Income, U.K. patent box\ndeductions, R&D tax credits, and windfall tax benefits upon vesting of share-based compensation awards, partially offset by disallowed compensation\ndeductions and uncertain tax position accruals. For the nine months ended September 29, 2023, the tax benefits upon vesting of certain share-based\ncompensation awards had a benefit of 4.5% on the Company’s effective tax rate.\n22\nNOVANTA INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nAS OF SEPTEMBER 27, 2024\n(Unaudited)\n14.

Commitments and Contingencies\nPurchase Commitments\nThere have been no material changes to the Company’s purchase commitments since December 31, 2023.\nLegal Contingencies\nThe Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business. The Company reviews the status of each\nsignificant matter and assesses the potential financial exposure on a quarterly basis. If the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered\nprobable and the amount can be reasonably estimated, the Company accrues a liability for the estimated loss. Significant judgment is required in both the\ndetermination of probability and the determination as to whether an exposure is reasonably estimable. Because of uncertainties related to these matters, accruals\nare based only on the best information available as of the date of the consolidated balance sheet. As additional information becomes available, the Company\nreassesses the potential liability related to any pending claims and litigation and may revise its estimates. When a material loss contingency is considered\nreasonably possible but not probable, the Company does not record a liability, but instead discloses the nature and the amount of the claim, and an estimate of\nthe potential loss or a range of potential losses, if such an estimate can be reasonably made. Legal fees are expensed as incurred. The Company does not believe\nthat the outcome of outstanding claims will have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial statements but there can be no assurance that any such\nclaims, or any similar claims, would not have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial statements.\nGuarantees and Indemnifications\nIn the normal course of its operations, the Company executes agreements that provide for indemnification and guarantees to counterparties in\ntransactions such as business dispositions, sale of assets, sale of products, and operating leases. Additionally, the by-laws of the Company require it to indemnify\ncertain current or former directors, officers, and employees of the Company against expenses incurred by them in connection with each proceeding in which\nthey are involved as a result of serving or having served in certain capacities. Indemnification is not available with respect to a proceeding as to which it has\nbeen adjudicated that the person did not act in good faith in the reasonable belief that the action was in the best interests of the Company. Certain of the\nCompany’s officers and directors are also a party to indemnification agreements with the Company. These indemnification agreements provide, among other\nthings, that the director or officer shall be indemnified to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law against all expenses, judgments, fines and amounts paid\nin settlement actually and reasonably incurred by such director or officer in connection with any proceeding by reason of their relationship with the Company. In\naddition, the indemnification agreements provide for the advancement of expenses incurred by such director or officer in connection with any proceeding\ncovered by the indemnification agreement, subject to the conditions set forth therein and to the extent such advancement is not prohibited by law. The\nindemnification agreements also set out the procedures for determining entitlement to indemnification, the requirements relating to notice and defense of claims\nfor which indemnification is sought, the procedures for enforcement of indemnification rights, the limitations on and exclusions from indemnification, and the\nminimum levels of directors and officers liability insurance to be maintained by the Company.\n16. Segment Information\nReportable Segments\nThe Company’s Chief Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”) utilizes certain financial information to make decisions about allocating resources and\nassessing performance for the entire Company.

The reportable\nsegments and their principal activities are summarized below.\nPrecision Medicine and Manufacturing\nOur Precision Medicine and Manufacturing segment designs, manufactures and markets photonics-based solutions, including laser scanning, laser beam\ndelivery, CO2 laser, solid state laser, ultrafast laser, and optical light engine products to customers worldwide. The segment serves highly demanding photonics-\nbased applications for advanced industrial processes, medical and life science imaging, DNA sequencing, and medical laser procedures, particularly\nophthalmology applications. The vast majority of the segment’s product offerings are sold to OEM customers. The segment sells these products both directly,\nutilizing a highly technical sales force, and indirectly, through resellers and distributors.\nMedical Solutions\nOur Medical Solutions segment designs, manufactures and markets a range of medical grade technologies, including medical insufflators, pumps and\nrelated disposables; visualization solutions; wireless technologies, video recorder and video integration technologies for operating room integrations; optical\ndata collection and machine vision technologies; radio frequency identification (“RFID”) technologies; thermal chart recorders; spectrometry technologies;\nembedded touch screen solutions; and high precision customized subsystems. The vast majority of the segment’s product offerings are sold to OEM customers.\nThe segment sells these products directly, utilizing a highly technical sales force, and indirectly, through resellers and distributors.\nRobotics and Automation\nOur Robotics and Automation segment designs, manufactures and markets optical and inductive encoders, precision motors, servo drives and motion\ncontrol solutions, integrated stepper motors, intelligent robotic end-of-arm technology solutions, and air bearing spindles to customers worldwide. The vast\nmajority of the segment’s product offerings are sold to OEM customers. The segment sells these products directly, utilizing a highly technical sales force, and\nindirectly, through resellers and distributors.\nEnd Markets\nWe primarily operate in two end markets: the medical market and the advanced industrial market.\nMedical Market\nFor the nine months ended September 27, 2024, the medical market accounted for approximately 56% of our revenue. Revenue from our products sold to\nthe medical market is generally affected by hospital and other healthcare provider capital spending, growth rates of surgical procedures, changes in regulatory\nrequirements and laws, aggregation of purchasing by healthcare networks, changes in technology requirements, timing of OEM customers’ product development\nand new product launches, changes in customer or patient preferences, and general demographic trends.\n28\nAdvanced Industrial Market\nFor the nine months ended September 27, 2024, the advanced industrial market accounted for approximately 44% of our revenue. Revenue from our\nproducts sold to the advanced industrial market is affected by several factors, including changing technology requirements and preferences of our customers,\nproductivity or quality investments in a manufacturing environment, financial conditions of our customers, changes in regulatory requirements and laws, and\ngeneral economic conditions. We believe that the PMI on manufacturing activities specific to different regions around the world may provide an indication of\nthe impact of general economic conditions on our sales into the advanced industrial market.\nStrategy\nOur strategy is to drive sustainable, profitable growth through short-term and long-term initiatives, including:\n• disciplined focus on our diversified business model of providing functionality to long life-cycle OEM customer platforms in attractive medical\nand advanced industrial niche markets;\n• improving our business mix to increase medical sales as a percentage of total revenue by:\n- introducing new products aimed at attractive medical applications, such as minimally invasive and robotic surgery, ophthalmology,\npatient monitoring, drug delivery, clinical laboratory testing and life science equipment;\n- deepening our key account management relationships with and driving cross selling of our product offerings to leading medical\nequipment manufacturers; and\n- pursuing complementary medical technology acquisitions;\n• increasing our penetration of high growth advanced industrial applications, such as laser materials processing, intelligent end-of-arm robotic\ntechnology solutions, robotics, laser additive manufacturing, automation and metrology, by working closely with OEM customers to launch\napplication specific products that closely match the requirements of each application;\n• broadening our portfolio of enabling proprietary technologies and capabilities through increased investment in new product development, and\ninvestments in application development to further penetrate existing customers, while expanding the applicability of our solutions to new\nmarkets;\n• broadening our product and service offerings through the acquisition of innovative and complementary technologies and solutions in medical and\nadvanced industrial technology applications;\n• expanding sales and marketing channels to reach new target customers;\n• improving our existing operations to expand profit margins and improve customer satisfaction by implementing lean manufacturing principles,\nstrategic sourcing across our major production sites; and optimizing and limiting the growth of our fixed cost base; and\n• attracting, retaining, and developing world-class talented, diverse, and motivated employees.\nSignificant Events and Updates\nAcquisition of Motion Solutions\nOn January 2, 2024, we completed the acquisition of Motion Solutions Parent Corp. (“Motion Solutions”), an Irvine, California-based provider of highly\nengineered integrated solutions, specializing in proprietary precision motion and advanced motion control solutions, for a total purchase price of $192.0 million\nin cash, net of working capital adjustments. The acquisition was financed with borrowings under our revolving credit facility. The addition of Motion Solutions\nenhances our product portfolio and further expands our presence in attractive medical and precision medicine spaces. The Motion Solutions acquisition is\nincluded in our Medical Solutions reportable segment.\nBusiness Environment\nInflationary Pressures\nDuring the nine months ended September 27, 2024, we continued to experience higher than normal inflation of raw material and component prices and\nlabor costs. We have generally been able to offset increases in these costs through various productivity cost reduction initiatives, as well as increasing our selling\nprices to pass through some of these higher costs to our customers. Given the timing of our actions compared to the timing of these inflationary pressures, there\nmay be periods during which we are unable to fully\n29\nrecover the increases in our costs. Additionally, the inflationary pressures gave rise to significant increases in interest rates in recent periods as various\ngovernments used monetary policy to contain and reduce inflation. As a result, our year to date weighted average interest rate increased from approximately\n6.1% as of September 29, 2023 to approximately 6.7% as of September 27, 2024. These higher interest rates have caused access to credit to be more expensive\nand have impacted demand from some of our OEM customers, as they see some of their end market customers deferring new capital equipment orders due to\nthe higher interest rate environment.\nGeopolitical Conflicts\nIn February 2022, Russian forces invaded Ukraine. In response, the U.S., the European Union (“EU”), and several other countries imposed economic and\ntrade sanctions and other restrictions (collectively, “global sanctions”) targeting Russia and Belarus. Russia then imposed retaliatory economic measures against\nthe U.S., the EU, and several other countries. Our historical sales to Russia were not material. We also do not have any assets, employees or third-party\ncontractors in Russia or Ukraine. However, the duration of the conflict and further sanctions could have further impact on the global economy and inflation.\nIn early October 2023, Israel declared war on Hamas. We are monitoring the social, political and economic environment in Israel and in the region for\nany impact on our businesses. Our historical sales to Israel were around 1% of our total sales. We do not have any assets, employees, or third-party contractors\nin Israel. Due to the uncertainty around the duration of the conflict, future impacts are unknown to our businesses.\nResults of Operations for the Three and Nine Months Ended September 27, 2024 Compared with the Three and Nine Months Ended September 29,\n2023\nOverview of Financial Results\nTotal revenue of $244.4 million for the three months ended September 27, 2024 increased $22.9 million, or 10.3%, from the prior year period primarily\ndue to revenue from the Motion Solutions acquisition.

The weighted average interest rate on our senior credit facilities was 6.68%\nduring the nine months ended September 27, 2024, versus 6.12% during the prior year period.\nForeign Exchange Transaction Gains (Losses), Net\nForeign exchange transaction gains (losses) were nominal for both the three and nine months ended September 27, 2024 and the three and nine months\nended September 29, 2023.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nNet other expense was nominal for both the three and nine months ended September 27, 2024 and the three and nine months ended September 29, 2023.\nIncome Tax Provision (Benefit)\nOur effective tax rate for the three months ended September 27, 2024 was 20.8%, versus 7.7% for the prior year period. Our effective tax rate of 20.8%\nfor the three months ended September 27, 2024 differs from the Canadian statutory tax rate of 29.0% primarily due to the mix of income earned in jurisdictions\nwith varying tax rates, estimated deductions for Foreign Derived Intangible Income, U.K. patent box deductions and R&D tax credits, partially offset by\ndisallowed compensation deductions, uncertain tax position accruals, and Pillar Two inclusion.\nOur effective tax rate for the three months ended September 29, 2023 of 7.7% differs from the Canadian statutory tax rate of 29.0% primarily due to the\nmix of income earned in jurisdictions with varying tax rates, estimated deductions for Foreign Derived Intangible Income, U.K. patent box deductions, R&D tax\ncredits, and windfall tax benefits upon vesting of share-based compensation awards, partially offset by disallowed compensation deductions and uncertain tax\nposition accruals.\nOur effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 27, 2024 was 18.3%, versus 11.2% for the prior year period. Our effective tax rate of 18.3%\nfor the nine months ended September 27, 2024 differs from the Canadian statutory tax rate of 29.0% primarily due to the mix of income earned in jurisdictions\nwith varying tax rates, estimated deductions for Foreign Derived Intangible\n35\nIncome, U.K. patent box deductions, R&D tax credits, and windfall tax benefits upon vesting of share based compensation awards, partially offset by disallowed\ncompensation deductions, uncertain tax position accruals, and Pillar Two inclusion. For the nine months ended September 27, 2024, the tax benefits upon\nvesting of certain share-based compensation awards had a benefit of 3.1% on our effective tax rate.\nOur effective tax rate of 11.2% for the nine months ended September 29, 2023 differs from the Canadian statutory tax rate of 29.0% primarily due to the\nmix of income earned in jurisdictions with varying tax rates, estimated deductions for Foreign Derived Intangible Income, U.K. patent box deductions, R&D tax\ncredits and windfall tax benefits upon vesting of share based compensation awards, partially offset by disallowed compensation deductions and uncertain tax\nposition accruals. For the nine months ended September 29, 2023, the tax benefits upon vesting of certain share-based compensation awards had a benefit of\n4.5% on our effective tax rate.\nOn December 12, 2022, the EU member states agreed to implement the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development’s (“OECD”) Pillar\nTwo Model Rules. These rules, which impose a global corporate minimum income tax rate of 15%, have been enacted or introduced in proposed legislation in\n35 countries. Additional countries are actively considering changes to their tax laws to adopt certain parts of the OECD’s proposals. We have estimated the\nimpact of this minimum tax in our effective tax rate analysis, and it does not have a material impact on our financial results in the current period. We continue to\nclosely monitor the progression of legislative activities.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund our operating, investing, and financing activities. Our primary ongoing cash\nrequirements are funding operations, capital expenditures, investments in businesses, and repayment of our debt and related interest payments. Our primary\nsources of liquidity are cash flows from operations and borrowings under our revolving credit facility. We believe our future operating cash flows will be\nsufficient to meet our future operating and capital expenditure cash needs for the foreseeable future, including at least the next 12 months. The availability of\nborrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility provides another potential source of liquidity for any future capital expenditures and other liquidity needs.\nIn addition, we have the ability to expand our borrowing capacity by up to $350.0 million by exercising the accordion option under our revolving credit\nagreement. We may also seek to raise additional capital, which could be in the form of bonds, convertible debt or preferred or common equity, to fund business\ndevelopment activities or other future investing cash requirements, subject to approval by the lenders in the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (as\namended, the “Credit Agreement”). There is no assurance that such capital will be available on reasonable terms or at all.\nSignificant factors affecting the management of our ongoing cash requirements are the adequacy of available bank lines of credit and our ability to attract\nlong term capital with satisfactory terms. The sources of our liquidity are subject to all of the risks of our business and could be adversely affected by, among\nother factors, risks associated with events outside of our control, such as economic consequences of geopolitical conflicts, monetary policy changes in the U.S.\nand other countries and their impact on the global financial markets, a decrease in demand for our products, our ability to integrate current and future\nacquisitions, deterioration in certain financial ratios, availability of borrowings under our revolving credit facility, and other market changes in general. See\n“Risks Relating to Our Common Shares and Our Capital Structure” included in Part I, Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended\nDecember 31, 2023.\nOur cash requirements primarily consist of principal and interest payments associated with our Senior Credit Facilities (as defined below), operating and\nfinance leases, purchase commitments, and pension obligations. Such contractual obligations are described in our Management’s Discussion and Analysis of\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations and in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, each included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the\nfiscal year ended December 31, 2023. Through September 27, 2024, we have not entered into any other material new or modified contractual obligations since\nDecember 31, 2023.\nOur ability to make payments on our indebtedness and to fund our operations may be dependent upon the operating income and the distribution of funds\nfrom our subsidiaries. However, as local laws and regulations and/or the terms of our indebtedness restrict certain of our subsidiaries from paying dividends and\ntransferring assets to us, there is no assurance that our subsidiaries will be permitted to provide us with sufficient dividends, distributions or loans when\nnecessary.\nAs of September 27, 2024, $55.9 million of our $92.7 million cash and cash equivalents was held by subsidiaries outside of Canada and the U.S.\nGenerally, our intent is to use cash held in these foreign subsidiaries to fund our local operations or acquisitions by those local subsidiaries and to pay down\nborrowings under our Senior Credit Facilities. Approximately $93.8 million of our outstanding term loan and revolver borrowings under our Senior Credit\nFacilities were held in our subsidiaries outside of Canada and the U.S. as of September 27, 2024. Additionally, we may use intercompany loans to address short-\nterm cash flow needs for various subsidiaries.\n36\nSenior Credit Facilities\nIn December 2019, we entered into the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (as amended from time to time, the “Credit Agreement”),\noriginally consisting of a $100.0 million U.S. dollar equivalent euro-denominated (approximately €90.2 million) 5-year term loan facility and a $350.0 million\n5-year revolving credit facility (collectively, the “Senior Credit Facilities”). The Senior Credit Facilities had an original maturity date of December 2024 and\nincluded an uncommitted accordion option pursuant to which the commitments under the revolving credit facility may be increased by an additional $200.0\nmillion in aggregate, subject to certain customary conditions. The term loan facility requires quarterly scheduled principal repayments of approximately €1.1\nmillion beginning in March 2020 with the remaining principal balance due upon maturity. We may make additional principal payments at any time, which will\nreduce the next quarterly installment payment due. We may pay down outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility with cash on hand and cash\ngenerated from future operations at any time.\nOn March 27, 2020, we entered into an amendment (the “First Amendment”) to the Credit Agreement and exercised a portion of the uncommitted\naccordion option. The First Amendment increased the revolving credit facility commitment under the Credit Agreement by $145.0 million, from $350.0 million\nto $495.0 million, and reset the uncommitted accordion option to $200.0 million for potential future expansion.\nOn October 5, 2021, we entered into an amendment (the “Fourth Amendment”) to the Credit Agreement to exercise the accordion option. The Fourth\nAmendment increased the revolving credit facility commitment under the Credit Agreement by $200.0 million, from $495.0 million to $695.0 million, and reset\nthe uncommitted accordion option to $200.0 million for potential future expansion.\nOn March 10, 2022, we entered into an amendment (the “Fifth Amendment”) to the Credit Agreement to extend the maturity date thereof from December\n31, 2024 to March 10, 2027, update the pricing grid, replace LIBOR with SOFR as the reference rate for U.S. dollar borrowings, and increase the uncommitted\naccordion option from $200 million to $350 million.\nAs of September 27, 2024, we had $76.6 million term loan and $383.8 million revolver borrowings outstanding under our Senior Credit Facilities. The\nborrowings outstanding under the Senior Credit Facilities bear interest at rates based on (a) the Base Rate, as defined in the Credit Agreement, plus a margin\nranging between 0.00% and 0.75% per annum, determined by reference to our consolidated leverage ratio, or (b) the Term SOFR Screen Rate, the Alternative\nCurrency Daily Rate or the Alternative Currency Term Rate, as defined in the Credit Agreement, plus a margin ranging between 0.75% and 1.75% per annum,\ndetermined by reference to our consolidated leverage ratio. In addition, we are obligated to pay a commitment fee on the unused portion of the revolving credit\nfacility, ranging between 0.20% and 0.30% per annum, determined by reference to our consolidated leverage ratio. As of September 27, 2024, we had\noutstanding borrowings under the Credit Agreement denominated in Euro and U.S. dollars of $93.8 million and $366.5 million, respectively.\nThe Credit Agreement contains various covenants that we believe are usual and customary for this type of agreement, including a maximum consolidated\nleverage ratio and a minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement). The following table summarizes these financial\ncovenants and our compliance therewith as of September 27, 2024:\nRequirement Actual\nMaximum consolidated leverage ratio (1) 3.50 2.08\nMinimum consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio 1.50 4.29\n(1)Maximum consolidated leverage ratio shall be increased to 4.00 for four consecutive quarters following a designated\nacquisition, as defined in the Fifth Amendment.\nShare Repurchase Plans\nOur Board of Directors may approve share repurchase plans from time to time. Under these repurchase plans, shares may be repurchased at our\ndiscretion based on ongoing assessment of the capital needs of the business, the market price of our common shares, and general market conditions. Shares may\nalso be repurchased through an accelerated share purchase agreement, on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions in accordance with applicable\nfederal securities laws. Repurchases may be made under certain SEC regulations, which would permit common shares to be repurchased when we would\notherwise be prohibited from doing so under insider trading laws. While the share repurchase plans are generally intended to offset dilution from equity awards\ngranted to our employees and directors, the plans do not obligate us to acquire any particular amount of common shares. No time limit is typically set for the\ncompletion of the share repurchase plans, and the plans may be suspended or discontinued at any time. We expect to fund share repurchases through cash on\nhand and cash generated from operations.\nIn February 2020, our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase plan (the “2020 Repurchase Plan”) authorizing the repurchase of $50.0 million\nworth of common shares. Share repurchases have been made under the 2020 Repurchase Plan pursuant to\n37\nRule 10b-18 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. We did not repurchase any shares during the nine months ended September 27, 2024. We had $49.5\nmillion available for share repurchases under the 2020 Repurchase Plan as of September 27, 2024.\nCash Flows for the Nine Months Ended September 27, 2024 and September 29, 2023\nThe following tables summarize our cash flows, cash and cash equivalents, and unused and available funds under our revolving credit facility for the\nperiods indicated (in thousands):\nNine Months Ended\nSeptember 27, September 29,\n2024 2023\nNet cash provided by operating activities $ 96,950 $ 81,083\nNet cash used in investing activities $ (206,113) $ (13,741)\nNet cash provided by (used in) financing activities $ 92,559 $ (92,783)\nSeptember 27, December 31,\n2024 2023\nCash and cash equivalents $ 92,690 $ 105,051\nUnused and available funds under the revolving credit facility $ 311,228 $ 416,596\nOperating Cash Flows\nCash provided by operating activities was $97.0 million for the nine months ended September 27, 2024, versus $81.1 million for the prior year period.\nCash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 27, 2024 increased from the prior year period primarily as a result of less cash paid\nfor income taxes.\nInvesting Cash Flows\nCash used in investing activities was $206.1 million for the nine months ended September 27, 2024, primarily driven by $191.2 million cash\nconsideration, net of cash acquired and net working capital adjustments for the Motion Solutions acquisition. We also paid $14.9 million for capital\nexpenditures.\nCash used in investing activities was $13.7 million for the nine months ended September 29, 2023, all related to capital expenditures.\nWe expect to use an aggregate of approximately $18 million to $20 million in 2024 for capital expenditures related to investments in new property, plant\nand equipment for our existing businesses.\nFinancing Cash Flows\nCash provided by financing activities was $92.6 million for the nine months ended September 27, 2024, primarily driven by $198.0 million of\nborrowings under our revolving credit facility to fund the Motion Solutions acquisition, partially offset by $96.0 million of term loan and revolving credit\nfacility repayments and $8.9 million of payroll tax payments upon vesting of share-based compensation awards.\nCash used in financing activities was $92.8 million for the nine months ended September 29, 2023, primarily due to $82.0 million of term loan and\nrevolving credit facility repayments and $10.2 million of payroll tax payments upon vesting of share-based compensation awards.\n38\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe critical accounting policies that we believe impact significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial\nstatements presented in this periodic report on Form 10-Q are described in our Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of\nOperations and in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, each included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31,\n2023. There have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates through September 27, 2024 from those disclosed in our Annual\nReport on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 1 to Unaudited Interim Consolidated Financial Statements.\nItem 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nOur primary market risk exposures are foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and interest rate sensitivity. During the three months ended September\n27, 2024, there have been no material changes to the information included under Part II, Item 7A, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market\nRisk,” of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023.\nItem 4.

Based upon this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and\nChief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 27, 2024.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThere has been no change to our internal control over financial reporting during the fiscal quarter ended September 27, 2024 that has materially affected,\nor is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\n39\nPART II—OTHER INFORMATION\nItem 1. Legal Proceedings\nWe are subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business. We do not believe that the outcome of these claims\nwill have a material adverse effect upon our financial condition or results of operations but there can be no assurance that any such claims, or any similar claims,\nwould not have a material adverse effect upon our financial condition or results of operations.\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\nOur risk factors are described in Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors”, of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023.
