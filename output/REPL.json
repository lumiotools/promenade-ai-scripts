In addition, in lieu of common stock to certain investors, Replimune today announced the pricing of its public offering of pre-funded warrants to purchase 3,846,184 shares of its common stock at a purchase price of $12.9999 per pre-funded warrant, which equals the public offering price per share of the common stock less the $0.0001 per share exercise price of each pre-funded warrant. The aggregate gross proceeds from the offering are expected to be approximately $140 million, before deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses payable by Replimune. All securities in the offering are being offered by Replimune. In addition, Replimune has granted the underwriter a 30-day option to purchase up to an additional 1,615,377 shares of its common stock from Replimune at the public offering price, less the underwriting discounts and commissions. The offering is expected to close on November 27, 2024, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions.\n\nLeerink Partners is acting as sole bookrunning manager for the offering.\n\nA preliminary prospectus supplement relating to and describing the terms of the offering was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on November 25, 2024. The final prospectus supplement relating to the offering will be filed with the SEC. Copies of the final prospectus supplement and the accompanying prospectus relating to the offering may be obtained, when available, by visiting EDGAR on the SEC website at [www.sec.gov](http://www.sec.gov). Alternatively, copies of the preliminary prospectus supplement and the accompanying prospectus, when available, may be obtained from Leerink Partners LLC, Attention: Syndicate Department, 53 State Street, 40th Floor, Boston, Massachusetts 02109, by telephone at + 1 (800) 808-7525, ext. 6105, or by email at syndicate@leerink.com.

Replimune’s proprietary RPx platform is based on a potent HSV-1 backbone intended to maximize immunogenic cell death and the induction of a systemic anti-tumor immune response. The RPx platform is designed to have unique dual local and systemic activity consisting of direct selective virus-mediated killing of the tumor resulting in the release of tumor derived antigens and altering of the tumor microenvironment to ignite a strong and durable systemic response. The RPx product candidates are expected to be synergistic with most established and experimental cancer treatment modalities, leading to the versatility to be developed alone or combined with a variety of other treatment options.\n\n**Forward-Looking Statements**\n\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, including statements regarding the timing of closing of our public offering, the gross proceeds we expect to receive from our public offering and other statements identified by words such as “could,” “expects,” “intends,” “may,” “plans,” “potential,” “should,” “will,” “would,” or similar expressions and the negatives of those terms. Forward-looking statements are not promises or guarantees of future performance, and are subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control, and which could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated in such forward-looking statements. These factors include risks related to our limited operating history, our ability to generate positive clinical trial results for our product candidates, the costs and timing of operating our in-house manufacturing facility, the timing and scope of regulatory approvals, the availability of combination therapies needed to conduct our clinical trials, changes in laws and regulations to which we are subject, competitive pressures, our ability to identify additional product candidates, political and global macro factors including the impact of the coronavirus as a global pandemic and related public health issues and the Russian-Ukrainian and Israel-Hamas political and military conflicts, and other risks as may be detailed from time to time in our Annual Reports on Form 10-K and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and other reports we file with the SEC, and in the preliminary prospectus supplement and the accompanying prospectus, once filed with the SEC.

(NASDAQ: REPL), a clinical stage biotechnology company pioneering the development of novel oncolytic immunotherapies, today announced that it has submitted a biologics license application (BLA) to the FDA for RP1 (vusolimogene oderparepvec) in combination with nivolumab for the treatment of adult patients with advanced melanoma who have previously received an anti-PD1 containing regimen. The submission was made under the Accelerated Approval pathway. The Company also announced that the FDA has granted Breakthrough Therapy designation to RP1 in combination with nivolumab in the same setting.\n\nBreakthrough Therapy designation is intended to expedite the development and review of therapies for serious diseases when preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the therapy may provide substantial improvement over existing available therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints. This Breakthrough Therapy designation is based on the safety and clinical activity observed in the anti-PD1 failed melanoma cohort of the IGNYTE clinical trial.\n\n“Today is an important milestone for Replimune and for the melanoma community as we are one step closer to having another potential treatment available for patients who have limited options after progressing on anti-PD1 containing regimens,” said Sushil Patel, Ph.D., CEO of Replimune.\n\nThe confirmatory Phase 3 IGNYTE-3 trial of RP1 in combination with nivolumab in advanced melanoma patients who have progressed on anti-PD1 and anti-CTLA-4 therapy, or who are not candidates for anti-CTLA-4 treatment is currently enrolling patients.
