Results\n\n**_Revenues Increased by 17% Year-over-Year GAAP Operating Income of $6.7 Million Adjusted EBITDA of $10.7 Million_**\n\n**Petah Tikva, Israel, November 13, 2024** — Gilat Satellite Networks Ltd. (NASDAQ: GILT, TASE: GILT), a worldwide leader in satellite networking technology, solutions and services, today reported its results for the third quarter, ended September 30, 2024.\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Highlights**\n\n  * **Revenues** of $74.6 million, up 17% compared with $63.9 million in Q3 2023;\n  * **GAAP operating income** of $6.7 million, compared with $12.7 million in Q3 2023;\n  * GAAP operating income includes other income, net, of $1.3 million. Q3 2023 GAAP operating income included other income, net, of $7.4 million;\n  * **Non-GAAP operating income** of $8.3 million, up 36% compared with $6.1 million in Q3 2023;\n  * **GAAP net income** of $6.8 million, or $0.12 per diluted share, compared with $10.2 million, or $0.18 per diluted share, in Q3 2023;\n  * GAAP net income includes other income, net, of $1.3 million. Q3 2023 GAAP net income included other income, net, of $7.4 million;\n  * **Non-GAAP net income** of $8.1 million, or $0.14 per diluted share, almost doubled compared with $4.6 million, or $0.08 per diluted share, in Q3 2023;\n  * **Adjusted EBITDA** of $10.7 million, up 13% compared with $9.5 million in Q3 2023.\n\n\n\n**Forward-Looking Expectations**\n\nThe Company narrowed the range of its 2024 revenue guidance. Expectations of revenue between $305 million to $315 million now represent year-over-year growth of 17% at the mid-point. The main effect on the revenue guidance is the company’s decision to terminate its activities in Russia due to limitations and constraints that are imposed with regard to operations there.\n\nThe Company raised and narrowed the range of its 2024 GAAP operating income guidance to between $24 million to $26 million, mainly due to the receipt of approximately $11 million in proceeds from an arbitration in Peru in H2 2024.\n\nThe Company also narrowed the range of its Adjusted EBITDA guidance to between $41 to $43 million, representing year-over-year growth of 15% at the mid-point.\n\n**Management Commentary**\n\n**Adi Sfadia, Gilat’s CEO, commented:** “We performed strongly in the third quarter, achieving solid growth driven by our Satellite Network segment. This growth highlights the progress we are making in expanding our defense opportunities following our acquisition of DataPath at the end of 2023. This is highly encouraging for Gilat, as our defense business represents a rapidly growing strategic segment for the company. Our innovative satellite solutions are meeting the specialized demands of government and military customers, reinforcing our position as a trusted partner. In addition, our in-flight connectivity solutions continue to set new benchmarks for reliability and performance, addressing the increasing need for seamless airborne connectivity. Together, these efforts underscore our commitment to capturing growth in these critical markets.”\n\n**Mr. Sfadia added,** “We continued to broaden our pipeline of potential orders throughout our business, supported by our next-generation platform, as we capture new LEO satellite communications opportunities. Gilat is extremely well-positioned to leverage the growing demand for NGSO with an emphasis on LEO based on our comprehensive product offering and satellite expertise.” \n\n**Mr. Sfadia concluded** , “We are continuing to work towards the closing of our acquisition of Stellar Blu Solutions, a leader and first-to-market of Electronically Steerable Antenna for the In-Flight-Connectivity market, and are awaiting the receipt of final regulatory approvals, documentation and other customary closing conditions. Stellar Blu’s production ramp is progressing very well, and it has already begun delivering antennas to its customers. We are more confident today that Stellar Blu will add between $120-$150 million in annual revenues and be accretive to our Non-GAAP results. Furthermore, we estimate that once Stellar Blu reaches its target manufacturing capacity during the second half of 2025, its EBITDA margin will be above 10%.”\n\n**Key Recent Announcements**\n\n  * Gilat Receives Approximately $5 Million in Orders from US Defense Customers\n  * Gilat Received Over $4 Million Order from the US Department of Defense\n  * Gilat Secures Approximately $15 Million in Orders from Leading Satellite Operators for GEO, MEO and LEO Constellations\n  * Gilat Satellite Networks Awarded approximately $4 Million Contract to Provide Connectivity for rural areas in Latin America\n  * Gilat Satellite Networks Receives Multimillion Service Contract from Leading Satellite Operator in APAC region\n  * Gilat Satellite Networks Awarded Over $5M in Support of the US Department of Defense\n  * Gilat Secures Over $12 Million Orders for SkyEdge Platforms from Leading Satellite Operator\n\n\n\n**Conference Call Details**\n\nGilat’s management will discuss its third quarter 2024 results and business achievements and participate in a question-and-answer session:\n\nDate: Wednesday, November 13, 2024 Start: 09:30 AM EST / 16:30 IST Dial-in: US: 1-888-407-2553 International: +972-3-918-0609\n\nA simultaneous webcast of the conference call will be available on the Gilat website at [www.gilat.com](http://www.gilat.com) and through this link: [_https://veidan.activetrail.biz/gilatq3-2024_](https://veidan.activetrail.biz/gilatq3-2024)\n\nThe webcast will also be archived for a period of 30 days on the Company’s website and through the link above.\n\n**Non-GAAP Measures**\n\nThe attached summary unaudited financial statements were prepared in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). To supplement the consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP, the Company presents non-GAAP presentations of gross profit, operating expenses, operating income, income before taxes on income, net income, Adjusted EBITDA, and earnings per share. The adjustments to the Company’s GAAP results are made with the intent of providing both management and investors with a more complete understanding of the Company’s underlying operational results, trends, and performance. Non-GAAP financial measures mainly exclude, if and when applicable, the effect of stock-based compensation expenses, amortization of purchased intangibles, lease incentive amortization, other non-recurring expenses, other integration expenses, other operating income, net, and income tax effect on the relevant adjustments.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA is presented to compare the Company’s performance to that of prior periods and evaluate the Company’s financial and operating results on a consistent basis from period to period. The Company also believes this measure, when viewed in combination with the Company’s financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP, provides useful information to investors to evaluate ongoing operating results and trends. Adjusted EBITDA, however, should not be considered as an alternative to operating income or net income for the period and may not be indicative of the historic operating results of the Company; nor is it meant to be predictive of potential future results. Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of financial performance under GAAP and may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures for other companies. Reconciliation between the Company’s net income and adjusted EBITDA is presented in the attached summary financial statements.\n\nNon-GAAP presentations of gross profit, operating expenses, operating income, income before taxes on income, net income, adjusted EBITDA and earnings per share should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for any of the consolidated statements of operations prepared in accordance with GAAP, or as an indication of Gilat’s operating performance or liquidity.\n\n#### About Gilat\n\nGilat Satellite Networks Ltd.

Results\n\n**_Revenue Increased by 13% Year-over-Year,_****_GAAP Operating Income of $2.8 Million and_**** _Adjusted EBITDA of $10.1 Million_**\n\n**Petah Tikva, Israel, August 7, 2024** — Gilat Satellite Networks Ltd. (NASDAQ: GILT, TASE: GILT), a worldwide leader in satellite networking technology, solutions and services, today reported its results for the second quarter, ended June 30, 2024.\n\n**Second Quarter 2024 Financial Highlights**\n\n  * **Revenue** of $76.6 million, up 13% compared with $67.6 million in Q2 2023;\n  * **GAAP operating income** of $2.8 million, compared with $5.4 million in Q2 2023;\n  * The decline is mainly attributable to the acquisition-related expenses, amortization of purchased intangibles, and earnout-based expenses related to DataPath acquisition;\n  * **Non-GAAP operating income** of $7.3 million, up 21% compared with $6.1 million in Q2 2023;\n  * **GAAP net income** of $1.3 million, or $0.02 per diluted share, compared with $4.3 million, or $0.08 per diluted share, in Q2 2023;\n  * **Non-GAAP net income** of $5.6 million, or $0.10 per diluted share, up 13% compared with $4.9 million, or $0.09 per diluted share, in Q2 2023;\n  * **Adjusted EBITDA** of $10.1 million, up 10% compared with $9.2 million in Q2 2023.\n\n\n\n**Forward-Looking Expectations**\n\nThe Company today reiterated its formerly issued guidance expectations for 2024.\n\nExpectations are for revenue between $305 and $325 million, representing year-over-year growth of 18% at the midpoint. GAAP operating income is expected to be between $15 and $19 million, and Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be between $40 and $44 million, representing year-over-year growth of 15% at the mid-point.\n\nThis Guidance does not include any contribution expected from the acquisition of Stellar Blu. However given Stellar Blu has already begun delivering its antennas, and assuming closing will happen during the beginning of Q4, we estimate SBS revenues will add between $25 to $35 million in Q4.\n\n**Management Commentary**\n\n**Adi Sfadia, Gilat’s CEO, commented:** “We are pleased with our results for the second quarter. Our business continues to perform well and we are on track with our expectations for 2024. The pipeline of potential orders throughout our business continues to broaden, supported by our next-generation platform and growth engines. In particular, we are pleased with the solid traction we are experiencing in the growing defense satellite communications segment, a strategic growth vector for us. This is strongly supported by our DataPath subsidiary acquired at the end of last year, which has already proven itself as a successful acquisition and key contributor to our success this quarter.”\n\n**Mr. Sfadia added,** “We recently took a major strategic step and announced our intention to acquire Stellar Blu, a leader and first-to-market in delivering Electronically Steerable Antenna for the In-Flight-Connectivity market. Given Stellar Blu has already begun delivering its antennas we now expect Stellar Blu to add between $120-$150 million in revenue in 2025 and be accretive to our Non-GAAP results. Furthermore, we estimate that once Stellar Blu reaches its target manufacturing capacity during the second half of 2025, its EBITDA margin will be above 10%”.\n\n**Mr. Sfadia concluded** , “With Stellar Blu on board, we will become the leader in the ESA IFC market, which we believe is set to explode in popularity and become widely adopted in the coming years. I believe that this acquisition will transform Gilat into a high-growth company for many years to come, providing us with a highly attractive portfolio of ESA products and technologies. We are very excited about the significant potential this acquisition holds for Gilat.”\n\n**Key Recent Announcements**\n\n  * Gilat Awarded Over $9M for its GEO and NGSO Satellite Communications Solutions\n  * Gilat Awarded Over $5M by a National Defense Organization for the Upgrade of Transportable SATCOM Network Hubs\n  * Gilat Receives Over $10M Contract Extension for Cellular Backhaul Services\n  * Gilat Awarded Over $9M to Support Critical Connectivity Requirements for the US Department of Defense\n  * Gilat Receives over $14M in Orders Expanding Further into the IFC Market\n  * Gilat to Acquire Stellar Blu, an IFC Market Leader with a First-to-Market ESA-Based Solution for Commercial Aviation\n  * Nicole Robinson Appointed President of DataPath Inc.\n\n\n\n**Conference Call Details**\n\nGilat’s management will discuss its second quarter 2024 results and business achievements and participate in a question-and-answer session:\n\nDate: Wednesday, August 7, 2024 Start: 09:30 AM EDT / 16:30 IDT Dial-in: US: 1-888-407-2553 International: +972-3-918-0609\n\nA simultaneous webcast of the conference call will be available on the Gilat website at [www.gilat.com](http://www.gilat.com) and through this link: <https://veidan.activetrail.biz/gilatq2-2024>\n\nThe webcast will also be archived for a period of 30 days on the Company’s website and through the link above.\n\n**Non-GAAP Measures**\n\nThe attached summary unaudited financial statements were prepared in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). To supplement the consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP, the Company presents non-GAAP presentations of gross profit, operating expenses, operating income, income before taxes on income, net income, Adjusted EBITDA, and earnings per share. The adjustments to the Company’s GAAP results are made with the intent of providing both management and investors with a more complete understanding of the Company’s underlying operational results, trends, and performance. Non-GAAP financial measures mainly exclude, if and when applicable, the effect of stock-based compensation expenses, amortization of purchased intangibles, lease incentive amortization, other non-recurring expenses, other integration expenses, other operating expenses (income), net, one-time changes of deferred tax assets and income tax effect on the relevant adjustments.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA is presented to compare the Company’s performance to that of prior periods and evaluate the Company’s financial and operating results on a consistent basis from period to period. The Company also believes this measure, when viewed in combination with the Company’s financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP, provides useful information to investors to evaluate ongoing operating results and trends. Adjusted EBITDA, however, should not be considered as an alternative to operating income or net income for the period and may not be indicative of the historic operating results of the Company; nor is it meant to be predictive of potential future results. Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of financial performance under GAAP and may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures for other companies. Reconciliation between the Company’s net income and adjusted EBITDA is presented in the attached summary financial statements.\n\nNon-GAAP presentations of gross profit, operating expenses, operating income, income before taxes on income, net income, adjusted EBITDA and earnings per share should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for any of the consolidated statements of operations prepared in accordance with GAAP, or as an indication of Gilat’s operating performance or liquidity.\n\n**About Gilat**\n\nGilat Satellite Networks Ltd.

Results\n\n_Strong Revenue Growth of 29% Year-over-Year, GAAP Operating Income of $5.4 Million and Adjusted EBITDA of $9.3 Million_\n\n**Petah Tikva, Israel, May 8, 2024** — Gilat Satellite Networks Ltd. (NASDAQ: GILT, TASE: GILT), a worldwide leader in satellite networking technology, solutions and services, today reported its results for the first quarter, ended March 31, 2024.\n\n**First Quarter 2024 Financial Highlights**\n\n  * **Revenue** of $76.1 million, up 29% compared with $59.0 million in Q1 2023;\n  * **GAAP operating income** of $5.4 million, compared with $7.0 million in Q1 2023;\n  * The decline is mainly due to lower other income, higher stock-based compensation, mainly related to the Datapath acquisition, and amortization of purchased intangibles;\n  * **Non-GAAP operating income** of $6.6 million, up 25% compared with $5.3 million in Q1 2023;\n  * **GAAP net income** of $5.0 million, or $0.09 per diluted share, compared with $5.6 million, or $0.10 per diluted share, in Q1 2023;\n  * **Non-GAAP net income** of $6.0 million, or $0.11 per diluted share, almost doubled compared with $3.8 million, or $0.07 per diluted share, in Q1 2023;\n  * **Adjusted EBITDA** of $9.3 million compared with $8.4 million in Q1 2023.\n\n\n\n**Forward-Looking Expectations**\n\nThe Company today reiterated its guidance for 2024.\n\nExpectations are for revenue between $305 and $325 million, representing year-over-year growth of 18% at the midpoint. GAAP operating income is expected to be between $15 and $19 million, and Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be between $40 and $44 million, representing year-over-year growth of 15% at the mid-point. \n\n**Management Commentary**\n\n**Adi Sfadia, Gilat’s CEO, commented** : “We are pleased with our financial results representing another strong quarter of growth and profitability, with revenue up 29% year-over-year and Adjusted EBITDA up 11% year-over-year. Our revenue growth was driven by solid organic growth in both our Satellite Networks and our Network Infrastructure and Services segments, as well as a full quarter of contribution from Datapath, the defense communications business we acquired in November of last year. Our pipeline of potential orders throughout our business continues to increase and broaden, supported by our next-generation platforms and growth engines.”\n\n**Mr. Sfadia added** , “Our strong revenue growth demonstrates the continued growing traction for many of Gilat’s products and services among both new and existing customers. In particular, we are pleased with the strong level of orders from the Defense sector in recent months, which is a strategic growth vector for us. We continue to work on extracting potential synergies from the Datapath acquisition, which we believe will increasingly benefit our profitability over the coming quarters.”\n\n**Mr. Sfadia concluded,** “Given the fundamental advantages of satellite communications that are driving market interest and generating growing orders for our leading technological solutions, we are excited by Gilat’s potential in both the near and long term.

The adjustments to the Company’s GAAP results are made with the intent of providing both management and investors with a more complete understanding of the Company’s underlying operational results, trends, and performance. Non-GAAP financial measures mainly exclude, if and when applicable, the effect of stock-based compensation expenses, amortization of purchased intangibles, lease incentive amortization, other integration expenses, one-time changes of deferred tax assets, other operating expenses (income), net and income tax effect on the relevant adjustments.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA is presented to compare the Company’s performance to that of prior periods and evaluate the Company’s financial and operating results on a consistent basis from period to period. The Company also believes this measure, when viewed in combination with the Company’s financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP, provides useful information to investors to evaluate ongoing operating results and trends. Adjusted EBITDA, however, should not be considered as an alternative to operating income or net income for the period and may not be indicative of the historic operating results of the Company; nor is it meant to be predictive of potential future results. Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of financial performance under GAAP and may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures for other companies. Reconciliation between the Company’s net income and adjusted EBITDA is presented in the attached summary financial statements.\n\nNon-GAAP presentations of gross profit, operating expenses, operating income, income before taxes on income, net income, adjusted EBITDA and earnings per share should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for any of the consolidated statements of operations prepared in accordance with GAAP, or as an indication of Gilat’s operating performance or liquidity.\n\n**About Gilat**\n\nGilat Satellite Networks Ltd.
