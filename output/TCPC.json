(“we,” “us,” “our,” “TCPC” or the “Company”), a business development company (NASDAQ: TCPC), today announced its financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024 and filed its Form 10-Q with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. \n\n**FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS**\n\n  * On a GAAP basis, net investment income for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 was $33.9 million, or $0.40 per share on a diluted basis, which exceeded the regular dividend of $0.34 per share paid on September 30, 2024. Excluding amortization of purchase discount recorded in connection with the Merger (1) , adjusted net investment income (1) for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 was $30.8 million, or $0.36 per share on a diluted basis. \n  * Net asset value per share was $10.11 as of September 30, 2024 compared to $10.20 as of June 30, 2024. \n  * Net increase in net assets from operations on a GAAP basis for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 was $21.6 million, or $0.25 per share, compared to a $51.3 million, or $0.60 per share, net decrease in net assets from operations for the quarter ended June 30, 2024. \n  * Total acquisitions during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 were approximately $72.8 million and total investment dispositions were $139.2 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024. \n  * As of September 30, 2024, net leverage was 1.08x compared to 1.13x at June 30, 2024. \n  * As of September 30, 2024, debt investments on non-accrual status represented 3.8% of the portfolio at fair value and 9.3% at cost, compared to 4.9% of the portfolio at fair value and 10.5% at cost as of June 30, 2024. \n  * On August 1, 2024, the Company amended the Operating Facility to extend the maturity date to August 1, 2029. Additionally, on August 23, 2024, the Company paid off $250.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 3.90% notes due 2024 (the “2024 Notes”). \n  * On November 6, 2024, our Board of Directors declared a fourth quarter dividend of $0.34 per share and a special dividend of $0.10 per share, both payable on December 31, 2024 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on December 17, 2024. \n\n\n\n“We delivered solid adjusted net investment income of $30.8 million, or $0.36 per share, for the third quarter, resulting in an adjusted annualized NII return on average equity of 14%, which continues to be at the high end of historical levels,” said Raj Vig, Chairman and CEO of BlackRock TCP Capital Corp. “Our dividend remains well covered at 106%. We are also pleased to report that our board approved a special dividend of $0.10 per share payable to our shareholders this quarter and also re-approved our authorization to repurchase up to $50.0 million of our common stock.” \n\n“Our portfolio showed signs of improvement since last quarter as non-accrual investments declined; however, an additional non-accrual investment and certain markdowns resulted in a slight reduction in the NAV. We are working diligently with our borrowers, their lenders, and their sponsors to resolve credit issues with the goal of achieving positive outcomes for our shareholders.” \n\n“At quarter end, our portfolio remained well diversified with 156 investments primarily in senior secured, first-lien loans. We have a strong capital and liquidity position to capitalize on a growing pipeline of attractive investment opportunities to deliver attractive risk-adjusted returns for our shareholders over the long term.” \n\n**SELECTED FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS(1) **  \n---  \n**Three months ended September 30,**  \n**2024** |  **2023**  \n**Amount** |  **Per** **Share** |  **Amount** |  **Per** **Share**  \n**Net investment income** |  $  |  33,877,641  |  0.40  |  $  |  28,319,912  |  0.49   \nLess: Purchase accounting discount amortization  |  3,044,864  |  0.04  |  —  |  —   \n**Adjusted net investment income** |  $  |  30,832,777  |  0.36  |  $  |  28,319,912  |  0.49   \n**Net realized and unrealized gain (loss)** |  $  |  (12,244,681  |  )  |  (0.14  |  )  |  $  |  (15,496,980  |  )  |  (0.27  |  )   \nLess: Realized gain (loss) due to the allocation of purchase discount  |  2,727,500  |  0.03  |  —  |  —   \nLess: Net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) due to the allocation of purchase discount  |  (5,772,364  |  )  |  (0.07  |  )  |  —  |  —   \n**Adjusted net realized and unrealized gain (loss)** |  $  |  (9,199,817  |  )  |  (0.10  |  )  |  $  |  (15,496,980  |  )  |  (0.27  |  )   \n**Net increase (decrease) in net assets resulting from operations** |  $  |  21,632,960  |  0.25  |  $  |  12,822,932  |  0.22   \nLess: Purchase accounting discount amortization  |  3,044,864  |  0.04  |  —  |  —   \nLess: Realized gain (loss) due to the allocation of purchase discount  |  2,727,500  |  0.03  |  —  |  —   \nLess: Net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) due to the allocation of purchase discount  |  (5,772,364  |  )  |  (0.07  |  )  |  —  |  —   \n**Adjusted net increase (decrease) in assets resulting from operations** |  $  |  21,632,960  |  0.25  |  $  |  12,822,932  |  0.22   \n  \n(1) On March 18, 2024, the Company completed its previously announced merger with BlackRock Capital Investment Corporation (\"Merger\"). The Merger has been accounted for as an asset acquisition of BlackRock Capital Investment Corporation (\"BCIC\") by the Company in accordance with the asset acquisition method of accounting as detailed in ASC 805-50 (\"ASC 805\"), _Business Combinations-Related Issues_ . The Company determined the fair value of the shares of the Company's common stock that were issued to former BCIC shareholders pursuant to the Merger Agreement plus transaction costs to be the consideration paid in connection with the Merger under ASC 805. The consideration paid to BCIC shareholders was less than the aggregate fair values of the BCIC assets acquired and liabilities assumed, which resulted in a purchase discount (the “purchase discount”). The consideration paid was allocated to the individual BCIC assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on the relative fair values of net identifiable assets acquired other than “non-qualifying” assets and liabilities (for example, cash) and did not give rise to goodwill. As a result, the purchase discount was allocated to the cost basis of the BCIC investments acquired by the Company on a pro-rata basis based on their relative fair values as of the effective time of the Merger. Immediately following the Merger, the investments were marked to their respective fair values in accordance with ASC 820 which resulted in immediate recognition of net unrealized appreciation in the Consolidated Statement of Operations as a result of the Merger. The purchase discount allocated to the BCIC debt investments acquired will amortize over the remaining life of each respective debt investment through interest income, with a corresponding adjustment recorded to unrealized appreciation or depreciation on such investment acquired through its ultimate disposition. The purchase discount allocated to BCIC equity investments acquired will not amortize over the life of such investments through interest income and, assuming no subsequent change to the fair value of the equity investments acquired and disposition of such equity investments at fair value, the Company may recognize a realized gain or loss with a corresponding reversal of the unrealized appreciation on disposition of such equity investments acquired. \n\nAs a supplement to the Company’s reported GAAP financial measures, we have provided the following non-GAAP financial measures that we believe are useful: \n\n  * “Adjusted net investment income” – excludes the amortization of purchase accounting discount from net investment income calculated in accordance with GAAP; \n  * “Adjusted net realized and unrealized gain (loss)” – excludes the unrealized appreciation resulting from the purchase discount and the corresponding reversal of the unrealized appreciation from the amortization of the purchase discount from the determination of net realized and unrealized gain (loss) determined in accordance with GAAP; and \n  * “Adjusted net increase (decrease) in net assets resulting from operations” – calculates net increase (decrease) in net assets resulting from operations based on Adjusted net investment income and Adjusted net realized and unrealized gain (loss). \n\n\n\nWe believe that the adjustment to exclude the full effect of purchase discount accounting under ASC 805 from these financial measures is meaningful because of the potential impact on the comparability of these financial measures that we and investors use to assess our financial condition and results of operations period over period. Although these non-GAAP financial measures are intended to enhance investors’ understanding of our business and performance, these non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered an alternative to GAAP. The aforementioned non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similar non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. \n\n**PORTFOLIO AND INVESTMENT ACTIVITY**\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, our consolidated investment portfolio consisted of debt and equity positions in 156 portfolio companies with a total fair value of approximately $1.9 billion, of which 90.6% was in senior secured debt. 81.3% of the total portfolio was first lien. Equity positions, which include equity interests in diversified portfolios of debt, represented approximately 9.1% of the portfolio. 92.7% of our debt investments were floating rate, 97.0% of which had interest rate floors. \n\nAs of September 30, 2024, the weighted average annual effective yield of our debt portfolio was approximately 13.4% (1) and the weighted average annual effective yield of our total portfolio was approximately 11.9%, compared with 13.7% and 12.4%, respectively, as of June 30, 2024. Debt investments in ten portfolio companies were on non-accrual status as of September 30, 2024, representing 3.8% of the consolidated portfolio at fair value and 9.3% at cost. \n\nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2024, we invested approximately $72.8 million, primarily in 9 investments, comprised of 6 new and 3 existing portfolio companies. Of these investments, $62.7 million, or 86.2% of total acquisitions, were in senior secured loans, and $7.6 million, or 10.4% of total acquisitions, were in senior secured notes. The remaining $2.5 million, or 3.4% of total acquisitions, were comprised of equity investments. Additionally, we received approximately $139.2 million in proceeds from sales or repayments of investments during the three months ended September 30, 2024. New investments during the quarter had a weighted average effective yield of 11.3%. Investments we exited had a weighted average effective yield of 13.4%. \n\nAs of September 30, 2024, total assets were $2.0 billion, net assets were $865.6 million and net asset value per share was $10.11, as compared to $2.2 billion, $873.1 million, and $10.20 per share, respectively, as of June 30, 2024. \n\n**__________________________**\n\n(1) Weighted average annual effective yield includes amortization of deferred debt origination and accretion of original issue discount, but excludes market discount and any prepayment and make-whole fee income. The weighted average effective yield on our debt portfolio excludes non-accrual and non-income producing loans. \n\n**CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS**\n\nTotal investment income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was approximately $70.9 million, or $0.83 per share. Investment income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 included $0.08 per share from prepayment premiums and related accelerated original issue discount and exit fee amortization, $0.04 per share from recurring portfolio investment original issue discount and exit fee amortization, $0.05 per share from interest income paid in kind and $0.02 per share in dividend income. This reflects our policy of recording interest income, adjusted for amortization of portfolio investment premiums and discounts, on an accrual basis. Origination, structuring, closing, commitment, and similar upfront fees received in connection with the outlay of capital are generally amortized into interest income over the life of the respective debt investment. \n\nTotal operating expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were approximately $37.1 million, or $0.43 per share, including interest and other debt expenses of $21.2 million, or $0.25 per share, and incentive compensation from net investment income of $6.5 million, or $0.08 per share. Excluding incentive compensation, interest and other debt expenses, annualized third quarter expenses were 4.2% of average net assets. \n\nNet investment income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was approximately $33.9 million, or $0.40 per share. Net realized losses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were $31.4 million, or $0.37 per share. Net realized losses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were comprised primarily of $24.1 million and $7.4 million in losses from the restructuring of our investments in Pluralsight and McAfee, respectively. Subsequent to its restructuring, our debt investment in Pluralsight is back on accrual status. Net unrealized gains for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were $19.2 million, or $0.22 per share. Net unrealized gains for the three months ended September 30, 2024 primarily reflect $24.1 million and $7.6 million reversals of previous unrealized losses from the restructuring of our investments in Pluralsight and McAfee, respectively, a $4.2 million unrealized gain on our investment in Securus, a $3.6 million unrealized gain on our investment in Domo and other unrealized gains across the portfolio, partially offset by an $8.0 million unrealized loss on our investment in Gordon Brothers, a $4.0 million unrealized loss on our investment in Seller-X, a $3.3 million unrealized loss on our investment in InMoment, a $2.8 million unrealized loss on our investment in Edmentum and a $2.2 million unrealized loss on our investment in Alpine. Net increase in net assets resulting from operations for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was $21.6 million, or $0.25 per share. \n\n**LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES**\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, available liquidity was approximately $581.8 million, comprised of approximately $477.7 million in available capacity under our leverage program, $104.2 million in cash and cash equivalents, offset by $0.1 million in payable for investments purchased. \n\nThe combined weighted-average interest rate on debt outstanding at September 30, 2024 was 5.43%. \n\nTotal debt outstanding at September 30, 2024, including debt assumed as a result of the Merger, was as follows: \n\n**Maturity** |  **Rate** |  **Carrying** **Value(1) ** |  **Available** |  **Total** **Capacity**  \n---|---|---|---|---  \nOperating Facility  |  2029  |  SOFR+2.00%  |  (2) |  $  |  121,253,796  |  $  |  178,746,204  |  $  |  300,000,000  |  (3)  \nFunding Facility II  |  2027  |  SOFR+2.05%  |  (4) |  51,000,000  |  149,000,000  |  200,000,000  |  (5)  \nMerger Sub Facility (6) |  2028  |  SOFR+2.00%  |  (7) |  125,000,000  |  140,000,000  |  265,000,000  |  (8)  \nSBA Debentures  |  2025−2031  |  2.45%  |  (9) |  131,500,000  |  10,000,000  |  141,500,000   \n2025 Notes ($92 million par) (6) |  2025  |  Fixed/Variable  |  (10) |  92,000,000  |  —  |  92,000,000   \n2026 Notes ($325 million par)  |  2026  |  2.85%  |  325,497,355  |  —  |  325,497,355   \n2029 Notes ($325 million par)  |  2029  |  6.95%  |  321,590,452  |  —  |  321,590,452   \nTotal leverage  |  1,167,841,603  |  $  |  477,746,204  |  $  |  1,645,587,807   \nUnamortized issuance costs  |  (7,798,616  |  )   \nDebt, net of unamortized issuance costs  |  $  |  1,160,042,987   \n  \n(1)  |  Except for the 2026 Notes and 2029 Notes, all carrying values are the same as the principal amounts outstanding.   \n---|---  \n(2)  |  As of September 30, 2024, $113.0 million of the outstanding amount was subject to a SOFR credit adjustment of 0.11%. $8.3 million of the outstanding amount bore interest at a rate of EURIBOR + 2.00%.   \n(3)  |  Operating Facility includes a $100.0 million accordion which allows for expansion of the facility to up to $400.0 million subject to consent from the lender and other customary conditions.   \n(4)  |  Subject to certain funding requirements and a SOFR credit adjustment of 0.15%.   \n(5)  |  Funding Facility II includes a $50.0 million accordion which allows for expansion of the facility to up to $250.0 million subject to consent from the lender and other customary conditions.   \n(6)  |  Debt assumed by the Company as a result of the Merger with BCIC.   \n(7)  |  The applicable margin for SOFR-based borrowings could be either 1.75% or 2.00% depending on a ratio of the borrowing base to certain committed indebtedness, and is also subject to a credit spread adjustment of 0.10%. If Merger Sub elects to borrow based on the alternate base rate, the applicable margin could be either 0.75% or 1.00% depending on a ratio of the borrowing base to certain committed indebtedness.   \n(8)  |  Merger Sub Facility includes a $60.0 million accordion which allows for expansion of the facility to up to $325.0 million subject to consent from the lender and other customary conditions.   \n(9)  |  Weighted-average interest rate, excluding fees of 0.35% or 0.36%.   \n(10)  |  The 2025 Notes consist of two tranches: $35.0 million aggregate principal amount with a fixed interest rate of 6.85% and $57.0 million aggregate principal amount bearing interest at a rate equal to SOFR plus 3.14%.   \n  \nOn February 27, 2024, the Board of Directors approved a new dividend reinvestment plan (the “DRIP”) for the Company. The DRIP was effective as of, and will apply to the reinvestment of cash distributions with a record date after March 18, 2024. Under the DRIP, shareholders will automatically receive cash dividends and distributions unless they “opt in” to the DRIP and elect to have their dividends and distributions reinvested in additional shares of the Company’s common stock. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the former shareholders of BCIC that participated in the BCIC dividend reinvestment plan at the time of the Merger have been automatically enrolled in the Company’s DRIP and will have their shares reinvested in additional shares of the Company’s common stock on future distributions, unless they “opt out” of the DRIP. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, approximately $0.7 million of cash distributions were reinvested for electing Participants through purchase of shares in the open market in accordance with the terms of the DRIP. \n\nOn August 1, 2024, our Board of Directors re-approved our stock repurchase plan to acquire up to $50.0 million in the aggregate of our common stock at prices at certain thresholds below our net asset value per share, in accordance with the guidelines specified in Rule 10b-18 and Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, no shares were repurchased. \n\n**RECENT DEVELOPMENTS**\n\nOn November 6, 2024, our Board of Directors declared a fourth quarter dividend of $0.34 per share and a $0.10 per share special dividend, both payable on December 31, 2024 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on December 17, 2024. \n\n**CONFERENCE CALL AND WEBCAST**\n\nBlackRock TCP Capital Corp. will host a conference call on Wednesday, November 6, 2024 at 1:00 p.m. Eastern Time (10:00 a.m. Pacific Time) to discuss its financial results.

(“the Company”) completed its previously announced Merger with BlackRock Capital Investment Corporation (“BCIC”) . The Merger has been\naccounted for as an asset acquisition of BCIC by the Company in accordance with the asset acquisition method of accounting as detailed in ASC 805-50 (\"ASC 805\"), Business Combinations-\nRelated Issues. The Company determined the fair value of the shares of the Company's common stock that were issued to former BCIC shareholders pursuant to the Merger Agreement plus\ntransaction costs to be the consideration paid in connection with the Merger under ASC 805. The consideration paid to BCIC shareholders was less than the aggregate fair values of the BCIC\nassets acquired and liabilities assumed, which resulted in a purchase discount (the “purchase discount”). The consideration paid was allocated to the individual BCIC assets acquired and\nliabilities assumed based on the relative fair values of net identifiable assets acquired other than “non-qualifying” assets and liabilities (for example, cash) and did not give rise to goodwill. As a\nresult, the purchase discount was allocated to the cost basis of the BCIC investments acquired by the Company on a pro-rata basis based on their relative fair values as of the effective time of\nthe Merger. Immediately following the Merger, the investments were marked to their respective fair values in accordance with ASC 820 which resulted in immediate recognition of net unrealized\nappreciation in the Consolidated Statement of Operations as a result of the Merger. The purchase discount allocated to the BCIC debt investments acquired will amortize over the remaining life\nof each respective debt investment through interest income, with a corresponding adjustment recorded to unrealized appreciation or depreciation on such investment acquired through its\nultimate disposition. The purchase discount allocated to BCIC equity investments acquired will not amortize over the life of such investments through interest income and, assuming no\nsubsequent change to the fair value of the equity investments acquired and disposition of such equity investments at fair value, the Company may recognize a realized gain or loss with a\ncorresponding reversal of the unrealized appreciation on disposition of such equity investments acquired.\nAs a supplement to the Company’s reported GAAP financial measures, we have provided the following non-GAAP financial measures that we believe are useful:\n• “Adjusted net investment income” – excludes the amortization of purchase accounting discount from net investment income calculated in accordance with GAAP;\n• “Adjusted net realized and unrealized gain (loss)” – excludes the unrealized appreciation resulting from the purchase discount and the corresponding reversal of the unrealized appreciation\nfrom the amortization of the purchase discount from the determination of net realized and unrealized gain (loss) determined in accordance with GAAP; and\n• “Adjusted net increase (decrease) in net assets resulting from operations” – calculates net increase (decrease) in net assets resulting from operations based on Adjusted net investment\nincome and Adjusted net realized and unrealized gain (loss).\nWe believe that the adjustment to exclude the full effect of purchase discount accounting under ASC 805 from these financial measures is meaningful because of the potential impact on the\ncomparability of these financial measures that we and investors use to assess the Company’s financial condition and results of operations period over period.Although these non-GAAP financial\nmeasures are intended to enhance investors’ understanding of our business and performance, these non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered an alternative to GAAP. The\naforementioned non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similar non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies.\n20\nEndnotes – Internal Investment Rating System Overview\nTCPC’s Advisor employs a grading system for its entire portfolio in which all loans are rated on a scale of 1 to 4. This system is intended to reflect the Advisor’s assessment of the performance of the\nborrower’s business, the collateral coverage of the loans and other factors the Advisor considers relevant and is subject to change from time to time. The following is a description of the conditions\nassociated with each investment rating:\nGrade 1: Investments in portfolio companies whose performance is substantially within or above the Advisor’s original base case expectations and whose risk factors are neutral to favorable to\nthose at the time of the original investment or subsequent restructuring;\nGrade 2: Investments in portfolio companies whose performance is materially below the Advisor’s original base case expectations or risk factors have increased since the time of original\ninvestment or subsequent restructuring. No loss of investment return or principal (or invested capital) is expected.;\nGrade 3: Investments in portfolio companies whose performance is materially below the Advisor’s original base case expectations or risk factors have increased materially since the time of\noriginal investment or subsequent restructuring. Some loss of investment return is expected, but no loss of principal (or invested capital) is expected.\nGrade 4: Investments in portfolio companies whose performance is materially below the Advisor’s original base case expectations or risk factors have increased substantially since the time of\noriginal investment or subsequent restructuring. Some loss of principal (or invested capital) is expected.\n21\nCorporate information\nSecurities listing Transfer agent\nNASDAQ: TCPC Computershare Inc.\n(866) 333-6433 (from U.S.)\n(201) 680-6578 (from outside U.S.)\nResearch coverage\nwwww.computershare.com/investor\n• Keefe, Bruyette & Woods\n• Ladenburg Thalmann\nCorporate headquarters\n• Oppenheimer\n• Raymond James 2951 28th Street\n• Wells Fargo Suite 1000\nSanta Monica, CA 90405\nInvestor relations\nMichaela Murray\n(310) 566-1094\ninvestor.relations@tcpcapital.com\nwww.tcpcapital.com\n22\nImportant notes\nProspective investors considering an investment in BlackRock TCP Capital Corp.

(“we,” “us,” “our,” “TCPC” or the “Company”), a business development company (NASDAQ: TCPC), today announced its financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024 and filed its Form 10-Q with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. \n\n**FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS**\n\n  * On a GAAP basis, net investment income for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 was $33.9 million, or $0.40 per share on a diluted basis, which exceeded the regular dividend of $0.34 per share paid on September 30, 2024. Excluding amortization of purchase discount recorded in connection with the Merger (1) , adjusted net investment income (1) for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 was $30.8 million, or $0.36 per share on a diluted basis. \n  * Net asset value per share was $10.11 as of September 30, 2024 compared to $10.20 as of June 30, 2024. \n  * Net increase in net assets from operations on a GAAP basis for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 was $21.6 million, or $0.25 per share, compared to a $51.3 million, or $0.60 per share, net decrease in net assets from operations for the quarter ended June 30, 2024. \n  * Total acquisitions during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 were approximately $72.8 million and total investment dispositions were $139.2 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024. \n  * As of September 30, 2024, net leverage was 1.08x compared to 1.13x at June 30, 2024. \n  * As of September 30, 2024, debt investments on non-accrual status represented 3.8% of the portfolio at fair value and 9.3% at cost, compared to 4.9% of the portfolio at fair value and 10.5% at cost as of June 30, 2024. \n  * On August 1, 2024, the Company amended the Operating Facility to extend the maturity date to August 1, 2029. Additionally, on August 23, 2024, the Company paid off $250.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 3.90% notes due 2024 (the “2024 Notes”). \n  * On November 6, 2024, our Board of Directors declared a fourth quarter dividend of $0.34 per share and a special dividend of $0.10 per share, both payable on December 31, 2024 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on December 17, 2024. \n\n\n\n“We delivered solid adjusted net investment income of $30.8 million, or $0.36 per share, for the third quarter, resulting in an adjusted annualized NII return on average equity of 14%, which continues to be at the high end of historical levels,” said Raj Vig, Chairman and CEO of BlackRock TCP Capital Corp. “Our dividend remains well covered at 106%. We are also pleased to report that our board approved a special dividend of $0.10 per share payable to our shareholders this quarter and also re-approved our authorization to repurchase up to $50.0 million of our common stock.” \n\n“Our portfolio showed signs of improvement since last quarter as non-accrual investments declined; however, an additional non-accrual investment and certain markdowns resulted in a slight reduction in the NAV. We are working diligently with our borrowers, their lenders, and their sponsors to resolve credit issues with the goal of achieving positive outcomes for our shareholders.” \n\n“At quarter end, our portfolio remained well diversified with 156 investments primarily in senior secured, first-lien loans. We have a strong capital and liquidity position to capitalize on a growing pipeline of attractive investment opportunities to deliver attractive risk-adjusted returns for our shareholders over the long term.” \n\n**SELECTED FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS(1) **  \n---  \n**Three months ended September 30,**  \n**2024** |  **2023**  \n**Amount** |  **Per** **Share** |  **Amount** |  **Per** **Share**  \n**Net investment income** |  $  |  33,877,641  |  0.40  |  $  |  28,319,912  |  0.49   \nLess: Purchase accounting discount amortization  |  3,044,864  |  0.04  |  —  |  —   \n**Adjusted net investment income** |  $  |  30,832,777  |  0.36  |  $  |  28,319,912  |  0.49   \n**Net realized and unrealized gain (loss)** |  $  |  (12,244,681  |  )  |  (0.14  |  )  |  $  |  (15,496,980  |  )  |  (0.27  |  )   \nLess: Realized gain (loss) due to the allocation of purchase discount  |  2,727,500  |  0.03  |  —  |  —   \nLess: Net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) due to the allocation of purchase discount  |  (5,772,364  |  )  |  (0.07  |  )  |  —  |  —   \n**Adjusted net realized and unrealized gain (loss)** |  $  |  (9,199,817  |  )  |  (0.10  |  )  |  $  |  (15,496,980  |  )  |  (0.27  |  )   \n**Net increase (decrease) in net assets resulting from operations** |  $  |  21,632,960  |  0.25  |  $  |  12,822,932  |  0.22   \nLess: Purchase accounting discount amortization  |  3,044,864  |  0.04  |  —  |  —   \nLess: Realized gain (loss) due to the allocation of purchase discount  |  2,727,500  |  0.03  |  —  |  —   \nLess: Net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) due to the allocation of purchase discount  |  (5,772,364  |  )  |  (0.07  |  )  |  —  |  —   \n**Adjusted net increase (decrease) in assets resulting from operations** |  $  |  21,632,960  |  0.25  |  $  |  12,822,932  |  0.22   \n  \n(1) On March 18, 2024, the Company completed its previously announced merger with BlackRock Capital Investment Corporation (\"Merger\"). The Merger has been accounted for as an asset acquisition of BlackRock Capital Investment Corporation (\"BCIC\") by the Company in accordance with the asset acquisition method of accounting as detailed in ASC 805-50 (\"ASC 805\"), _Business Combinations-Related Issues_ . The Company determined the fair value of the shares of the Company's common stock that were issued to former BCIC shareholders pursuant to the Merger Agreement plus transaction costs to be the consideration paid in connection with the Merger under ASC 805. The consideration paid to BCIC shareholders was less than the aggregate fair values of the BCIC assets acquired and liabilities assumed, which resulted in a purchase discount (the “purchase discount”). The consideration paid was allocated to the individual BCIC assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on the relative fair values of net identifiable assets acquired other than “non-qualifying” assets and liabilities (for example, cash) and did not give rise to goodwill. As a result, the purchase discount was allocated to the cost basis of the BCIC investments acquired by the Company on a pro-rata basis based on their relative fair values as of the effective time of the Merger. Immediately following the Merger, the investments were marked to their respective fair values in accordance with ASC 820 which resulted in immediate recognition of net unrealized appreciation in the Consolidated Statement of Operations as a result of the Merger. The purchase discount allocated to the BCIC debt investments acquired will amortize over the remaining life of each respective debt investment through interest income, with a corresponding adjustment recorded to unrealized appreciation or depreciation on such investment acquired through its ultimate disposition. The purchase discount allocated to BCIC equity investments acquired will not amortize over the life of such investments through interest income and, assuming no subsequent change to the fair value of the equity investments acquired and disposition of such equity investments at fair value, the Company may recognize a realized gain or loss with a corresponding reversal of the unrealized appreciation on disposition of such equity investments acquired. \n\nAs a supplement to the Company’s reported GAAP financial measures, we have provided the following non-GAAP financial measures that we believe are useful: \n\n  * “Adjusted net investment income” – excludes the amortization of purchase accounting discount from net investment income calculated in accordance with GAAP; \n  * “Adjusted net realized and unrealized gain (loss)” – excludes the unrealized appreciation resulting from the purchase discount and the corresponding reversal of the unrealized appreciation from the amortization of the purchase discount from the determination of net realized and unrealized gain (loss) determined in accordance with GAAP; and \n  * “Adjusted net increase (decrease) in net assets resulting from operations” – calculates net increase (decrease) in net assets resulting from operations based on Adjusted net investment income and Adjusted net realized and unrealized gain (loss). \n\n\n\nWe believe that the adjustment to exclude the full effect of purchase discount accounting under ASC 805 from these financial measures is meaningful because of the potential impact on the comparability of these financial measures that we and investors use to assess our financial condition and results of operations period over period. Although these non-GAAP financial measures are intended to enhance investors’ understanding of our business and performance, these non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered an alternative to GAAP. The aforementioned non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similar non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. \n\n**PORTFOLIO AND INVESTMENT ACTIVITY**\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, our consolidated investment portfolio consisted of debt and equity positions in 156 portfolio companies with a total fair value of approximately $1.9 billion, of which 90.6% was in senior secured debt. 81.3% of the total portfolio was first lien. Equity positions, which include equity interests in diversified portfolios of debt, represented approximately 9.1% of the portfolio. 92.7% of our debt investments were floating rate, 97.0% of which had interest rate floors. \n\nAs of September 30, 2024, the weighted average annual effective yield of our debt portfolio was approximately 13.4% (1) and the weighted average annual effective yield of our total portfolio was approximately 11.9%, compared with 13.7% and 12.4%, respectively, as of June 30, 2024. Debt investments in ten portfolio companies were on non-accrual status as of September 30, 2024, representing 3.8% of the consolidated portfolio at fair value and 9.3% at cost. \n\nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2024, we invested approximately $72.8 million, primarily in 9 investments, comprised of 6 new and 3 existing portfolio companies. Of these investments, $62.7 million, or 86.2% of total acquisitions, were in senior secured loans, and $7.6 million, or 10.4% of total acquisitions, were in senior secured notes. The remaining $2.5 million, or 3.4% of total acquisitions, were comprised of equity investments. Additionally, we received approximately $139.2 million in proceeds from sales or repayments of investments during the three months ended September 30, 2024. New investments during the quarter had a weighted average effective yield of 11.3%. Investments we exited had a weighted average effective yield of 13.4%. \n\nAs of September 30, 2024, total assets were $2.0 billion, net assets were $865.6 million and net asset value per share was $10.11, as compared to $2.2 billion, $873.1 million, and $10.20 per share, respectively, as of June 30, 2024. \n\n**__________________________**\n\n(1) Weighted average annual effective yield includes amortization of deferred debt origination and accretion of original issue discount, but excludes market discount and any prepayment and make-whole fee income. The weighted average effective yield on our debt portfolio excludes non-accrual and non-income producing loans. \n\n**CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS**\n\nTotal investment income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was approximately $70.9 million, or $0.83 per share. Investment income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 included $0.08 per share from prepayment premiums and related accelerated original issue discount and exit fee amortization, $0.04 per share from recurring portfolio investment original issue discount and exit fee amortization, $0.05 per share from interest income paid in kind and $0.02 per share in dividend income. This reflects our policy of recording interest income, adjusted for amortization of portfolio investment premiums and discounts, on an accrual basis. Origination, structuring, closing, commitment, and similar upfront fees received in connection with the outlay of capital are generally amortized into interest income over the life of the respective debt investment. \n\nTotal operating expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were approximately $37.1 million, or $0.43 per share, including interest and other debt expenses of $21.2 million, or $0.25 per share, and incentive compensation from net investment income of $6.5 million, or $0.08 per share. Excluding incentive compensation, interest and other debt expenses, annualized third quarter expenses were 4.2% of average net assets. \n\nNet investment income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was approximately $33.9 million, or $0.40 per share. Net realized losses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were $31.4 million, or $0.37 per share. Net realized losses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were comprised primarily of $24.1 million and $7.4 million in losses from the restructuring of our investments in Pluralsight and McAfee, respectively. Subsequent to its restructuring, our debt investment in Pluralsight is back on accrual status. Net unrealized gains for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were $19.2 million, or $0.22 per share. Net unrealized gains for the three months ended September 30, 2024 primarily reflect $24.1 million and $7.6 million reversals of previous unrealized losses from the restructuring of our investments in Pluralsight and McAfee, respectively, a $4.2 million unrealized gain on our investment in Securus, a $3.6 million unrealized gain on our investment in Domo and other unrealized gains across the portfolio, partially offset by an $8.0 million unrealized loss on our investment in Gordon Brothers, a $4.0 million unrealized loss on our investment in Seller-X, a $3.3 million unrealized loss on our investment in InMoment, a $2.8 million unrealized loss on our investment in Edmentum and a $2.2 million unrealized loss on our investment in Alpine. Net increase in net assets resulting from operations for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was $21.6 million, or $0.25 per share. \n\n**LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES**\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, available liquidity was approximately $581.8 million, comprised of approximately $477.7 million in available capacity under our leverage program, $104.2 million in cash and cash equivalents, offset by $0.1 million in payable for investments purchased. \n\nThe combined weighted-average interest rate on debt outstanding at September 30, 2024 was 5.43%. \n\nTotal debt outstanding at September 30, 2024, including debt assumed as a result of the Merger, was as follows: \n\n**Maturity** |  **Rate** |  **Carrying** **Value(1) ** |  **Available** |  **Total** **Capacity**  \n---|---|---|---|---  \nOperating Facility  |  2029  |  SOFR+2.00%  |  (2) |  $  |  121,253,796  |  $  |  178,746,204  |  $  |  300,000,000  |  (3)  \nFunding Facility II  |  2027  |  SOFR+2.05%  |  (4) |  51,000,000  |  149,000,000  |  200,000,000  |  (5)  \nMerger Sub Facility (6) |  2028  |  SOFR+2.00%  |  (7) |  125,000,000  |  140,000,000  |  265,000,000  |  (8)  \nSBA Debentures  |  2025−2031  |  2.45%  |  (9) |  131,500,000  |  10,000,000  |  141,500,000   \n2025 Notes ($92 million par) (6) |  2025  |  Fixed/Variable  |  (10) |  92,000,000  |  —  |  92,000,000   \n2026 Notes ($325 million par)  |  2026  |  2.85%  |  325,497,355  |  —  |  325,497,355   \n2029 Notes ($325 million par)  |  2029  |  6.95%  |  321,590,452  |  —  |  321,590,452   \nTotal leverage  |  1,167,841,603  |  $  |  477,746,204  |  $  |  1,645,587,807   \nUnamortized issuance costs  |  (7,798,616  |  )   \nDebt, net of unamortized issuance costs  |  $  |  1,160,042,987   \n  \n(1)  |  Except for the 2026 Notes and 2029 Notes, all carrying values are the same as the principal amounts outstanding.   \n---|---  \n(2)  |  As of September 30, 2024, $113.0 million of the outstanding amount was subject to a SOFR credit adjustment of 0.11%. $8.3 million of the outstanding amount bore interest at a rate of EURIBOR + 2.00%.   \n(3)  |  Operating Facility includes a $100.0 million accordion which allows for expansion of the facility to up to $400.0 million subject to consent from the lender and other customary conditions.   \n(4)  |  Subject to certain funding requirements and a SOFR credit adjustment of 0.15%.   \n(5)  |  Funding Facility II includes a $50.0 million accordion which allows for expansion of the facility to up to $250.0 million subject to consent from the lender and other customary conditions.   \n(6)  |  Debt assumed by the Company as a result of the Merger with BCIC.   \n(7)  |  The applicable margin for SOFR-based borrowings could be either 1.75% or 2.00% depending on a ratio of the borrowing base to certain committed indebtedness, and is also subject to a credit spread adjustment of 0.10%.

The DRIP was effective as of, and will apply to the reinvestment of cash distributions with a record date after March 18, 2024. Under the DRIP, shareholders will automatically receive cash dividends and distributions unless they “opt in” to the DRIP and elect to have their dividends and distributions reinvested in additional shares of the Company’s common stock. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the former shareholders of BCIC that participated in the BCIC dividend reinvestment plan at the time of the Merger have been automatically enrolled in the Company’s DRIP and will have their shares reinvested in additional shares of the Company’s common stock on future distributions, unless they “opt out” of the DRIP. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, approximately $0.7 million of cash distributions were reinvested for electing Participants through purchase of shares in the open market in accordance with the terms of the DRIP. \n\nOn August 1, 2024, our Board of Directors re-approved our stock repurchase plan to acquire up to $50.0 million in the aggregate of our common stock at prices at certain thresholds below our net asset value per share, in accordance with the guidelines specified in Rule 10b-18 and Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, no shares were repurchased. \n\n**RECENT DEVELOPMENTS**\n\nOn November 6, 2024, our Board of Directors declared a fourth quarter dividend of $0.34 per share and a $0.10 per share special dividend, both payable on December 31, 2024 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on December 17, 2024. \n\n**CONFERENCE CALL AND WEBCAST**\n\nBlackRock TCP Capital Corp. will host a conference call on Wednesday, November 6, 2024 at 1:00 p.m. Eastern Time (10:00 a.m. Pacific Time) to discuss its financial results.

Organization and Nature of Operations\nBlackRock TCP Capital Corp. (the “Company”), formerly known as TCP Capital Corp., is a Delaware corporation formed on April 2, 2012 as an\nexternally managed, closed-end, non-diversified management investment company. The Company elected to be regulated as a business development company\n(“BDC”) under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “1940 Act”). The Company’s investment objective is to achieve high total returns\nthrough current income and capital appreciation, with an emphasis on principal protection. The Company invests primarily in the debt of middle-market\ncompanies as well as small businesses, including senior secured loans, junior loans, mezzanine debt and bonds. Such investments may include an equity\ncomponent, and, to a lesser extent, the Company may make equity investments directly. The Company was formed through the conversion on April 2, 2012 of\nthe Company’s predecessor, Special Value Continuation Fund, LLC, from a limited liability company to a corporation in a non-taxable transaction, leaving the\nCompany as the surviving entity. On April 3, 2012, the Company completed its initial public offering.\nInvestment operations are conducted through the Company's wholly-owned subsidiaries, Special Value Continuation Partners LLC, a Delaware limited\nliability company (\"SVCP\"), TCPC Funding I, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“TCPC Funding”), TCPC Funding II, LLC, a Delaware limited\nliability company (\"TCPC Funding II\"), TCPC SBIC, LP, a Delaware limited partnership (the “SBIC”) and BCIC Merger Sub, LLC, a Delaware limited liability\ncompany and wholly-owned subsidiary of SVCP (“Merger Sub”). SVCP was organized as a limited partnership and had elected to be regulated as a BDC under\nthe 1940 Act through July 31, 2018. On August 1, 2018, SVCP withdrew its election to be regulated as a BDC under the 1940 Act and withdrew the registration\nof its common limited partner interests under Section 12(g) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “1934 Act”) and, on August 2, 2018, terminated its\ngeneral partner, Series H of SVOF/MM, LLC, and converted to a Delaware limited liability company. The SBIC was organized in June 2013, and, on April 22,\n2014, received a license from the United States Small Business Administration (the “SBA”) to operate as a small business investment company under the\nprovisions of Section 301(c) of the Small Business Investment Act of 1958. These consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company, SVCP\n(including effective from the closing (the \"Closing\") of the Merger (as defined below) on March 18, 2024, the consolidated accounts of Merger Sub), TCPC\nFunding, TCPC Funding II and the SBIC. All significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in the consolidation.\nThe Company has elected to be treated as a regulated investment company (“RIC”) for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As a RIC, the Company will\nnot be taxed on its income to the extent that it distributes such income each year and satisfies other applicable income tax requirements. All of the subsidiaries of\nthe Company are treated as disregarded entities.\nSeries H of SVOF/MM, LLC serves as the administrator of the Company (the “Administrator”). The managing member of SVOF/MM is Tennenbaum\nCapital Partners, LLC (the “Advisor”), which serves as the investment manager to the Company, TCPC Funding, TCPC Funding II, Merger Sub and the SBIC.\nOn August 1, 2018, the Advisor merged with and into a wholly owned subsidiary of BlackRock Capital Investment Advisors, LLC, an indirect wholly owned\nsubsidiary of BlackRock, Inc., with the Advisor as the surviving entity.\nCompany management consists of the Advisor and the Company’s Board of Directors (the “Board of Directors”). The Advisor directs and executes the\nday-to-day operations of the Company, subject to oversight from the Board of Directors, which sets the broad policies of the Company. The Board of Directors\nof the Company has delegated investment management of SVCP’s assets to the Advisor. The Board of Directors consists of seven persons, five of whom are\nindependent.\nOn March 18, 2024, the Company completed its previously announced acquisition of BlackRock Capital Investment Corporation, a Delaware\ncorporation (“BCIC”), pursuant to the Amended and Restated Agreement and Plan of Merger (the \"Merger Agreement\"), dated as of January 10, 2024, by and\namong the Company, BCIC, Merger Sub, and solely for the limited purposes set forth therein, BlackRock Capital Investment Advisors, LLC, a Delaware limited\nliability company and investment advisor to BCIC (“BCIA”), and the Advisor.

The Company is an investment company following accounting and reporting guidance in Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic\n946, Financial Services – Investment Companies. The Company has consolidated the results of its wholly owned subsidiaries in its consolidated financial\nstatements in accordance with ASC Topic 946.

Investments are recorded at fair value in accordance with GAAP, based\nupon the principles and methods of valuation set forth in the policies adopted by the Valuation Designee and approved by the Board of Directors. Fair value is\ngenerally defined as the amount for which an investment would be sold in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.\nAll investments are valued at least quarterly based on quotations or other affirmative pricing from independent third-party sources, with the exception of\ninvestments priced directly by the Valuation Designee which in the aggregate comprise less than 5% of the assets of the Company. Investments listed on a\nrecognized exchange or market quotation system, whether U.S. or foreign, are valued using the closing price on the date of valuation. Investments not listed on a\nrecognized exchange or market quotation system, but for which reliable market quotations are readily available are valued using prices provided by a nationally\nrecognized pricing service or by using quotations from broker-dealers.\nInvestments for which market quotations are either not readily available or are determined to be unreliable are priced at fair value using affirmative\nvaluations performed by independent valuation services approved by the Valuation Designee or, for investments aggregating less than 5% of the total assets of\nthe Company, using valuations determined directly by the Valuation Designee. Such valuations are determined under documented valuation policies and\nprocedures reviewed and approved by a committee established by the Valuation Designee (the “Valuation Committee”).\nGenerally, to increase objectivity in valuing the investments, the Valuation Designee will utilize external measures of value, such as public markets or\nthird-party transactions, whenever possible. The Valuation Designee’s valuation is not based on long-term work-out value, immediate liquidation value, nor\nincremental value for potential changes that may take place in the future. The values assigned to investments are based on available information and do not\nnecessarily represent amounts that might ultimately be realized, as these amounts depend on future circumstances and cannot reasonably be determined until the\nindividual investments are actually liquidated. Such circumstances may include macroeconomic, geopolitical and other events and conditions that may\nsignificantly impact the profitability or viability of businesses in which the Company is invested, and therefore may significantly impact the return\n32\nTable of Contents\nBlackRock TCP Capital Corp.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited) (Continued)\nSeptember 30, 2024\n2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies — (continued)\non the Company’s investments. The foregoing policies apply to all investments, including any in companies and groups of affiliated companies aggregating\nmore than 5% of the Company’s assets.\nFair valuations of investments in each asset class are determined using one or more methodologies including market quotations, the market approach,\nincome approach, or, in the case of recent investments, the cost approach, as appropriate. The market approach uses prices and other relevant information\ngenerated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets. Such information may include observed multiples of earnings and/or revenues at\nwhich transactions in securities of comparable companies occur, with appropriate adjustments for differences in company size, operations or other factors\naffecting comparability.\nThe income approach uses valuation techniques to convert future amounts (for example, cash flows or earnings) to a single present value amount\n(discounted). The measurement is based on the value indicated by current market expectations about those future amounts. The discount rates used for such\nanalyses reflect market yields for comparable investments, considering such factors as relative credit quality, capital structure, and other factors.\nIn following these approaches, the types of factors that may be taken into account also include, as relevant: available current market data, including\nrelevant and applicable market trading and transaction comparables, security covenants, call protection provisions, information rights, the nature and realizable\nvalue of any collateral, the portfolio company’s ability to make payments, its earnings and cash flows, the markets in which the portfolio company does\nbusiness, comparisons of financial ratios of peer companies that are public, merger and acquisition comparables, comparable costs of capital, the principal\nmarket in which the investment trades and enterprise values, among other factors.\nInvestments may be categorized based on the types of inputs used in valuing such investments. The level in the GAAP valuation hierarchy in which an\ninvestment falls is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the valuation of the investment in its entirety. Transfers between levels are recognized as\nof the beginning of the reporting period.\nAt September 30, 2024, the Company's investments were categorized as follows:\nOther\nCorporate Equity\nLevel Basis for Determining Fair Value Bank Debt (1) Debt (2) Securities Total\n1 Quoted prices in active markets for identical $ — $ — $ 398,721 $ 398,721\nassets\n2 Other direct and indirect observable market 28,450,417 — — 28,450,417\ninputs (3)\n3 Independent third-party valuation sources 1,640,966,197 65,702,036 172,419,745 1,879,087,978\nthat employ significant unobservable inputs\n3 Valuation Designee valuations with significant — — 1,152,245 1,152,245\nunobservable inputs\nTotal $ 1,669,416,614 $ 65,702,036 $ 173,970,711 $ 1,909,089,361\n(1) Includes senior secured loans\n(2) Includes senior secured notes, unsecured debt and subordinated debt\n(3) For example, quoted prices in inactive markets or quotes for comparable investments\n33\nTable of Contents\nBlackRock TCP Capital Corp.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited) (Continued)\nSeptember 30, 2024\n2.

Such positions were converted at the\nrespective closing foreign exchange rates in effect at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 and reported in U.S. dollars. Purchases and sales of\ninvestments and income and expense items denominated in foreign currencies, when they occur, are translated into U.S. dollars based on the foreign exchange\nrates in effect on the respective dates of such transactions.

These risks include, among other things, revaluation of currencies, less reliable information\nabout issuers, different transaction clearance and settlement practices, and potential future adverse political and economic developments. Moreover, investments\nin foreign companies and securities of foreign governments and their markets may be less liquid and their prices more volatile than those of comparable U.S.\ncompanies and the U.S. government.\n(cid:0)’ (cid:0)H (cid:0)U (cid:0)L(cid:0)Y (cid:0)D (cid:0)W(cid:0)L(cid:0)Y (cid:0)H (cid:0)V\nIn order to mitigate certain currency exchange and interest rate risks, the Company may enter into certain derivative transactions. All derivatives are\nsubject to a master netting agreement and are reported at their gross amounts as either assets or liabilities in the Consolidated Statements of Assets and\nLiabilities. Transactions entered into are accounted for using the mark-to-market method with the resulting change in fair value recognized in earnings for the\ncurrent period. Risks may arise upon entering into these contracts from the potential inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts and from\nunanticipated movements in interest rates and the value of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies — (continued)\nMerger Sub entered into a centrally-cleared interest rate swap (the “Interest Rate Swap”) to economically hedge the interest payable on the fixed rate\ntranche of Merger Sub’s 2025 Notes (as defined below) (see Note 4). The notional amount of the Interest Rate Swap is $35.0 million and matures on June 9,\n2025. Under the swap agreement, Merger Sub receives a fixed interest rate of 2.633% and pays a floating interest rate of SOFR with payments due annually.\nPursuant to the contract, Merger Sub was required to deposit initial margin with the broker in the form of cash and has agreed to receive from or pay to\nthe broker daily variation margin. The amounts related to the right to claim or the obligation to return cash collateral may not be used to offset amounts due\nunder the Interest Rate Swap contract in the normal course of settlement. Both the initial margin and variation margin paid are included as assets within Due\nfrom broker on the Consolidated Statement of Assets and Liabilities at September 30, 2024.\nSince the swap contract has not been designated as a hedge accounting relationship pursuant to ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging, changes in the fair\nvalue of the swap contract, net of any periodic interest accruals, are presented as part of change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on the Consolidated\nStatement of Operations. As of September 30, 2024, the Interest Rate Swap had a fair value of $(0.7) million, which is reflected as a liability on the\nConsolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities; such fair value is inclusive of any net periodic interest accruals and payments on the contract.\nInterest rate swap agreements are valued utilizing quotes received from independent pricing services or through brokers, which are derived using daily\nswap curves and models that incorporate a number of market data factors, such as discounted cash flows, trades and values of the underlying reference\ninstruments. The fair value of the Interest Rate Swap is classified as Level 2 with respect to the fair value hierarchy.\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company did not enter into any additional derivative transactions.\nValuations of derivatives are determined using observable market inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and, accordingly,\nare generally classified as Level 2 in the GAAP valuation hierarchy.\n(cid:0)’ (cid:0)H (cid:0)I(cid:0)H (cid:0)U (cid:0)U (cid:0)H (cid:0)G (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)’ (cid:0)H (cid:0)E (cid:0)W(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0), (cid:0)V (cid:0)V (cid:0)X (cid:0)D (cid:0)Q (cid:0)F (cid:0)H (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)& (cid:0)R (cid:0)V (cid:0)W(cid:0)V\nCertain costs incurred in connection with the issuance and/or extension of debt of the Company and its subsidiaries were capitalized and are being\namortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated life of the respective instruments.

Origination,\nstructuring, closing, commitment and other upfront fees, including original issue discounts, earned with respect to capital commitments are generally amortized\nor accreted into interest income over the life of the respective debt investment, as are end-of-term or exit fees receivable upon repayment of a debt investment.\nOther fees, including certain amendment fees, prepayment fees and commitment fees on broken deals, are recognized as earned. Prepayment fees and similar\nincome due upon the early repayment of a loan or debt security are recognized when earned and are included in interest income.\nCertain debt investments are purchased at a discount to par as a result of the underlying credit risks and financial results of the issuer, as well as general\nmarket factors that influence the financial markets as a whole. Discounts on the acquisition of corporate bonds are generally amortized using the effective-\ninterest or constant-yield method assuming there are no questions as to collectability. When principal payments on a loan are received in an amount in excess of\nthe loan’s amortized cost, the excess principal payments are recorded as interest income.\nDebt investments are generally placed on non-accrual status when it is probable that principal or interest will not be collected according to the contractual\nterms. When a debt investment is placed on non-accrual status, accrued and unpaid interest (including any accrued PIK interest) is generally reversed, and\ndiscount accretion or premium amortization is discontinued. The Company does not reverse previously capitalized PIK income. Payments received on non-\naccrual investments may either be recognized as income or applied to principal depending upon the Company’s judgment regarding collectability of the\noutstanding principal and interest. Non-accrual investments are restored to accrual status if past due principal and interest are paid or, in the Company’s\njudgment, the repayment of the remaining contractual principal and interest is expected.

Therefore, no U.S. federal income tax provision is required. The income or loss of SVCP\n(including effective from the Closing, the consolidated income or loss of Merger Sub), TCPC Funding, TCPC Funding II and the SBIC is reported in the\nrespective members' or partners’ income tax returns, as applicable. In accordance with ASC Topic 740 - Income Taxes, the Company recognizes in its\nconsolidated financial statements the effect of a tax position when it is determined that such position is more likely than not, based on the technical merits, to be\nsustained upon examination. The tax returns of the Company, SVCP, TCPC Funding, TCPC Funding II and the SBIC remain open for examination by tax\nauthorities for a period of three years from the date they are filed. No such examinations are currently pending. Management has analyzed tax laws and\nregulations and their application to the Company as of September 30, 2024, inclusive of the open tax return years, and does not believe that there are any\nuncertain tax positions that require recognition of a tax liability in the consolidated financial statements.\nThe final tax characterization of distributions is determined after the fiscal year and is reported on Form 1099 and in the Company’s annual report to\nshareholders. Distributions can be characterized as ordinary income, capital gains and/or return of capital.

The amendments apply only to contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions that reference LIBOR or another reference rate\nexpected to be discontinued because of reference rate reform.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies — (continued)\nIn August 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-06, Debt-Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging-\nContracts in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40): Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity’s Own Equity,” which simplifies the\naccounting for convertible instruments by removing the separation models for (1) convertible debt with a cash conversion feature and (2) convertible\ninstruments with a beneficial conversion feature. As a result, after adoption, a convertible debt instrument will be accounted for as a single liability measured at\nits amortized cost. Additionally, ASU 2020-06 requires the application of the if-converted method to calculate the impact of convertible instruments on diluted\nearnings per share. ASU 2020-06 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, with early adoption permitted for fiscal years beginning after\nDecember 15, 2020 and can be adopted on either a fully retrospective or modified retrospective basis. The Company adopted ASU 2020-06 under the modified\nretrospective basis as of January 1, 2022. The impact of the Company’s adoption under the modified retrospective basis required an adjustment of $0.1 million\nto opening net assets for the remaining unamortized discount on the convertible senior unsecured notes due March 2022 issued by the Company (the “2022\nConvertible Notes”), an increase to our debt balance in the amount of $0.1 million as a result of the recombination of the equity conversion component of the\n2022 Convertible Notes, and $0.1 million lower interest expense on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The Company’s adoption of this guidance did\nnot have a material impact on the Company’s financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.\nIn June 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-03, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Fair Value Measurement of Equity Securities Subject to Contractual\nSale Restrictions (“ASU 2022-03”), which clarifies guidance for fair value measurement of an equity security subject to a contractual sale restriction and\nestablishes new disclosure requirements for such equity securities. ASU 2022-03 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023 and for interim\nperiods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. The Company has concluded that this guidance will not have a material impact on its\nconsolidated financial statements.\n3. Management Fees, Incentive Fees and Other Expenses\nOn February 8, 2019, the shareholders of the Company approved an amended investment management agreement to be effective on February 9, 2019\nbetween the Company and the Advisor which (i) reduced the base management fee on total assets (excluding cash and cash equivalents) that exceed an amount\nequal to 200% of the net asset value of the Company from 1.50% to 1.00%, (ii) reduced the incentive compensation on net investment income and net realized\ngains (reduced by any net unrealized losses) from 20% to 17.5% and (iii) reduced the cumulative total return hurdle from 8% to 7%.\nAccordingly, the Company’s base management fee was calculated at an annual rate of 1.50% on total assets (excluding cash and cash equivalents) up to\nan amount equal to 200% of the net asset value of the Company, and 1.00% thereafter. The base management fee is calculated on a consolidated basis as of the\nbeginning of each quarter and is payable to the Advisor quarterly in arrears.\nIn connection with the Merger, the Company and the Advisor entered into an amended and restated investment advisory agreement (the “Amended and\nRestated Investment Advisory Agreement”) that became effective at the Closing, pursuant to which the Advisor reduced its base management fee rate for\nmanaging the Company from 1.50% to 1.25% on assets equal to or below 200% of the net asset value of the Company with no change to the basis of\ncalculation. Prior to the Closing, the Advisor's base management fee rate for managing the Company was 1.50% on assets equal to or below 200% of the net\nasset value of the Company. The base management fee rate on assets that exceed 200% of the net asset value of the Company remains 1.00%. The base\nmanagement fee is calculated on a consolidated basis as of the beginning of each quarter and is payable to the Advisor quarterly in arrears.\nIn connection with the Merger, the Company also entered into a fee waiver agreement with the Advisor (the “Fee Waiver Agreement”). The Fee Waiver\nAgreement provides that the Advisor will waive all or a portion of its advisory fees to the extent the adjusted net investment income of the Company on a per\nshare basis (determined by dividing the adjusted net investment income of the Company by the weighted average outstanding shares of the Company during the\nrelevant quarter) is less than $0.32 per share in any of the first four (4) fiscal quarters ending after the Closing (the first of which will be the quarter in which the\nClosing occurred) to the extent there are sufficient advisory fees to cover such deficit (the waiver amount in a given quarter cannot exceed the total advisory fees\nfor such quarter). For the quarter ended September 30, 2024, no advisory fee waiver was required.\nIncentive compensation is only incurred to the extent the Company’s cumulative total return (after incentive compensation) exceeds a 7% annual rate on\ndaily weighted-average contributed common equity. Subject to that limitation, incentive compensation is calculated on ordinary income (before incentive\ncompensation) and net realized gains (net of any unrealized depreciation) at rates of 17.5% on income since the fee reduction on February 8, 2019 and 20%\npreviously. Incentive compensation is computed as the difference between incentive compensation earned and incentive compensation paid, subject to the total\nreturn hurdle, on a cumulative basis since January 1, 2013, and is payable quarterly in arrears.\n44\nTable of Contents\nBlackRock TCP Capital Corp.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited) (Continued)\nSeptember 30, 2024\n3. Management Fees, Incentive Fees and Other Expenses — (continued)\nIn connection with the Merger, the Company and the Advisor agreed that, for the purposes of calculating adjusted net investment income and for\npurposes of incentive fee calculations under the Amended and Restated Investment Advisory Agreement, any amortization of original issue discount to interest\nincome or any gains and losses resulting solely from accounting adjustments to the cost basis of the BCIC assets acquired in the Merger as required under\napplicable accounting guidance under ASC 805 will be excluded.\nA reserve for incentive compensation is accrued based on the amount of any additional incentive compensation that would have been payable to the\nAdvisor assuming a hypothetical liquidation of the Company at net asset value on the balance sheet date. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, no\nsuch reserve was accrued.\nThe Company bears all expenses incurred in connection with its business, including fees and expenses of outside contracted services, such as custodian,\nadministrative, legal, audit and tax preparation fees, costs of valuing investments, insurance costs, brokers’ and finders’ fees relating to investments, and any\nother transaction costs associated with the purchase and sale of investments.\n4.

The 2022 Convertible\nNotes were general unsecured obligations of the Company, and ranked structurally junior to the Operating Facility, Funding Facility II and the SBA Debentures.\nThe Company did not have the right to redeem the 2022 Convertible Notes prior to maturity. The 2022 Convertible Notes bore interest at an annual rate of\n4.625%, paid semi-annually. In certain circumstances, the 2022 Convertible Notes could have been converted into cash, shares of the Company’s common stock\nor a combination of cash and shares of common stock (such combination to be at the Company’s election), at an initial conversion rate of 54.5019 shares of\ncommon stock per one thousand dollar principal amount of the 2022 Convertible Notes, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately\n$18.35 per share of common stock, subject to customary anti-dilutional adjustments. The initial conversion price was approximately 10.0% above the $16.68 per\nshare closing price of the Company’s common stock on August 30, 2016. Prior to its maturity on March 1, 2022, the principal amount of the 2022 Convertible\nNotes exceeded the value of the conversion rate multiplied by the per share closing price of the Company’s common stock. Therefore, no additional shares were\nadded to the calculation of diluted earnings per common share and weighted average common shares outstanding.\nThe 2022 Convertible Notes were accounted for in accordance with ASC Topic 470-20 – Debt with Conversion and Other Options. Upon conversion of\nany of the 2022 Convertible Notes, the Company intended to pay the outstanding principal amount in cash and, to the extent that the conversion value exceeds\nthe principal amount, had the option to pay the excess amount in cash or shares of the Company’s common stock (or a combination of cash and shares), subject\nto the requirements of the respective indenture.\nPrior to the adoption of ASU 2020-06, the Company had determined that the embedded conversion options in 2022 Convertible Notes were not required to be\nseparately accounted for as derivatives under GAAP. At the time of issuance the estimated values of the debt and equity components of the 2022 Convertible\nNotes were approximately 97.6% and 2.4%, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company adopted ASU 2020-06 using the modified\nretrospective basis. In accordance with this guidance, the Company recombined the equity conversion component of our 2022 Convertible Notes outstanding,\nand accounted for the 2022 Convertible Notes as a single liability measured at amortized cost. This resulted in a cumulative decrease to additional paid in capital\nof $3.3 million, partially offset by a decrease to accumulated loss of $3.2 million as of January 1, 2022 (see Note 2).\nPrior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding September 1, 2021, holders were permitted to convert their 2022 Convertible\nNotes only under certain circumstances set forth in the indenture governing the terms of the 2022 Convertible Notes. On or after September 1, 2021 until the\nclose of business on the scheduled trading day immediately preceding March 1, 2022, holders may have converted their 2022 Convertible Notes at any time.\nUpon conversion, the Company would pay or deliver, as the case may be, at its election, cash, shares of the Company’s common stock or a combination of cash\nand shares of the Company’s common stock, subject to the requirements of the indenture. No notes were converted prior to the notes maturing on March 1,\n2022.\nThe original issue discounts equal to the equity components of the 2022 Convertible Notes were recorded in “paid-in capital in excess of par” in the\naccompanying Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities. As a result, the Company records interest expense comprised of both stated interest and\namortization of the original issue discounts. At the time of issuance, the equity components of the 2022 Convertible Notes were $3.3 million.\n(cid:0)8 (cid:0)Q (cid:0)V (cid:0)H (cid:0)F (cid:0)X (cid:0)U (cid:0)H (cid:0)G (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)1 (cid:0)R (cid:0)W(cid:0)H (cid:0)V\nOn August 23, 2019, the Company issued $150.0 million of unsecured notes. On November 26, 2019, the Company issued an additional $50.0 million of\nthe 2024 Notes and on October 2, 2020, the Company issued an additional $50.0 million of the 2024 Notes for a total outstanding aggregate principal amount of\n$250.0 million. The 2024 Notes were issued at a discount to the principal amount and bore interest at an annual rate of 3.900%, payable semi-annually. On\nAugust 23, 2024, the 2024 Notes matured and all principal was repaid.\nOn February 9, 2021, the Company issued $175.0 million of unsecured notes that mature on February 9, 2026, unless previously repurchased or\nredeemed in accordance with their terms. The 2026 Notes were issued at a discount to the principal amount. On August 27, 2021, the Company issued an\nadditional $150.0 million of the 2026 Notes, at a premium to par, for a total outstanding aggregate principal amount of $325.0 million. The 2026 Notes bear\ninterest at an annual rate of 2.850%, payable semi-annually, and all principal is due upon maturity. The 2026 Notes may be redeemed in whole or part at the\nCompany's option at a redemption price equal to par plus a \"make whole\" premium, as determined pursuant to the indenture governing the 2026 Notes, and any\naccrued and unpaid interest.\n47\nTable of Contents\nBlackRock TCP Capital Corp.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited) (Continued)\nSeptember 30, 2024\n4.

On September 13, 2023, the Company was named as a defendant, together with the Advisor and\ncertain other funds managed by the Advisor, as well as certain other defendants, in a lawsuit filed in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern\nDistrict of New York. The suit relates to a third-party sponsored collateralized loan obligation in which the Company and certain other defendants invested. The\nsuit alleges that the Company and the other defendants knew or should have known of certain fraudulent activities of the third-party manager relating to its\nmanagement of the collateralized loan obligation that caused the plaintiffs to suffer investment losses. The suit seeks to recover from the Company\napproximately $15 million, plus interest, additional amounts from the other Defendants, and attorneys’ fees and costs from all Defendants. The Company, the\naffiliated funds and the Advisor intend to vigorously defend against these claims. At this time, however, the Company and the Advisor cannot predict with a\nreasonable degree of certainty the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome, including any potential losses that could result. On November 6, 2023, the Company,\nthe affiliated funds, and the Advisor, and certain other Defendants filed motions to dismiss the lawsuit, which was fully briefed on February 12, 2024 and was\nargued in court on March 6, 2024.\n53\nTable of Contents\nBlackRock TCP Capital Corp.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited) (Continued)\nSeptember 30, 2024\n6. Other Related Party Transactions\nThe Company, SVCP, TCPC Funding, TCPC Funding II, the SBIC, Merger Sub, the Advisor and their members and affiliates may be considered related\nparties. From time to time, SVCP advances payments to third parties on behalf of the Company which are reimbursable through deductions from distributions to\nthe Company. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, no such amounts were outstanding. From time to time, the Advisor advances payments to third\nparties on behalf of the Company and SVCP and receives reimbursement from the Company. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, amounts\nreimbursable to the Advisor totaled $0.2 million and $0.8 million, respectively, as reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities.\nPursuant to an administration agreement between the Administrator and the Company (the “Administration Agreement”), the Administrator may be\nreimbursed for costs and expenses incurred by the Administrator for office space rental, office equipment and utilities allocable to the Company, as well as costs\nand expenses incurred by the Administrator or its affiliates relating to any administrative, operating, or other non-investment advisory services provided by the\nAdministrator or its affiliates to the Company. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, expenses allocated pursuant to the Administration\nAgreement totaled $1.7 million and $1.1 million, respectively.\n7. Stockholders’ Equity and Dividends\nIn accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement, at the Closing, each outstanding share of BCIC’s common stock was converted into the right to\nreceive 0.3834 shares (the “Exchange Ratio”) of common stock, par value $0.001 per share of the Company (with BCIC shareholders receiving cash in lieu of\nfractional shares of the Company’s common stock). As a result of the Merger, the Company issued 27,823,870 shares of its common stock on March 18, 2024 to\nformer BCIC shareholders, after adjustment for BCIC shareholders receiving cash in lieu of fractional shares.\nThe Company’s dividends are recorded on the ex-dividend date.

The DRIP was effective as of,\nand will apply to the reinvestment of cash distributions with a record date after March 18, 2024. Under the DRIP, shareholders will automatically receive cash\ndividends and distributions unless they “opt in” to the DRIP and elect to have their dividends and distributions reinvested in additional shares of the Company’s\ncommon stock. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the former shareholders of BCIC that participated in the BCIC dividend reinvestment plan at the time of the\nMerger have been automatically enrolled in the Company’s DRIP and will have their shares reinvested in additional shares of the Company’s common stock on\nfuture distributions, unless they “opt out” of the DRIP.\nTo “opt in”, a shareholder shall notify Computershare Trust Company, N.A., the DRIP plan administrator (the “Plan Administrator”), in writing so that\nsuch notice is received by the Plan Administrator no later than the record date fixed by the Board of Directors for the distribution involved. The Plan\nAdministrator will set up an account for shares acquired pursuant to the DRIP for each shareholder who has elected to participate in the DRIP (each a\n“Participant”). The amount of common stock to be issued to Participants pursuant to the DRIP will be calculated by reference to all shares of common stock\nowned by the Participant, whether held in its DRIP account or elsewhere. Common stock will be acquired by the Plan Administrator for the Participants’\naccounts, through either (i) the receipt from the Company of additional unissued but authorized common stock (“newly issued common stock”) or (ii) the\npurchase of outstanding common stock in the open market (“open-market purchases”).\nThe Plan Administrator will acquire newly issued common stock on behalf of Participants if, on the distribution payment date, the closing market price\nper share of the Company’s common stock on the NASDAQ Global Select Market (or if no sale is reported for such day, the midpoint of the reported bid and\nasked prices) plus estimated per share fees (which include any applicable brokerage commissions the Plan Administrator is required to pay) (the “Market Price”)\nis greater than the most recently published net asset value per common stock (“NAV”) (such condition referred to as a “market premium”). The number of shares\nof newly issued common stock to be credited to a Participant’s account will be determined by dividing the dollar amount of the distribution otherwise payable to\nthe Participant by the greater of (i) the NAV or (ii) 95% of the Market Price on the distribution payment date.\nUnless otherwise instructed by the Company at the direction of its Board of Directors, the Plan Administrator will acquire common Stock on behalf of\nParticipants through open-market purchases if, on the distribution payment date, the Market Price is less than the most recently published NAV (such condition\nreferred to as a “market discount”). In the event of a market discount on the distribution payment date, the Plan Administrator will have until the last business\nday before the next date on which the common stock trades on an “ex-distribution” basis or 30 days after the distribution payment date, whichever is sooner (the\n“last purchase date”), to invest the distribution amount in common stock acquired in open-market purchases. If shares are purchased in the open market with\nrespect to a distribution, the number of shares to be credited to a Participant’s account shall be determined by dividing the dollar amount of the cash distribution\notherwise payable to the Participant by the weighted average Market Price per share for all common stock purchased by the Plan Administrator in the open\nmarket. If the Plan Administrator is unable to invest the full distribution amount in open-market purchases, or if the market discount shifts to a market premium\nduring the purchase period, the Plan Administrator may cease making open-market purchases and may use any uninvested portion to acquire newly issued\nshares. Investments in newly issued shares made in this manner would be made pursuant to the same process described above and the date of issue for such\nnewly issued shares will substitute for the distribution payment date. If the Company instructs the Plan Administrator to purchase new shares of common stock\nwhen there is a market discount, the shares of common stock will be acquired in accordance with the same terms as outlined above when there is a market\npremium.\nThere will be no fees with respect to shares of common stock issued directly by the Company. However, each Participant will pay the per share fees\n(which include any applicable brokerage commissions the Plan Administrator is required to pay) incurred in connection with open-market purchases. If a\nshareholder has shares held by a broker, such shareholder should contact his/her broker to participate in the DRIP. For the nine months ended September 30,\n2024, approximately $1.5 million of cash distributions were reinvested for electing Participants through purchase of shares in the open market in accordance\nwith the terms of the DRIP.\n55\nTable of Contents\nBlackRock TCP Capital Corp.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited) (Continued)\nSeptember 30, 2024\n7.

The Company Repurchase Plan is designed to allow the Company to repurchase its\ncommon stock at times when it otherwise might be prevented from doing so under insider trading laws. The Company Repurchase Plan requires an agent\nselected by the Company to repurchase shares of common stock on the Company’s behalf if and when the market price per share is at certain thresholds below\nthe most recently reported net asset value per share. Under the plan, the agent will increase the volume of purchases made if the price of the Company’s\ncommon stock declines, subject to volume restrictions. The timing and amount of any stock repurchased depends on the terms and conditions of the Company\nRepurchase Plan, the market price of the common stock and trading volumes, and no assurance can be given that any particular amount of common stock will be\nrepurchased. The Company Repurchase Plan was re-approved on August 1, 2024, to be in effect through the earlier of April 30, 2025, unless further extended or\nterminated by the Company’s Board of Directors, or such time as the approved $50.0 million repurchase amount has been fully utilized, subject to certain\nconditions.\nNo shares were repurchased by the Company under the Company Repurchase Plan for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.\n8. Earnings Per Share\nIn accordance with ASC 260, Earnings per Share, basic earnings per share is computed by dividing earnings available to common shareholders by the\nweighted average number of shares outstanding during the period. Other potentially dilutive common shares, if any, and the related impact to earnings, are\nconsidered when calculating earnings per share on a diluted basis. The following information sets forth the computation of the net increase in net assets per\nshare resulting from operations for three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nNet increase (decrease) in net assets from operations $ 21,632,960 $ 12,822,932 $ (24,586,416) $ 51,787,497\nWeighted average shares outstanding 85,591,134 57,767,264 77,772,017 57,767,264\nEarnings (loss) per share $ 0.25 $ 0.22 $ (0.32) $ 0.90\n9.

Merger with BlackRock Capital Investment Corporation\nOn March 18, 2024, the Company completed its previously announced acquisition of BCIC, pursuant to that certain Amended and Restated Agreement\nand Plan of Merger, dated as of January 10, 2024, by and among the Company, BCIC, Merger Sub, and solely for the limited purposes set forth therein, BCIA,\nand the Advisor. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, BCIC merged with and into Merger Sub, with Merger Sub continuing as the surviving company and as a\nsubsidiary of SVCP and an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. As a result of, and as of the effective time of, the Merger, BCIC’s separate\ncorporate existence ceased.\nIn connection with the Merger, the Company and the Advisor entered into the Amended and Restated Investment Advisory Agreement that became\neffective as of the Closing, pursuant to which the Advisor reduced its base management fee rate for managing the Company from 1.50% to 1.25% on assets\nequal to or below 200% of the net asset value of the Company with no change to the basis of the calculation. Prior to the Closing, the Advisor's base\nmanagement fee rate for managing the Company was 1.50% on assets equal to or below 200% of the net asset value of the Company. The base management fee\nrate on assets that exceed 200% of the net asset value of the Company remains 1.00%. The Company also entered into the Fee Waiver Agreement with the\nAdvisor. The Fee Waiver Agreement provides that the Advisor will waive all or a portion of its advisory fees to the extent the adjusted net investment income of\nthe Company on a per share basis (determined by dividing the adjusted net investment income of the Company by the weighted average outstanding shares of\nthe Company during the relevant quarter) is less than $0.32 per share in any of the first four (4) fiscal quarters ending after the Closing (the first of which will be\nthe quarter in which the Closing occurred) to the extent there are sufficient advisory fees to cover such deficit. The waiver amount in a given quarter cannot\nexceed the total advisory fees for such quarter.\nIn accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement, at the Closing, each outstanding share of BCIC’s common stock was converted into the right to\nreceive 0.3834 shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share of the Company (with BCIC’s shareholders receiving cash in lieu of fractional shares of the\nCompany’s common stock). As a result of the Merger, the Company issued 27,823,870 shares of its common stock to former BCIC shareholders, after\nadjustment for BCIC’s shareholders receiving cash in lieu of fractional shares.\n59\nTable of Contents\nBlackRock TCP Capital Corp.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited) (Continued)\nSeptember 30, 2024\n12. Merger with BlackRock Capital Investment Corporation — (continued)\nThe Merger has been accounted for as an asset acquisition of BCIC by the Company in accordance with the asset acquisition method of accounting as\ndetailed in ASC 805-50 (\"ASC 805\"), Business Combinations-Related Issues. The Company determined the fair value of the shares of the Company's common\nstock that were issued to former BCIC shareholders pursuant to the Merger Agreement plus transaction costs to be the consideration paid in connection with the\nMerger under ASC 805. The consideration paid to BCIC shareholders was less than the aggregate fair values of the BCIC assets acquired and liabilities\nassumed, which resulted in a purchase discount (the “purchase discount”). The consideration paid was allocated to the individual BCIC assets acquired and\nliabilities assumed based on the relative fair values of net identifiable assets acquired other than “non-qualifying” assets and liabilities (for example, cash) and\ndid not give rise to goodwill. As a result, the purchase discount was allocated to the cost basis of the BCIC investments acquired by the Company on a pro-rata\nbasis based on their relative fair values as of the effective time of the Merger. Immediately following the Merger, the investments were marked to their\nrespective fair values in accordance with ASC 820 which resulted in immediate recognition of net unrealized appreciation in the Consolidated Statement of\nOperations as a result of the Merger. The purchase discount allocated to the BCIC debt investments acquired will amortize over the remaining life of each\nrespective debt investment through interest income, with a corresponding adjustment recorded to unrealized appreciation or depreciation on such investment\nacquired through its ultimate disposition. The purchase discount allocated to BCIC equity investments acquired will not amortize over the life of such\ninvestments through interest income and, assuming no subsequent change to the fair value of the equity investments acquired and disposition of such equity\ninvestments at fair value, the Company may recognize a realized gain or loss with a corresponding reversal of the unrealized appreciation on disposition of such\nequity investments acquired.\nThe Merger was considered a tax-free reorganization and the Company has elected to carry forward the historical cost basis of the acquired BCIC\ninvestments for tax purposes.\nPursuant to the Merger Agreement, the Advisor, in the case of the Company, and BCIA, in the case of BCIC, would each bear 50% of the aggregate\nreasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by the Company or BCIC, as applicable, up to a combined aggregate amount equal to $6.0 million (the\n“Merger transaction costs”). Net of Merger transaction costs borne by the Advisor, the Company capitalized $2.4 million of Merger transaction costs as part of\nthe total consideration paid to acquire the assets and liabilities of BCIC.\nThe following table summarizes the allocation of the consideration paid to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as a result of the Merger:\nCommon stock issued by the Company (1) $

The Company was formed through the conversion of a pre-existing closed-end investment company. The Company elected to be regulated as a\nbusiness development company (“BDC”) under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “1940 Act”). Our investment objective is to seek to\nachieve high total returns through current income and capital appreciation, with an emphasis on principal protection. We invest primarily in the debt of middle-\nmarket companies as well as small businesses, including senior secured loans, junior loans, mezzanine debt and bonds. Such investments may include an equity\ncomponent, and, to a lesser extent, we may make equity investments directly. Certain investment operations are conducted through the Company’s wholly-\nowned subsidiaries, Special Value Continuation Partners LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“SVCP”), TCPC Funding I, LLC (“TCPC Funding”),\nTCPC Funding II, LLC (\"TCPC Funding II\") TCPC SBIC, LP, a Delaware limited partnership (the “SBIC”) and BCIC Merger Sub, LLC, a Delaware limited\nliability company and a wholly-owned subsidiary of SVCP (“Merger Sub”). SVCP was organized as a limited partnership and had elected to be regulated as a\nBDC under the 1940 Act through July 31, 2018. On August 1, 2018, SVCP withdrew its election to be regulated as a BDC under the 1940 Act and withdrew the\nregistration of its common limited partner interests under Section 12(g) of the 1934 Act and, on August 2, 2018, terminated its general partner, Series H of\nSVOF/MM, LLC, and converted to a Delaware limited liability company. Series H of SVOF/MM, LLC (“SVOF/MM”) serves as the administrator (the\n“Administrator”) of the Company. The managing member of SVOF/MM is Tennenbaum Capital Partners, LLC (the “Advisor”), which serves as the investment\nmanager to the Company, TCPC Funding, TCPC Funding II and the SBIC. On August 1, 2018, the Advisor merged with and into a wholly owned subsidiary of\nBlackRock Capital Investment Advisors, LLC, an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of BlackRock, Inc. with the Advisor as the surviving entity. The SBIC was\norganized as a Delaware limited partnership in June 2013. On April 22, 2014, the SBIC received a license from the United States Small Business Administration\n(the “SBA”) to operate as a small business investment company under the provisions of Section 301(c) of the Small Business Investment Act of 1958.\nThe Company has elected to be treated as a RIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As a RIC, the Company will not be taxed on its income to the\nextent that it distributes such income each year and satisfies other applicable income tax requirements. All of the subsidiaries of the Company are treated as\ndisregarded entities.\nOur leverage program is comprised of $300.0 million in available debt under a revolving, multi-currency credit facility issued by SVCP (the “Operating\nFacility”), $200.0 million in available debt under a senior secured revolving credit facility issued by TCPC Funding II (“Funding Facility II”), amounts\noutstanding under a senior secured revolving credit facility originally issued by BCIC and assumed by Merger Sub (\"Merger Sub Facility\"), unsecured notes due\nDecember 2025 originally issued by BCIC and assumed by Merger Sub (the \"2025 Notes\"), $325.0 million in senior unsecured notes issued by the Company\nmaturing in 2026 (the “2026 Notes”), $325.0 million in senior unsecured notes issued by the Company maturing in 2029 (the “2029 Notes”) and $141.5 million\nin committed leverage from the SBA (the “SBA Program” and, together with the Operating Facility, Funding Facility II, Merger Sub Facility, the 2025 Notes,\nthe 2026 Notes and the 2029 Notes, the “Leverage Program”). Prior to being repaid on March 1, 2022, debt included $140.0 million in Convertible unsecured\nnotes due March 2022 issued by the Company (the \"2022 Convertible Notes\"). Prior to being repaid on August 23, 2024, debt included $250.0 million in\nunsecured notes due August 2024 issued by the Company (the \"2024 Notes\").\nTo qualify as a RIC, we must, among other things, meet certain source-of-income and asset diversification requirements and timely distribute to our\nshareholders generally at least 90% of our investment company taxable income, as defined by the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, for each year.\nPursuant to this election, we generally will not have to pay corporate level taxes on any income that we distribute to our shareholders provided that we satisfy\nthose requirements.\nOn September 6, 2023, the Company entered into the Merger Agreement with BCIC, Merger Sub, and, solely for the limited purposes set forth therein,\nBCIA and the Advisor. On March 18, 2024, the Company completed its previously announced Merger with BCIC. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, BCIC\nwas merged with and into Merger Sub, with Merger Sub continuing as the surviving company and as a subsidiary of SVCP. As a result of the Merger, BCIC’s\nseparate existence ceased.\nIn accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement, at the Closing, each outstanding share of BCIC’s common stock was converted into the right to\nreceive 0.3834 shares (the “Exchange Ratio”) of common stock, par value $0.001 per share of the Company (with BCIC shareholders receiving cash in lieu of\nfractional shares of the Company’s common stock). As a result of the Merger, the Company issued 27,823,870 shares of its common stock to former BCIC\nshareholders, after adjustment for BCIC’s shareholders receiving cash in lieu of fractional shares.\nSee “Note 12 – Merger with BlackRock Capital Investment Corporation” for further information regarding the Merger Agreement and the Merger.\n68\nTable of Contents\n(cid:0), (cid:0)Q (cid:0)Y (cid:0)H (cid:0)V (cid:0)W(cid:0)P (cid:0)H (cid:0)Q (cid:0)W(cid:0)V\nOur level of investment activity can and does vary substantially from period to period depending on many factors, including the amount of debt and\nequity capital available to middle-market companies, the level of merger and acquisition activity, the general economic environment and the competitive\nenvironment for the types of investments we make.\nAs a BDC, we are required to comply with certain regulatory requirements. For instance, we generally have to invest at least 70% of our total assets in\n“qualifying assets,” including securities and indebtedness of private U.S. companies, public U.S. operating companies whose securities are not listed on a\nnational securities exchange or registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, public domestic operating companies having a market\ncapitalization of less than $250.0 million, cash, cash equivalents, U.S. government securities and high-quality debt investments that mature in one year or less.\nWe are also permitted to make certain follow-on investments in companies that were eligible portfolio companies at the time of initial investment but that no\nlonger meet the definition. As of September 30, 2024, 83.1% of our total assets were invested in qualifying assets.\n(cid:0)5 (cid:0)H (cid:0)Y (cid:0)H (cid:0)Q (cid:0)X (cid:0)H (cid:0)V\nWe generate revenues primarily in the form of interest on the debt we hold. We also generate revenue from dividends on our equity interests, capital\ngains on the disposition of investments, and certain lease, fee, and other income. Our investments in fixed income instruments generally have an expected\nmaturity of three to five years, although we have no lower or upper constraint on maturity. Interest on our debt investments is generally payable quarterly or\nsemi-annually. Payments of principal of our debt investments may be amortized over the stated term of the investment, deferred for several years or due entirely\nat maturity. In some cases, our debt investments and preferred stock investments may defer payments of cash interest or dividends or PIK. Any outstanding\nprincipal amount of our debt investments and any accrued but unpaid interest will generally become due at the maturity date. In addition, we may generate\nrevenue in the form of prepayment fees, commitment, origination, structuring or due diligence fees, end-of-term or exit fees, fees for providing significant\nmanagerial assistance, consulting fees and other investment related income.\n(cid:0)( (cid:0)[ (cid:0)S (cid:0)H (cid:0)Q (cid:0)V (cid:0)H (cid:0)V\nOur primary operating expenses include the payment of a base management fee and, depending on our operating results, incentive compensation,\nexpenses reimbursable under the management agreement, administration fees and the allocable portion of overhead under the administration agreement. The\nbase management fee and incentive compensation remunerates the Advisor for work in identifying, evaluating, negotiating, closing and monitoring our\ninvestments. Our administration agreement with the Administrator provides that the Administrator may be reimbursed for costs and expenses incurred by the\nAdministrator for office space rental, office equipment and utilities allocable to us under the administration agreement, as well as any costs and expenses\nincurred by the Administrator or its affiliates relating to any non-investment advisory, administrative or operating services provided by the Administrator or its\naffiliates to us. We also bear all other costs and expenses of our operations and transactions (and the Company’s common shareholders indirectly bear all of the\ncosts and expenses of the Company, SVCP, TCPC Funding II, the SBIC and Merger Sub), which may include those relating to:\n• our organization;\n• calculating our net asset value (including the cost and expenses of any independent valuation firms);\n• interest payable on debt, if any, incurred to finance our investments;\n• costs of future offerings of our common stock and other securities, if any;\n• the base management fee and any incentive compensation;\n• dividends and distributions on our preferred shares, if any, and common shares;\n• administration fees payable under the administration agreement;\n• fees payable to third parties relating to, or associated with, making investments;\n• transfer agent and custodial fees;\n• registration fees;\n• listing fees;\n• taxes;\n• director fees and expenses;\n69\nTable of Contents\n• costs of preparing and filing reports or other documents with the SEC;\n• costs of any reports, proxy statements or other notices to our shareholders, including printing costs;\n• our fidelity bond;\n• directors and officers/errors and omissions liability insurance, and any other insurance premiums;\n• indemnification payments;\n• direct costs and expenses of administration, including audit and legal costs; and\n• all other expenses reasonably incurred by us and the Administrator in connection with administering our business, such as the allocable portion of\noverhead under the administration agreement, including rent and other allocable portions of the cost of certain of our officers and their respective\nstaffs.\nPrior to the Closing, the investment management agreement provided that the base management fee be calculated at an annual rate of 1.5% of our total\nassets (excluding cash and cash equivalents) payable quarterly in arrears; provided, however, that, effective as of February 9, 2019, the base management fee\nwas calculated at an annual rate of 1.0% of our total assets (excluding cash and cash equivalents) that exceed an amount equal to 200% of the net asset value of\nthe Company. For purposes of calculating the base management fee, “total assets” is determined without deduction for any borrowings or other liabilities. The\nbase management fee is calculated based on the value of our total assets and net asset value (excluding cash and cash equivalents) at the end of the most recently\ncompleted calendar quarter.\nIn connection with the Merger, the Company and the Advisor entered into the Amended and Restated Investment Advisory Agreement, pursuant to which\nthe Advisor reduced its base management fee rate for managing the Company from 1.50% to 1.25% on assets equal to or below 200% of the net asset value of\nthe Company with no change to the basis of calculation. Prior to the Closing, the Advisor’s base management fee rate for managing the Company was 1.50% on\nassets equal to or below 200% of the net asset value of the Company. The base management fee rate on assets that exceed 200% of the net asset value of the\nCompany remains 1.00%. The Company also entered into the Fee Waiver Agreement with the Advisor. The Fee Waiver Agreement provided that the Advisor\nwill waive all or a portion of its advisory fees to the extent the adjusted net investment income of the Company on a per share basis (determined by dividing the\nadjusted net investment income of the Company by the weighted average outstanding shares of the Company during the relevant quarter) is less than $0.32 per\nshare in any of the first four (4) fiscal quarters ending after the Closing (the first of which will be the quarter in which the Closing occurred) to the extent there\nare sufficient advisory fees to cover such deficit (the waiver amount in a given quarter cannot exceed the total advisory fees for such quarter).\nAdditionally, the previous investment management agreement dated February 9, 2019 and the Amended and Restated Investment Advisory Agreement\neach provide that the Advisor or its affiliates may be entitled to incentive compensation under certain circumstances. According to the terms of such agreements,\nno incentive compensation was incurred prior to January 1, 2013. Under the previous investment management agreement, dated February 9, 2019, and as\ncontinued under the Amended and Restated Investment Advisory Agreement, the incentive compensation equals the sum of (1) 20% of all ordinary income since\nJanuary 1, 2013 through February 8, 2019 and 17.5% thereafter and (2) 20% of all net realized capital gains (net of any net unrealized capital depreciation) since\nJanuary 1, 2013 through February 8, 2019 and 17.5% thereafter, less ordinary income incentive compensation and capital gains incentive compensation\npreviously paid. However, incentive compensation will only be paid to the extent the cumulative total return of the Company after incentive compensation and\nincluding such payment would equal or exceed a 7% annual return on daily weighted-average contributed common equity. The determination of incentive\ncompensation is subject to limitations under the 1940 Act and the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.\nCritical accounting policies and estimates\nOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements, which have been prepared in\naccordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts\nof assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Changes in the economic environment, financial markets and any other parameters used in determining such\nestimates could cause actual results to differ. Management considers the following critical accounting policies important to understanding the financial\nstatements. In addition to the discussion below, our critical accounting policies are further described in the notes to our financial statements.\n70\nTable of Contents\n(cid:0)9 (cid:0)D (cid:0)O(cid:0)X (cid:0)D (cid:0)W(cid:0)L(cid:0)R (cid:0)Q (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)R (cid:0)I(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)S (cid:0)R (cid:0)U (cid:0)W(cid:0)I(cid:0)R (cid:0)O(cid:0)L(cid:0)R (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)L(cid:0)Q (cid:0)Y (cid:0)H (cid:0)V (cid:0)W(cid:0)P (cid:0)H (cid:0)Q (cid:0)W(cid:0)V\nPursuant to Rule 2a-5 (the “Rule”) under the 1940 Act, the Board of Directors designated the Advisor as the Company’s valuation designee (the\n“Valuation Designee”) to perform certain fair value functions, including performing fair value determinations and has approved policies and procedures adopted\nby the Advisor to seek to ensure compliance with the requirements of the Rules.\nWe value our portfolio investments at fair value based upon the principles and methods of valuation set forth in policies and procedures reviewed and\napproved by a committee established by the Valuation Designee (the \"Valuation Committee\"). Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an\nasset in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Market participants are buyers and sellers in the principal (or most\nadvantageous) market for the asset that (i) are independent of us, (ii) are knowledgeable, having a reasonable understanding about the asset based on all\navailable information (including information that might be obtained through due diligence efforts that are usual and customary), (iii) are able to transact for the\nasset, and (iv) are willing to transact for the asset or liability (that is, they are motivated but not forced or otherwise compelled to do so).\nInvestments for which market quotations are readily available are valued at such market quotations unless the quotations are deemed not to represent fair\nvalue. We generally obtain market quotations from recognized exchanges, market quotation systems, independent pricing services or one or more broker-dealers\nor market makers. However, short term debt investments with original maturities of generally three months or less are valued at amortized cost, which\napproximates fair value. Debt and equity securities for which market quotations are not readily available, which is the case for many of our investments, or for\nwhich market quotations are deemed not to represent fair value, are valued at fair value using a consistently applied valuation process in accordance with our\ndocumented valuation policies and procedures reviewed and approved by the Valuation Committee. The policies were adopted by the Valuation Designee and\napproved by the Board. Due to the inherent uncertainty and subjectivity of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market\nvalue, the fair value of our investments may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a readily available market value existed for such\ninvestments and may differ materially from the values that we may ultimately realize. In addition, changes in the market environment and other events may have\ndiffering impacts on the market quotations used to value some of our investments than on the fair values of our investments for which market quotations are not\nreadily available. Market quotations may be deemed not to represent fair value in certain circumstances where we believe that facts and circumstances\napplicable to an issuer, a seller or purchaser, or the market for a particular security cause current market quotations to not reflect the fair value of the security.\nExamples of these events could include cases where a security trades infrequently causing a quoted purchase or sale price to become stale, where there is a\n“forced” sale by a distressed seller, where market quotations vary substantially among market makers, or where there is a wide bid-ask spread or significant\nincrease in the bid-ask spread.\nThe valuation process adopted by the Valuation Designee with respect to investments for which market quotations are not readily available or for which\nmarket quotations are deemed not to represent fair value is as follows:\n• The investment professionals of the Valuation Designee provide recent portfolio company financial statements and other reporting materials to\nindependent valuation firms approved by the Valuation Committee.\n• Such firms evaluate this information along with relevant observable market data to conduct independent appraisals each quarter, and their\npreliminary valuation conclusions are documented and discussed with senior management of the Valuation Designee.\n• The fair value of smaller investments comprising in the aggregate less than 5% of our total capitalization may be determined by the Valuation\nDesignee in good faith in accordance with our valuation policy without the employment of an independent valuation firm.\n• The Valuation Designee determines the fair value of the remainder of investments in our portfolio in good faith based on the input of the\nValuation Committee and the respective independent valuation firms.\nThose investments for which market quotations are not readily available or for which market quotations are deemed not to represent fair value are valued\nutilizing one or more methodologies, including the market approach, the income approach, or in the case of recent investments, the cost approach, as\nappropriate. The market approach uses prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or\nliabilities (including a business). The income approach uses valuation techniques to convert future amounts (for example, cash flows or earnings) to a single\npresent amount (discounted). The measurement is based on the value indicated by current market expectations about those future amounts. In following these\napproaches, the types of factors that the Valuation Designee may take into account in determining the fair value of our investments include, as relevant and\namong other factors: available current market data, including relevant and applicable market trading and transaction comparable, applicable market yields and\nmultiples, security covenants, call protection provisions, information rights, the nature and realizable value of any collateral, the portfolio company’s ability to\nmake payments, its earnings and discounted cash flows, the markets in which the portfolio company does business, comparisons of financial ratios of peer\ncompanies that are public, merger and acquisition comparable, our principal market (as the reporting entity) and enterprise values.\n71\nTable of Contents\nWhen valuing all of our investments, we strive to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. Inputs refer\nbroadly to the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset, including assumptions about risk. Inputs may be observable or unobservable.\nObservable inputs are inputs that reflect the assumptions market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability developed based on market data obtained\nfrom sources independent of us. Unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect our assumptions about the assumptions market participants would use in pricing an\nasset or liability developed based on the best information available in the circumstances.\nOur investments may be categorized based on the types of inputs used in their valuation. The level in the GAAP valuation hierarchy in which an\ninvestment falls is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the valuation of the investment in its entirety. Investments are classified by GAAP into the\nthree broad levels as follows:\nLevel 1 — Investments valued using unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets.\nLevel 2 — Investments valued using other unadjusted observable market inputs, e.g. quoted prices in markets that are not active or quotes for\ncomparable instruments.\nLevel 3 — Investments that are valued using quotes and other observable market data to the extent available, but which also take into consideration one\nor more unobservable inputs that are significant to the valuation taken as a whole.\nAs of September 30, 2024, 0.0% of our investments were categorized as Level 1, 1.5% were categorized as Level 2, 98.4% were categorized as Level 3\ninvestments valued based on valuations by independent third-party sources, and 0.1% were categorized as Level 3 investments valued based on valuations by\nthe Valuation Designee.\nAs of December 31, 2023, 0.0% of our investments were categorized as Level 1, 3.0% were categorized as Level 2, 96.9% were categorized as Level 3\ninvestments valued based on valuations by independent third-party sources, and 0.1% were categorized as Level 3 investments valued based on valuations by\nthe Valuation Designee.\nDetermination of fair value involves subjective judgments and estimates. Accordingly, the notes to our consolidated financial statements express the\nuncertainty with respect to the possible effect of such valuations, and any change in such valuations, on the financial statements.\n(cid:0)5 (cid:0)H (cid:0)Y (cid:0)H (cid:0)Q (cid:0)X (cid:0)H (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)U (cid:0)H (cid:0)F (cid:0)R (cid:0)J (cid:0)Q (cid:0)L(cid:0)W(cid:0)L(cid:0)R (cid:0)Q\nInterest and dividend income, including income paid in kind, is recorded on an accrual basis, when such amounts are considered collectible. Origination,\nstructuring, closing, commitment and other upfront fees, including original issue discounts, earned with respect to capital commitments are generally amortized\nor accreted into interest income over the life of the respective debt investment, as are end-of-term or exit fees receivable upon repayment of a debt investment.\nOther fees, including certain amendment fees, prepayment fees and commitment fees on broken deals, are recognized as earned. Prepayment fees and similar\nincome due upon the early repayment of a loan or debt security are recognized when earned and are included in interest income.\nCertain of our debt investments are purchased at a discount to par as a result of the underlying credit risks and financial results of the issuer, as well as\ngeneral market factors that influence the financial markets as a whole. Discounts on the acquisition of corporate bonds are generally amortized using the\neffective-interest or constant-yield method assuming there are no questions as to collectability. When principal payments on a loan are received in an amount in\nexcess of the loan’s amortized cost, the excess principal payments are recorded as interest income.\nDebt investments are generally placed on non-accrual status when it is probable that principal or interest will not be collected according to the contractual\nterms. When a debt investment is placed on non-accrual status, accrued and unpaid interest (including any accrued PIK interest) is generally reversed, and\ndiscount accretion or premium amortization is discontinued. The Company does not reverse previously capitalized PIK income. Payments received on non-\naccrual investments may either be recognized as income or applied to principal depending upon the Company’s judgment regarding collectability of the\noutstanding principal and interest. Non-accrual investments are restored to accrual status if past due principal and interest are paid or, in the Company’s\njudgment, the repayment of the remaining contractual principal and interest is expected. The Company may opt not to place a distressed debt investment on non-\naccrual status if principal and interest are secured through sufficient collateral value and are in the process of collection through legal actions or other efforts that\nare expected to result in repayment of principal and interest.\n72\nTable of Contents\n(cid:0)1 (cid:0)H (cid:0)W(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)U (cid:0)H (cid:0)D (cid:0)O(cid:0)L(cid:0)] (cid:0)H (cid:0)G (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)J (cid:0)D (cid:0)L(cid:0)Q (cid:0)V (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)R (cid:0)U (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)O(cid:0)R (cid:0)V (cid:0)V (cid:0)H (cid:0)V (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)D (cid:0)Q (cid:0)G (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)Q (cid:0)H (cid:0)W(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)F (cid:0)K (cid:0)D (cid:0)Q (cid:0)J (cid:0)H (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)L(cid:0)Q (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)X (cid:0)Q (cid:0)U (cid:0)H (cid:0)D (cid:0)O(cid:0)L(cid:0)] (cid:0)H (cid:0)G (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)D (cid:0)S (cid:0)S (cid:0)U (cid:0)H (cid:0)F (cid:0)L(cid:0)D (cid:0)W(cid:0)L(cid:0)R (cid:0)Q (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)R (cid:0)U (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)G (cid:0)H (cid:0)S (cid:0)U (cid:0)H (cid:0)F (cid:0)L(cid:0)D (cid:0)W(cid:0)L(cid:0)R (cid:0)Q\nWe measure realized gains or losses by the difference between the net proceeds from the repayment or sale and the amortized cost basis of the\ninvestment, without regard to unrealized appreciation or depreciation previously recognized.

The change in net unrealized\nappreciation for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily reflects a $37.0 million reversal of previously recognized unrealized losses from the\nreorganization of our investment in Autoalert, offset by a $8.0 million unrealized loss in Hylan, a $6.8 million unrealized loss on our investment in Magenta\nBuyer, a $5.3 million unrealized loss on our investment in 36th Street, a $5.1 million unrealized loss on our investment in Khoros, a $4.4 million unrealized loss\non our investment in Edmentum, a $3.9 million unrealized loss on our investment in Astra Acquisition, and a $3.9 million unrealized loss on our investment in\nPerch.\n(cid:0), (cid:0)Q (cid:0)F (cid:0)H (cid:0)Q (cid:0)W(cid:0)L(cid:0)Y (cid:0)H (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)F (cid:0)R (cid:0)P (cid:0)S (cid:0)H (cid:0)Q (cid:0)V (cid:0)D (cid:0)W(cid:0)L(cid:0)R (cid:0)Q\nIncentive fees, included in operating expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were $6.5 million and $6.0 million, and for the\nnine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were $19.2 million and $17.3 million, respectively, and were each payable due to our performance exceeding\nthe cumulative total return threshold during those periods. The increase in incentive fee expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024\ncompared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, was the result of higher pre-incentive fee net investment income earned during\nthe three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 which was driven by higher SOFR rates and additional investment income earned on investments acquired\nas a result of the Merger.\n(cid:0), (cid:0)Q (cid:0)F (cid:0)R (cid:0)P (cid:0)H (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)W(cid:0)D (cid:0)[ (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)H (cid:0)[ (cid:0)S (cid:0)H (cid:0)Q (cid:0)V (cid:0)H (cid:0)(cid:15)(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)L(cid:0)Q (cid:0)F (cid:0)O(cid:0)X (cid:0)G (cid:0)L(cid:0)Q (cid:0)J (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)H (cid:0)[ (cid:0)F (cid:0)L(cid:0)V (cid:0)H (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)W(cid:0)D (cid:0)[\nThe Company has elected to be treated as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code and operates in a manner so as to qualify for the tax treatment\napplicable to RICs.

The Company has made and intends to continue to make the requisite distributions to its\nshareholders which will generally relieve the Company from U.S. federal income taxes.\nDepending on the level of taxable income earned in a tax year, we may choose to carry forward taxable income in excess of current year dividend\ndistributions from such current year taxable income into the next tax year and pay a 4% excise tax on such income. Any excise tax expense is recorded at year\nend as such amounts are known. No excise tax was incurred for the nine months ended September 30, 2024.\nOn March 18, 2024, the Company completed its previously announced Merger with BCIC. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, BCIC was merged with\nand into Merger Sub, with Merger Sub continuing as the surviving company and as a subsidiary of SVCP.

The Merger has been accounted for as an asset acquisition of\nBCIC by the Company in accordance with the asset acquisition method of accounting as detailed in ASC 805-50 (\"ASC 805\"), Business Combinations-Related\nIssues. The Company determined the fair value of the shares of the Company's common stock that were issued to former BCIC shareholders pursuant to the\nMerger Agreement plus transaction costs to be the consideration paid in connection with the Merger under ASC 805. The consideration paid to BCIC\nshareholders was less than the aggregate fair values of the BCIC assets acquired and liabilities assumed, which resulted in a purchase discount (the “purchase\ndiscount”). The consideration paid was allocated to the individual BCIC assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on the relative fair values of net\nidentifiable assets acquired other than “non-qualifying” assets and liabilities (for example, cash) and did not give rise to goodwill. As a result, the purchase\ndiscount was allocated to the cost basis of the BCIC investments acquired by the Company on a pro-rata basis based on their relative fair values as of the\neffective time of the Merger. Immediately following the Merger, the investments were marked to their respective fair values in accordance with ASC 820 which\nresulted in immediate recognition of net unrealized appreciation in the Consolidated Statement of Operations as a result of the Merger. The purchase discount\nallocated to the BCIC debt investments acquired will amortize over the remaining life of each respective debt investment through interest income, with a\ncorresponding adjustment recorded to unrealized appreciation or depreciation on such investment acquired through its ultimate disposition. The purchase\ndiscount allocated to BCIC equity investments acquired will not amortize over the life of such investments through interest income and, assuming no subsequent\nchange to the fair value of the equity investments acquired and disposition of such equity investments at fair value, the Company may recognize a realized gain\nwith a corresponding reversal of the unrealized appreciation on disposition of such equity investments acquired.\nAs a supplement to the Company’s reported GAAP financial measures, we have provided the following non-GAAP financial measures that we believe\nare useful:\n• “Adjusted net investment income” – excludes the amortization of purchase accounting discount from net investment income calculated in\naccordance with GAAP;\n• “Adjusted net realized and unrealized gain (loss)” – excludes the unrealized appreciation resulting from the purchase discount and the\ncorresponding reversal of the unrealized appreciation from the amortization of the purchase discount from the determination of net realized and\nunrealized gain (loss) determined in accordance with GAAP; and\n• “Adjusted net increase (decrease) in net assets resulting from operations” – calculates net increase (decrease) in net assets resulting from\noperations based on Adjusted net investment income and Adjusted net realized and unrealized gain (loss).\n77\nTable of Contents\nThree months ended September 30, Nine months ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nPer Per Per Per\nAmount Share Amount Share Amount Share Amount Share\nNet investment income $ 33,877,641 0.40 $ 28,319,912 0.49 $ 97,964,446 1.26 $ 81,297,518 1.41\nLess: Purchase accounting discount\namortization 3,044,864 0.04 — — 7,278,861 0.09 — —\nAdjusted net investment income $ 30,832,777 0.36 $ 28,319,912 0.49 $ 90,685,585 1.17 $ 81,297,518 1.41\nNet realized and unrealized gain (loss)$ (12,244,681) (0.14) $ (15,496,980) (0.27) $ (122,550,862) (1.58) $ (29,510,021) (0.51)\nLess: Realized gain (loss) due to the\nallocation of purchase discount 2,727,500 0.03 — — 7,915,125 0.10 — —\nLess: Net change in unrealized\nappreciation (depreciation) due to the\nallocation of purchase discount (5,772,364) (0.07) — — 6,692,862 0.09 — —\nAdjusted net realized and unrealized\ngain (loss) $ (9,199,817) (0.10) $ (15,496,980) (0.27) $ (137,158,849) (1.77) $ (29,510,021) (0.51)\nNet increase (decrease) in net assets\nresulting from operations $ 21,632,960 0.25 $ 12,822,932 0.22 $ (24,586,416) (0.32) $ 51,787,497 0.90\nLess: Purchase accounting discount\namortization 3,044,864 0.04 — — 7,278,861 0.09 — —\nLess: Realized gain (loss) due to the\nallocation of purchase discount 2,727,500 0.03 — — 7,915,125 0.10 — —\nLess: Net change in unrealized\nappreciation (depreciation) due to the\nallocation of purchase discount (5,772,364) (0.07) — — 6,692,862 0.09 — —\nAdjusted net increase (decrease) in\nassets resulting from operations $ 21,632,960 0.25 $ 12,822,932 0.22 $ (46,473,264) (0.60) $ 51,787,497 0.90\nWe believe that the adjustment to exclude the full effect of purchase discount accounting under ASC 805 from these financial measures is meaningful\nbecause of the potential impact on the comparability of these financial measures that we and investors use to assess our financial condition and results of\noperations period over period. Although these non-GAAP financial measures are intended to enhance investors’ understanding of our business and performance,\nthese non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered an alternative to GAAP. The aforementioned non-GAAP financial measures may not be\ncomparable to similar non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies.\nLiquidity and capital resources\nSince our inception, our liquidity and capital resources have been generated primarily through the initial private placement of common shares of Special\nValue Continuation Fund, LLC (the predecessor entity) which were subsequently converted to common stock of the Company, the net proceeds from the initial\nand secondary public offerings of our common stock, amounts outstanding under our Leverage Program, and cash flows from operations, including investments\nsales and repayments and income earned from investments and cash equivalents. The primary uses of cash have been investments in portfolio companies, cash\ndistributions to our equity holders, payments to service our Leverage Program and other general corporate purposes.\nOn February 27, 2024, the Board of Directors approved a new dividend reinvestment plan (the “DRIP”) for the Company. The DRIP was effective as of,\nand will apply to the reinvestment of cash distributions with a record date after March 18, 2024. Under the DRIP, shareholders will automatically receive cash\ndividends and distributions unless they “opt in” to the DRIP and elect to have their dividends and distributions reinvested in additional shares of the Company’s\ncommon stock. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the former shareholders of BCIC that participated in the BCIC dividend reinvestment plan at the time of the\nMerger have been automatically enrolled in the Company’s DRIP and will have their shares reinvested in additional shares of the Company’s common stock on\nfuture distributions, unless they “opt out” of the DRIP. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, approximately $1.5 million of cash distributions were\nreinvested for electing Participants through purchase of shares in the open market in accordance with the terms of the DRIP.\nOn February 24, 2015, the Company’s Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase plan (the “Company Repurchase Plan”) to acquire up to $50.0\nmillion in the aggregate of the Company’s common stock at prices at certain thresholds below the Company’s net asset value per share, in accordance with the\nguidelines specified in Rule 10b-18 and Rule 10b5-1 of the 1934 Act. The Company Repurchase Plan is designed to allow the Company to repurchase its\ncommon stock at times when it otherwise might be prevented from doing so under insider trading laws. The Company Repurchase Plan requires an agent\nselected by the Company to repurchase shares of common stock on the Company’s behalf if and when the market price per share is at certain thresholds below\nthe most recently reported net asset value per share. Under the plan, the agent will increase the volume of purchases made if the price of the Company’s\ncommon stock declines, subject to volume restrictions. The timing and amount of any stock repurchased depends on the terms and conditions of the Company\nRepurchase Plan, the market price of the common stock and trading volumes, and no assurance can be given that any\n78\nTable of Contents\nparticular amount of common stock will be repurchased. The Company Repurchase Plan was re-approved on August 1, 2024, to be in effect through the earlier\nof April 30, 2025, unless further extended or terminated by our Board of Directors, or such time as the approved $50.0 million repurchase amount has been fully\nutilized, subject to certain conditions. No shares were repurchased by the Company under the Company Repurchase plan for the nine months ended September\n30, 2024 and 2023.\nTotal leverage outstanding and available under the combined Leverage Program at September 30, 2024 were as follows:\nCarrying Total\nMaturity Rate Value (1) Available Capacity\nOperating Facility 2029 SOFR+2.00%(2) $ 121,253,796 $ 178,746,204 $ 300,000,000 (3)\nFunding Facility II 2027 SOFR+2.05%(4) 51,000,000 149,000,000 200,000,000 (5)\nMerger Sub Facility(6) 2028 SOFR+2.00%(7) 125,000,000 140,000,000 265,000,000 (8)\nSBA Debentures 2025−2031 2.45%(9) 131,500,000 10,000,000 141,500,000\n2025 Notes ($92 million par)(6) 2025 Fixed/Variable(10) 92,000,000 — 92,000,000\n2026 Notes ($325 million par) 2026 2.85% 325,497,355 — 325,497,355\n2029 Notes ($325 million par) 2029 6.95% 321,590,452 — 321,590,452\nTotal leverage 1,167,841,603 $ 477,746,204 $ 1,645,587,807\nUnamortized issuance costs (7,798,616)\nDebt, net of unamortized issuance costs $ 1,160,042,987\n(1) Except for the 2026 Notes and 2029 Notes, all carrying values are the same as the principal amounts outstanding.\n(2) As of September 30, 2024, $113.0 million of the outstanding amount was subject to a SOFR credit adjustment of 0.11%. $8.3 million of the outstanding amount bore interest at a\nrate of EURIBOR + 2.00%.\n(3) Operating Facility includes a $100.0 million accordion which allows for expansion of the facility to up to $400.0 million subject to consent from the lender and other customary\nconditions.\n(4) Subject to certain funding requirements and a SOFR credit adjustment of 0.15%.\n(5) Funding Facility II includes a $50.0 million accordion which allows for expansion of the facility to up to $250.0 million subject to consent from the lender and other customary\nconditions.\n(6) Debt assumed by the Company as a result of the Merger with BCIC.\n(7) The applicable margin for SOFR-based borrowings could be either 1.75% or 2.00% depending on a ratio of the borrowing base to certain committed indebtedness, and is also\nsubject to a credit spread adjustment of 0.10%.

On March 23, 2018, the Small Business Credit Availability Act (“SBCAA”) was signed into law, which\namong other things, amended Section 61(a) of the 1940 Act to add a new Section 61(a)(2) that reduces the asset coverage requirement applicable to BDCs from\n200% to 150% so long as the BDC meets certain disclosure requirements and obtains certain approvals. The reduced asset coverage requirement would permit a\nBDC to have a ratio of total outstanding indebtedness to common equity of 2:1 as compared to a maximum of 1:1 under the 200% asset coverage requirement.\nEffective November 7, 2018, the Company’s Board of Directors, including a “required majority” (as such term is defined in Section 57(o) of the 1940\nAct) of our Board of Directors, approved the application of the modified asset coverage requirements set forth in Section 61(a)(2) of the 1940 Act, as amended\nby the SBCAA (the “Asset Coverage Ratio Election”), which would have resulted (had the Company not received earlier shareholder approval) in our asset\ncoverage requirement applicable to senior securities being reduced from 200% to 150%, effective on November 7, 2019. On February 8, 2019, the shareholders\nof the Company approved the Asset Coverage Ratio Election, and, as a result, effective on February 9, 2019, our asset coverage requirement applicable to senior\nsecurities was reduced from 200% to 150%. As of September 30, 2024, the Company’s asset coverage ratio was 183.2%.\nOn July 13, 2015, we obtained exemptive relief from the SEC to permit us to exclude debt outstanding under the SBA Debentures from our asset\ncoverage test under the 1940 Act. The exemptive relief provides us with increased flexibility under the 150% asset coverage test by permitting the SBIC to\nborrow up to $141.5 million more than it would otherwise be able to absent the receipt of this exemptive relief.\nNet cash provided by operating activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was $221.5 million, consisting primarily of $84.8 million in\nnet investment income (net of non-cash income and expenses) and the settlement of dispositions of investments (net of acquisitions) of $136.7 million.\nNet cash used by financing activities was $229.5 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, consisting primarily of a $250.0 million\nrepayment of the 2024 Notes, $208.3 million in net credit facility repayments, $85.1 million in dividends paid to common shareholders (including $7.3 million\nof dividends declared by BCIC prior to the Merger and paid to former BCIC shareholders\n79\nTable of Contents\nout of cash and cash equivalents acquired) and $7.5 million in payments of associated debt issuance costs, offset by $321.4 million in proceeds from the\nissuance of the 2029 Notes(cid:0)(cid:17)\nAt September 30, 2024, we had $104.2 million in cash and cash equivalents.\nThe Operating Facility, Funding Facility II and Merger Sub Facility (in the aggregate) are secured by substantially all of the assets in our portfolio,\nincluding cash and cash equivalents, and are subject to compliance with customary affirmative and negative covenants, including the maintenance of a minimum\nshareholders’ equity, the maintenance of a ratio of not less than 150% of total assets (less total liabilities other than indebtedness) to total indebtedness, and\nrestrictions on certain payments and issuance of debt. Unfavorable economic conditions may result in a decrease in the value of our investments, which would\naffect both the asset coverage ratios and the value of the collateral securing the Operating Facility, Funding Facility II and Merger Sub Facility, and may\ntherefore impact our ability to borrow under the Operating Facility, Funding Facility II and Merger Sub Facility. In addition to regulatory restrictions that restrict\nour ability to raise capital, the Leverage Program contains various covenants which, if not complied with, could accelerate repayment of debt, thereby materially\nand adversely affecting our liquidity, financial condition and results of operations. At September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with all financial and\noperational covenants required by the Leverage Program.\nUnfavorable economic conditions, while potentially creating attractive opportunities for us, may decrease liquidity and raise the cost of capital generally,\nwhich could limit our ability to renew, extend or replace the Leverage Program on terms as favorable as are currently included therein. If we are unable to\nrenew, extend or replace the Leverage Program upon the various dates of maturity, we expect to have sufficient funds to repay the outstanding balances in full\nfrom our net investment income and sales of, and repayments of principal from, our portfolio company investments, as well as from anticipated debt and equity\ncapital raises, among other sources. Unfavorable economic conditions may limit our ability to raise capital or the ability of the companies in which we invest to\nrepay our loans or engage in a liquidity event, such as a sale, recapitalization or initial public offering. The Operating Facility, Funding Facility II, Merger Sub\nFacility, the 2025 Notes, the 2026 Notes and the 2029 Notes, mature in August 2029, August 2027, September 2028, December 2025, February 2026 and May\n2029, respectively. Any inability to renew, extend or replace the Leverage Program could adversely impact our liquidity and ability to find new investments or\nmaintain distributions to our shareholders.\nChallenges in the market are intensified for us by certain regulatory limitations under the Code and the 1940 Act. To maintain our qualification as a RIC,\nwe must satisfy, among other requirements, an annual distribution requirement to pay out at least 90% of our ordinary income and short-term capital gains to our\nshareholders. Because we are required to distribute our income in this manner, and because the illiquidity of many of our investments may make it difficult for\nus to finance new investments through the sale of current investments, our ability to make new investments is highly dependent upon external financing. While\nwe anticipate being able to continue to satisfy all covenants and repay the outstanding balances under the Leverage Program when due, there can be no\nassurance that we will be able to do so, which could lead to an event of default.\nContractual obligations\nIn addition to obligations under our Leverage Program, we have entered into several contracts under which we have future commitments. Pursuant to an\ninvestment management agreement, the Advisor manages our day-to-day operations and provides investment advisory services to us. Payments under the\ninvestment management agreement are equal to a percentage of the value of our total assets (excluding cash and cash equivalents) and an incentive\ncompensation, plus reimbursement of certain expenses incurred by the Advisor. Under our administration agreement, the Administrator provides us with\nadministrative services, facilities and personnel. Payments under the administration agreement are equal to an allocable portion of overhead and other expenses\nincurred by the Administrator in performing its obligations to us and may include rent and our allocable portion of the cost of certain of our officers and their\nrespective staffs. We are responsible for reimbursing the Advisor for due diligence and negotiation expenses, fees and expenses of custodians, administrators,\ntransfer and distribution agents, counsel and directors, insurance, filings and registrations, proxy expenses, expenses of communications to investors, compliance\nexpenses, interest, taxes, portfolio transaction expenses, costs of responding to regulatory inquiries and reporting to regulatory authorities, costs and expenses of\npreparing and maintaining our books and records, indemnification, litigation and other extraordinary expenses and such other expenses as are approved by the\ndirectors as being reasonably related to our organization, offering, capitalization, operation or administration and any portfolio investments, as applicable. The\nAdvisor is not responsible for any of the foregoing expenses and such services are not investment advisory services under the 1940 Act. Either party may\nterminate each of the investment management agreement and administration agreement without penalty upon not less than 60 days’ written notice to the other.\nDistributions\nOur quarterly dividends and distributions to common shareholders are recorded on the ex-dividend date. Distributions are declared considering our\nestimate of annual taxable income available for distribution to shareholders and the amount of taxable income carried over from the prior year for distribution in\nthe current year. We do not have a policy to pay distributions at a specific level and expect to continue to distribute substantially all of our taxable income. We\ncannot assure shareholders that they will receive any distributions or distributions at a particular level.\n80\nTable of Contents\nThe following tables summarize dividends declared for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:\nAmount\nPer Reinvested\nDate Declared Record Date Payment Date Type Share Total Amount Amount(1)\nFebruary 29, 2024 March 14, 2024 March 29, 2024 Regular $ 0.34 $ 19,640,870 $ —\nMay 1, 2024 June 14, 2024 June 28, 2024 Regular 0.34 29,100,986 771,651\nAugust 7, 2024 September 16, 2024 September 30, 2024 Regular 0.34 29,100,986 722,140\n$ 1.02 $ 77,842,842 $ 1,493,791\n(1) Dividends reinvested through purchase of shares in the open market.\nAmount\nPer Reinvested\nDate Declared Record Date Payment Date Type Share Total Amount Amount(1)\nFebruary 28, 2023 March 17, 2023 March 31, 2023 Regular $ 0.32 $ 18,485,524 $ —\nMay 4, 2023 June 16, 2023 June 30, 2023 Regular 0.34 19,640,870 —\nAugust 3, 2023 September 15, 2023 September 29, 2023 Regular 0.34 19,640,870 —\nAugust 3, 2023 September 15, 2023 September 29, 2023 Special 0.10 5,776,726 —\n$ 1.10 $ 63,543,990 $ —\n(1) No dividend reinvestment plan was effective for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\nIn addition, the Company paid $7.3 million of dividends payable assumed in the Merger that were declared on March 4, 2024 by the BCIC Board of\nDirectors for the benefit of former BCIC shareholders of record as of March 15, 2024. Such amount was paid from BCIC cash and cash equivalents acquired by\nthe Company in the Merger.\nWe have elected to be taxed as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code. In order to maintain favorable RIC tax treatment, we must distribute annually to\nour shareholders at least 90% of our ordinary income and realized net short-term capital gains in excess of realized net long-term capital losses, if any, out of the\nassets legally available for distribution. In order to avoid certain excise taxes imposed on RICs, we must distribute during each calendar year an amount at least\nequal to the sum of:\n• 98% of our ordinary income (not taking into account any capital gains or losses) for the calendar year;\n• 98.2% of the amount by which our capital gains exceed our capital losses (adjusted for certain ordinary losses) for the one-year period generally\nending on October 31 of the calendar year; and\n• certain undistributed amounts from previous years on which we paid no U.S. federal income tax.\nWe may, at our discretion, carry forward taxable income in excess of calendar year distributions and pay a 4% excise tax on this income. If we choose to\ndo so, all other things being equal, this would increase expenses and reduce the amounts available to be distributed to our shareholders. We will accrue excise\ntax on estimated taxable income as required. In addition, although we currently intend to distribute realized net capital gains (i.e., net long-term capital gains in\nexcess of short-term capital losses), if any, at least annually, out of the assets legally available for such distributions, we may in the future decide to retain such\ncapital gains for investment.\nWe may not be able to achieve operating results that will allow us to make dividends and distributions at a specific level or to increase the amount of\nthese dividends and distributions from time to time. Also, we may be limited in our ability to make dividends and distributions due to the asset coverage test\napplicable to us as a BDC under the 1940 Act and due to provisions in our existing and future credit facilities. If we do not distribute a certain percentage of our\nincome annually, we will suffer adverse tax consequences, including possible loss of favorable RIC tax treatment. In addition, in accordance with U.S. generally\naccepted accounting principles and tax regulations, we include in income certain amounts that we have not yet received in cash, such as PIK interest, which\nrepresents contractual interest added to the loan balance that becomes due at the end of the loan term, or the accrual of original issue or market discount. Since\nwe may recognize income before or without receiving cash representing such income, we may have difficulty meeting the requirement to distribute at least 90%\nof our investment company taxable income to obtain tax benefits as a RIC and may be subject to an excise tax.\nIn order to satisfy the annual distribution requirement applicable to RICs, we have the ability to declare a large portion of a dividend in shares of our\ncommon stock instead of in cash. As long as a portion of such dividend is paid in cash and certain requirements are met, the entire distribution would be treated\nas a dividend for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\n81\nTable of Contents\nRelated Parties\nWe have entered into a number of business relationships with affiliated or related parties, including the following:\n• Each of the Company, TCPC Funding II, and the SBIC has entered into an investment management agreement with the Advisor.\n• The Administrator provides us with administrative services necessary to conduct our day-to-day operations. For providing these services, facilities\nand personnel, the Administrator may be reimbursed by us for expenses incurred by the Administrator in performing its obligations under the\nadministration agreement, including our allocable portion of the cost of certain of our officers and the Administrator’s administrative staff and\nproviding, at our request and on our behalf, significant managerial assistance to our portfolio companies to which we are required to provide such\nassistance. The Administrator is an affiliate of the Advisor and certain other series and classes of SVOF/MM, LLC serve as the general partner or\nmanaging member of certain other funds managed by the Advisor.\n• We have entered into a royalty-free license agreement with BlackRock and the Advisor, pursuant to which each of BlackRock and the Advisor has\nagreed to grant us a non-exclusive, royalty-free license to use the name \"BlackRock\" and \"TCP.\"\nThe Advisor and its affiliates, employees and associates currently do and in the future may manage other funds and accounts. The Advisor and its\naffiliates may determine that an investment is appropriate for us and for one or more of those other funds or accounts. Accordingly, conflicts may arise regarding\nthe allocation of investments or opportunities among us and those accounts. In general, the Advisor will allocate investment opportunities pro rata among us and\nthe other funds and accounts (assuming the investment satisfies the objectives of each) based on the amount of committed capital each then has available. The\nallocation of certain investment opportunities in private placements is subject to independent director approval pursuant to the terms of the co-investment\nexemptive order applicable to us. In certain cases, investment opportunities may be made other than on a pro rata basis. For example, we may desire to retain an\nasset at the same time that one or more other funds or accounts desire to sell it or we may not have additional capital to invest at a time the other funds or\naccounts do. If the Advisor is unable to manage our investments effectively, we may be unable to achieve our investment objective. In addition, the Advisor may\nface conflicts in allocating investment opportunities between us and certain other entities that could impact our investment returns. While our ability to enter into\ntransactions with our affiliates is restricted under the 1940 Act, we have received an exemptive order from the SEC permitting certain affiliated investments\nsubject to certain conditions. As a result, we may face conflict of interests and investments made pursuant to the exemptive order conditions which could in\ncertain circumstances affect adversely the price paid or received by us or the availability or size of the position purchased or sold by us.\nRecent Developments\nFrom October 1, 2024 through November 5, 2024, the Company has invested approximately $29.5 million primarily in two senior secured loans with a\ncombined effective yield of approximately 10.7%.\nOn October 30, 2024, the Company’s Board of Directors re-approved the Company Repurchase Plan, to be in effect through the earlier of two trading\ndays after the Company’s fourth quarter 2024 earnings release or such time as the approved $50 million repurchase amount has been fully utilized, subject to\ncertain conditions.\nOn November 6, 2024, the Company’s Board of Directors declared a fourth quarter regular dividend of $0.34 per share and a special dividend of $0.10\nper share, both payable on December 31, 2024 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on December 17, 2024.\n82\nTable of Contents\nItem 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nWe are subject to financial market risks, including changes in interest rates. At September 30, 2024, 92.7% of debt investments in our portfolio bore\ninterest based on floating rates, such as SOFR, EURIBOR, the Federal Funds Rate or the Prime Rate. The interest rates on such investments generally reset by\nreference to the current market index after one to six months. At December 31, 2023, the percentage of floating rate debt investments in our portfolio that were\nsubject to an interest rate floor was 95.6%. Floating rate investments subject to a floor generally reset by reference to the current market index after one to six\nmonths only if the index exceeds the floor.\nInterest rate sensitivity refers to the change in earnings that may result from changes in the level of interest rates. Because we fund a portion of our\ninvestments with borrowings, our net investment income is affected by the difference between the rate at which we invest and the rate at which we borrow. As a\nresult, there can be no assurance that a significant change in market interest rates will not have a material adverse effect on our net investment income. We assess\nour portfolio companies periodically to determine whether such companies will be able to continue making interest payments in the event that interest rates\nincrease. There can be no assurances that the portfolio companies will be able to meet their contractual obligations at any or all levels of increases in interest\nrates.\nBased on our September 30, 2024 statement of assets and liabilities, the following table shows the annual impact on net investment income (excluding\nthe related incentive compensation impact) of base rate changes in interest rates (considering interest rate floors for variable rate instruments and the fact that\nour assets and liabilities may not have the same base rate period as assumed in this table) assuming no changes in our investment and borrowing structure.\nProjected amounts in the table do not include the impact of interest rate changes on the Company's Interest Rate Swap.\nNet Investment Net Investment\nBasis Point Change Income Income Per Share\nUp 300 basis points $ 40,664,011 $ 0.48\nUp 200 basis points 27,109,340 0.32\nUp 100 basis points 13,554,670 0.16\nDown 100 basis points (13,554,670) (0.16)\nDown 200 basis points (27,109,340) (0.32)\nDown 300 basis points (40,355,695) (0.47)\n83\nTable of Contents\nItem 4. Controls and Procedures\nDisclosure Controls and Procedures\nAs of the period covered by this report, we, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and\noperation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act). Based on our evaluation, our management, including\nthe chief executive officer and chief financial officer, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective in timely alerting management,\nincluding the chief executive officer and chief financial officer, of material information about us required to be included in our periodic SEC filings. However, in\nevaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, are\nbased upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and\nmanagement necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.\nInternal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThere has not been any change in our internal controls over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred\nduring the period covered by this report that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.\n84\nTable of Contents\nPART II - Other Information.\nItem 1. Legal Proceedings\nFrom time to time, the Company and the Advisor may be parties to certain legal proceedings incidental to the normal course of our business, including\nwith respect to our investments in our portfolio companies. On September 13, 2023, the Company was named as a defendant, together with the Advisor and\ncertain other funds managed by the Advisor, as well as certain other defendants, in a lawsuit filed in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern\nDistrict of New York. The suit relates to a third-party sponsored collateralized loan obligation in which the Company and certain other defendants invested. The\nsuit alleges that the Company and the other defendants knew or should have known of certain fraudulent activities of the third-party manager relating to its\nmanagement of the collateralized loan obligation that caused the plaintiffs to suffer investment losses. The suit seeks to recover from the Company\napproximately $15 million, plus interest, additional amounts from the other defendants, and attorneys’ fees and costs from all defendants. The Company, the\naffiliated funds and the Advisor intend to vigorously defend against these claims and filed a motion to dismiss the lawsuit on November 6, 2023, which was\nargued in court on March 6, 2024, and which remains pending. At this time, however, the Company and the Advisor cannot predict with a reasonable degree of\ncertainty the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome, including any potential losses that could result.\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\nIn addition to the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the risk factors discussed below and the risk factors in our\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, which could materially affect our business, financial condition and/or operating\nresults. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially and adversely affect our\nbusiness, financial condition and/or operating results.\n(cid:0)2 (cid:0)X (cid:0)U (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)X (cid:0)V (cid:0)H (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)R (cid:0)I(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)E (cid:0)R (cid:0)U (cid:0)U (cid:0)R (cid:0)Z (cid:0)H (cid:0)G (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)I(cid:0)X (cid:0)Q (cid:0)G (cid:0)V (cid:0)(cid:15)(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)L(cid:0)Q (cid:0)F (cid:0)O(cid:0)X (cid:0)G (cid:0)L(cid:0)Q (cid:0)J (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)X (cid:0)Q (cid:0)G (cid:0)H (cid:0)U (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)W(cid:0)K (cid:0)H (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)/ (cid:0)H (cid:0)Y (cid:0)H (cid:0)U (cid:0)D (cid:0)J (cid:0)H (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)3 (cid:0)U (cid:0)R (cid:0)J (cid:0)U (cid:0)D (cid:0)P (cid:0)(cid:15)(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)W(cid:0)R (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)P (cid:0)D (cid:0)N (cid:0)H (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)L(cid:0)Q (cid:0)Y (cid:0)H (cid:0)V (cid:0)W(cid:0)P (cid:0)H (cid:0)Q (cid:0)W(cid:0)V (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)H (cid:0)[ (cid:0)S (cid:0)R (cid:0)V (cid:0)H (cid:0)V (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)X (cid:0)V (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)W(cid:0)R (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)U (cid:0)L(cid:0)V (cid:0)N (cid:0)V (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)W(cid:0)\\ (cid:0)S (cid:0)L(cid:0)F (cid:0)D (cid:0)O(cid:0)O(cid:0)\\ (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)D (cid:0)V (cid:0)V (cid:0)R (cid:0)F (cid:0)L(cid:0)D (cid:0)W(cid:0)H (cid:0)G (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)Z (cid:0)L(cid:0)W(cid:0)K (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)O(cid:0)H (cid:0)Y (cid:0)H (cid:0)U (cid:0)D (cid:0)J (cid:0)H (cid:0)(cid:17)\nThe Company borrows money, both directly and indirectly, through SVCP, TCPC Funding II, SBIC and Merger Sub. As a result:\n• our common stock is exposed to incremental risk of loss, and a decrease in the value of our investments would have a greater negative impact on\nthe value of our common stock than if we did not use leverage;\n• adverse changes in interest rates, whether as a result of fluctuations in the reference rates for our floating rate debt, changes in margin, higher\nfixed rate debt or otherwise, could reduce or eliminate the incremental income we make with the proceeds of leverage;\n• we, and indirectly our common stockholders, bear the entire cost of issuing and paying interest or dividends on any borrowed funds issued by us\nor our subsidiaries; and\n• our ability to pay dividends on our common stock will be restricted if our asset coverage ratio is not at least 150% and any amounts used to\nservice indebtedness would not be available for such dividends.\nThe use of leverage creates increased risk of loss and is considered a speculative investment technique. The use of leverage magnifies the potential gains\nand losses from an investment and increases the risk of loss of capital. To the extent that income derived by us from investments purchased with borrowed funds\nis greater than the cost of borrowing such funds, our net income will be greater than if leverage had not been used. Conversely, if the income from investments\npurchased from these sources is not sufficient to cover the cost of the leverage, our net investment income will be less than if leverage had not been used, and\nthe amount available for ultimate distribution to the holders of common stock will be reduced. The extent of any gains and losses associated with our leverage\ngenerally will depend on the degree of leverage employed. We may, under some circumstances, be required to dispose of investments under unfavorable market\nconditions in order to maintain our leverage, thus causing us to recognize a loss that might not otherwise have occurred. In the event of a sale of investments\nupon default under our borrowing arrangements, secured creditors will be contractually entitled to direct such sales and may do so in their interest, rather than in\nthe interests of the holders of common stock. Holders of common stock will incur losses if the proceeds from a sale in any of the foregoing circumstances are\ninsufficient, after payment in full of amounts due and payable on leverage, including administrative and other fees and expenses, to repay the cost of such\nholders’ investment in our common stock. As a result, you could experience a total loss of your investment. Any decrease in our revenue would cause our net\nincome to decline more than it would have had we not borrowed funds and could negatively affect our ability to make distributions on our common stock. The\nability to service any debt that we have or may have outstanding depends largely on our financial performance and is subject to prevailing economic conditions\nand competitive pressures. There is no limitation on the percentage of portfolio investments that can be pledged to secure borrowings. The amount of leverage\nthat we employ at any particular time will depend on our Advisor’s and our board of director’s assessments of market and other factors at the time of any\nproposed borrowing.\n85\nTable of Contents\n(cid:0), (cid:0)Q (cid:0)(cid:3) (cid:0)D (cid:0)G (cid:0)G (cid:0)L(cid:0)W(cid:0)L(cid:0)R (cid:0)Q (cid:0)(cid:3) (cid:0)W(cid:0)R (cid:0)(cid:3) (cid:0)U (cid:0)H (cid:0)J (cid:0)X (cid:0)O(cid:0)D (cid:0)W(cid:0)R (cid:0)U (cid:0)\\ (cid:0)(cid:3) (cid:0)U (cid:0)H (cid:0)V (cid:0)W(cid:0)U (cid:0)L(cid:0)F (cid:0)W(cid:0)L(cid:0)R (cid:0)Q (cid:0)V (cid:0)(cid:3) (cid:0)W(cid:0)K (cid:0)D (cid:0)W(cid:0)(cid:3) (cid:0)U (cid:0)H (cid:0)V (cid:0)W(cid:0)U (cid:0)L(cid:0)F (cid:0)W(cid:0)(cid:3) (cid:0)R (cid:0)X (cid:0)U (cid:0)(cid:3) (cid:0)D (cid:0)E (cid:0)L(cid:0)O(cid:0)L(cid:0)W(cid:0)\\ (cid:0)(cid:3) (cid:0)W(cid:0)R (cid:0)(cid:3) (cid:0)U (cid:0)D (cid:0)L(cid:0)V (cid:0)H (cid:0)(cid:3) (cid:0)F (cid:0)D (cid:0)S (cid:0)L(cid:0)W(cid:0)D (cid:0)O(cid:0)(cid:15)(cid:0)(cid:3) (cid:0)W(cid:0)K (cid:0)H (cid:0)(cid:3) (cid:0)/ (cid:0)H (cid:0)Y (cid:0)H (cid:0)U (cid:0)D (cid:0)J (cid:0)H (cid:0)(cid:3) (cid:0)3 (cid:0)U (cid:0)R (cid:0)J (cid:0)U (cid:0)D (cid:0)P (cid:0)(cid:3) (cid:0)F (cid:0)R (cid:0)Q (cid:0)W(cid:0)D (cid:0)L(cid:0)Q (cid:0)V (cid:0)(cid:3) (cid:0)(cid:3) (cid:0)Y (cid:0)D (cid:0)U (cid:0)L(cid:0)R (cid:0)X (cid:0)V (cid:0)(cid:3) (cid:0)F (cid:0)R (cid:0)Y (cid:0)H (cid:0)Q (cid:0)D (cid:0)Q (cid:0)W(cid:0)V (cid:0)(cid:3) (cid:0)Z (cid:0)K (cid:0)L(cid:0)F (cid:0)K (cid:0)(cid:15)(cid:0)(cid:3) (cid:0)L(cid:0)I(cid:0)(cid:3) (cid:0)Q (cid:0)R (cid:0)W(cid:0)(cid:3)\n(cid:0)F (cid:0)R (cid:0)P (cid:0)S (cid:0)O(cid:0)L(cid:0)H (cid:0)G (cid:0)(cid:3) (cid:0)Z (cid:0)L(cid:0)W(cid:0)K (cid:0)(cid:15)(cid:0)(cid:3) (cid:0)F (cid:0)R (cid:0)X (cid:0)O(cid:0)G (cid:0)(cid:3) (cid:0)D (cid:0)F (cid:0)F (cid:0)H (cid:0)O(cid:0)H (cid:0)U (cid:0)D (cid:0)W(cid:0)H (cid:0)(cid:3) (cid:0)U (cid:0)H (cid:0)S (cid:0)D (cid:0)\\ (cid:0)P (cid:0)H (cid:0)Q (cid:0)W(cid:0)(cid:3) (cid:0)R (cid:0)I(cid:0)(cid:3) (cid:0)R (cid:0)X (cid:0)U (cid:0)(cid:3) (cid:0)G (cid:0)H (cid:0)E (cid:0)W(cid:0)(cid:15)(cid:0)(cid:3) (cid:0)Z (cid:0)K (cid:0)L(cid:0)F (cid:0)K (cid:0)(cid:3) (cid:0)P (cid:0)D (cid:0)\\ (cid:0)(cid:3) (cid:0)P (cid:0)D (cid:0)W(cid:0)H (cid:0)U (cid:0)L(cid:0)D (cid:0)O(cid:0)O(cid:0)\\ (cid:0)(cid:3) (cid:0)D (cid:0)Q (cid:0)G (cid:0)(cid:3) (cid:0)D (cid:0)G (cid:0)Y (cid:0)H (cid:0)U (cid:0)V (cid:0)H (cid:0)O(cid:0)\\ (cid:0)(cid:3) (cid:0)D (cid:0)I(cid:0)I(cid:0)H (cid:0)F (cid:0)W(cid:0)(cid:3) (cid:0)R (cid:0)X (cid:0)U (cid:0)(cid:3) (cid:0)O(cid:0)L(cid:0)T (cid:0)X (cid:0)L(cid:0)G (cid:0)L(cid:0)W(cid:0)\\ (cid:0)(cid:15)(cid:0)(cid:3) (cid:0)I(cid:0)L(cid:0)Q (cid:0)D (cid:0)Q (cid:0)F (cid:0)L(cid:0)D (cid:0)O(cid:0)(cid:3) (cid:0)F (cid:0)R (cid:0)Q (cid:0)G (cid:0)L(cid:0)W(cid:0)L(cid:0)R (cid:0)Q (cid:0)(cid:3) (cid:0)D (cid:0)Q (cid:0)G (cid:0)(cid:3) (cid:0)U (cid:0)H (cid:0)V (cid:0)X (cid:0)O(cid:0)W(cid:0)V (cid:0)(cid:3) (cid:0)R (cid:0)I(cid:0)(cid:3)\n(cid:0)R (cid:0)S (cid:0)H (cid:0)U (cid:0)D (cid:0)W(cid:0)L(cid:0)R (cid:0)Q (cid:0)V (cid:0)(cid:17)\nUnder the Leverage Program, we must comply with certain financial and operational covenants. These covenants include:\n• restrictions on the level of indebtedness that we are permitted to incur in relation to the value of our assets;\n• restrictions on our ability to make distributions and other restricted payments under certain circumstances;\n• restrictions on extraordinary events, such as mergers, consolidation and sales of assets;\n• restrictions on our ability to incur liens and incur indebtedness; and\n• maintenance of a minimum level of stockholders’ equity.\nIn addition, by limiting the circumstances in which borrowings may occur under the Operating Facility, Funding Facility II and Merger Sub Facility, the\ncredit agreements related to such facilities (the “Credit Agreements”) in effect provide for various asset coverage, credit quality and diversification limitations\non our investments. Such limitations may cause us to be unable to make or retain certain potentially attractive investments or to be forced to sell investments at\nan inappropriate time and consequently impair our profitability or increase losses or result in adverse tax consequences.\nAs of September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with applicable covenants under the Leverage Program. However our continued compliance with\nthese covenants depends on many factors, some of which are beyond our control. Accordingly, there are no assurances that we will continue to comply with the\ncovenants under the Leverage Program (including any covenants that may be included in future debt arrangements that become part of the Leverage Program).\nFailure to comply with these covenants would result in a default under our debt arrangements which, if we were unable to obtain a waiver from the applicable\ncreditors, would enable the applicable creditors to accelerate outstanding balances under our debt and terminate their commitments to lend to us. This would be\nexpected to have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations and place limitations on our operational flexibility.\nThe Operating Facility also has certain “key man” provisions. For example, it is an event of default if the Advisor is controlled by any person or group\nother than (i) BlackRock, Inc. or a wholly-owned subsidiary of BlackRock, Inc. or (ii) any two of a group of four listed individuals (or any replacement manager\nor individual reasonably acceptable to the administrative agent and approved by the required lenders), provided that if the Advisor is no longer under the control\nof at least two of such four individuals (or their previously approved replacements) through an event resulting in the death or disability of such individuals, the\nAdvisor has 60 calendar days to replace such individuals with other managers or individuals reasonably acceptable to the administrative agent and approved by\nthe required lenders, provided further that a default (but not an event of default) shall be deemed to exist during such period.\n(cid:0)7 (cid:0)K (cid:0)H (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)2 (cid:0)S (cid:0)H (cid:0)U (cid:0)D (cid:0)W(cid:0)L(cid:0)Q (cid:0)J

Although the Advisor and the voting members of the\nInvestment Committee devote a significant amount of their respective efforts to the Company, they actively manage investments for other clients and are not\nrequired to (and will not) devote all of their time to the Company’s affairs. In addition, in connection with the acquisition of the Advisor by BlackRock in August\n2018, certain senior members of the Advisor's investment team and other key advisory personnel were granted retention bonuses. As the last of such retention\nbonuses have recently been paid, there may be less economic incentive for certain senior investment team members and certain other key personnel to remain\nwith the Advisor than in prior periods. Certain members of the Advisor's investment team that received such bonuses have left the firm.

(“the Company”) completed its previously announced Merger with BlackRock Capital Investment Corporation (“BCIC”) . The Merger\nhas been accounted for as an asset acquisition of BCIC by the Company in accordance with the asset acquisition method of accounting as detailed in ASC 805-50 (\"ASC 805\"),\nBusiness Combinations-Related Issues. The Company determined the fair value of the shares of the Company's common stock that were issued to former BCIC shareholders pursuant\nto the Merger Agreement plus transaction costs to be the consideration paid in connection with the Merger under ASC 805. The consideration paid to BCIC shareholders was less\nthan the aggregate fair values of the BCIC assets acquired and liabilities assumed, which resulted in a purchase discount (the “purchase discount”). The consideration paid was\nallocated to the individual BCIC assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on the relative fair values of net identifiable assets acquired other than “non-qualifying” assets and\nliabilities (for example, cash) and did not give rise to goodwill. As a result, the purchase discount was allocated to the cost basis of the BCIC investments acquired by the Company on a\npro-rata basis based on their relative fair values as of the effective time of the Merger. Immediately following the Merger, the investments were marked to their respective fair values in\naccordance with ASC 820 which resulted in immediate recognition of net unrealized appreciation in the Consolidated Statement of Operations as a result of the Merger. The purchase\ndiscount allocated to the BCIC debt investments acquired will amortize over the remaining life of each respective debt investment through interest income, with a corresponding\nadjustment recorded to unrealized appreciation or depreciation on such investment acquired through its ultimate disposition. The purchase discount allocated to BCIC equity\ninvestments acquired will not amortize over the life of such investments through interest income and, assuming no subsequent change to the fair value of the equity investments\nacquired and disposition of such equity investments at fair value, the Company may recognize a realized gain or loss with a corresponding reversal of the unrealized appreciation on\ndisposition of such equity investments acquired.\nAs a supplement to the Company’s reported GAAP financial measures, we have provided the following non-GAAP financial measures that we believe are useful:\n• “Adjusted net investment income” – excludes the amortization of purchase accounting discount from net investment income calculated in accordance with GAAP;\n• “Adjusted net realized and unrealized gain (loss)” – excludes the unrealized appreciation resulting from the purchase discount and the corresponding reversal of the unrealized\nappreciation from the amortization of the purchase discount from the determination of net realized and unrealized gain (loss) determined in accordance with GAAP; and\n• “Adjusted net increase (decrease) in net assets resulting from operations” – calculates net increase (decrease) in net assets resulting from operations based on Adjusted net\ninvestment income and Adjusted net realized and unrealized gain (loss).\nWe believe that the adjustment to exclude the full effect of purchase discount accounting under ASC 805 from these financial measures is meaningful because of the potential\nimpact on the comparability of these financial measures that we and investors use to assess the Company’s financial condition and results of operations period over period.Although\nthese non-GAAP financial measures are intended to enhance investors’ understanding of our business and performance, these non-GAAP financial measures should not be\nconsidered an alternative to GAAP. The aforementioned non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similar non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies.\nFor reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to their most comparable GAAP measures, see slide 6.\n5\nQuarterly Operating Results\n2023 2024\nUnaudited ($ in thousands, except per share amounts) Q3 Q4 Q1 Q2 Q3\nInvestment income\nInterest and PIK interest income $ 53,254 $ 49,843 $ 54,702 $ 69,032 $ 69,225\nDividend income 936 1,005 1,026 2,491 1,580\nOther income 21 1 1 3 127\nTotal investment income 54,211 50,849 55,729 71,526 70,932\nExpenses\nInterest and other debt expenses 12,134 11,840 13,230 19,727 21,161\nManagement fees 6,093 5,954 5,820 6,563 6,185\nIncentive fee 6,010 5,348 5,880 6,816 6,540\nOther expenses 1,641 2,249 2,538 2,595 3,169\nTotal expenses 25,878 25,391 27,468 35,701 37,055\nExcise tax expense 13 199 - - -\nNet investment income 28,320 25,259 28,261 35,826 33,878\nLess: Purchase accounting discount amortization2 - - 539 3,695 3,045\nAdjusted net investment income2 28,320 25,259 27,722 32,131 30,833\nNet realized and unrealized gain (loss) (15,497) (38,572) (23,204) (87,102) (12,245)\nLess: Net unrealized gains due to the allocation of purchase\n- - 21,347 5,188 2,727\ndiscount2\nLess: Net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) due to the\n- - - (8,882) (5,772)\nallocation of purchase discount2\nAdjusted net realized and unrealized gain (loss)2 28,320 25,259 (44,551) (83,408) (9,200)\nNet increase (decrease) in net assets resulting from operations $ 12,823 $ (13,313) $ 5,057 $ (51,277) 21,633\nAdjusted net increase (decrease) in net assets resulting from\n12,823 (13,313) (16,830) (51,277) 21,633\noperations2\nNet investment income per share1 $ 0.49 $ 0.44 $ 0.46 $ 0.42 $ 0.40\nAdjusted net investment income per share2 $ 0.49 $ 0.44 $ 0.45 $ 0.38 $ 0.36\nEarnings (loss) per share $ 0.22 $ (0.23) $ 0.08 $ (0.60) $ 0.25\nAdjusted earnings (loss) per share2 $ 0.22 $ (0.23) $ (0.27) $ (0.60) $ 0.25\nRegular dividend per share $ 0.34 $ 0.34 $ 0.34 $ 0.34 $ 0.34\nSpecial dividend per share $ 0.10 $ 0.25 $ - $ - $ -\nWeighted average common shares outstanding3 57,767,264 57,767,264 62,047,859 85,591,134 85,591,134\nEnding common shares outstanding3 57,767,264 57,767,264 85,591,134 85,591,134 85,591,134\n1.

(“the Company”) completed its previously announced Merger with BlackRock Capital Investment Corporation (“BCIC”) . The Merger has been\naccounted for as an asset acquisition of BCIC by the Company in accordance with the asset acquisition method of accounting as detailed in ASC 805-50 (\"ASC 805\"), Business Combinations-\nRelated Issues. The Company determined the fair value of the shares of the Company's common stock that were issued to former BCIC shareholders pursuant to the Merger Agreement plus\ntransaction costs to be the consideration paid in connection with the Merger under ASC 805. The consideration paid to BCIC shareholders was less than the aggregate fair values of the BCIC\nassets acquired and liabilities assumed, which resulted in a purchase discount (the “purchase discount”). The consideration paid was allocated to the individual BCIC assets acquired and\nliabilities assumed based on the relative fair values of net identifiable assets acquired other than “non-qualifying” assets and liabilities (for example, cash) and did not give rise to goodwill. As a\nresult, the purchase discount was allocated to the cost basis of the BCIC investments acquired by the Company on a pro-rata basis based on their relative fair values as of the effective time of\nthe Merger. Immediately following the Merger, the investments were marked to their respective fair values in accordance with ASC 820 which resulted in immediate recognition of net unrealized\nappreciation in the Consolidated Statement of Operations as a result of the Merger. The purchase discount allocated to the BCIC debt investments acquired will amortize over the remaining life\nof each respective debt investment through interest income, with a corresponding adjustment recorded to unrealized appreciation or depreciation on such investment acquired through its\nultimate disposition. The purchase discount allocated to BCIC equity investments acquired will not amortize over the life of such investments through interest income and, assuming no\nsubsequent change to the fair value of the equity investments acquired and disposition of such equity investments at fair value, the Company may recognize a realized gain or loss with a\ncorresponding reversal of the unrealized appreciation on disposition of such equity investments acquired.\nAs a supplement to the Company’s reported GAAP financial measures, we have provided the following non-GAAP financial measures that we believe are useful:\n• “Adjusted net investment income” – excludes the amortization of purchase accounting discount from net investment income calculated in accordance with GAAP;\n• “Adjusted net realized and unrealized gain (loss)” – excludes the unrealized appreciation resulting from the purchase discount and the corresponding reversal of the unrealized appreciation\nfrom the amortization of the purchase discount from the determination of net realized and unrealized gain (loss) determined in accordance with GAAP; and\n• “Adjusted net increase (decrease) in net assets resulting from operations” – calculates net increase (decrease) in net assets resulting from operations based on Adjusted net investment\nincome and Adjusted net realized and unrealized gain (loss).\nWe believe that the adjustment to exclude the full effect of purchase discount accounting under ASC 805 from these financial measures is meaningful because of the potential impact on the\ncomparability of these financial measures that we and investors use to assess the Company’s financial condition and results of operations period over period.Although these non-GAAP financial\nmeasures are intended to enhance investors’ understanding of our business and performance, these non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered an alternative to GAAP. The\naforementioned non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similar non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies.\n20\nEndnotes – Internal Investment Rating System Overview\nTCPC’s Advisor employs a grading system for its entire portfolio in which all loans are rated on a scale of 1 to 4. This system is intended to reflect the Advisor’s assessment of the performance of the\nborrower’s business, the collateral coverage of the loans and other factors the Advisor considers relevant and is subject to change from time to time. The following is a description of the conditions\nassociated with each investment rating:\nGrade 1: Investments in portfolio companies whose performance is substantially within or above the Advisor’s original base case expectations and whose risk factors are neutral to favorable to\nthose at the time of the original investment or subsequent restructuring;\nGrade 2: Investments in portfolio companies whose performance is materially below the Advisor’s original base case expectations or risk factors have increased since the time of original\ninvestment or subsequent restructuring. No loss of investment return or principal (or invested capital) is expected.;\nGrade 3: Investments in portfolio companies whose performance is materially below the Advisor’s original base case expectations or risk factors have increased materially since the time of\noriginal investment or subsequent restructuring. Some loss of investment return is expected, but no loss of principal (or invested capital) is expected.\nGrade 4: Investments in portfolio companies whose performance is materially below the Advisor’s original base case expectations or risk factors have increased substantially since the time of\noriginal investment or subsequent restructuring. Some loss of principal (or invested capital) is expected.\n21\nCorporate information\nSecurities listing Transfer agent\nNASDAQ: TCPC Computershare Inc.\n(866) 333-6433 (from U.S.)\n(201) 680-6578 (from outside U.S.)\nResearch coverage\nwwww.computershare.com/investor\n• Keefe, Bruyette & Woods\n• Ladenburg Thalmann\nCorporate headquarters\n• Oppenheimer\n• Raymond James 2951 28th Street\n• Wells Fargo Suite 1000\nSanta Monica, CA 90405\nInvestor relations\nMichaela Murray\n(310) 566-1094\ninvestor.relations@tcpcapital.com\nwww.tcpcapital.com\n22\nImportant notes\nProspective investors considering an investment in BlackRock TCP Capital Corp.
