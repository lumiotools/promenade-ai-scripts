New client onboarding, combined with strong demand from existing clients, added approximately $16 million in revenue during the third quarter. However, growth was partially offset by weaker-than-expected conditions at certain clients in our industrial end markets and isolated client attrition. In addition, during the third quarter, we implemented our vendor management system, which temporarily caused a significantly higher than expected increase in cost of revenue and incremental SG&A in support of the transition,” said S. Ray Hatch, President and Chief Executive Officer of Quest.\n\n“As a result of the hard work of our team, we have received high marks from new clients, several of which have already been reference clients, helping us to continue to grow our pipeline of new business. In addition, we have made significant progress and are in the final stages of selecting lenders to refinance our debt. Based on initial proposals, the refinancing is on track to be completed by the end of the year, and we expect both a significant reduction in interest expense and improved terms. Based on the continued ramp of new business and increasing efficiencies, we expect to show year-over-year increases in revenue and profitability during the fourth quarter. During 2025 and beyond, we expect to continue to drive significant growth from new clients and improve profitability from efficiency gains and earnings leverage.”\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Highlights**\n\n  * Revenue was $72.8 million, a 3.3% increase compared with the third quarter of 2023.\n  * Gross profit was $11.7 million, a 5.9% decrease compared with the third quarter of 2023.\n  * Gross margin was 16.1% of revenue compared with 17.7% for the third quarter of 2023.\n  * GAAP net loss was $(3.4) million, compared with GAAP net loss of $(2.1) million during the third quarter of 2023.\n  * GAAP net loss per basic and diluted share attributable to common stockholders was $(0.16), compared with $(0.10) for the third quarter of 2023.\n  * Adjusted EBITDA was $2.5 million, compared with $3.7 million during the third quarter of 2023.\n  * Adjusted net loss per diluted share was $(0.06), compared with adjusted net income of $0.02 per diluted share during the third quarter of 2023.\n\n\n\n**Year-to-Date 2024 Highlights (September 30, 2024)**\n\n  * Revenue was $218.6 million, a 0.2% decrease compared with the same period of 2023. \n  * Gross profit was $39.3 million, a 1.8% increase compared with the same period of 2023. \n  * Gross margin was 18.0% of revenue compared with 17.6% during the same period of 2023.\n  * GAAP net loss was $(5.6) million, compared with GAAP net loss of $(5.0) million during the same period of 2023.\n  * GAAP net loss per basic and diluted share attributable to common stockholders was $(0.27), compared with $(0.25) during the same period of 2023. \n  * Year-to-date Adjusted EBITDA was $12.8 million compared to $12.7 million during the same period of 2023. \n  * Adjusted net income per diluted share was $0.05, compared with $0.12 per diluted share during the same period of 2023.\n\n\n\n**Recent Highlights**\n\n  * Secured a new client in the food distribution business that is expected to produce seven figures of annual revenue.\n  * Secured a new automotive service client win that is expected to produce seven figures of annual revenue.\n  * Completed the integration of automated accounts payable processing system with solid waste vendors, processing approximately 70% of invoices with zero human interaction and 100% of invoices audited at the service line-item level according to contractual terms.\n  * Progress in refinancing of existing debt, on track for completion by the end of 2024 with significantly better terms.\n\n\n\n**_Third Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call and Webcast_**\n\nQuest will host a conference call on Thursday, November 7, 2024, at 5:00 PM ET, to review the financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024. To participate, dial 1-800-717-1738 or 1-646-307-1865. The conference call, which may include forward-looking statements, is also being webcast and is available via the investor relations section of Quest’s website at [https://investors.qrhc.com/investors](https://investors.qrhc.com/investors/default.aspx). A replay of the webcast will be archived on Quest’s investor relations website for 90 days.\n\n**_About Quest Resource Holding Corporation_**\n\nQuest is a national provider of waste and recycling services that enable larger businesses to excel in achieving their environmental and sustainability goals and responsibilities. Quest delivers focused expertise across multiple industry sectors to build single-source, client-specific solutions that generate quantifiable business and sustainability results. Addressing a wide variety of waste streams and recyclables, Quest provides information and data that tracks and reports the environmental results of Quest’s services, gives actionable data to improve business operations, and enables Quest’s clients to excel in their business and sustainability responsibilities. For more information, visit [www.qrhc.com](http://www.qrhc.com).\n\n**_Reconciliation of U.S. GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures_**\n\nIn this press release, non-GAAP financial measures, “Adjusted EBITDA” and “Adjusted Net Income (Loss)” are presented. From time to time, Quest considers and uses these supplemental measures of operating performance in order to provide an improved understanding of underlying performance trends. Quest believes it is useful to review, as applicable, both (1) GAAP measures that include (i) depreciation and amortization, (ii) interest expense, (iii) stock-based compensation expense, (iv) income tax expense, and (v) certain other adjustments, and (2) non-GAAP measures that exclude such items. Quest presents these non-GAAP measures because it considers it an important supplemental measure of Quest’s performance. Quest’s definition of these adjusted financial measures may differ from similarly named measures used by others. Quest believes these measures facilitate operating performance comparisons from period to period by eliminating potential differences caused by the existence and timing of certain expense items that would not otherwise be apparent on a GAAP basis. These non-GAAP measures have limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the Company’s GAAP measures. (See attached tables “Reconciliation of Net Loss to Adjusted EBITDA” and “Adjusted Net Income Per Share”).\n\n**_Safe Harbor Statement_**\n\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, which provides a “safe harbor” for such statements in certain circumstances. The forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, our expectation that we will show year-over-year increases in revenue and profitability during the fourth quarter, our expectation that we will continue to drive significant growth from new clients and improving profitability from efficiency gains and earnings leverage during 2025 and beyond, our expectation that our new client wins will produce seven figures of annual revenue and our belief that we will be able to refinance our existing debt by the end of 2024 on better terms. Actual events or results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including, but not limited to, competition in the environmental services industry, the impact of the current economic environment, the spread of major epidemics (including Coronavirus) and other related uncertainties such as government-imposed travel restrictions, interruptions to supply chains, commodity price fluctuations, extended shut down of businesses, and other factors discussed in greater detail in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such statements and to consult our SEC filings for additional risks and uncertainties that may apply to our business and the ownership of our securities. Our forward-looking statements are presented as of the date made, and we disclaim any duty to update such statements unless required by law to do so.\n\nInvestor Relations Contact:\n\nThree Part

New client onboarding, combined with strong demand from existing clients, added approximately $16 million in revenue during the third quarter. However, growth was partially offset by weaker-than-expected conditions at certain clients in our industrial end markets and isolated client attrition. In addition, during the third quarter, we implemented our vendor management system, which temporarily caused a significantly higher than expected increase in cost of revenue and incremental SG&A in support of the transition,” said S. Ray Hatch, President and Chief Executive Officer of Quest.\n\n“As a result of the hard work of our team, we have received high marks from new clients, several of which have already been reference clients, helping us to continue to grow our pipeline of new business. In addition, we have made significant progress and are in the final stages of selecting lenders to refinance our debt. Based on initial proposals, the refinancing is on track to be completed by the end of the year, and we expect both a significant reduction in interest expense and improved terms. Based on the continued ramp of new business and increasing efficiencies, we expect to show year-over-year increases in revenue and profitability during the fourth quarter. During 2025 and beyond, we expect to continue to drive significant growth from new clients and improve profitability from efficiency gains and earnings leverage.”\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Highlights**\n\n  * Revenue was $72.8 million, a 3.3% increase compared with the third quarter of 2023.\n  * Gross profit was $11.7 million, a 5.9% decrease compared with the third quarter of 2023.\n  * Gross margin was 16.1% of revenue compared with 17.7% for the third quarter of 2023.\n  * GAAP net loss was $(3.4) million, compared with GAAP net loss of $(2.1) million during the third quarter of 2023.\n  * GAAP net loss per basic and diluted share attributable to common stockholders was $(0.16), compared with $(0.10) for the third quarter of 2023.\n  * Adjusted EBITDA was $2.5 million, compared with $3.7 million during the third quarter of 2023.\n  * Adjusted net loss per diluted share was $(0.06), compared with adjusted net income of $0.02 per diluted share during the third quarter of 2023.\n\n\n\n**Year-to-Date 2024 Highlights (September 30, 2024)**\n\n  * Revenue was $218.6 million, a 0.2% decrease compared with the same period of 2023. \n  * Gross profit was $39.3 million, a 1.8% increase compared with the same period of 2023. \n  * Gross margin was 18.0% of revenue compared with 17.6% during the same period of 2023.\n  * GAAP net loss was $(5.6) million, compared with GAAP net loss of $(5.0) million during the same period of 2023.\n  * GAAP net loss per basic and diluted share attributable to common stockholders was $(0.27), compared with $(0.25) during the same period of 2023. \n  * Year-to-date Adjusted EBITDA was $12.8 million compared to $12.7 million during the same period of 2023. \n  * Adjusted net income per diluted share was $0.05, compared with $0.12 per diluted share during the same period of 2023.\n\n\n\n**Recent Highlights**\n\n  * Secured a new client in the food distribution business that is expected to produce seven figures of annual revenue.\n  * Secured a new automotive service client win that is expected to produce seven figures of annual revenue.\n  * Completed the integration of automated accounts payable processing system with solid waste vendors, processing approximately 70% of invoices with zero human interaction and 100% of invoices audited at the service line-item level according to contractual terms.\n  * Progress in refinancing of existing debt, on track for completion by the end of 2024 with significantly better terms.\n\n\n\n**_Third Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call and Webcast_**\n\nQuest will host a conference call on Thursday, November 7, 2024, at 5:00 PM ET, to review the financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024. To participate, dial 1-800-717-1738 or 1-646-307-1865. The conference call, which may include forward-looking statements, is also being webcast and is available via the investor relations section of Quest’s website at [https://investors.qrhc.com/investors](https://investors.qrhc.com/investors/default.aspx). A replay of the webcast will be archived on Quest’s investor relations website for 90 days.\n\n**_About Quest Resource Holding Corporation_**\n\nQuest is a national provider of waste and recycling services that enable larger businesses to excel in achieving their environmental and sustainability goals and responsibilities. Quest delivers focused expertise across multiple industry sectors to build single-source, client-specific solutions that generate quantifiable business and sustainability results. Addressing a wide variety of waste streams and recyclables, Quest provides information and data that tracks and reports the environmental results of Quest’s services, gives actionable data to improve business operations, and enables Quest’s clients to excel in their business and sustainability responsibilities. For more information, visit [www.qrhc.com](http://www.qrhc.com).\n\n**_Reconciliation of U.S. GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures_**\n\nIn this press release, non-GAAP financial measures, “Adjusted EBITDA” and “Adjusted Net Income (Loss)” are presented. From time to time, Quest considers and uses these supplemental measures of operating performance in order to provide an improved understanding of underlying performance trends. Quest believes it is useful to review, as applicable, both (1) GAAP measures that include (i) depreciation and amortization, (ii) interest expense, (iii) stock-based compensation expense, (iv) income tax expense, and (v) certain other adjustments, and (2) non-GAAP measures that exclude such items. Quest presents these non-GAAP measures because it considers it an important supplemental measure of Quest’s performance. Quest’s definition of these adjusted financial measures may differ from similarly named measures used by others. Quest believes these measures facilitate operating performance comparisons from period to period by eliminating potential differences caused by the existence and timing of certain expense items that would not otherwise be apparent on a GAAP basis. These non-GAAP measures have limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the Company’s GAAP measures. (See attached tables “Reconciliation of Net Loss to Adjusted EBITDA” and “Adjusted Net Income Per Share”).\n\n**_Safe Harbor Statement_**\n\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, which provides a “safe harbor” for such statements in certain circumstances. The forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, our expectation that we will show year-over-year increases in revenue and profitability during the fourth quarter, our expectation that we will continue to drive significant growth from new clients and improving profitability from efficiency gains and earnings leverage during 2025 and beyond, our expectation that our new client wins will produce seven figures of annual revenue and our belief that we will be able to refinance our existing debt by the end of 2024 on better terms. Actual events or results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including, but not limited to, competition in the environmental services industry, the impact of the current economic environment, the spread of major epidemics (including Coronavirus) and other related uncertainties such as government-imposed travel restrictions, interruptions to supply chains, commodity price fluctuations, extended shut down of businesses, and other factors discussed in greater detail in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such statements and to consult our SEC filings for additional risks and uncertainties that may apply to our business and the ownership of our securities. Our forward-looking statements are presented as of the date made, and we disclaim any duty to update such statements unless required by law to do so.\n\nInvestor Relations Contact:\n\nThree Part
