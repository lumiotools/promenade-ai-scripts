(NASDAQ: OMEX), an ocean exploration pioneer engaged in the discovery, development and extraction of critical minerals that provide solutions to global challenges, reported results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2024, and provided an update on current projects and future plans. \n\n\"We are approaching the conclusion of our NAFTA arbitration case against Mexico for the ExO Project, with the final step being the Tribunal's decision, which is currently being translated. The outcome of this case will be significant, and Odyssey is prepared with a robust business plan to continue our mission of unlocking valuable ocean resources that can help feed and power the future in any scenario,” said Mark Gordon, Odyssey Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board of Directors. \n\n“Odyssey is an industry leader in marine research and exploration with unique expertise that is highly sought after in the industry. We focus on multiple types of minerals in various regions and jurisdictions, which allows us to adapt to changing mineral markets and geopolitical conditions, ensuring resources are directed toward the best opportunities. Our capabilities can be used to advance our projects and those in which we invest, as well as to accelerate progress across the industry, enabling us to thrive and capitalize on the positive trends in the ocean mineral resource sector,” continued Gordon. \n\n[Odyssey also announced earlier this year that it received a payment of approximately $9.4 million from its residual economic interest in a shipwreck project.](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fd18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net%2FCIK-0000798528%2F915a5382-c187-44e2-8c33-3060422f92c6.pdf&esheet=54106915&newsitemid=20240809321017&lan=en-US&anchor=Odyssey+also+announced+earlier+this+year+that+it+received+a+payment+of+approximately+%249.4+million+from+its+residual+economic+interest+in+a+shipwreck+project.&index=1&md5=cbbd602f258600b116e13ac46967d3ff) \"Although we appreciate this financial boost from our past, we want to emphasize that we do not have interests in any other shipwrecks, and we do not expect legacy shipwreck projects to be an ongoing source of income. We remain committed to and focused on our subsea mineral exploration and development programs,\" noted Gordon. \n\n**NAFTA ARBITRATION UPDATE**\n\n[On June 10, Odyssey received a letter from the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID)](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fd18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net%2FCIK-0000798528%2F0821e489-6afe-47a7-ae86-b010e218d1f9.pdf&esheet=54106915&newsitemid=20240809321017&lan=en-US&anchor=On+June+10%2C+Odyssey+received+a+letter+from+the+International+Centre+for+Settlement+of+Investment+Disputes+%28ICSID%29&index=2&md5=992bc28d42f7abee7bb6c8f6972cb22e) advising “that the Tribunal’s determinations are in the process of being translated.

(NASDAQ: OMEX), an ocean exploration pioneer engaged in the discovery, development, and extraction of critical minerals that provide solutions to global challenges, provides a company update.\n\n\"The recent arbitration ruling and the 2018 Tribunal Federal de Justicia Administrativa (TFJA) ruling in our favor validate that our approach to responsible ocean mineral exploration is viable. We remain committed to the long-term success of our business, supported by a strong portfolio of current projects and a pipeline of new projects that offer further opportunities to expand access to critical minerals in high demand. We were encouraged to see the unprecedented volume of trading in our stock, which we believe indicates an increased interest in our company and our industry’s crucial role in addressing critical global mineral resources issues,” said Mark Gordon, Odyssey’s Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board of Directors. “Our focus on ocean minerals supports efforts to reduce carbon emissions through renewable energy and enhance fertilizer availability for a growing global population. We continue to believe the ExO Phosphate Project could play a vital role in helping Mexico achieve its long-standing goal of addressing food security by allowing the country to have a stable supply of domestically sourced phosphate that could enhance the country’s fertilizer production.”\n\n“The industry has been monitoring the Odyssey NAFTA case. I am pleased to see that the international panel of arbitrators supports and encourages governments to treat permit applications in a fair and equitable manner. Our industry is working tirelessly to ensure excellent environmental analysis and stewardship, just as Odyssey did in this instance, and that science underpins permitting decisions,” said Hans Smit, CEO of Ocean Minerals Limited (OML). “We look forward to continuing to work with Odyssey as they support our work program in the Cook Islands.”\n\nOdyssey's research and scientific team actively uses its proprietary Global Prospectivity process to identify promising regions with stable governments interested in understanding their seafloor mineral resources. This approach aims to capitalize on the growing global interest in the industry, including in the United States, where legislative initiatives are gaining momentum. In addition, Norway has opened its continental shelf for deep-sea mineral exploration, and Japan recently announced the discovery of over 200 million tonnes of polymetallic nodules from its waters. Odyssey is involved with two of the three companies that hold exploration licenses in the Cook Islands, a country that is setting the standard for responsible regulatory practices governing seafloor exploration.\n\nOdyssey is supported by a highly experienced executive management team, board of directors, and dedicated staff. All are grounded in strong governance and a firm belief that integrity, transparency, and accountability are essential in our partnerships with business and governmental entities. The leadership team has expertly guided the company through growth phases, identifying opportunities to leverage Odyssey's strengths while ensuring the resources and support needed for sustained success during the company’s 30-year history.\n\n**About Odyssey Marine Exploration**\n\nOdyssey Marine Exploration, Inc.

(NASDAQ: OMEX), an ocean exploration pioneer engaged in the discovery, development and extraction of critical minerals that provide solutions to global challenges, announces an award in its arbitration with the United Mexican States under Chapter Eleven of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). \n\nOdyssey Marine Exploration (Odyssey) has received notification from the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) of the arbitral award on the claims involving Odyssey and its subsidiary, Exploraciones Oceánicas S. de R.L. de C.V. (ExO), against Mexico. The award orders Mexico to pay US$37.1 million for breaching its obligations under NAFTA, plus interest at the one-year Mexico Treasury bond rate, compounded annually, from October 12, 2018, until the award is paid in full, plus the arbitrators’ fees and ICSID administrative costs. The amounts awarded are net of Mexican taxes and Mexico may not tax the award. Odyssey expects that most or all of the proceeds of the award will be used to satisfy its litigation financing obligations. \n\n“The ruling today validates our position that Mexico’s environmental agency SEMARNAT wrongfully denied our environmental permit, which received extensive input from external advisors and industry experts to determine an economically feasible and environmentally responsible development plan. The project remains strategically significant and commercially viable,” said Mark Gordon, Odyssey Marine Exploration’s Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board of Directors. \"We are poised to continue advancing our projects globally, while also collaborating with nations interested in exploring their underwater mineral resources to meet the escalating demand for critical minerals. Our focus remains on minerals that offer solutions to pressing global challenges, such as mitigating carbon emissions through renewable energy adoption and enhancing fertilizer accessibility to support an ever-growing global population.\" \n\nICSID will publish the decision on its website at [https://icsid.worldbank.org/](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Ficsid.worldbank.org%2F&esheet=54123532&newsitemid=20240917082379&lan=en-US&anchor=https%3A%2F%2Ficsid.worldbank.org%2F&index=1&md5=aaabedaa8966563ba92f22c6f12b589c) when it is available. \n\n**NAFTA Case Background**\n\nOdyssey initiated the NAFTA arbitration after the manifestly arbitrary and discriminatory denial by SEMARNAT of an environmental permit for ExO based not on Mexico’s regulations or on scientific support, but on a politician’s directive. Mexico's highest federal administrative court, the Tribunal Federal de Justicia Administrativa (TFJA), unanimously ruled in favor of ExO in 2018 that SEMARNAT had unlawfully rejected the environmental permit in 2016. When SEMARNAT once again denied the permit in contravention of Mexican and public international laws, Odyssey determined it needed to commence the arbitration in order to protect its shareholders’ investment. Today's ruling reflects the tribunal's examination of SEMARNAT's unlawful handling of the permit. ExO is also once again challenging the unlawful decision of SEMARNAT before the TFJA. \n\n**About Odyssey Marine Exploration**\n\nOdyssey Marine Exploration, Inc.

All projections and estimates are subject to material uncertainties and should not be viewed as a prediction or an assurance of actual future performance. The validity and accuracy of Odyssey's projections will depend upon unpredictable future events, many of which are beyond Odyssey's control and, accordingly, no assurance can be given that Odyssey's assumptions will prove true or that its projected results will be achieved. \n\n![](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=bwnews&sty=20240917082379r1&sid=q4-prod&distro=nx&lang=en)\n\nLiz Shows Odyssey Marine Exploration, Inc.
