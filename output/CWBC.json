The loss\nduring the second quarter and reduced net income for the third quarter was attributable to merger-\nrelated expenses, including a provision for current expected credit losses (CECL) for the acquired\nloan portfolio during the second quarter. In addition, the Company realized a loss on sale of securities\nin both the second and third quarter. See Non-GAAP financial measures below.\n• The amortized cost of available-for-sale investment securities decreased $115.7 million or 17.3% at\nSeptember 30, 2024 compared to December 31, 2023. During the year-to-date period, the Company\nreceived $64.2 million in proceeds from the sale of available-for-sale investment securities, with the\nremaining decrease due to normal pay downs, calls and maturities. Proceeds were used to fund loan\ngrowth as part of strategic repositioning of the balance sheet to improve future earnings.\n• Total gross loans of $2.3 billion at September 30, 2024 increased by 77.96% or $1.0 billion compared\nto December 31, 2023 largely due to the Central Valley Community Bancorp/Community West\nBancshares merger (“merger”), which the fair value of the acquired loans totaled $920.1 million.\nExcluding the acquired loans, gross loans increased by $86.2 million and 6.68% during the year-to-\ndate period.\n• Total assets increased by $1.1 billion or 45.12% at September 30, 2024 compared to December 31,\n2023, largely as a result of the merger.\n• Total deposits of $2.9 billion at September 30, 2024 increased by 43.11% or $880.1 million compared\nto December 31, 2023, primarily due to the merger, which the fair value of the acquired deposits\ntotaled $844.0 million. Excluding the merger, deposits increased $36.0 million or 1.77%.\n• Total cost of deposits decreased to 1.69% for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 compared to\n1.71% for the quarter ended June 30, 2024.\n• Average non-interest bearing demand deposit accounts as a percentage of total average deposits\nwas 37.16% and 37.36% for the quarters ended September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024,\nrespectively.\n• Net interest margin increased to 3.69% for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, from 3.65% for the\nquarter ended June 30, 2024.\n• There were $3.3 million non-performing assets for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 as the\nresult of the acquired loans from the merger. Net loan recoveries were $162,000 and loans delinquent\n30 days and more were $6.5 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024.\n- more -\nCommunity West Bancshares -- page 2\n• Capital positions remain strong at September 30, 2024 with a 9.38% Tier 1 Leverage Ratio; a 11.12%\nCommon Equity Tier 1 Ratio; a 11.30% Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital Ratio; and a 13.55% Total Risk-\nBased Capital Ratio.\n• The Company declared a $0.12 per common share cash dividend, payable on November 22, 2024 to\nshareholders of record as of November 8, 2024.\n“The current year has been transformative for our Company, including the April 1 closing of the largest\nmerger in our history, uniting an expanded team of experienced community bankers and, during the third\nquarter, combining two core bank systems into one. Each milestone, marked by the efforts and sacrifices of\nour team, has built a foundation for growth and opportunity for the Company. The new Community West Bank\nproudly operates as one of the premier community banks headquartered in Central California, under one\nbrand, with an inspired team focused on building relationships by exceeding the expectations of clients,\ncommunities and shareholders,” shared James J.

Increases in non-interest\nexpenses for the year-to-date period were impacted by merger and acquisition expenses and the additional\noperating expenses of the merger.\nAnnualized return on average equity (ROAE) for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 was 3.84%,\ncompared to 13.60% for the same period of 2023. The decrease in ROAE is reflective of the reduced\nearnings due to merger and acquisition expenses.

During the second quarter, the Company received $26.0 million from the sale\nof available-for-sale investment securities and the remaining decline was due to normal pay downs\nand maturities, which the proceeds were used to fund loan growth as part of strategic repositioning of\nthe balance sheet to improve future earnings.\n• Total gross loans of $2.26 billion at June 30, 2024 increased by 74.82% or $965.8 million compared to\nDecember 31, 2023 largely due to the merger, which the fair value of the acquired loans totaled\n$920.9 million.

Kim, President and\nCEO of the Bank and CEO of the Company.\n“As a result of merger-related expenses, overall earnings were significantly reduced for the quarter ended\nJune 30, 2024, compared to the previous quarter ended March 31, 2024. Still, the strength of the combined\nCompany’s core earnings provides a solid base for sustained growth,” added Shannon Livingston, Executive\nVice President and Chief Financial Officer. “The Company continues to reposition the balance sheet to\noptimize earnings through strong loan growth, utilizing proceeds from lower-earning investment securities.\nAdditionally, while elevated non-interest expenses are expected to continue through the third quarter 2024\ndue to merger-related systems integration, operational efficiencies will commence in the fourth quarter.”\nResults of Operations\nThree months ended\nJune 30, March 31, June 30,\n(In thousands, except share and per-share amounts) 2024 2024 2023\nNet interest income before provision for credit losses $ 29,057 $ 19,073 $ 20,205\nProvision (credit) for credit losses 9,831 575 (343)\nNet interest income after provision (credit) for credit losses 19,226 18,498 20,548\nTotal non-interest income 1,400 1,636 1,594\nTotal non-interest expenses 28,503 15,333 13,805\n(Loss) income before provision for income taxes (7,877) 4,801 8,337\n(Benefit) provision for income taxes (1,587) 1,125 2,055\nNet (loss) income $ (6,290) $ 3,676 $ 6,282\nStatement Regarding use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nIn this press release, Community West Bancshares’s financial results are presented in accordance with\nGAAP and refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures.

The net loss for the period was\nimpacted by a provision for credit losses of $10,407,000, and an increase in total non-interest expense of\n$16,826,000, partially offset by an increase in net interest income before provision for credit losses of\n$6,343,000 and a decrease in the provision for income taxes of $4,866,000. Increases in non-interest\nexpenses for the year-to-date period were impacted by merger and acquisition expenses and the additional\noperating expenses of the merged Bank as of April 1, 2024.\nAnnualized return on average equity (ROAE) for the six months ended June 30, 2024 was (1.91)%,\ncompared to 14.44% for the same period of 2023. The decrease in ROAE is reflective of the net loss\nincurred during the second quarter due to merger and acquisition expenses, including a provision for loan\nlosses for the acquired loan portfolio. Annualized return on average assets (ROAA) was (0.18)% for the six\nmonths ended June 30, 2024 compared to 1.08% for the same period in 2023.\nThe effective yield on average investment securities, including interest earning deposits in other banks and\nFederal funds sold, was 3.21% for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, compared to 3.18% for the quarter\nended June 30, 2023 and 3.07% for the quarter ended March 31, 2024.

The increase was primarily due to the merger, in which loans with a\nfair value of $920,900,000 were recorded on the balance sheet as of April 1, 2024. The effective yield on\naverage loans was 6.54% for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, compared to 5.54% and 5.74% for the\nquarters ended June 30, 2023 and March 31, 2024, respectively. Total average loans increased by\n$496,691,000 to $1,755,766,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2024, from $1,259,075,000 for the six\nmonths ended June 30, 2023. The effective yield on average loans was 6.24% for the six months ended\nJune 30, 2024, compared to 5.47% for the six months ended June 30, 2023.\nThe Company’s net interest margin (fully tax equivalent basis) was 3.65% for the quarter ended June 30,\n2024, compared to 3.46% for the quarter ended June 30, 2023 and 3.42% for the quarter ended March 31,\n2024.

Over the\nlast year, the Company's yield on interest earning assets has increased from 4.43% for the quarter ended\nJune 30, 2023 to 5.50% for the quarter ended June 30, 2024. Additionally, the Company has been impacted\nby higher costs on interest-bearing liabilities, in which the cost of total deposits increased to 1.71% from\n0.88% when comparing the quarters ended June 30, 2024 and 2023. The increase in the cost of deposits is\nprimarily attributed to volume and rate increases in the money market and time deposit portfolios from the\nboth acquired deposits from the merger and the Company’s existing base.\n- more -\nCommunity West Bancshares -- page 5\nThe Company’s net interest margin (fully tax equivalent basis) was 3.55% for the six months ended June 30,\n2024, compared to 3.65% for the six months ended June 30, 2023.

Net income for the period was\nimpacted by a decrease in net interest income after provision for credit losses of $2,450,000, which was\na direct result of the increase in cost of funds and an increase in total non-interest expenses of\n$2,128,000, partially offset by an increase in non-interest income of $61,000 and a decrease in the\nprovision for income taxes of $1,223,000. The effective tax rate decreased to 23.43% from 25.20% for\nthe quarters ended March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2023, respectively. The increase in non-interest\nexpense as compared to the prior year’s quarter was primarily due to an increase in merger and\nacquisition expenses, increases in salaries and employee benefits, and increases to occupancy and\nequipment from capital asset additions related to new banking center openings and relocations. Net\nincome for the immediately trailing quarter ended December 31, 2023 was $5,893,000, or $0.50 per\ndiluted common share.\nAnnualized return on average equity (ROAE) for the quarter ended March 31, 2024 was 7.08%,\ncompared to 15.30% for the same period of 2023. The decrease in ROAE reflects a decrease in net\nincome and an increase in average total shareholders’ equity compared to the prior year. The increase\nin average shareholders’ equity compared to the prior year’s quarter was driven by the retention of\nearnings and a decrease in the average accumulated other comprehensive losses, partially offset by\ndividends paid. Annualized return on average assets (ROAA) was 0.61% for the quarter ended\nMarch 31, 2024 compared to 1.15% for the same period in 2023.\nThe effective yield on average investment securities, including interest earning deposits in other banks\nand Federal funds sold, was 3.07% for the quarter ended March 31, 2024, compared to 2.95% for the\nquarter ended March 31, 2023 and 3.18% for the quarter ended December 31, 2023.\nTotal average loans increased by $22,890,000 to $1,283,068,000 for the quarter ended March 31,\n2024, from $1,260,178,000 for the quarter ended March 31, 2023 and increased by $14,746,000 from\n$1,268,322,000 for the quarter ended December 31, 2023.

Net interest income, before provision for credit losses, decreased\n$2,508,000, or 11.62%, to $19,073,000 for the first quarter of 2024, compared to $21,581,000 for the\nsame period in 2023. The net interest margin period-to-period comparisons were impacted by the\nincrease in the cost of funds. Over the last year, the Company's yield on interest earning assets has\nincreased from 4.31% for the quarter ended March 31, 2023 to 4.58% for the quarter ended March 31,\n2024. Additionally, the Company has been impacted by higher costs on interest-bearing liabilities, in\nwhich the cost of total deposits increased to 0.98% from 0.20% when comparing the quarters ended\nMarch 31, 2024 and 2023. The increase in the cost of deposits is primarily attributed to volume and\nrate increases in the money market and time deposit portfolios.\nNon-Interest Income - The following tables present the key components of non-interest income for the\nperiods indicated:\nThree months ended\nMarch 31,\n(Dollars in thousands) 2024 2023 $ Change % Change\nService charges $ 384 $ 387 $ (3) (0.8) %\nAppreciation in cash surrender value of bank owned life\ninsurance 275 249 26 10.4 %\nInterchange fees 405 446 (41) (9.2) %\nLoan placement fees 166 124 42 33.9 %\nNet realized losses on sales and calls of investment\nsecurities (373) (219) (154) 70.3 %\nFederal Home Loan Bank dividends 157 109 48 44.0 %\nOther income 622 479 143 29.9 %\nTotal non-interest income $ 1,636 $ 1,575 $ 61 3.9 %\nThe increase in other income for the quarter ended March 31, 2024 was primarily due to the change in\nequity investment gain (loss), and an increase in credit card merchant fees.\n- more -\nCommunity West Bancshares -- page 5\nNon-Interest Expense - The following table presents the key components of non-interest expense for\nthe periods indicated:\nThree months ended\nMarch 31,\n(Dollars in thousands) 2024 2023 $ Change % Change\nSalaries and employee benefits $ 8,638 $ 8,034 $ 604 7.5 %\nOccupancy and equipment 1,543 1,258 285 22.7 %\nInformation technology 1,021 847 174 20.5 %\nRegulatory assessments 322 210 112 53.3 %\nData processing expense 685 650 35 5.4 %\nProfessional services 625 353 272 77.1 %\nATM/Debit card expenses 214 184 30 16.3 %\nAdvertising 151 125 26 20.8 %\nDirectors’ expenses 169 163 6 3.7 %\nMerger and acquisition expense 383 — 383 — %\nLoan related expenses 92 147 (55) (37.4) %\nPersonnel other 131 259 (128) (49.4) %\nOther expense 1,359 975 384 39.4 %\nTotal non-interest expenses $ 15,333 $ 13,205 $ 2,128 16.1 %\nThe increase in occupancy and equipment is the result of banking center relocations and a banking\ncenter opening.
