(Nasdaq: COYA) (“Coya” or the “Company”), a clinical-stage biotechnology company developing biologics intended to enhance regulatory T cell (Treg) function, provides a corporate update and announces its financial results for the quarter ended September 30, 2024. \n\n**Recent Corporate Highlights**\n\n  * Announced positive results from an investigator initiated double-blind study of low-dose interleukin-2 (LD IL-2) in patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) at the Clinical Trials on Alzheimer’s Disease Conference (CTAD24) in Madrid \n  * Filed patents for COYA 301 in combination with Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists \n  * Promoted Arun Swaminathan, Ph.D. to Chief Executive Officer, effective November 1, 2024, while Howard Berman has transitioned from CEO to Executive Chairman \n  * Announced anti-inflammatory effects of COYA 302 in the brain from a preclinical inflammatory mouse model of Parkinson’s disease (PD) \n  * Aligned with FDA on the non-clinical data needed to support the planned randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase 2b trial of COYA-302 in patients with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS). \n  * A Phase 1 investigator-initiated trial (IIT) combining LD IL-2 + CTLA4-Ig began in patients with Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD) \n\n\n\n**Upcoming Expected Catalysts for 2025**\n\n  * Q1 2025: Additional clinical data to be released in the Phase 2 LD IL-2 investigator-initiated trial (IIT) study in patients with AD. Publication and release of additional and comprehensive blood immune panels and inflammatory cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers comparing LD IL-2 arms to placebo arm \n  * Q1/Q2 2025: COYA 301/GLP-1 combination data submission for publication and additional intellectual property filings \n  * Q2 2025: Submission of additional data to support the start of the COYA-302 Phase 2 trial in patients with ALS \n  * Upon IND acceptance and first patient dosing of COYA-302 in ALS, eligible to receive milestone payments of $8.4 million from strategic partner, Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories (DRL) \n  * Q2 2025: ALS Biomarker data. Publication of longitudinal data on Neurofilament Light Chain (NfL) and oxidative stress markers in patients with ALS \n  * 2H 2025: Top-line clinical data release for an investigator-initiated trial combining LD IL-2 + CTLA4-Ig in patients with FTD \n  * 2H 2025: Filing of IND for the COYA-302 Phase 2 trial in patients with FTD* (*Clinical trial initiated upon FDA IND approval) \n\n\n\n“We are pleased with the constructive discussion we have had with the FDA,” said Coya CMO, Dr. Fred Grossman. “We have clarity on the non-clinical data needed to support the start of our Phase 2 study of COYA-302 in patients with ALS and we are fully aligned with the FDA. We are confident in the path forward towards the completion of this important potential pivotal trial. Following FDA acceptance of the Coya 302 IND in ALS, we expect to submit the IND for COYA 302 in FTD, likely in the second half of 2025.” \n\nCoya CEO Arun Swaminathan, Ph.D. said: \n\n“As the new CEO of Coya, I am very encouraged by our progress in 2024. I believe our progress opens a wide array of strategic opportunities in 2025, both with existing and new partners. I will be keenly focused on delivering shareholder value over the next year. \n\n“During the third quarter of 2024 we continued to advance our pipeline of neurodegenerative treatments, all aimed at neurodegenerative diseases with high unmet need, including AD, PD, and ALS. \n\n“Our drug candidates all target neuroinflammation, which we see as a major contributing factor towards disease progression in the neurological conditions we are addressing. Moreover, our approach to potential combination therapies for treatment of these neurodegenerative diseases differentiates us from other companies and offers, what we believe, a new treatment paradigm that could lead to the creation of meaningful shareholder value. \n\n“We anticipate 2025 will be a busy and productive year filled with multiple milestones, clinical data and catalysts. In Q1 of 2025, we will be presenting additional clinical data from the investigator-initiated phase 2 trial in AD and later in the year clinical data from another investigator-initiated clinical trial in FTD, this time with the combination of LD IL-2 and CTLA-4 Ig. We are also excited to begin our Coya sponsored phase 2 trials for our combination biologic COYA 302 in both ALS and FTD. \n\n“During the CTAD conference in Madrid at the end of October, encouraging Phase 2 data was presented from an investigator-initiated trial that highlighted the benefits of LD IL-2 in treating patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer’s disease. This data increased our confidence in our combination drug candidate, COYA 302, which combines COYA 301, our proprietary LD IL-2 candidate, with the fusion protein CTLA4-Ig, or Abatacept for the potential treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, such as ALS and FTD. We believe LD IL-2 enhances and restores Treg function, lowering inflammation, while CTLA4-Ig inhibits other inflammatory cell types and so may sustain and create more durable Treg functionality. While we were encouraged with the promising LD IL-2 monotherapy data in AD, we believe that our combination approach with CTLA-4 Ig provides numerous advantages by targeting multiple immune pathways which are critical in these complex diseases. \n\n“We also believe there is potential for strategic opportunities combining COYA-301 with other therapeutic agents as potential therapeutics for patients with AD or other neurodegenerative and autoimmune diseases. \n\n“Finally, our recent capital raise provides additional flexibility and cushion for us to execute on our corporate, clinical, and regulatory goals. As of October 31, 2024, our interim cash and cash equivalents (unaudited) was $39.8 million. We continue to be in discussions with our partners and potential partners looking for opportunities to reach our goals quicker and in the best way possible. I look forward to sharing additional corporate, clinical, and regulatory progress as appropriate,” concluded Swaminathan. \n\n**Unaudited Financial Results**\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, Coya had cash and cash equivalents of $31.1 million. \n\nResearch and development expenses were $2.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $1.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was due to a $0.3 million increase in our preclinical expenses primarily due to our preclinical advancement of COYA 302 in ALS and a $0.3 million increase in internal research and development expenses. \n\nGeneral and administrative expenses were $2.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and $2.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, a change of approximately $0.2 million. The increase was primarily due to a $0.4 million increase in stock-based compensation and employee headcount, partially offset by a $0.2 million decrease in corporate fees. \n\nNet loss was $4.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to net loss of $3.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. \n\n**About Coya Therapeutics, Inc.**\n\nHeadquartered in Houston, TX, Coya Therapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq: COYA) is a clinical-stage biotechnology company developing proprietary treatments focused on the biology and potential therapeutic advantages of regulatory T cells (“Tregs”) to target systemic inflammation and neuroinflammation. Dysfunctional Tregs underlie numerous conditions, including neurodegenerative, metabolic, and autoimmune diseases, and this cellular dysfunction may lead to sustained inflammation and oxidative stress resulting in lack of homeostasis of the immune system. \n\nCoya’s investigational product candidate pipeline leverages multiple therapeutic modalities aimed at restoring the anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory functions of Tregs. Coya’s therapeutic platforms include Treg-enhancing biologics, Treg-derived exosomes, and autologous Treg cell therapy. \n\nCOYA 302 – the Company’s lead biologic investigational product or \"Pipeline in a Product\" – is a proprietary combination of COYA 301 (Coya’s proprietary LD IL-2) and CTLA4-Ig for subcutaneous administration with a unique dual mechanism of action that is now being developed for the treatment of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, Frontotemporal Dementia, Parkinson’s Disease, and Alzheimer’s Disease. Its multi-targeted approach enhances the number and anti-inflammatory function of Tregs and simultaneously lowers the expression of activated microglia and the secretion of pro-inflammatory mediators. This synergistic mechanism may lead to the re-establishment of immune balance and amelioration of inflammation in a sustained and durable manner that may not be achieved by either low-dose IL-2 or CTLA4-Ig alone. \n\nFor more information about Coya, please visit [www.coyatherapeutics.com](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.coyatherapeutics.com&esheet=54147605&newsitemid=20241106135734&lan=en-US&anchor=www.coyatherapeutics.com&index=1&md5=5d1573e342a1932a0a53e435dbd061f3). \n\n**Forward-Looking Statements**\n\nThis press release contains “forward-looking” statements that are based on our management’s beliefs and assumptions and on information currently available to management.

We have made tremendous strides in 2024, repeatedly executing on our promises. As I look to 2025, I am confident that our nimble and highly experienced team will continue to exceed expectations. \n\nI have spent my entire 25-year career in the biotech space, and I believe that Coya has the most promise of any company that I have represented. I truly believe our novel science, strong clinical proof of concept data, pharmaceutical partnership validation, cash runway, and clear path to a commercial drug differentiates us. Prior to serving at Coya, I helped spearhead and lead pharmaceutical transactions worth billions of dollars that led to significant value creation. I believe the opportunities ahead of us in 2025 and beyond are what investors, stockholders, and patients should be most excited about. Our science and approach of regulating Tregs is now validated in multiple trials across multiple neurodegenerative diseases, we have a track record of executing value-creating non-dilutive deals, and our strong cash position allows us to be prudent in our decisions. \n\n**Year Ahead**\n\nWe expect our activities in 2025 to be focused on the following indications: \n\n**ALS (Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis) Program:** We have alignment with the FDA on the data required to initiate our potentially pivotal COYA 302 Phase 2 double-blind randomized study in patients with ALS. We are targeting the submission of the requested data package by 2Q 2025 and initiation of the clinical trial upon FDA clearance. The roadmap to topline results is now clear with reduced uncertainty. In late 2023, we partnered with Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories, a multi-billion-dollar drug developer, to license COYA 302 in ALS in a deal that is worth up to $700 million. We still retain the rights to COYA 302 in ALS in Japan and South/Central America and Mexico, thus providing us direct upside and optionality in this indication alone. \n\n**FTD (Frontotemporal Dementia) Program:** We expect to see topline results in 2H 2025 from the investigator-initiated, open-label study of Low Dose IL-2 (LD IL-2) + CTLA4-Ig in FTD. Study endpoints will measure safety, peripheral and central inflammation, FTD progression, and pharmacodynamic effects on Treg cell populations. The data are expected to guide our planned COYA 302 Phase 2 double-blind randomized study (which will be funded by the Alzheimer’s Drug Discovery Foundation) and further optimize the design for success. The guidance from the FDA on the ALS IND reduces uncertainty on the planned IND filing for FTD in 2H of 2025. We have retained full commercial rights on this program thus far, providing us optionality to develop the program to BLA approval ourselves and capture the full potential upside or partner at a later stage once we obtain additional clinical data. \n\n**AD (Alzheimer’s disease) Program:** Complementing the promising data that was presented at CTAD in Madrid for LD IL-2 in mild to moderate AD, the investigators will disclose additional data in 1H 2025 that summarizes the changes in inflammation in the peripheral system (blood) and central nervous system (CSF and brain) and other molecular measurements for the two IL-2 dosing arms vs. placebo. These important data will help to further address the basic science associated with the promising clinical response observed in the lower dose IL-2 arm and its association with better Treg enhancement. We retain full rights to the AD indication for COYA 302 and are already in the process of exploring non-dilutive and strategic partnering opportunities. While the CTAD data was based on LD IL-2 alone and proved highly promising in and of itself, COYA 302, which is a proprietary combination of LD IL-2 and CTLA4-Ig, targets multiple pathways and is developed to more significantly and durably enhance Treg function, which we believe will be highly attractive to potential partners. \n\n**Strategic Partnerships**\n\n**Dr. Reddy’s Partnership:** Our partnership with Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories is approaching its one-year anniversary, and our collaboration could not be stronger. We have a reliable partner for ALS, and leveraging its resources and expertise has created value beyond the milestone payments. In 2025, we anticipate receiving $8.4 million upon initiation of the Phase 2 ALS clinical trial and will continue to evaluate opportunities to further deepen the relationship. \n\n**Other Strategic Possibilities:** As I have described, my background is one of deal-making, and I intend to leverage my network and capabilities to maximize opportunities for Coya in 2025. We have only partnered COYA 302 in ALS, and the optionality to partner, co-develop, or license the asset in other indications exists. Any potential transaction will be evaluated based on maximizing stockholder value. The positive data from the investigator-initiated trial of LD IL-2 in patients with Alzheimer’s disease increases our confidence in obtaining value-creating pharma partnerships that combine our proprietary LD IL-2, COYA 301, with other modalities. I can envision multiple opportunities with LD IL-2 serving as a backbone adjuvant with standard of care agents and other novel pathways. \n\nMoreover, the opportunity for grant funding and financial support from foundations exists and will be vigorously pursued. We believe the data emerging on Tregs in autoimmune disease (such as lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, and scleroderma) and, in particular, treatment with LD IL-2 is compelling and may strengthen the role of COYA 302 and LD IL-2 combinations in this space. I intend to actively pursue partnerships in this arena that would further place us in a strong position to pursue value-creating deals. \n\n**Value-Creating Pipeline**\n\nLike many experts in the scientific community, we believe combination strategies are the future to address devastating neurodegenerative diseases. We believe targeting one mechanism or pathway is likely insufficient to achieve maximal effect - hence our approach with COYA 302. COYA 302 is a “Pipeline within a Product” and has strong potential in ALS, FTD, AD, Parkinson’s disease, and other indications. \n\nWe are continuously building our intellectual property to further enhance the value of Coya. One recent development is the combination of COYA 301 and GLP-1 agonists. Data suggests that the mechanism of action appears additive and/or synergistic in ameliorating inflammation. This is yet another opportunity for value-creating strategic partnerships. We intend to publish more detailed data in 1Q 2025. \n\n**Conclusion**\n\nAs you can see from our past performance, our entire management team is committed to the success of Coya. We expect to recognize a number of clinical, regulatory, and/or commercial milestones in 2025 that will help us advance the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. \n\nOn behalf of the entire Coya team, please accept our sincere gratitude for both your support and belief in our science, our story, and our team. We look forward to presenting additional clinical data and updating you on our additional corporate developments as they unfold. Onwards and upwards! \n\n**About Coya Therapeutics, Inc.**\n\nHeadquartered in Houston, TX, Coya Therapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq: COYA) is a clinical-stage biotechnology company developing proprietary treatments focused on the biology and potential therapeutic advantages of regulatory T cells (“Tregs”) to target systemic inflammation and neuroinflammation. Dysfunctional Tregs underlie numerous conditions, including neurodegenerative, metabolic, and autoimmune diseases, and this cellular dysfunction may lead to sustained inflammation and oxidative stress resulting in lack of homeostasis of the immune system. \n\nCoya’s investigational product candidate pipeline leverages multiple therapeutic modalities aimed at restoring the anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory functions of Tregs. Coya’s therapeutic platforms include Treg-enhancing biologics, Treg-derived exosomes, and autologous Treg cell therapy. \n\nCOYA 302 – the Company’s lead biologic investigational product or \"Pipeline in a Product\" – is a proprietary combination of COYA 301 (Coya’s proprietary LD IL-2) and CTLA4-Ig for subcutaneous administration with a unique dual mechanism of action that is now being developed for the treatment of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, Frontotemporal Dementia, Parkinson’s Disease, and Alzheimer’s Disease. Its multi-targeted approach enhances the number and anti-inflammatory function of Tregs and simultaneously lowers the expression of activated microglia and the secretion of pro-inflammatory mediators. This synergistic mechanism may lead to the re-establishment of immune balance and amelioration of inflammation in a sustained and durable manner that may not be achieved by either low-dose IL-2 or CTLA4-Ig alone. \n\nFor more information about Coya, please visit [www.coyatherapeutics.com](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.coyatherapeutics.com&esheet=54154536&newsitemid=20241119164131&lan=en-US&anchor=www.coyatherapeutics.com&index=2&md5=2500485b6f2e67bcecfd6bae5c09fda4). \n\n**Forward-Looking Statements**\n\nThis press release contains “forward-looking” statements that are based on our management’s beliefs and assumptions and on information currently available to management.

The 4.93 point ∆ suggests a clinically meaningful treatment effect.\n➢ For patients with mild AD, a change of +3 on the ADAS-Cog has been described as clinically meaningful to assess worsening (Muir et al.,\nAlzheimer’s Dement. 2024;20:3352–3363).\n✓ Safety (Primary Endpoint) and Regulatory T cell (Treg) Enhancement (Secondary Endpoint) Validated:\n• Both dosing frequencies regimens of LD IL-2 studied (q4wk & q2wk) were safe and well-tolerated.\n• Administering LD IL-2 q4wk effectively, sustainably, and significantly expanded Treg numbers and function vs. placebo without off-target effects on\nother peripheral lymphocytes.\n✓ Significant Improvement in Amyloid Beta Pathology for Lower IL-2 Dose vs. Placebo:\n• LD IL-2 q4wk significantly improved CSF Soluble Aβ42 levels (an index of amyloid pathology) vs. placebo.\n• LD IL-2 among the first double-blind human trials to document subcutaneous Treg-enhancing therapy that modifies beta-amyloid.\n✓ Cerebral Spinal Fluid (CSF) Biomarker and Cognitive Effects Were Associated with Boosted Treg Function\nand Numbers vs. Placebo\n*The Alzheimer’s Disease Assessment Scale–Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog) was developed in the 1980s to assess the level of cognitive dysfunction in Alzheimer’s disease. Clinical Global Impression of\nChange (CGIC) scales have been used as primary outcomes in phase 2 and 3 clinical trials for Alzheimer disease, mild cognitive impairment, and for cognitive enhancers. A CGIC score is intended to be\nused as a measure of clinically meaningful change, as distinct from an instrument’s ability to assess any change. 31\nLD IL-2 in Mild to Moderate Alzheimer’s Disease: Validated Lower\nDose IL-2 is Better\nThe trial was designed to detect significant differences in primary and\nsecondary endpoints:\nPrimary Endpoint: Secondary Endpoint: Exploratory Endpoints:\nSafety and Tolerability Treg Cell Populations CSF Biomarkers and Clinical Scales\n➢ No Serious Treatment\nRelated Adverse Events\nReported\n➢ All Patients Completed\nTrial ➢ Significant improvement ➢ Clinical scales,\n➢Significant change in Treg population in cerebrospinal (CSF) including the ADAS-\n➢ Drug was Well Tolerated following two different dosing frequency AD-related biomarker Cog Score\nSoluble AB42\nregimens of LD IL-2 treatment, compared\nto placebo\n➢ Assessment of\nperipheral/central\nLower Dose IL-2 Level\ninflammatory responses\nHigher Dose IL-2 Level will be reported in\nthe near future)\n: 21 week or 148 day on-treatment period 32\nKey Takeaways\n➢ We believe LD IL-2 study results further validate the hypothesis that restoring the\nnumbers and function of Tregs with systemic LD IL-2 alone targets neuroinflammation\n➢ We believe LD IL-2 study results indicate that systemically administered LD IL-2 directly\nmediates significant disease-modifying pathology in the CNS\n➢ LD IL-2 study results increase our confidence in COYA 302 outcomes in neurodegenerative\ndiseases (ALS and FTD)\n➢ LD IL-2 study results increase our confidence in the opportunity to combine COYA 301 with\nother complementary modalities targeting AD (Amyloid, Tau targeting agents)\n➢ LD IL-2 study results increase our confidence to pursue additional value-creating strategic\npartnership opportunities for COYA 301\n33\nKey Catalysts and Milestones- 2025\n➢ 1Q 2025: Phase 2 LD IL-2 investigator initiated trial in patients with AD additional clinical data\nAdditional Clinical\nrelease: Publication and release of additional and comprehensive systemic immune panel and\nData Release:\ninflammatory cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers comparing LD IL-2 arms to placebo arm\nPhase 2 IIT AD Trial\nCOYA 301/GLP-1 ➢ 1Q/2Q 2025: COYA 301/GLP-1 combination mechanistic data publication and additional IP filings\nData Release\n➢ 2Q 2025:Submission of the additional data package to support the start of the COYA-302 Phase\nCOYA 302 Phase 2\n2 trial in patients with ALS\nALS Trial Initiation\nReceipt: Non-Dilutive\n➢ Upon Acceptance and first patient dosing, eligible to receive milestone payments of $8.4 MM from\nMilestone Payment\nstrategic partner, Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories (DRL)\n➢ 2Q 2025: ALS Biomarker data publication of longitudinal data on Neurofilament Light Chain (NfL)\nALS Biomarker Data\nand oxidative stress markers in ALS Patients\nRelease\n➢ 2H 2025: Top Line Clinical Data of investigator-initiated trial combining LD IL-2 + CTLA4-Ig in FTD\nFTD Clinical Data\nPatients\nRelease and IND\n➢ 2H 2025: File COYA-302 IND for Phase 2 FTD Trial 34\nThank you!\n35\nCoya’s Leadership Has Demonstrated Deep Expertise in Biotech\nManagement\nTeam\nHoward Berman, Ph.D. Arun Swaminathan, Ph.D. Fred Grossman, D.O., FAPA David Snyder Michelle Frazier\nExecutive Chairman of the Board Chief Executive Officer President & Chief Medical Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President\nOfficer Chief Operating Officer of Regulatory Affairs\nPrior\nExperience*\nBoard of\nDirectors\nWilbur Ross Ann Lee, Ph.D. Anabella Villalobos, Ph.D. Dieter Weinand Dov Goldstein, M.D., MBA\nFormer U.S. Secretary of Chief Technical Officer Head of Biotherapeutics and Former Chairman of Board Chief Financial Officer\nCommerce of Prime Medicine Medicinal Sciences of Biogen and CEO, Bayer Pharma, AG of BioAge Labs\nPrior\nExperience*\n36\n*Logos illustrated represent past experience\nSAB Comprised of Seminal Leadership in Tregs\nFollowing the discoveries of\nDr. Sakaguchi and Dr. Appel,\nCoya is developing multiple\nproduct modalities to\nenhance the therapeutic\nShimon Sakaguchi, MD, PhD Stanley Appel, MD\npotential of Tregs for the\nDistinguished Professor at the World Premier Former Chair of the Stanley H.

Appel, M.D., internationally renowned researcher and neurologist-__-Webinar to be held Friday, June 11, 2021 at 11:30 a.m. ET-_\n\nHOUSTON, June 02, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Coya Therapeutics, Inc., (Coya™), a clinical-stage biotechnology company developing first-in-class approaches utilizing autologous regulatory T cells (Tregs) and Treg-derived exosome therapeutics for neurodegenerative and autoimmune diseases, today announced that it will host a key opinion leader (KOL) webinar on ALS001, the Company’s lead asset for the treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), on Friday, June 11, 2021 at 11:30 a.m. ET.\n\nThe webinar will feature a presentation by KOL, Stanley H. Appel, M.D. (Houston Methodist Neurological Institute), who will discuss the current treatment landscape of ALS, the implications of dysfunctional Tregs in neurodegenerative disease progression and the therapeutic potential of ALS001, an autologous, expanded Treg cell therapy. Dr. Appel will be available to answer questions following the formal presentation. Coya’s management team will also provide an update on their lead pipeline candidate, ALS001, currently in an ongoing Phase 2a trial with data expected summer 2021.\n\nDr. Appel’s transformational work is the basis for Coya’s proprietary and patented TAI™ (Tregs Against Inflammation™) platform, that offers therapeutic approaches to address the unmet and significant medical needs of patients with ALS, Parkinson’s, Alzheimer’s, FTD and other autoimmune diseases. Coya’s CTreg™ platform (Cryopreservation for Tregs™) is the first in the industry to expand, freeze, and re-thaw Tregs, while maintaining viability and suppressive function, thus solving manufacturing and supply-chain limitations and providing an ‘off the shelf’ Treg cell therapy that enables serial and monthly infusions.\n\nStanley H. Appel, M.D., is the Peggy and Gary Edwards Distinguished Endowed Chair for the Treatment and Research of ALS, Co-Director of the Houston Methodist Neurological Institute, Chair of the Stanley H. Appel Department of Neurology, Houston Methodist Hospital and Professor of Neurology at Weill Cornell Medical College. He is also Director of the MDA/ALSA ALS Research and Clinical Center at the Houston Methodist Neurological Institute. Dr Appel’s seminal research documented the intimate relationship of neurodegeneration and ALS progression with dysfunctional and decreased levels of Tregs. He is also renowned for his discovery of cryopreservation of Tregs, demonstrating the ability to expand, freeze and re-thaw Tregs, while maintaining viability and suppressive function. Dr. Appel is a member of numerous professional societies and committees and has authored 15 books and over 440 articles on topics such as ALS, neuromuscular disease, Alzheimer’s Disease, and Parkinson’s Disease.\n\nTo register for the webinar, please click [here](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=rvauOWxHrSa5qPWziUjyKqTYX1Jn1sp-OZOjz6fa0h01KF8AtN0kbYXjTenVH8lvzhXQrYBUpzRtN9j7Yr3S7w== \"here\").
