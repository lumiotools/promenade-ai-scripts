RMB45,396 million of such loan volume was under capital-light model, Intelligence Credit Engine (“ICE”) and total technology solutions*5, representing 55.1% of the total, an increase of 4.7% from RMB43,353 million in the same period of 2023 and an increase of 15.4% from RMB39,344 million in the prior quarter.\n  * Loan facilitation volume of intended discontinued service*6 reached RMB17,145 million, a decrease of 34.6% from RMB26,226 million in the same period of 2023 and a decrease of 24.0% from RMB22,561 million in the prior quarter.\n  * Total outstanding loan balance*7 of ongoing services was RMB127,727 million as of September 30, 2024, a decrease of 13.3% from RMB147,237 million as of September 30, 2023 and an increase of 3.4% from RMB123,551 million as of June 30, 2024. RMB74,078 million of such loan balance was under capital-light model, “ICE” and total technology solutions*8, a decrease of 0.5% from RMB74,421 million as of September 30, 2023 and an increase of 6.4% from RMB69,589 million as of June 30, 2024.\n  * Outstanding loan balance of intended discontinued service*6 was RMB31,901 million as of September 30, 2024, a decrease of 23.8% from RMB41,863 million as of September 30, 2023 and a decrease of 6.8% from RMB34,227 million as of June 30, 2024.\n  * The weighted average contractual tenor of loans originated by financial institutions across our platform in the third quarter of 2024 was approximately 10.12 months, compared with 11.23 months in the same period of 2023.\n  * 90 day+ delinquency rate*9 of loans originated by financial institutions across our platform was 2.72% as of September 30, 2024.\n  * Repeat borrower contribution*10 of loans originated by financial institutions across our platform for the third quarter of 2024 was 93.8%.\n\n\n\n1 Refers to cumulative registered users across our platform.2 “Cumulative users with approved credit lines” refers to the total number of users who had submitted their credit applications and were approved with a credit line at the end of each period.3 Including 3,298,567 loans across “V-pocket”, and 19,743,736 loans across other products.4 Refers to the total principal amount of loans facilitated and originated during the given period.5 “ICE” is an open platform primarily on our “Qifu Jietiao” APP (previously known as “360 Jietiao”), we match borrowers and financial institutions through big data and cloud computing technology on “ICE”, and provide pre-loan investigation report of borrowers. For loans facilitated through “ICE”, the Company does not bear principal risk. Loan facilitation volume through “ICE” was RMB 29,635 million in the third quarter of 2024.Under total technology solutions, we have been offering end-to-end technology solutions to financial institutions based on on-premise deployment, SaaS or hybrid model since 2023. Loan facilitation volume through total technology solutions was RMB761 million in the third quarter of 2024.6 In 2021, we started to offer financial institutions on-premise deployed, modular risk management SaaS, which helps financial institution partners improve credit assessment results. We further began to offer end-to-end technology solutions to financial institutions based on on-premise deployment, SaaS or hybrid model in 2023, which we refer to as total technology solutions. These foregoing services combined were previously referred to as other technology solutions. However, as the risk management SaaS service only generated marginal returns and had little potential for up selling, we intend to gradually discontinue it by the end of 2024. The gradual discontinuation of the service is not expected to have a material impact on our overall business, financial condition, and results of operations. 7 “Total outstanding loan balance” refers to the total amount of principal outstanding for loans facilitated and originated at the end of each period, excluding loans delinquent for more than 180 days.8 As of September 30, 2024, outstanding loan balance was RMB42,898 million for “ICE” and RMB1,544 million for total technology solutions.9 “90 day+ delinquency rate” refers to the outstanding principal balance of on- and off-balance sheet loans that were 91 to 180 calendar days past due as a percentage of the total outstanding principal balance of on- and off-balance sheet loans across our platform as of a specific date. Loans that are charged-off and loans under “ICE” and total technology solutions are not included in the delinquency rate calculation.10 “Repeat borrower contribution” for a given period refers to (i) the principal amount of loans borrowed during that period by borrowers who had historically made at least one successful drawdown, divided by (ii) the total loan facilitation and origination volume through our platform during that period.\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Highlights**\n\n  * Total net revenue was RMB4,370.2 million (US$622.7 million), compared to RMB 4,281.0 million in the same period of 2023.\n  * Income from operations was RMB2,289.2 million (US$326.2 million), compared to RMB 1,388.9 million in the same period of 2023.\n  * Non-GAAP*11 income from operations was RMB2,315.5 million (US$330.0 million), compared to RMB 1,432.2 million in the same period of 2023.\n  * Operating margin was 52.4%.

For more information on these Non-GAAP financial measures, please see the section of “Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures Statement” and the table captioned “Unaudited Reconciliations of GAAP and Non-GAAP Results” set forth at the end of this press release.\n\nMr. Haisheng Wu, Chief Executive Officer and Director of Qifu Technology, commented, “We are very pleased to deliver a strong quarter of financial results in a still challenging macro environment with some tentative sign of increasing users’ activities late in the quarter. We continued to make noticeable progress in key areas of our operations and achieved better efficiency and enhanced returns.\n\nDuring the quarter, we saw continued improvement in net take rates with the help of improving risks and lowering funding costs. Non-credit risk bearing loans for ongoing services accounted for nearly 55% of total volume. In the third quarter, we further reduced unit costs for user acquisition through more efficient and diversified user acquisition channels. Meanwhile, in an overall easing funding environment, we continued to strengthen our relationship with financial institution partners and further reduced overall funding costs to another historic low.\n\nWhile we are encouraged by recent release of stimulus economic policies, it may still take a while to see the actual impact to the overall consumer demand and consumption behavior. Looking ahead, we intend to continue to take a disciplined risk management approach despite improved asset quality and tentatively uptick in user activities. With our consistent execution, we believe we are well positioned to capture long-term opportunities by building a comprehensive credit-tech platform that offers differentiate products and services to users and financial institution partners based on their respective credit profiles and risk preferences.”\n\n“We are excited to report a set of strong financial results in the quarter. Total net revenue was RMB4.37 billion and Non-GAAP net income was RMB1.83 billion for the third quarter,” Mr. Alex Xu, Chief Financial Officer, commented. “At the end of the third quarter, our total cash and cash equivalent*12 was approximately RMB9.77 billion, and we generated approximately RMB2.37 billion cash from operations. During the quarter, we continued to execute the US$350 million share repurchase program with meaningful progress. The newly approved US$450 million share repurchase program for 2025 further demonstrates our strong commitment to sustainable shareholder returns through dividend and share repurchases.”\n\nMr. Yan Zheng, Chief Risk Officer, added, “We experienced further improvement in overall risk metrics of our loan book in the third quarter as we continued to take a prudent approach in managing risks. Among key leading indicators, Day-1 delinquency rate*13 was 4.6%, and 30-day collection rate*14 was approximately 87.4%. The 30-day collection rates reached its best levels in the past three years. As we remain vigilant in risk management under current macro environment, we expect to see relatively stable overall risk performance in the coming quarters.”\n\n12 Including “Cash and cash equivalents”, “Restricted cash”, “Security deposit prepaid to third-party guarantee companies” and “Short-term investments”.13 “Day-1 delinquency rate” is defined as (i) the total amount of principal that became overdue as of a specified date, divided by (ii) the total amount of principal that was due for repayment as of such specified date.14 “30-day collection rate” is defined as (i) the amount of principal that was repaid in one month among the total amount of principal that became overdue as of a specified date, divided by (ii) the total amount of principal that became overdue as of such specified date.\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results**\n\n**Total net revenue** was RMB4,370.2 million (US$622.7 million), compared to RMB4,281.0 million in the same period of 2023, and RMB4,160.1 million in the prior quarter.\n\n**Net revenue from Credit Driven Services** was RMB 2,901.0 million (US$413.4 million), compared to RMB3,071.0 million in the same period of 2023, and RMB2,912.2 million in the prior quarter.\n\n_Loan facilitation and servicing fees-capital heavy_ were RMB258.7 million (US$36.9 million), compared to RMB479.2 million in the same period of 2023 and RMB151.1 million in the prior quarter.

Reconciliations of our Non-GAAP financial measures to our U.S. GAAP financial measures are set forth in tables at the end of this earnings release, which provide more details on the Non-GAAP financial measures.\n\nWe use Non-GAAP income from operation, Non-GAAP operating margin, Non-GAAP net income, Non-GAAP net income margin, Non-GAAP net income attributed to the Company and Non-GAAP net income per fully diluted ADS in evaluating our operating results and for financial and operational decision-making purposes. Non-GAAP income from operation represents income from operation excluding share-based compensation expenses. Non-GAAP operating margin is equal to Non-GAAP income from operation divided by total net revenue. Non-GAAP net income represents net income excluding share-based compensation expenses. Non-GAAP net income margin is equal to Non-GAAP net income divided by total net revenue. Non-GAAP net income attributed to the Company represents net income attributed to the Company excluding share-based compensation expenses. Non-GAAP net income per fully diluted ADS represents net income excluding share-based compensation expenses per fully diluted ADS. Such adjustments have no impact on income tax. We believe that Non-GAAP income from operation, Non-GAAP operating margin, Non-GAAP net income, Non-GAAP net income margin, Non-GAAP net income attributed to the Company and Non-GAAP net income per fully diluted ADS help identify underlying trends in our business that could otherwise be distorted by the effect of certain expenses that we include in results based on U.S. GAAP. We believe that Non-GAAP income from operation and Non-GAAP net income provide useful information about our operating results, enhance the overall understanding of our past performance and future prospects and allow for greater visibility with respect to key metrics used by our management in its financial and operational decision-making. Our Non-GAAP financial information should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, but should not be considered a substitute for or superior to U.S. GAAP results. In addition, our calculation of Non-GAAP financial information may be different from the calculation used by other companies, and therefore comparability may be limited.\n\n**Exchange Rate Information**\n\nThis announcement contains translations of certain RMB amounts into U.S. dollars at specified rates solely for the convenience of the reader.
