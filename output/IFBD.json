The Share Consolidation will\naffect all shareholders uniformly and will have no effect on the proportionate holdings of any individual shareholder,\nwith the exception of adjustments related to the treatment of fractional shares (see below).\nPurpose of the Share Consolidation\nThe Company’s Ordinary Shares are currently listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market (“Nasdaq”) under the symbol\n“IFBD.” Among other requirements, the listing maintenance standards established by Nasdaq require the Ordinary\nShares to have a minimum closing bid price of at least $1.00 per share. Pursuant to the Nasdaq Marketplace Rule\n5550(a)(2) (the ”Minimum Bid Price Rule”), if the closing bid price of the Ordinary Shares is not equal to or greater\nthan $1.00 for 30 consecutive business days, Nasdaq will send a deficiency notice to the Company. Thereafter, if the\nOrdinary Shares do not close at a minimum bid price of $1.00 or more for 10 consecutive business days within 180\ncalendar days of the deficiency notice, Nasdaq may determine to delist the Ordinary Shares.\nOn September 12, 2023, the Company received a written notification from the Nasdaq Stock Market LLC notifying\nthe Company that it was not in compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Rule, and the Company was provided 180\ncalendar days, or until March 11, 2024, to regain compliance.\nTo regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Rule by March 11, 2024, the Board of Directors determined that\nit was in the best interest of the Company to solicit the approval of the shareholders to effect a share consolidation of\nthe Company’s Ordinary Shares. The Board of Directors believes that without receiving the shareholders’ approval\nand without the closing price of the Ordinary Shares otherwise meeting the $1.00 minimum closing bid price\nrequirement, the Company’s Ordinary Shares will be delisted from Nasdaq. In the event the Company does not regain\ncompliance by March 11, 2024, the Company may be eligible for an additional 180 calendar day grace period. To\nqualify, the Company will be required to meet the continued listing requirement for market value of publicly held\nshares and all other initial listing standards for the Nasdaq Capital Market, with the exception of the bid price\nrequirement, and will need to provide written notice of its intention to cure the deficiency during the second\ncompliance period, including by effecting a reverse stock split, if necessary. If the Company chooses to implement a\nreverse stock split, it must complete the split no later than ten (10) business days prior to March 11, 2024, or the\nexpiration of the second compliance period if granted.\nIn the event the Ordinary Shares were no longer eligible for continued listing on Nasdaq, the Company could be forced\nto seek to be traded on the OTC Bulletin Board or in the “pink sheets.” These alternative markets are generally\nconsidered to be less efficient than, and not as broad as, Nasdaq, and therefore less desirable. Accordingly, the Board\nof Directors believes delisting of the Ordinary Shares would likely have a negative impact on the liquidity and market\nprice of the Ordinary Shares and may increase the spread between the “bid” and “ask” prices quoted by market makers.\nThe Board of Directors has considered the potential harm to the Company of a delisting from Nasdaq and believes\nthat delisting could, among other things, adversely affect (i) the trading price of the Ordinary Shares, and (ii) the\nliquidity and marketability of the Ordinary Shares. This could reduce the ability of holders of the Ordinary Shares to\npurchase or sell Ordinary Shares as quickly and as inexpensively as they have done historically. Delisting could also\nadversely affect the Company’s relationships with customers who may perceive the Company’s business less\nfavorably, which would have a detrimental effect on the Company’s relationships with these entities.\nFurthermore, if the Ordinary Shares were no longer listed on Nasdaq, it may reduce the Company’s access to capital\nand cause the Company to have less flexibility in responding to its capital requirements. Certain institutional investors\nmay also be less interested or prohibited from investing in the Ordinary Shares, which may cause the market price of\nthe Ordinary Shares to decline.\nRegistration and Trading of our Ordinary Shares\nThe Share Consolidation will not affect the registration of our Ordinary Shares or our obligation to publicly file\nfinancial and other information with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. When the Share Consolidation is\nimplemented, our Ordinary Shares will begin trading on a post-split basis on the Effective Date that we announce by\npress release. In connection with the Share Consolidation, the CUSIP number of our Ordinary Shares (which is an\nidentifier used by participants in the securities industry to identify our Ordinary Shares) will change.\nFractional Shares\nNo fractional Ordinary Shares will be issued to any shareholders in connection with the Share Consolidation. Any\nfractional shares resulting from the Share Consolidation shall be rounded up such that each shareholder will be entitled\nto receive one Ordinary Share in lieu of the fractional share that would have resulted from the Share Consolidation.\nAuthorized Shares\nUpon the Share Consolidation becoming effective, our authorized share capital of the Company shall be decreased\nfrom 1,000,000,000 ordinary shares of US$0.025 each to 50,000,000 ordinary shares of US$0.50 each.\nStreet Name Holders of Ordinary Shares\nThe Company intends for the Share Consolidation to treat shareholders holding Ordinary Shares in street name through\na nominee (such as a bank or broker) in the same manner as shareholders whose shares are registered in their names.\nNominees will be instructed to effect the Share Consolidation for their beneficial holders. However, nominees may\nhave different procedures. Accordingly, shareholders holding Ordinary Shares in street name should contact their\nnominees.\nShare Certificates\nMandatory surrender of certificates by our shareholders is not required. The Company’s transfer agent will adjust the\nrecord books of the Company to reflect the Share Consolidation as of the Effective Date. New certificates will not be\nmailed to shareholders.\nResolutions\nThe Board of Directors proposes to solicit shareholder approval to effect Share Consolidation of the Company’s\nOrdinary Shares at a ratio of twenty shares into one share in the form of shareholder resolutions. The resolutions be\nput to the shareholders to consider and to vote upon at the Meeting in relation to amending the authorized share capital\nof the Company are:\nVote Required and Board Recommendation\nIf a quorum is present, the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes of the holders of Ordinary Shares present in\nperson or represented by proxy and entitled to vote at the Meeting will be required to approve the Share Consolidation.\n1. “IT IS HEREBY RESOLVED, as an ordinary resolution, that:\n(A) every twenty (20) issued and unissued existing ordinary shares of US$0.025 par value each of\nthe Company be consolidated into one (1) ordinary share of US$0.50 par value each (the\n“Consolidated Ordinary Shares”), with such Consolidated Ordinary Shares having the same\nrights and being subject to the same restrictions (save as to nominal value) as the existing\nordinary shares of US$0.025 each of the Company as set out in the Company’s memorandum\nand articles of association (the “Share Consolidation”) with immediate effect(the “Effective\nDate”);\n(B) on the Effective Date, as a result of the Share Consolidation, the authorized share capital of\nthe Company be amended from US$25,000,000 divided into 1,000,000,000 ordinary shares of\nUS$0.025 each to US$25,000,000 divided into 50,000,000 ordinary shares of US$0.50 each; and\n(C) all fractional entitlements to the issued Consolidated Ordinary Shares resulting from the Share\nConsolidation will not be issued to the shareholders of the Company and the Company be\nauthorized to round up any fractional shares resulting from the Share Consolidation such that\neach shareholder will be entitled to receive one Consolidated Ordinary Share in lieu of any\nfractional share that would have resulted from the Share Consolidation.\nTHE BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMEND\nA VOTE FOR\nAPPROVAL OF\nTHE SHARE CONSOLIDATION OF THE COMPANY’S ORDINARY SHARES\nPROPOSAL NO. 3\nTHE INCREASE OF THE COMPANY’S AUTHORIZED SHARES\nGeneral\nThe Board of Directors believes that it is in the best interest of the Company and the shareholders, and is hereby\nsoliciting shareholder approval, to increase of the Company’s authorized share capital from US$25,000,000 divided\ninto 50,000,000 shares of a par value of US$0.50 each to US$25,000,000,000 divided into 50,000,000,000 shares of\na par value of US$0.50 each, by the creation of an additional 49,950,000,000 Ordinary Shares of a par value of\nUS$0.50 each (the “Increase of Authorized Shares”).\nThe Increase of Authorized Shares must be passed by an ordinary resolution which requires the affirmative vote of a\nsimple majority of the votes cast at the Annual General Meeting by the shareholders present in person or represented\nby proxy and entitled to vote on such proposals, either in person, by proxy or by authorized representative.\nPROPOSAL NO. 4\nAPPROVAL OF THE FIFTH AMENDED AND RESTATED MEMORANDUM AND ARTICLES OF\nASSOCIATION\nTo consider and approve by a special resolution the amendments of the Company’s Memorandum and Articles of\nAssociation in the form of Fifth Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association attached as Annex\nA hereto to reflect the above Share Consolidation; and that the Fifth Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles\nof Association be adopted as the Memorandum and Articles of Association of the Company, to the exclusion of the\nexisting Memorandum and Articles of Association with effect from the effective date of the Share Consolidation and\nthe Increase of Authorised Shares.
