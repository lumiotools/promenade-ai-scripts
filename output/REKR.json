In October, we amended the Pre-Paid advance Agreement with an affiliate of Yorkville Global Advisors, LP and eliminated the option for additional advances to the Company of $20 million. Below are some highlights of the Company's other achievements during the quarter:\n\n  * **Rekor Highlighted by Texas DOT:** The Texas Department of Transportation presented the Rekor Command™ solution to the Texas House Legislature as a model for the future of roadway management. Rekor's deployment and its successful outcomes were also [showcased in a recent video featuring testimonials](https://vimeo.com/1000916017?share=copy&t=0) from the department's senior leaders.\n  * **New York Moves to Procurement:** The New York State Department of Transportation has advanced Rekor Discover™ from the proof-of- concept stage to the procurement phase. This initial implementation establishes a foundation for Rekor to collaborate with various engineering and construction firms, inviting bids for numerous data collection sites across the state.\n  * **New Mexico Selects Rekor for AI Count Class and Speed:** In New Mexico, Rekor Discover™ has been selected to replace the side-firing radars on major roadwork along I-25. This decision highlights Rekor's ability to enhance roadside intelligence and monitor critical infrastructure as part of New Mexico’s [$200 million improvement initiative](https://www.kob.com/new-mexico/construction-begins-on-i-25-near-montgomery-and-comanche/).\n  * **Partnership with Goldwings Establishes Hawaiian Presence:** Rekor Discover™ is now available to the communities in Hawaii with high demand for roadway intelligence through a new partnership with Goldwings.\n  * **NVIDIA Case Study:** [NVIDIA recently published a case study](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/rekor-metropolis-ai-jetson-roadway-safety/) highlighting Rekor's integration of its comprehensive accelerated computing platform for roadway intelligence. By leveraging NVIDIA's AI technologies, Rekor is advancing new generative AI applications, including enhanced internal data annotation, streamlined workflows, and more effective calibration and configuration of systems.\n\n\n\n\"Our third quarter financial results reflect the delays in revenue realization we recently experienced due to the variability we've previously noted in servicing government customers. Consequently, we are aggressively optimizing our cost structure and accelerating our path to achieve positive cash flow in 2025. To stay resilient in this environment, we’ve taken the necessary steps to adjust to the unpredictability of government procurement timelines and trim our expenses. This expense realignment has been designed to achieve an annual reduction in costs of up to $15 million.\" said Eyal Hen, CFO of Rekor. \"Concurrent with this optimization program, we eliminated the option to tap additional advances of $20 million under our agreement with Yorkville Advisors. This reflects our confidence in our forward outlook, growing operating momentum, and commitment to protecting shareholder value. As our actions have been targeted to support near-term revenue generation, we continue to look forward to delivering strong future growth in the coming quarters.\"\n\nOur President and CEO, David Desharnais, was recently appointed to the Board of ITS America. “I am truly honored to be inducted into the ITS America Board of Directors and to join forces with visionary leaders from both the public and private sectors to shape the future of transportation,” said Mr. Desharnais. “ITS America is leading the way in transforming the movement of people and goods, championing innovation, and advancing intelligent transportation systems to build safer, more resilient, and connected communities. I look forward to contributing to this bold mission and helping to accelerate the adoption of groundbreaking solutions that will shape the future of our transportation infrastructure.\"\n\n**_Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Financial Results_**\n\nThis section highlights the changes for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023.\n\n**_Revenues_**\n\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/613358c0b4aa2460fb2dfe6c/6745dc038fe2f4a8650df970_67365319f3344f2bf7ed88d9_6736529fe94ce5d0ed5545b5_revenues.jpeg)\n\nThe increase in revenue for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, was primarily attributable to our Urban Mobility revenue stream which consists of revenue derived from roadway data aggregation activities. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, revenue attributable to ATD was $1,723,000 and $7,428,000, respectively, and is included as part of the Urban Mobility revenue stream.\n\n**_Cost of Revenue, excluding Depreciation and Amortization_**\n\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/613358c0b4aa2460fb2dfe6c/6745dc038fe2f4a8650df97f_67365319f3344f2bf7ed88e1_673652b24d2f85ada5d961de_Cost%252520of%252520Revenue.jpeg)\n\nFor the three and nine months that ended September 30, 2024, the cost of revenue, excluding depreciation and amortization, increased compared to the corresponding prior periods primarily due to an increase in personnel and other direct costs, such as hardware, that were incurred to support our increase in revenue. Additionally, during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, $809,000 and $2,608,000 of the increase was related to our acquisition of ATD.\n\n**_Loss from Operations_**\n\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/613358c0b4aa2460fb2dfe6c/6745dc038fe2f4a8650df98d_67365319f3344f2bf7ed88ce_673652e8f652f67e67f1ca4d_three%252520months%252520ended.jpeg)\n\nLoss from operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, increased primarily due to additional costs of ATD including the additional depreciation and amortization of intangible assets associated with the acquisition.\n\n**_Additional Key Performance Indicators and Non-GAAP Measures_**\n\n** _Performance Obligations_**\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company had approximately $23,613,000 in remaining performance obligations not yet satisfied or partially satisfied. This is a decrease of approximately 11%, down from $26,390,000 of remaining performance obligations as of December 31, 2023. Total performance obligations have decreased over time as the contract term of certain of the Company's large long-term contracts begin to near.\n\n**_Adjusted Gross Profit and Adjusted Gross Margin_**\n\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/613358c0b4aa2460fb2dfe6c/6745dc038fe2f4a8650df974_67365319f3344f2bf7ed88de_673652fb36523f51c03f13c0_Adjusted%252520Gross%252520Profit.jpeg)\n\nAdjusted Gross Margin for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, decreased compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. The fluctuation in Adjusted Gross Margin is typically correlated to the mix of hardware and software sales as well as service-type work. Typically, our software sales carry a higher Adjusted Gross Margin.\n\n**_EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA_**\n\nThe Company calculates EBITDA as net loss before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization. The Company calculates Adjusted EBITDA as net loss before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, adjusted for (i) impairment of intangible assets, (ii) loss on extinguishment of debt, (iii) stock-based compensation, (iv) losses or gains on sales of subsidiaries, and (v) other unusual or non-recurring items. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not measurements of financial performance or liquidity under accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (\"U.S. GAAP\") and should not be considered as an alternative to net earnings or cash flow from operating activities as indicators of our operating performance or as a measure of liquidity or any other measures of performance derived in accordance with U.S. GAAP. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are presented because we believe they are frequently used by securities analysts, investors, and other interested parties in the evaluation of a company's ability to service and/or incur debt. However, other companies in our industry may calculate EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA differently than we do.\n\nThe following table sets forth the components of the EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA for the periods included (dollars in thousands):\n\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/613358c0b4aa2460fb2dfe6c/6745dc038fe2f4a8650df985_67365319f3344f2bf7ed88d2_673652cbf00f93c8b7af8f19_net%252520loss.jpeg)\n\nRekor has scheduled a conference call to discuss the third quarter 2024 results on Thursday, November 14, 2024, at 4:30 P.M.
