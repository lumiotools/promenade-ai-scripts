This includes data from preclinical in vitro studies recently accepted for online publication at the upcoming American Society of Hematology (“ASH”) Annual Meeting, and correlates with efficacy demonstrated by recent preliminary clinical data in subjects who were relapsed from or refractory to first line Venetoclax regimens and were then treated with Annamycin in combination with Ara-C (“AnnAraC”).\n\n[ ![\\(PRNewsfoto/Moleculin Biotech, Inc.\\) \\(PRNewsfoto/Moleculin Biotech, Inc.\\)](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/959635/Moleculin_Biotech_Inc_Logo.jpg) ](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/959635/Moleculin_Biotech_Inc_Logo.html)\n\nJorge Cortes, MD, Director of the Georgia Cancer Center at Augusta University and a member of the Company’s Scientific Advisory Board, commented, “Although Venetoclax has been an important improvement in first line therapy for AML patients who are unfit for intensive chemotherapy, the rate of relapse is high and overall survival post relapse is just a few months. This turns out to be a large percentage of AML patients in total and we clearly need a better treatment option.”\n\nMichael Andreeff, MD, PhD, Professor of Medicine, Department of Leukemia, Division of Cancer Medicine, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center and a member of the Company’s Scientific Advisory Board, added, “Many patients get Ven-Aza, not because they are ‘unfit’ but because of the high initial response rates. When they relapse, however, our options are very limited. Annamycin combined with Ara-C could significantly advance the standard of care and provide better outcomes for these high-risk patients. I am excited to be a part of the next step in the development of this important asset.”\n\nA prior publication, _[Outcomes of relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia after frontline hypomethylating agent and venetoclax regimens](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4305049-1&h=1627342633&u=https%3A%2F%2Fhaematologica.org%2Farticle%2Fview%2F9775&a=Outcomes+of+relapsed+or+refractory+acute+myeloid+leukemia+after+frontline+hypomethylating+agent+and+venetoclax+regimens)_ _1_ , reported that the CR/CRi2 rate for salvage therapy using available standard of care in AML subjects who relapsed from or were refractory to Venetoclax regimens was 12.5% (n=24, 4% CR). The new preliminary clinical findings announced today in the MB-106 clinical trial indicate that relapsed or refractory (“R/R”) AML subjects previously treated with Venetoclax regimens achieved a 60% CR/CRi rate (n=5, 40% CR), more than 4 times the rate that would be expected based on the above referenced paper. As previously disclosed in MB-106, there was an overall CR/CRi rate of 60% (50% CR) in 2nd line subjects (n=10) and 41% (36% CR) in all subjects, 1st-7th line (n=22).\n\nAn abstract titled, “ _Annamycin, a non-cardiotoxic anthracycline, demonstrates unique organotropism and activity against Ara-C and Venetoclax resistant AML,”_ supporting the clinical activity of Annamycin was accepted for online publication at the ASH Annual Meeting being held December 7-10, 2024, in San Diego, CA. The abstract will be published in a supplemental issue of _[Blood](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4305049-1&h=897673985&u=https%3A%2F%2Fashpublications.org%2Fblood&a=Blood)_ _,_ expected in late November, and will become part of the permanent ASH and _Blood_ abstracts archive following the conclusion of the Annual Meeting.\n\nAdditionally, new preliminary data from the Company’s Phase 1B/2 clinical trial evaluating AnnAraC for the treatment of subjects with AML as both first line therapy and for subjects who were refractory to or relapsed after induction therapy (MB-106) demonstrated median overall survival (“OS”) of 9.1 months for subjects with a wide range of (0-6) prior lines of therapy (n=22) and 11.6 months (n=10) for subjects with 1 prior line of therapy (second line therapy).\n\n“Moleculin is focusing on development of Annamycin to address the significant unmet need in R/R AML. The growing body of preliminary data continue to bolster our confidence in the safety and efficacy of Annamycin, and its potential to provide patients and physicians with a promising new treatment option in AML,” commented Walter Klemp, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Moleculin. “We believe the latest preliminary OS data we are seeing in our MB-106 trial can now be considered exceptional and we look forward to the initiation of our pivotal registration study, especially now that our recent protocol amendment allows for disclosing unblinded data for the first 45 subjects, which we expect within the next 12 months.”\n\nThe Company is advancing the development of Annamycin in a Phase 3 pivotal trial evaluating AnnAraC for the treatment of AML patients who are refractory to or relapsed after induction therapy (R/R AML) (MB-108). This Phase 3 “MIRACLE” trial (derived from **_M_** olecul** _i_** n **_R_** /R AML **_A_** nnAraC **_Cl_** inical **_E_** valuation) will be a global trial, including sites in the US. The Company remains on track to initiate patient treatment in the first quarter of 2025.\n\nAnnamycin currently has Fast Track Status and Orphan Drug Designation from the FDA for the treatment of relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia, in addition to Orphan Drug Designation for the treatment of soft tissue sarcoma. Furthermore, Annamycin has Orphan Drug Designation for the treatment of relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia from the European Medicines Agency (EMA).\n\n**About Moleculin Biotech, Inc.**\n\nMoleculin Biotech, Inc. is a Phase 3 clinical stage pharmaceutical company advancing a pipeline of therapeutic candidates addressing hard-to-treat tumors and viruses. The Company’s lead program, Annamycin, is a next-generation anthracycline designed to avoid multidrug resistance mechanisms and to eliminate the cardiotoxicity common with currently prescribed anthracyclines. Annamycin is currently in development for the treatment of relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and soft tissue sarcoma (STS) lung metastases.\n\nThe Company is initiating the MIRACLE (**M** olecul**i** n **R** /R AML **A** nnAraC **Cl** inical **E** valuation) Trial (MB-108), a pivotal, adaptive design Phase 3 trial evaluating Annamycin in combination with cytarabine, together referred to as AnnAraC, for the treatment of relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia. Following a successful Phase 1B/2 study (MB-106), with input from the FDA, the Company believes it has substantially de-risked the development pathway towards a potential approval for Annamycin for the treatment of AML. This study is subject to appropriate future filings with potential additional feedback from the FDA and their foreign equivalents.\n\nAdditionally, the Company is developing WP1066, an Immune/Transcription Modulator capable of inhibiting p-STAT3 and other oncogenic transcription factors while also stimulating a natural immune response, targeting brain tumors, pancreatic and other cancers. Moleculin is also engaged in the development of a portfolio of antimetabolites, including WP1122 for the potential treatment of pathogenic viruses, as well as certain cancer indications.\n\nFor more information about the Company, please visit [www.moleculin.com](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4305049-1&h=91804279&u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.moleculin.com%2F&a=www.moleculin.com) and connect on [X](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4305049-1&h=4264142529&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.twitter.com%2Fmoleculinbio&a=X), [LinkedIn](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4305049-1&h=840149722&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fcompany%2Fmoleculin-llc%2F&a=LinkedIn) and [Facebook](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4305049-1&h=1515305163&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fmoleculin&a=Facebook).\n\n**Forward-Looking Statements**\n\nSome of the statements in this release are forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, which involve risks and uncertainties.

This Phase 3 “MIRACLE” trial (derived from **_M_** olecul** _i_** n **_R_** /R AML **_A_** nnAraC **_Cl_** inical **_E_** valuation) will be a global trial, including sites in the US. Additionally, the Company released a Virtual Investor “What This Means” segment to discuss the amended protocol. Access the segment [here](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4302840-1&h=1627301008&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.virtualinvestorco.com%2Fwtm-mbrx-data-readout&a=here).\n\n[ ![\\(PRNewsfoto/Moleculin Biotech, Inc.\\) \\(PRNewsfoto/Moleculin Biotech, Inc.\\)](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/959635/Moleculin_Biotech_Inc_Logo.jpg) ](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/959635/Moleculin_Biotech_Inc_Logo.html)\n\n“Our team has been thoughtful and strategic with the design of the MIRACLE trial, which may allow for possible accelerated approval of Annamycin in combination with cytarabine for the treatment of relapsed or refractory AML. This amended protocol enables us to share definitive data earlier, which helps to partially de-risk financing the trial and potentially accelerates the timeline for strategic partnering. We believe that the unblinding of data at 45 subjects will enable us to begin assessing all three arms of the study and provide us with a clear path forward in understanding the potential of Annamycin for AML patients. This change now puts us potentially less than 12 months away from definitive unblinded data that could be a strong indicator of our likelihood of approval, and the kind of data that is likely to drive advanced partnering discussions,” commented Walter Klemp, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Moleculin.\n\nThe MIRACLE study, subject to appropriate future filings with and potential additional feedback from the FDA and their foreign equivalents, is expected to initially utilize an adaptive design whereby the first 75 to 90 subjects will be randomized in Part A of the trial to receive high dose cytarabine (HiDAC) combined with either placebo, 190 mg/m2 of Annamycin, or 230 mg/m2 of Annamycin, such doses were specifically recommended by the FDA in the Company’s end of Phase 1B/2 meeting. The amended protocol will allow for the unblinding of preliminary primary efficacy data (CR) and safety/tolerability of the three arms at 45 subjects. This early unblinding will yield 30 subjects with Annamycin (190mg/m2 and 230/m2) and HiDAC and 15 subjects with just HiDAC. The Company expects to reach 45 subjects in the second half of 2025, in addition to the planned unblinding expected in 2026 of the next 30-45 subjects. \n\nFor Part B of the trial, approximately 244 additional subjects will be randomized to receive either HiDAC plus placebo or HiDAC plus the optimum dose of Annamycin. The selection of the optimum dose will be based on the overall balance of safety, pharmacokinetics and efficacy, consistent with the FDA’s new Project Optimus initiative. This increase from 240 to 244 subjects represents the statistical “cost” of the additional unblinding.\n\nThe amended protocol is currently being reviewed by the Institutional Review Board (IRB). Once approved, the amended protocol will be filed with the amendment for the Company’s Initial New Drug (IND) application in the US with the FDA. \n\nAnnamycin currently has Fast Track Status and Orphan Drug Designation from the FDA for the treatment of relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia, in addition to Orphan Drug Designation for the treatment of soft tissue sarcoma. Furthermore, Annamycin has Orphan Drug Designation for the treatment of relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia from the European Medicines Agency (EMA).\n\n**About Moleculin Biotech, Inc.**\n\nMoleculin Biotech, Inc. is a Phase 3 clinical stage pharmaceutical company advancing a pipeline of therapeutic candidates addressing hard-to-treat tumors and viruses.

This Phase 3 “MIRACLE” trial (derived from **_M_** olecul** _i_** n **_R_** /R AML **_A_** nnAraC **_Cl_** inical **_E_** valuation) will be a global trial, including sites in the US.\n\n[ ![\\(PRNewsfoto/Moleculin Biotech, Inc.\\) \\(PRNewsfoto/Moleculin Biotech, Inc.\\)](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/959635/Moleculin_Biotech_Inc_Logo.jpg) ](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/959635/Moleculin_Biotech_Inc_Logo.html)\n\n“IRB approval marks an important milestone towards the launch of our MIRACLE pivotal Phase 3 trial of Annamycin in AML patients. Our team is focused on getting clinical trial sites up and running, and we believe we will be in a position to commence enrollment in the first quarter of 2025,” commented Walter Klemp, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Moleculin. “We have been extremely busy meeting with potential investigators for this study and are highly encouraged by these conversations. The positive feedback from the clinicians on the strength of our data generated to date, along with our alignment with FDA on the strategic design of the MIRACLE study, gives us a high level of confidence as we take these next steps toward potentially bringing a much needed solution to AML patients.” \n\nThe MIRACLE study, subject to appropriate future filings with and potential additional feedback from the FDA and their foreign equivalents, is expected to initially utilize an adaptive design whereby the first 75 to 90 subjects will be randomized in Part A of the trial to receive high dose cytarabine (HiDAC) combined with either placebo, 190 mg/m2 of Annamycin, or 230 mg/m2 of Annamycin, such doses were specifically recommended by the FDA in our end of Phase 1B/2 meeting. At that point, the trial will be unblinded to select the optimum dose for Annamycin. For Part B of the trial, approximately 240 additional subjects will be randomized to receive either HiDAC plus placebo or HiDAC plus the optimum dose of Annamycin. The selection of the optimum dose will be based on the overall balance of safety, pharmacokinetics and efficacy, consistent with the FDA’s new Project Optimus initiative.\n\nAnnamycin currently has Fast Track Status and Orphan Drug Designation from the FDA for the treatment of relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia, in addition to Orphan Drug Designation for the treatment of soft tissue sarcoma. Furthermore, Annamycin has Orphan Drug Designation for the treatment of relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia from the European Medicines Agency (EMA).\n\n**About Moleculin Biotech, Inc.**\n\nMoleculin Biotech, Inc. is a Phase 3 clinical stage pharmaceutical company advancing a pipeline of therapeutic candidates addressing hard-to-treat tumors and viruses. The Company’s lead program, Annamycin, is a next-generation anthracycline designed to avoid multidrug resistance mechanisms and to eliminate the cardiotoxicity common with currently prescribed anthracyclines. Annamycin is currently in development for the treatment of relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and soft tissue sarcoma (STS) lung metastases.\n\nThe Company is initiating the MIRACLE (**M** olecul**i** n **R** /R AML **A** nnAraC **Cl** inical **E** valuation) Trial (MB-108), a pivotal, adaptive design Phase 3 trial evaluating Annamycin in combination with cytarabine, together referred to as AnnAraC, for the treatment of relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia. Following a successful Phase 1B/2 study (MB-106), with input from the FDA, the Company believes it has substantially de-risked the development pathway towards a potential approval for Annamycin for the treatment of AML. This study is subject to appropriate future filings with potential additional feedback from the FDA and their foreign equivalents.\n\nAdditionally, the Company is developing WP1066, an Immune/Transcription Modulator capable of inhibiting p-STAT3 and other oncogenic transcription factors while also stimulating a natural immune response, targeting brain tumors, pancreatic and other cancers.

This includes data from preclinical in vitro studies recently accepted for online publication at the upcoming American Society of Hematology (\"ASH”) Annual Meeting, and correlates with efficacy demonstrated by recent preliminary clinical data in subjects who were relapsed from or refractory to first line Venetoclax regimens and were then treated with Annamycin in combination with Ara-C (\"AnnAraC”).\n\nJorge Cortes, MD, Director of the Georgia Cancer Center at Augusta University and a member of the Company’s Scientific Advisory Board, commented, \"Although Venetoclax has been an important improvement in first line therapy for AML patients who are unfit for intensive chemotherapy, the rate of relapse is high and overall survival post relapse is just a few months. This turns out to be a large percentage of AML patients in total and we clearly need a better treatment option.”\n\nMichael Andreeff, MD, PhD, Professor of Medicine, Department of Leukemia, Division of Cancer Medicine, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center and a member of the Company’s Scientific Advisory Board, added, \"Many patients get Ven-Aza, not because they are ‘unfit’ but because of the high initial response rates. When they relapse, however, our options are very limited. Annamycin combined with Ara-C could significantly advance the standard of care and provide better outcomes for these high-risk patients. I am excited to be a part of the next step in the development of this important asset.”\n\nA prior publication, _Outcomes of relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia after frontline hypomethylating agent and_ _venetoclax regimens_ 1, reported that the CR/CRi2 rate for salvage therapy using available standard of care in AML subjects who relapsed from or were refractory to Venetoclax regimens was 12.5% (n=24, 4% CR). The new preliminary clinical findings announced today in the MB-106 clinical trial indicate that relapsed or refractory (\"R/R”) AML subjects previously treated with Venetoclax regimens achieved a 60% CR/CRi rate (n=5, 40% CR), more than 4 times the rate that would be expected based on the above referenced paper. As previously disclosed in MB-106, there was an overall CR/CRi rate of 60% (50% CR) in 2nd line subjects (n=10) and 41% (36% CR) in all subjects, 1st-7th line (n=22).\n\nAn abstract titled, \"_Annamycin, a non-cardiotoxic anthracycline, demonstrates unique organotropism and activity against Ara-C and Venetoclax resistant AML,_ ” supporting the clinical activity of Annamycin was accepted for online publication at the ASH Annual Meeting being held December 7-10, 2024, in San Diego, CA. The abstract will be published in a supplemental issue of _Blood_ _,_ expected in late November, and will become part of the permanent ASH and _Blood_ abstracts archive following the conclusion of the Annual Meeting.\n\nAdditionally, new preliminary data from the Company’s Phase 1B/2 clinical trial evaluating AnnAraC for the treatment of subjects with AML as both first line therapy and for subjects who were refractory to or relapsed after induction therapy (MB-106) demonstrated median overall survival (\"OS”) of 9.1 months for subjects with a wide range of (0-6) prior lines of therapy (n=22) and 11.6 months (n=10) for subjects with 1 prior line of therapy (second line therapy).\n\n\"Moleculin is focusing on development of Annamycin to address the significant unmet need in R/R AML. The growing body of preliminary data continue to bolster our confidence in the safety and efficacy of Annamycin, and its potential to provide patients and physicians with a promising new treatment option in AML,” commented Walter Klemp, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Moleculin. \"We believe the latest preliminary OS data we are seeing in our MB-106 trial can now be considered exceptional and we look forward to the initiation of our pivotal registration study, especially now that our recent protocol amendment allows for disclosing unblinded data for the first 45 subjects, which we expect within the next 12 months.”\n\nThe Company is advancing the development of Annamycin in a Phase 3 pivotal trial evaluating AnnAraC for the treatment of AML patients who are refractory to or relapsed after induction therapy (R/R AML) (MB-108). This Phase 3 \"MIRACLE” trial (derived from **_M_** olecul** _i_** n **_R_** /R AML **_A_** nnAraC **_Cl_** inical **_E_** valuation) will be a global trial, including sites in the US. The Company remains on track to initiate patient treatment in the first quarter of 2025.\n\n1 A. Maiti, C. Rausch, J.

Furthermore, Annamycin has Orphan Drug Designation for the treatment of relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia from the European Medicines Agency (EMA).\n\n**About Moleculin Biotech, Inc.**\n\nMoleculin Biotech, Inc. is a Phase 3 clinical stage pharmaceutical company advancing a pipeline of therapeutic candidates addressing hard-to-treat tumors and viruses. The Company’s lead program, Annamycin, is a next-generation anthracycline designed to avoid multidrug resistance mechanisms and to eliminate the cardiotoxicity common with currently prescribed anthracyclines. Annamycin is currently in development for the treatment of relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and soft tissue sarcoma (STS) lung metastases.\n\nThe Company is initiating the MIRACLE (**M** olecul**i** n **R** /R AML **A** nnAraC **Cl** inical **E** valuation) Trial (MB-108), a pivotal, adaptive design Phase 3 trial evaluating Annamycin in combination with cytarabine, together referred to as AnnAraC, for the treatment of relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia. Following a successful Phase 1B/2 study (MB-106), with input from the FDA, the Company believes it has substantially de-risked the development pathway towards a potential approval for Annamycin for the treatment of AML. This study is subject to appropriate future filings with potential additional feedback from the FDA and their foreign equivalents.\n\nAdditionally, the Company is developing WP1066, an Immune/Transcription Modulator capable of inhibiting p-STAT3 and other oncogenic transcription factors while also stimulating a natural immune response, targeting brain tumors, pancreatic and other cancers. Moleculin is also engaged in the development of a portfolio of antimetabolites, including WP1122 for the potential treatment of pathogenic viruses, as well as certain cancer indications.\n\nFor more information about the Company, please visit _www.moleculin.com_ and connect on _X_ , _LinkedIn_ and _Facebook_.\n\n**Forward-Looking Statements**\n\nSome of the statements in this release are forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, which involve risks and uncertainties.

The words “believe,” “may,” “will,” “estimate,”\n“continue,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “expect,” and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. We have based these forward-looking\nstatements largely on our current expectations and projections about future events and trends that we believe may affect our financial condition, results of\noperations, business strategy, short-term and long-term business operations and objectives, and financial needs. Our potential to sustain our relationship with\nMD Anderson revolves around the continued collaboration and capitalizing on intellectual property resulting from sponsored research. The feasibility and\npromptness of our clinical trials are influenced by regulatory stipulations from entities like the US Food & Drug Administration (FDA) and their global\ncounterparts. As such, all of our trials, including the MIRACLE trial, are subject to timely, future filings with and feedback, allowance, approvals, etc. from the FDA\nand their global counterparts. The implications of global events, such as the conflict in Ukraine, the COVID-19 pandemic, and prevalent supply chain challenges,\nplay a role in our forward-looking statements. Additionally, our ongoing need for financing, fueling our clinical trial and product development initiatives, securing\nregulatory approvals in essential markets, and sourcing cost-effective drug solutions are core to our forward-looking statements. Furthermore, our commitments\nconcerning intellectual property licenses, the potential efficacy of our drug candidates, market reception, potential product liabilities, and the emerging\ncompetitive landscape are also fundamental to our forward-looking statements. Any reference related to cardiotoxicity or the lack thereof concerning Annamycin\nis based on our expert’s opinion as detailed in our filings, from time to time, with the SEC. Our dependencies on third-party manufacturers, strategies for\nestablishing business collaborations, the defense of our intellectual property rights, our plans for fostering company growth, and the imperative to retain key\nexecutive personnel also guide our projections. It is not possible for our management to predict all risks, nor can we assess the impact of all factors on our\nbusiness or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking\nstatements we may make. In light of these risks, uncertainties, and assumptions, the future events and trends discussed in this presentation may not occur, and\nactual results could differ materially and adversely from those anticipated or implied in the forward-looking statements.

For example, existing therapies were tested in and approved only for those subjects with corresponding\nmutations, whereas AnnAraC data are for all relapsed/refractory AML subjects regardless of gene mutations.
