This includes data from preclinical in vitro studies recently accepted for online publication at the upcoming American Society of Hematology (“ASH”) Annual Meeting, and correlates with efficacy demonstrated by recent preliminary clinical data in subjects who were relapsed from or refractory to first line Venetoclax regimens and were then treated with Annamycin in combination with Ara-C (“AnnAraC”).\n\n[ ![\\(PRNewsfoto/Moleculin Biotech, Inc.\\) \\(PRNewsfoto/Moleculin Biotech, Inc.\\)](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/959635/Moleculin_Biotech_Inc_Logo.jpg) ](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/959635/Moleculin_Biotech_Inc_Logo.html)\n\nJorge Cortes, MD, Director of the Georgia Cancer Center at Augusta University and a member of the Company’s Scientific Advisory Board, commented, “Although Venetoclax has been an important improvement in first line therapy for AML patients who are unfit for intensive chemotherapy, the rate of relapse is high and overall survival post relapse is just a few months. This turns out to be a large percentage of AML patients in total and we clearly need a better treatment option.”\n\nMichael Andreeff, MD, PhD, Professor of Medicine, Department of Leukemia, Division of Cancer Medicine, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center and a member of the Company’s Scientific Advisory Board, added, “Many patients get Ven-Aza, not because they are ‘unfit’ but because of the high initial response rates. When they relapse, however, our options are very limited. Annamycin combined with Ara-C could significantly advance the standard of care and provide better outcomes for these high-risk patients. I am excited to be a part of the next step in the development of this important asset.”\n\nA prior publication, _[Outcomes of relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia after frontline hypomethylating agent and venetoclax regimens](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4305049-1&h=1627342633&u=https%3A%2F%2Fhaematologica.org%2Farticle%2Fview%2F9775&a=Outcomes+of+relapsed+or+refractory+acute+myeloid+leukemia+after+frontline+hypomethylating+agent+and+venetoclax+regimens)_ _1_ , reported that the CR/CRi2 rate for salvage therapy using available standard of care in AML subjects who relapsed from or were refractory to Venetoclax regimens was 12.5% (n=24, 4% CR). The new preliminary clinical findings announced today in the MB-106 clinical trial indicate that relapsed or refractory (“R/R”) AML subjects previously treated with Venetoclax regimens achieved a 60% CR/CRi rate (n=5, 40% CR), more than 4 times the rate that would be expected based on the above referenced paper. As previously disclosed in MB-106, there was an overall CR/CRi rate of 60% (50% CR) in 2nd line subjects (n=10) and 41% (36% CR) in all subjects, 1st-7th line (n=22).\n\nAn abstract titled, “ _Annamycin, a non-cardiotoxic anthracycline, demonstrates unique organotropism and activity against Ara-C and Venetoclax resistant AML,”_ supporting the clinical activity of Annamycin was accepted for online publication at the ASH Annual Meeting being held December 7-10, 2024, in San Diego, CA. The abstract will be published in a supplemental issue of _[Blood](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4305049-1&h=897673985&u=https%3A%2F%2Fashpublications.org%2Fblood&a=Blood)_ _,_ expected in late November, and will become part of the permanent ASH and _Blood_ abstracts archive following the conclusion of the Annual Meeting.\n\nAdditionally, new preliminary data from the Company’s Phase 1B/2 clinical trial evaluating AnnAraC for the treatment of subjects with AML as both first line therapy and for subjects who were refractory to or relapsed after induction therapy (MB-106) demonstrated median overall survival (“OS”) of 9.1 months for subjects with a wide range of (0-6) prior lines of therapy (n=22) and 11.6 months (n=10) for subjects with 1 prior line of therapy (second line therapy).\n\n“Moleculin is focusing on development of Annamycin to address the significant unmet need in R/R AML. The growing body of preliminary data continue to bolster our confidence in the safety and efficacy of Annamycin, and its potential to provide patients and physicians with a promising new treatment option in AML,” commented Walter Klemp, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Moleculin. “We believe the latest preliminary OS data we are seeing in our MB-106 trial can now be considered exceptional and we look forward to the initiation of our pivotal registration study, especially now that our recent protocol amendment allows for disclosing unblinded data for the first 45 subjects, which we expect within the next 12 months.”\n\nThe Company is advancing the development of Annamycin in a Phase 3 pivotal trial evaluating AnnAraC for the treatment of AML patients who are refractory to or relapsed after induction therapy (R/R AML) (MB-108). This Phase 3 “MIRACLE” trial (derived from **_M_** olecul** _i_** n **_R_** /R AML **_A_** nnAraC **_Cl_** inical **_E_** valuation) will be a global trial, including sites in the US. The Company remains on track to initiate patient treatment in the first quarter of 2025.\n\nAnnamycin currently has Fast Track Status and Orphan Drug Designation from the FDA for the treatment of relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia, in addition to Orphan Drug Designation for the treatment of soft tissue sarcoma. Furthermore, Annamycin has Orphan Drug Designation for the treatment of relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia from the European Medicines Agency (EMA).\n\n**About Moleculin Biotech, Inc.**\n\nMoleculin Biotech, Inc. is a Phase 3 clinical stage pharmaceutical company advancing a pipeline of therapeutic candidates addressing hard-to-treat tumors and viruses. The Company’s lead program, Annamycin, is a next-generation anthracycline designed to avoid multidrug resistance mechanisms and to eliminate the cardiotoxicity common with currently prescribed anthracyclines. Annamycin is currently in development for the treatment of relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and soft tissue sarcoma (STS) lung metastases.\n\nThe Company is initiating the MIRACLE (**M** olecul**i** n **R** /R AML **A** nnAraC **Cl** inical **E** valuation) Trial (MB-108), a pivotal, adaptive design Phase 3 trial evaluating Annamycin in combination with cytarabine, together referred to as AnnAraC, for the treatment of relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia. Following a successful Phase 1B/2 study (MB-106), with input from the FDA, the Company believes it has substantially de-risked the development pathway towards a potential approval for Annamycin for the treatment of AML. This study is subject to appropriate future filings with potential additional feedback from the FDA and their foreign equivalents.\n\nAdditionally, the Company is developing WP1066, an Immune/Transcription Modulator capable of inhibiting p-STAT3 and other oncogenic transcription factors while also stimulating a natural immune response, targeting brain tumors, pancreatic and other cancers. Moleculin is also engaged in the development of a portfolio of antimetabolites, including WP1122 for the potential treatment of pathogenic viruses, as well as certain cancer indications.\n\nFor more information about the Company, please visit [www.moleculin.com](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4305049-1&h=91804279&u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.moleculin.com%2F&a=www.moleculin.com) and connect on [X](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4305049-1&h=4264142529&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.twitter.com%2Fmoleculinbio&a=X), [LinkedIn](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4305049-1&h=840149722&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fcompany%2Fmoleculin-llc%2F&a=LinkedIn) and [Facebook](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4305049-1&h=1515305163&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fmoleculin&a=Facebook).\n\n**Forward-Looking Statements**\n\nSome of the statements in this release are forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, which involve risks and uncertainties.

This Phase 3 “MIRACLE” trial (derived from **_M_** olecul** _i_** n **_R_** /R AML **_A_** nnAraC **_Cl_** inical **_E_** valuation) will be a global trial, including sites in the US. Additionally, the Company released a Virtual Investor “What This Means” segment to discuss the amended protocol. Access the segment [here](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4302840-1&h=1627301008&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.virtualinvestorco.com%2Fwtm-mbrx-data-readout&a=here).\n\n[ ![\\(PRNewsfoto/Moleculin Biotech, Inc.\\) \\(PRNewsfoto/Moleculin Biotech, Inc.\\)](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/959635/Moleculin_Biotech_Inc_Logo.jpg) ](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/959635/Moleculin_Biotech_Inc_Logo.html)\n\n“Our team has been thoughtful and strategic with the design of the MIRACLE trial, which may allow for possible accelerated approval of Annamycin in combination with cytarabine for the treatment of relapsed or refractory AML. This amended protocol enables us to share definitive data earlier, which helps to partially de-risk financing the trial and potentially accelerates the timeline for strategic partnering. We believe that the unblinding of data at 45 subjects will enable us to begin assessing all three arms of the study and provide us with a clear path forward in understanding the potential of Annamycin for AML patients. This change now puts us potentially less than 12 months away from definitive unblinded data that could be a strong indicator of our likelihood of approval, and the kind of data that is likely to drive advanced partnering discussions,” commented Walter Klemp, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Moleculin.\n\nThe MIRACLE study, subject to appropriate future filings with and potential additional feedback from the FDA and their foreign equivalents, is expected to initially utilize an adaptive design whereby the first 75 to 90 subjects will be randomized in Part A of the trial to receive high dose cytarabine (HiDAC) combined with either placebo, 190 mg/m2 of Annamycin, or 230 mg/m2 of Annamycin, such doses were specifically recommended by the FDA in the Company’s end of Phase 1B/2 meeting. The amended protocol will allow for the unblinding of preliminary primary efficacy data (CR) and safety/tolerability of the three arms at 45 subjects. This early unblinding will yield 30 subjects with Annamycin (190mg/m2 and 230/m2) and HiDAC and 15 subjects with just HiDAC. The Company expects to reach 45 subjects in the second half of 2025, in addition to the planned unblinding expected in 2026 of the next 30-45 subjects. \n\nFor Part B of the trial, approximately 244 additional subjects will be randomized to receive either HiDAC plus placebo or HiDAC plus the optimum dose of Annamycin. The selection of the optimum dose will be based on the overall balance of safety, pharmacokinetics and efficacy, consistent with the FDA’s new Project Optimus initiative. This increase from 240 to 244 subjects represents the statistical “cost” of the additional unblinding.\n\nThe amended protocol is currently being reviewed by the Institutional Review Board (IRB). Once approved, the amended protocol will be filed with the amendment for the Company’s Initial New Drug (IND) application in the US with the FDA. \n\nAnnamycin currently has Fast Track Status and Orphan Drug Designation from the FDA for the treatment of relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia, in addition to Orphan Drug Designation for the treatment of soft tissue sarcoma. Furthermore, Annamycin has Orphan Drug Designation for the treatment of relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia from the European Medicines Agency (EMA).\n\n**About Moleculin Biotech, Inc.**\n\nMoleculin Biotech, Inc. is a Phase 3 clinical stage pharmaceutical company advancing a pipeline of therapeutic candidates addressing hard-to-treat tumors and viruses.

This Phase 3 “MIRACLE” trial (derived from **_M_** olecul** _i_** n **_R_** /R AML **_A_** nnAraC **_Cl_** inical **_E_** valuation) will be a global trial, including sites in the US.\n\n[ ![\\(PRNewsfoto/Moleculin Biotech, Inc.\\) \\(PRNewsfoto/Moleculin Biotech, Inc.\\)](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/959635/Moleculin_Biotech_Inc_Logo.jpg) ](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/959635/Moleculin_Biotech_Inc_Logo.html)\n\n“IRB approval marks an important milestone towards the launch of our MIRACLE pivotal Phase 3 trial of Annamycin in AML patients. Our team is focused on getting clinical trial sites up and running, and we believe we will be in a position to commence enrollment in the first quarter of 2025,” commented Walter Klemp, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Moleculin. “We have been extremely busy meeting with potential investigators for this study and are highly encouraged by these conversations. The positive feedback from the clinicians on the strength of our data generated to date, along with our alignment with FDA on the strategic design of the MIRACLE study, gives us a high level of confidence as we take these next steps toward potentially bringing a much needed solution to AML patients.” \n\nThe MIRACLE study, subject to appropriate future filings with and potential additional feedback from the FDA and their foreign equivalents, is expected to initially utilize an adaptive design whereby the first 75 to 90 subjects will be randomized in Part A of the trial to receive high dose cytarabine (HiDAC) combined with either placebo, 190 mg/m2 of Annamycin, or 230 mg/m2 of Annamycin, such doses were specifically recommended by the FDA in our end of Phase 1B/2 meeting. At that point, the trial will be unblinded to select the optimum dose for Annamycin. For Part B of the trial, approximately 240 additional subjects will be randomized to receive either HiDAC plus placebo or HiDAC plus the optimum dose of Annamycin. The selection of the optimum dose will be based on the overall balance of safety, pharmacokinetics and efficacy, consistent with the FDA’s new Project Optimus initiative.\n\nAnnamycin currently has Fast Track Status and Orphan Drug Designation from the FDA for the treatment of relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia, in addition to Orphan Drug Designation for the treatment of soft tissue sarcoma. Furthermore, Annamycin has Orphan Drug Designation for the treatment of relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia from the European Medicines Agency (EMA).\n\n**About Moleculin Biotech, Inc.**\n\nMoleculin Biotech, Inc. is a Phase 3 clinical stage pharmaceutical company advancing a pipeline of therapeutic candidates addressing hard-to-treat tumors and viruses. The Company’s lead program, Annamycin, is a next-generation anthracycline designed to avoid multidrug resistance mechanisms and to eliminate the cardiotoxicity common with currently prescribed anthracyclines. Annamycin is currently in development for the treatment of relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and soft tissue sarcoma (STS) lung metastases.\n\nThe Company is initiating the MIRACLE (**M** olecul**i** n **R** /R AML **A** nnAraC **Cl** inical **E** valuation) Trial (MB-108), a pivotal, adaptive design Phase 3 trial evaluating Annamycin in combination with cytarabine, together referred to as AnnAraC, for the treatment of relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia. Following a successful Phase 1B/2 study (MB-106), with input from the FDA, the Company believes it has substantially de-risked the development pathway towards a potential approval for Annamycin for the treatment of AML. This study is subject to appropriate future filings with potential additional feedback from the FDA and their foreign equivalents.\n\nAdditionally, the Company is developing WP1066, an Immune/Transcription Modulator capable of inhibiting p-STAT3 and other oncogenic transcription factors while also stimulating a natural immune response, targeting brain tumors, pancreatic and other cancers.

Nature of Business\nThe terms \"MBI” or \"the Company”, \"we”, \"our” and \"us” are used herein to refer to Moleculin Biotech, Inc. MBI is a clinical-stage pharmaceutical company, organized\nas a Delaware corporation in July 2015, with clinical programs for hard-to-treat cancers and viruses. The Company has three core technologies, each of which have had one or more\ndrugs successfully complete a Phase 1 clinical trial, based substantially on discoveries made at and licensed from MD Anderson Cancer Center (MD Anderson) in Houston, Texas.\nIn July 2024 the Company’s lead program Annamycin completed a Phase 2 trial and has held it End-of-Phase 1/2 meeting with the Food and Drug Administration in the US and in\nAugust 2024 announced the preparations for a Phase 3 trial. The Company has two wholly owned subsidiaries, Moleculin Australia Pty. Ltd., which was set up to perform certain\npreclinical development and Moleculin Amsterdam B.V., which acts as its legal representative for clinical trials in Europe. The Company utilizes its own internal resources and\nfunds to conduct some of these trials and also has trials being conducted via physician-sponsored trials. The physician-sponsored trials utilize primarily external funds, such as\ngrant funds, which are not presented in these financial statements. The Company does not have manufacturing facilities, and all manufacturing activities are contracted out to third\nparties. Additionally, the Company does not have a sales organization. The Company’s overall strategy is to seek potential outlicensing or outsourcing opportunities with\ndevelopment/commercialization strategic partners who are better suited for the marketing, sales and distribution of its drugs, if approved.\nIn 2019, the Company sublicensed its technologies to Animal Life Sciences, Inc. (ALI), to enable research and commercialization for non-human use and share\ndevelopment data. As part of this agreement, ALI issued to the Company a 10% equity interest in ALI.\nOn May 5, 2023, the Company received a letter from the Nasdaq Capital Market (Nasdaq) notifying the Company that for the prior 30 consecutive business days the bid\nprice for the Company's common stock had closed below the minimum $1.00 per share requirement for continued inclusion on Nasdaq pursuant to Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2)\n(Bid Price Rule). The deficiency letter did not result in the immediate delisting of the Company's common stock from the Nasdaq. In accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)\n(A), the Company was provided an initial period of 180 calendar days, until November 1, 2023, to regain compliance with the Bid Price Rule. On November 2, 2023, the Company\nreceived a 180-calendar day extension, until April 29, 2024, from the Nasdaq to regain compliance with Bid Price Rule. On March 5, 2024, the Board of Directors approved a reverse\n1-for-15 reverse stock split effective 11:59 P.M. (Eastern time) on March 21, 2024, with trading to commence on a split-adjusted basis on March 22, 2024. On April 8, 2024, the\nCompany received a letter from Nasdaq notifying the Company that it had regained compliance with Bid Price Rule 5550(a)(2) as a result of the closing bid price of the Company's\ncommon stock being at $1.00 per share or greater for the 10 consecutive business days from March 22, 2024 through April 5, 2024. Accordingly, the Company is in compliance with\nthe Bid Price Rule and Nasdaq considers the matter closed.\n2. Basis of presentation, principles of consolidation, and significant accounting policies and liquidity\nReverse Stock Split - On March 22, 2024, the Company completed a reverse stock split of all the issued and outstanding shares of the Company's common stock at a ratio\nof 1 to 15. The accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes to the consolidated financial statements gives retroactive effect to the reverse stock split for all periods\npresented. Certain amounts previously reported include rounding up of fractional shares as a result of the reverse stock split.\nBasis of Presentation – Condensed Consolidated Financial Information - The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes have been\nprepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (U.S. GAAP) for financial information, and in accordance with the rules and regulations of the U.S.\nSecurities and Exchange Commission (SEC) with respect to Form 10-Q and Article 8 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes\nrequired by U.S. GAAP for complete financial statements. The condensed consolidated financial statements furnished reflect all normal adjustments, which are, in the opinion of\nmanagement, necessary for a fair statement of results for the interim periods presented. Interim results are not necessarily indicative of the results for the full year. These\ncondensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and for the year then\nended, including the notes thereto contained in the Form 10-K filed with the SEC on March 22, 2024.\nPrinciples of Consolidation - The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned\nsubsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Any reference in these notes to applicable guidance is meant to refer to U.S.\nGAAP. The Company views its operations and manages its business in one operating segment. All material long-lived assets of the Company reside in the U.S.\nSignificant Accounting Policies - The Company's significant accounting policies are described in Note 2, Basis of Presentation, principles of consolidation and\nsignificant accounting policies, to the consolidated financial statements included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. There\nhave been no material changes to the significant accounting policies during the nine months ended September 30, 2024.\nUse of Estimates - The preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported\namounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those\nestimates. Management considers many factors in selecting appropriate financial accounting policies and controls, and in developing the estimates and assumptions that are used\nin the preparation of these financial statements. Management must apply significant judgment in this process. In addition, other factors may affect estimates, including expected\nbusiness and operational changes, sensitivity and volatility associated with the assumptions used in developing estimates, and whether historical trends are expected to be\nrepresentative of future trends. The estimation process often may yield a range of potentially reasonable estimates of the ultimate future outcomes and management must select an\namount that falls within that range of reasonable estimates. This process may result in actual results differing materially from those estimated amounts used in the preparation of\nfinancial statements. Estimates are used in the following areas, among others: fair value estimates on intangible assets, warrants, and stock-based compensation expense, as well as\naccrued expenses and taxes.\n7\nTable of Contents\nIntangible Assets – Intangible assets with finite lives are amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated period of benefit. Acquired intangible assets\nidentified as in-process research and development (IPR&D) assets, are considered indefinite lived until the completion or abandonment of the associated research and\ndevelopment efforts. If the associated research and development effort is abandoned, the related IPR&D assets will be written-off and the Company will record a noncash\nimpairment loss on its statements of operations. For those compounds that reach commercialization, the IPR&D assets will be amortized over their estimated useful lives. Intangible\nassets are tested for impairment on an annual basis, which was completed as of September 30, 2024, and between annual tests if indicators of potential impairment exist, using a fair-\nvalue-based approach. The Company evaluates the recoverability of intangible assets periodically and take into account events or circumstances that warrant revised estimates of\nuseful lives or that indicate that impairment exists. No impairments of intangible assets have been identified during any of the periods presented.\nGoing Concern and Liquidity - These condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which assumes the Company will\ncontinue to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business. The continuation of the Company as a going concern is dependent upon the ability of the\nCompany to obtain necessary equity financing to continue operations and the attainment of profitable operations. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had an accumulated\ndeficit of $151.5 million since inception and had not yet generated any revenues from operations. Additionally, management anticipates that its cash on hand of $9.4 million as of\nSeptember 30, 2024 is not sufficient to fund its planned operations for a period of at least one year from when these consolidated financial statements are issued. These factors\nraise substantial doubt regarding the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any\nadjustments to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as\na going concern. The Company intends to seek additional funding through one or more of the following: a combination of equity offerings, debt financings, government or other\nthird-party funding, commercialization, marketing and distribution arrangements, other collaborations, strategic alliances and licensing arrangements and delay planned cash\noutlays or a combination thereof. There can be no assurance that such events or a combination thereof can be achieved.\nIn March 2022, the Company received a subpoena from the SEC requesting information and documents, including materials related to certain individuals (none of which\nare the Company's officers or directors) and entities, and materials related to the development of and statements regarding the Company's drug candidate for the treatment of\nCOVID-19. The Company has received, and expects to continue to receive, periodic further requests from the SEC staff with respect to this matter. The Company is not aware of the\nspecific nature of the underlying investigation by the SEC, and to the extent that this investigation relates to prior public disclosures that it has made, the Company believes in the\naccuracy and adequacy of such prior disclosures. The correspondence from the SEC transmitting the subpoena to the Company states that the SEC is trying to determine whether\nthere have been any violations of federal securities laws, but that its investigation does not mean that the SEC has concluded that anyone has violated the law or that the SEC has\na negative opinion of any person, entity, or security. The Company cannot predict when this matter will be resolved or what, if any, action the SEC may take following the\nconclusion of the investigation. The company expensed approximately $0.1 million and $0.4 million in related general and administrative fees and expenses for the three months\nended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and $0.2 million and $1.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The Company is in the\nprocess of filing a claim with its insurance carriers related to this loss which may cover a portion of the related expenses but not all. The claim is currently under review by\nthe insurance company. The claim has not yet been approved nor has a reimbursement amount been determined which, if any, would be limited by the applicable retention as\ndefined under the policy. Accordingly, the Company has not recorded any provision for insurance reimbursement. The Company expects to record the insurance reimbursement at\nthe time that the amount to be reimbursed is determined and approved by the insurance carrier. Any insurance reimbursement receivable will be recorded at an amount not to\nexceed the recorded loss and only if the terms of the legally enforceable insurance contracts support that the insurance recovery will not be disputed and is deemed collectible, or if\nrecovery of the loss is probable.\nCash and Cash Equivalents - Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to a concentration of credit risk consist of cash and cash equivalents. The\nCompany maintains cash accounts principally at one financial institution in the U.S., which at times, may exceed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation’s limit. The Company\nhas not experienced any losses from cash balances in excess of the insurance limit. The Company’s management does not believe the Company is exposed to significant credit risk\nat this time due to the financial condition of the financial institution where its cash is held.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments - The Company's financial instruments consist primarily of non-trade receivables, accounts payable, accrued expenses and its\nwarrant liability. The carrying amount of non-trade receivables, accounts payable, and accrued expenses approximates their fair value because of the short-term maturity of such.\nThe Company has categorized its assets and liabilities that are valued at fair value on a recurring basis into a three-level fair value hierarchy in accordance with U.S.\nGAAP. Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for\nthe asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active\nmarkets for identical assets and liabilities (Level 1) and lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3).\nAssets and liabilities recorded in the condensed consolidated balance sheets at fair value are categorized based on a hierarchy of inputs as follows:\nLevel 1 – Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets of identical assets or liabilities.\nLevel 2 – Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets or inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly through market\ncorroboration, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument.\nLevel 3 – Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.\n8\nTable of Contents\nThe Company’s financial assets and liabilities recorded at fair value on a recurring basis include the fair value of warrant liability discussed in Note 4.\nThe following table provides the financial liabilities reported at fair value and measured on a recurring basis at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 (table in\nthousands):\nDescription Fair Value Level 1 Level 2 Level 3\nFair value of warrant liability as of September 30, 2024: $ 9,932 $ — $ — $ 9,932\nFair value of warrant liability as of December 31, 2023: $ 4,855 $ — $ — $ 4,855\nThe table below of Level 3 liabilities (table in thousands) begins with the valuation as of the beginning of the third quarter and then is adjusted for changes in fair value\nthat occurred during the third quarter. The ending balance of the Level 3 financial instrument presented above represents the Company's best estimates and may not be\nsubstantiated by comparison to independent markets and, in many cases, could not be realized in immediate settlement of the instruments.\nWarrant Liability\nThree Months Ended September 30, 2024 Long-Term\nBalance, June 30, 2024 $ 1,704\nIssuances of warrants 6,111\nWarrant amendment 389\nChange in fair value - net 1,728\nBalance, September 30, 2024 $ 9,932\nThe table below of Level 3 liabilities (table in thousands) begins with the valuation as of December 31, 2023 and then is adjusted for changes in fair value that occurred\nduring the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The ending balance of the Level 3 financial instrument presented above represents the Company's best estimates and may not\nbe substantiated by comparison to independent markets and, in many cases, could not be realized in immediate settlement of the instruments.\nWarrant Liability\nNine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Long-Term\nBalance, December 31, 2023 $ 4,855\nIssuances of warrants 6,111\nWarrant amendment 389\nChange in fair value - net (1,423)\nBalance, September 30, 2024 $ 9,932\nLoss Per Common Share - Basic net loss per common share is computed by dividing net loss available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of\ncommon shares outstanding during the period. For purposes of this calculation, options to purchase common stock, restricted stock units subject to vesting and warrants to\npurchase common stock are considered to be common stock equivalents. Diluted net loss per common share is determined using the weighted-average number of common shares\noutstanding during the period, adjusted for the dilutive effect of common stock equivalents. In periods when losses are reported, the weighted-average number of common shares\noutstanding excludes common stock equivalents, because their inclusion would be anti-dilutive. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, approximately\n4.8 million and 0.6 million, respectively, of potentially dilutive shares were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share due to their anti-dilutive effect. For the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, approximately 2.7 million and 0.5 million, respectively, of potentially dilutive shares were excluded from the computation of diluted\nearnings per share due to their anti-dilutive effect.\nSubsequent Events - The Company’s management reviewed all material events through the date of these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements - In November 2024, FASB issued ASU 2024-03, Income Statement - Reporting Comprehensive Income - Expense Disaggregation\nDisclosures (Subtopic 220-40): Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses, which requires disclosure in the notes to the financial statements of specified information about\ncertain costs and expenses. The amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2026, and for interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December\n15, 2027. Early adoption is permitted. The amendments should be applied either prospectively to financial statements issued for reporting periods after the effective date of this\nASU or retrospectively to any or all prior periods presented in the financial statements. The Company is currently evaluating the new guidance to determine the impact it may have\non its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures, but expects additional disclosures upon adoption. There are no other recently issued accounting standards\nupdates that are currently expected to have a material impact on the Company.\n3. Accrued expenses and other current liabilities\nAccrued expenses and other current liabilities consist of the following components (in thousands):\nSeptember 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nAccrued payroll and bonuses $ 1,512 $ 765\nAccrued research and development 894 2,845\nAccrued legal, regulatory, professional and other 431 547\nOperating lease liability - current 116 100\nAccrued liabilities due to related party 90 60\nTotal accrued expenses and other current liabilities $ 3,043 $ 4,317\nAdditionally, accounts payable includes $20,000 and $67,000 as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, for related party payables.\n9\nTable of Contents\n4. Warrants and Equity\n2024 Warrant and Stock Issuances\nIn August 2024, the Company entered into a securities purchase agreement with an institutional investor for the sale by the Company of 283,000 shares of common stock,\nand 2,183,368 pre-funded warrants to purchase shares of common stock, series A warrants to purchase up to 2,466,368 shares of common stock, series B warrants to purchase up to\n2,466,368 shares of common stock, and placement agent warrants. The combined purchase price for the securities was $2.23 per share of common stock (or pre-funded warrant in\nlieu thereof). Each pre-funded warrant is exercisable for one share of common stock at an exercise price of $0.001 per share. The pre-funded warrants are exercisable immediately and\nmay be exercised at any time until all of the pre-funded warrants are exercised in full, subject to the beneficial ownership limitation. Each common warrant has an exercise price of\n$2.23 per share and will be exercisable beginning on the effective date of shareholder approval. The series A warrants expire on the earlier of (i) two years from the initial exercise\ndate, or (ii) 60 days from the Company's public announcement that it has achieved the series A milestone event. The series B warrants expire on the earlier of (i) five years from the\ninitial exercise date, or (ii) six months from the Company's public announcement that it has achieved the series B milestone event. The series A milestone event means the Company\nreleases interim data for the first subject group from the MIRACLE trial whereby the complete remission rate for either dose of the Company's study drug is greater than placebo;\nand series B milestone event means the Company releases final topline data from the MIRACLE trial and documented a statistically significant improvement in the primary efficacy\nendpoint. In addition, in August 2024, the Company entered into a warrant amendment agreement, pursuant to which the Company agreed that effective upon closing of the\noffering, and subject to shareholder approval, to amend 895,834 existing warrants originally issued on December 26, 2023 at an exercise price of $9.60 per share and a termination\ndate of February 14, 2029, so that the amended warrants would have a reduced exercise price of $2.23 per share and would expire five years from the date of shareholder approval.\nThe Company calculated the valuation of the warrant amendment immediately prior to the offering, as well as the valuation of the warrant amendment with the repriced terms, and a\n50% probability of obtaining shareholder approval. The loss on modification of the warrants of $0.4 million was recorded as a loss on issuance of warrant liabilities in the three and\nnine months ended September 30, 2024. The Company also considered a 50% probability of obtaining shareholder approval in the valuation for the August 2024 warrants in the\nthree and nine months ended September 30, 2024. In October 2024, the Company’s shareholders approved the issuance of both the August 2024 warrants, as well as the warrant\namendment.\nThe Company received gross proceeds of $5.5 million, before deducting the placement agent's fees and other offering expenses payable by the Company. Proceeds of\nofferings are allocated between common shares and warrants first by allocating to the warrants classified as a liability based on their fair value and then allocating the residual to\nthe equity instruments, which would include pre-funded warrants. As the fair value of the liability classified warrants in the August 2024 offering exceeded the total proceeds, no\nconsideration was allocated to the Common Shares or Pre-Funded Warrants. The full proceeds of the August 2024 offering were recorded to warrant liabilities, with an initial\nliability of $6.1 million, and a loss on initial recognition of $0.8 million. Transaction costs related to the offering were correspondingly fully allocated to warrant liabilities, and\n$1.0 million in related transaction costs were expensed during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024.\nLincoln Park Equity Line\nThe Company did not utilize the 2021 Lincoln Park purchase agreement during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The 2021 Lincoln Park Agreement terminated in\nJune 2024.\nOther Components of Equity\nIn March 2024, the Company issued 6,834 shares of common stock to consultants in exchange for services to be provided. In addition, during the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024, the Company issued 20,485 shares of common stock related to the vesting of restricted stock units.\nLiability Classified Warrants\nThe Company uses the Black-Scholes option pricing model (BSM) to determine the fair value of its warrants at the date of issue and outstanding at each reporting date.\nThe risk-free interest rate assumption is based upon observed interest rates on zero coupon U.S. Treasury bonds linearly interpolated to obtain a maturity period commensurate\nwith the term of the warrants. Estimated volatility is a measure of the amount by which the Company's stock price is expected to fluctuate each year during the expected life of the\nwarrants. Only the volatility of the Company's own stock is used in the Black-Scholes option pricing model. Certain assumptions, including the expected term, are subjective and\nrequire judgment to develop. As a result, if factors or expected outcomes change and we use significantly different assumptions or estimates, our warrant liability could be\nmaterially different.\nThe assumptions used in determining the fair value of the Company's outstanding liability classified warrants are as follows:\nSeptember 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nRisk-free interest rate 3.6% to 4.5% 3.8% to 5.4%\nVolatility 78.7% to 111.5% 79.5% to 108.7%\nExpected life (years) 0.4 to 5.0 0.3 to 5.0\nDividend yield —% —%\n10\nTable of Contents\nA summary of the Company's liability classified warrant activity during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and related information follows:\nWeighted\nAverage\nNumber of Range of Warrant Weighted Remaining\nShares Exercise Average Contractual\nUnder Warrant Price per Share Exercise Price Life (Years)\nBalance at January 1, 2024 1,082,895 $ 9.60 $ 157.50 $ 24.32 5.1\nGranted 5,056,054 $ 2.23 $ 2.79 $ 2.24 2.9\nExpired warrants (75,909) $ 99.00 $ 99.00 $ 99.00 —\nBalance at September 30, 2024 6,063,040 $ 2.23 $ 94.50 $ 12.90 3.1\nExercisable at September 30, 2024 1,006,986 $ 2.23 $ 94.50 $ 8.75 4.1\nFor a summary of the changes in fair value associated with the Company's warrant liability for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, see Note 2 - Basis of\npresentation, principles of consolidation and significant accounting policies - Fair Value of Financial Instruments.\nEquity Classified Warrants\nIn March 2024, the Company granted equity-classified warrants to purchase up to 3,334 shares of Company common stock with a ten-year term and an exercise price of\n$9.15. The warrants vest annually over four years while services are being performed.\nAt September 30, 2024, the Company had 2,089,105 equity classified warrants outstanding (including the remaining August 2024 pre-funded warrants) and\n2,066,894 warrants were exercisable. At December 31, 2023, the Company had 289,276 equity classified warrants outstanding and 266,350 warrants were exercisable.\n5. Stock Based Compensation\nThe 2015 Stock Plan provides for the grant of stock options, stock awards, stock unit awards, and stock appreciation rights to employees, non-employee directors and\nconsultants. In May 2023 and 2022, the 2015 Stock Plan (the Plan) was amended to authorize an additional 116,667 shares and 133,334 shares, respectively, such that 366,667 total\nshares may be issued under the Plan. As of September 30, 2024, there were 2,853 shares remaining to be issued under the 2015 Stock Plan. In October 2024, the Company's\nshareholders approved the 2024 Stock Plan, which authorizes a total of 1,000,000 shares of common stock, which will replace the 2015 Stock Plan.\nStock-based compensation expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, is as follows (table in thousands):\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nGeneral and administrative $ 259 $ 346 $ 980 $ 1,094\nResearch and development 94 147 319 411\nTotal stock-based compensation expense $ 353 $ 493 $ 1,299 $ 1,505\nThe Company recorded stock compensation expense for the equity classified warrants relating to non-employee consulting agreements of $26,000 and $50,000 for the\nthree months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and $94,000 and $142,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , respectively, which are included\nin the table above. At September 30, 2024, there was $283,000 of unrecognized stock compensation expense related to the Company's equity classified warrants.\nIn October and November 2024, the Company granted 545,000 stock options, 267,500 shares of restricted stock units, 73,334 shares of performance based restricted stock\nunits, and 36,000 in warrants to employees and contractors. These stock options have an exercise price ranging from $2.45 to $2.54 and vest over a one-to-four year period from the\ngrant date on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. The restricted stock units vest annually in four equal installments.\n11\nTable of Contents\n6. Income Taxes\nDeferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based upon differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities and are measured\nusing the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse.\nThe Company does not expect to pay any significant federal, state, or foreign income taxes in 2024 as a result of the losses recorded during the three and nine months\nended September 30, 2024 and the additional losses expected for the remainder of 2024 and cumulative net operating loss carryforwards. Accounting standards require the\nconsideration of a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets if it is \"more likely than not” that some component or all of the benefits of deferred tax assets will not be realized. As a\nresult, as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 the Company maintained a full valuation allowance for all deferred tax assets.\nThe Company recorded no income tax provision for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The effective tax rate for the nine months\nended September 30, 2024 and 2023 is nil. The income tax rates vary from the federal and state statutory rates primarily due to the change in fair value of the stock warrants, Internal\nRevenue Code Section 162(m) limitations and ISO activity, as well as the valuation allowances on the Company’s deferred tax assets. The Company estimates its annual effective\ntax rate at the end of each quarterly period. Jurisdictions with a projected loss for the year where no tax benefit can be recognized due to the valuation allowance could result in a\nhigher or lower effective tax rate during a particular quarter depending on the mix and timing of actual earnings versus annual projections.\n7. Commitments and Contingencies\nIn addition to the commitments and contingencies described elsewhere in these notes, see below for a discussion of the Company's commitments and contingencies as of\nSeptember 30, 2024.\nTable of Contents\nLease Obligations Payable\nThe following summarizes quantitative information about the Company's operating leases for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively\n(table in thousands):\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nLease cost:\nOperating lease cost $ 37 $ 34 $ 112 $ 99\nVariable lease cost 7 5 17 19\nTotal $ 44 $ 39 $ 129 $ 118\nIn September 2023, the Company executed an amendment to extend the corporate office lease until August 31, 2029, with an option to renew. The Company is required to\nremit base monthly rent of approximately $4,700 which will increase at an average approximate rate of 2% each year. The Company is also required to pay additional rent in the form\nof its pro-rata share of certain specified operating expenses of the building.\nIn June 2022, the Company extended the lab lease until September 30, 2027, with no further right or option to renew. The Company recorded approximately $12,000 in\nsublease income from a related party for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, and $37,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Sublease\nincome is recorded as other income, net on the Company's condensed consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss. Operating cash flows from operating leases\nwas $39,000 and $34,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and $107,000 and $109,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023,\nrespectively.\nLicenses\n(cid:0)(cid:1) (cid:0)(cid:2) (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)(cid:4) (cid:0)(cid:5) (cid:0)(cid:6) (cid:0)(cid:7) (cid:0)(cid:8) (cid:0)(cid:9) (cid:0)(cid:10) (cid:0)(cid:5) (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)(cid:11)(cid:0)(cid:3)Total expenses related to the Company's license agreements with MD Anderson were $63,000 and $64,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024\nand 2023, respectively, and $180,000 and $193,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n(cid:0)(cid:12) (cid:0)(cid:13) (cid:0)(cid:14)(cid:0)(cid:3) (cid:0)(cid:11)(cid:0)(cid:3)The Company has two agreements with a related party, Houston Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

Furthermore, we cannot guarantee future results, events, levels of activity, performance, or achievements.\nOur Business\nWe are a Phase 3 clinical stage pharmaceutical company with a portfolio of technologies for hard-to-treat cancers and viruses. We have three core technologies, each of\nwhich have had one or more drugs successfully complete a Phase 1 clinical trial, based substantially on discoveries made at and licensed from the University of Texas MD\nAnderson Cancer Center (MD Anderson) in Houston, Texas. Three of our six drug candidates have shown human activity in clinical trials and are currently or have been in Phase\n1B/2 or Phase 2 clinical trials. Since our inception, our drugs have completed, are currently in, or have been permitted to proceed in, fourteen clinical trials. Annamycin is our lead\nmolecule and we have recently concluded one Phase 1B/2 clinical trial for treating Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) and are embarking on a Phase 3 clinical trial for the treatment of\nAML, which we believe will be pivotal. Annamycin is also in two Phase 1B/2 clinical trials for treating Soft Tissue Sarcoma metastasized to the lungs (STS lung metastases, STS\nlung mets, or Advanced STS).\nOne of our core management beliefs is that anthracyclines represent the most important treatment for AML and Advanced STS, and we believe Annamycin may, for the\nfirst time ever, allow a majority of these patients to benefit from this treatment, mainly due to its lack of cardiotoxicity (which is found in currently prescribed anthracyclines) and its\nability to avoid multidrug resistance mechanisms. This belief, coupled with our limited resources, leads us to currently focus mainly on the development of Annamycin. We intend\nto advance our other drug candidates via investigator led studies – both clinically and preclinically.\nOur Core Technologies\nOur core technologies consist of the following programs:\na) Annamycin or L-Annamycin is a \"next generation” anthracycline (one of the most widely used classes of chemotherapy), designed to be different than currently\napproved anthracyclines, which are limited in utility because of cardiotoxicity risks and their susceptibility to multidrug resistance mechanisms. Annamycin was designed to avoid\nmultidrug resistance and to be non-cardiotoxic and, with intensive cardiac monitoring, has shown no cardiotoxicity in subjects treated in our four Annamycin clinical trials to date.\nFurthermore, we have demonstrated safe dosing significantly beyond the dose limitations imposed by regulatory authorities upon commonly prescribed anthracyclines due to their\ninherent cardiotoxicity. Annamycin has demonstrated efficacy in two of its Phase 1B/2 trials in subjects with AML and Advanced STS. We believe that Annamycin has potential\nto fill an unmet need as a second line therapy (2nd line or 2L) in AML and potentially as first line therapy in Advanced STS.\n13\nTable of Contents\nAs part of our Annamycin clinical trials, we have engaged an independent expert to assess cardiotoxicity associated with chemotherapy at the Cleveland Clinic (Expert or\nIndependent Expert). The data made available to the Expert include left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) as determined by echocardiograms, and ECHO strain imaging, as well as\nserum Troponin levels (a biochemical marker of acute heart damage). \"ECHO strain imaging” is a method in echocardiography (medical ultrasound) for measuring regional or global\ndeformation (contraction or beating) of the myocardium (heart muscle). By strain rate imaging, the simultaneous function of different regions can be displayed and measured.\nCardiac health biomarkers such as blood Troponin levels are considered an indicator of potential long-term heart damage. The Expert has issued and will continue to issue periodic\nreports as additional data are provided to him in batches of subject data. Such data include some data which are preliminary and subject to change. In our discussions regarding\nthe lack of Annamycin's cardiotoxicity, we rely on the Expert's assessment.\nAnnamycin benefits from a promising advancement in lipid enabled drug delivery developed in collaboration with and exclusively licensed from MD Anderson. The\nunique patented lipid composition allows us to combine a new concept in chemotherapeutic agents within a lipid structure that helps target the delivery of the payload and reduce\nthe potential for toxicity. In the case of Annamycin, our unique use of lipid technology enables improved tissue/organ distribution, and as demonstrated in multiple clinical trials,\ndramatically reduced toxicity, including cardiotoxicity. Annamycin has composition of matter patent protection through 2040.\nb) Our WP1066 Portfolio includes WP1066, WP1193 and WP1220, three of several Immune/Transcription Modulators in the portfolio designed to inhibit p-STAT3\n(phosphorylated signal transducer and activator of transcription) among other transcription factors associated with tumor activity. These also stimulate a natural immune response\nto tumors by inhibiting the errant activity of Regulatory T-Cells (TRegs). WP1066, in oral formulation, has been in two clinical trials for central nervous system (CNS)\ntumors, including compassionate use cases, in pediatric subjects. WP1066 and WP1193 are being tested in preclinical programs in intravenous (IV) formulations. WP1066 and\nWP1220 have been in clinical trials in a topical formulation. WP1066 and WP1220 have both independently successfully completed Phase 1 clinical trials and have demonstrated\nefficacy in their varied indications.\nc) Our WP1122 Portfolio contains compounds (including WP1122, WP1096, and WP1097) designed to exploit the potential uses of inhibitors of glycolysis such as 2-\ndeoxy-D-glucose (2-DG). We believe such compounds may provide an opportunity to cut off the energy supply of tumors by taking advantage of their high degree of dependence\non glucose in comparison to healthy cells, as well as viruses that also depend upon glycolysis and glycosylation to infect and replicate. WP1122 has completed a Phase 1 clinical\nstudy in normal volunteers, successfully establishing a Recommended Phase 2 Dose or RP2D.\nRecent Business Developments\nBelow are recent business developments.\n(cid:0)(cid:4) (cid:0)(cid:5) (cid:0)(cid:5) (cid:0)(cid:18) (cid:0)(cid:22) (cid:0)(cid:24) (cid:0)(cid:19) (cid:0)(cid:25)(cid:0)(cid:5) (cid:0)(cid:3)\n(cid:0)(cid:13) (cid:0)(cid:20) (cid:0)(cid:18) (cid:0)(cid:9) (cid:0)(cid:7) (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)(cid:26) (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)(cid:1) (cid:0)(cid:14) (cid:0)(cid:17) (cid:0)(cid:4) (cid:0)(cid:27) (cid:0)(cid:28) (cid:0)(cid:29) (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)(cid:30) (cid:0)(cid:8) (cid:0)(cid:25)(cid:0)(cid:18) (cid:0)(cid:31)\nWe are in the process of evaluating and visiting potential sites for our Phase 3 pivotal trial for the treatment of AML patients who are refractory to or relapsed after\ninduction therapy (R/R AML) with Annamycin in combination with Cytarabine (also known as \"Ara-C” and for which the combination of Annamycin and Ara-C is referred to as\n\"AnnAraC”). This Phase 3 \"MIRACLE” trial (derived from (M)olecul(i)n (R)/(r) AML (A)nnAraC (Cl)inical (E)valuation) will be a global trial.\nWe plan to focus on sites in the North America, Europe, Eastern Europe, Western Asia, and MENA (Middle East and Africa) for the initial Part A of MIRACLE. Our initial\ntarget will be approximately 45 sites. We expect that this will enable the enrollment of approximately 45 subjects by the third quarter of 2025 and approximately 90 subjects by the\nsecond half of 2026. The data may also be unblinded after the initial 45 subjects and, as currently planned, the data will be unblinded after approximately 90 subjects complete their\nefficacy analyses. We believe that we will have the data for approximately the first 90 subjects by the second half of 2026. The trial is designed to enable the review of interim\nanalyses for safety and efficacy upon reaching these enrollment milestones.\nWe held a conference call on August 6, 2024, along with Dr. Michael Andreeff, a member of our Science Advisory Board, to discuss the results of our most recent meeting\nwith the FDA and the plans for the MIRACLE trial. That meeting, the MIRACLE trial and the current data from the MB-106 trial are discussed further below.\nOn August 1, 2024, we announced the discussion in and our resulting plans from our End of Phase 1B/2 (EOP1B/2) meeting held in late June with the FDA supporting the\nadvancement of Annamycin in combination with Cytarabine (AnnAraC to a Phase 3 pivotal trial for the treatment of AML patients who are refractory to or relapsed after induction\ntherapy (R/R AML). This Phase 3 \"MIRACLE” trial will be a global study, including sites in the US and consistent with the FDA’s recommendations, the adaptive Phase 3 trial is\nexpected to rely solely on CR (complete remission) at day 35 (+/- 14 days) as the primary endpoint versus the control arm. We plan to utilize a double-blind, placebo-controlled\ndesign, where the control arm is high dose cytarabine (HiDAC) plus placebo. The MIRACLE trial will focus on AnnAraC as a 2nd line treatment for R/R AML subjects, with a\nsubsequent trial to be focused on AnnAraC as a 3rd line treatment for R/R AML.\nBased on our discussions with the FDA, we intend to amend our current investigational new drug application or IND to allow dosing above the lifetime maximum\nallowable dose (LTMAD) for currently prescribed anthracyclines in this trial in the US. The MIRACLE study, subject to appropriate future filings with and potential additional\nfeedback from the FDA, their foreign equivalents and/or institutional review boards (IRBs), is expected to initially utilize an adaptive design whereby the first 90 subjects will be\nrandomized to receive HiDAC combined with either placebo, 190 mg/m2 of Annamycin, or 230 mg/m2 of Annamycin with such doses recommended by the FDA based on their\nreview of our safety and efficacy data. At that point, the trial data will be unblinded to select the optimum dose for Annamycin. For the second half of the trial, approximately 240\nsubjects will be randomized to receive either HiDAC plus placebo or HiDAC plus the optimum dose of Annamycin.

Median Durability of all\nCRc's is ~8 months and climbing.\nOn May 7, 2024, our management held a Key Opinion Leader conference call with Dr. Martin Tallman and Dr. Michael Andreeff. Management made a presentation of the\ndata above and discussion ensued with Drs Tallman and Andreeff on the significance of this data. Both Drs. Tallman and Andreeff are members of our Science Advisory Board.\nThe call included a discussion of the results to date for MB-106. We believe that the Phase 1B/2 trial has been successful in establishing safety and efficacy of\nAnnamycin in combination with Cytarabine (AnnAraC) for the treatment of AML, and in providing sufficient data to support a Phase 3 registration-directed clinical trial (MB-108)\nto further provide data for efficacy which we intend to use to support an eventual application for New Drug Approval (NDA).\nPreliminary Safety, Efficacy and Durability Data\nThe preliminary data for MB-106 demonstrate a CR rate of 36% and a CRc rate of 41% for all subjects (N=22), regardless of the number of prior treatments, up to 6 prior\ntreatments. Segmenting the MB-106 subject population for 2nd line subjects (N=10) yields a CR rate of 50% and CRc rate of 60%. Further segmenting for 2nd and 3rd line subjects\n(N=14) yields a CR rate of 43% and a CRc rate of 50%. We believe the results demonstrated by AnnAraC in 2nd line subjects substantially exceeds the performance reported by any\ndrug currently approved for use in 2nd line AML.\nMedian durability of remission (DoR) for the 9 CRcs is approximately 8 months and developing. The DoR is being measured from the initiation of treatment to relapse or\ndeath.\nCardiovascular safety of Annamycin is thoroughly monitored as independent assessments are made by an independent expert cardio-oncologist from Cleveland Clinic.\nAs of April 1, 2024, data from 84 subjects across five trials (AML & STS, internal and externally funded trials) have been reviewed. Of note, most of these subjects have received\ngreater than the lifetime cumulative anthracycline dose above 550 mg/m2 associated with increased risk of cardiomyopathy. Some subjects have received four times this amount\nfollowing Annamycin administration(s). No signal of cardiotoxicity has been identified.\nAnnamycin as Monotherapy for the Treatment of Soft Tissue Sarcoma Lung Metastases\nAdditionally, we expect to release in the near future the topline data from the MB-107 trial with Annamycin for the monotherapy treatment of soft tissue sarcoma lung\nmetastases. This Phase 1B/2 clinical trial in the US is for subjects with STS lung metastases after first-line therapy for their disease. The trial began in the first half of 2021. The\nPhase 1B was concluded in July 2022. On September 21, 2023, we announced the completion of enrollment in the Phase 2 portion of our U.S. Phase 1B/2 clinical trial evaluating\nAnnamycin as monotherapy for the treatment of soft tissue sarcoma lung metastases. Subjects who had stable disease at the time of study discontinuation will continue to be\nfollowed for progression free response and overall survival. The study database is locked and the clinical study report is being written and should be completed in early 2025 and\nwill be released in detail at that time. The total number of intent to treat subjects in the trial is 36.\n15\nTable of Contents\n(cid:0)) (cid:0)*(cid:0)(cid:15) (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)(cid:13) (cid:0)(cid:18) (cid:0)(cid:23)(cid:0)(cid:7) (cid:0)(cid:5) (cid:0)(cid:23)(cid:0)(cid:9) (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0) (cid:0)(cid:10) (cid:0)(cid:8) (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)(cid:4) (cid:0)(cid:5) (cid:0)(cid:5) (cid:0)(cid:18) (cid:0)(cid:22) (cid:0)(cid:24) (cid:0)(cid:19) (cid:0)(cid:25)(cid:0)(cid:5) (cid:0)(cid:3)\nOn April 9, 2024, the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) issued U.S. Patent number 11,951,118 titled, \"Preparation of Preliposomal Annamycin\nLyophilizate” (the ‘118 patent’) to Moleculin and The University of Texas System Board of Regents.

Treatment with Annamycin resulted in statistically significant inhibition of tumor\ngrowth and extension of survival in orthotopic lung cancer models and continues to be 100% non-cardiotoxic. The poster titled \"Annamycin: Opening New Doors for\nOrganotropic Targeting of Primary and Metastatic Lung Cancer,” authored by Waldemar Priebe, PhD (Founder, Founding Scientist, and Chair of Scientific Advisory Board for\nMoleculin) and coworkers was presented at the IASLC 2024 World Conference on Lung Cancer. The presented poster outlined results from the efficacy assessment studies of\nAnnamycin, Moleculin’s next-generation anthracycline in orthotopic models of lung cancer and sarcoma lung metastasis models in comparison with doxorubicin (a commonly\nprescribed anthracycline.\nKey Highlights of the Data Presented:\n• Annamycin demonstrated high uptake and retention in lung parenchyma of mice and rats.\n• The therapeutic effects of doxorubicin (DOX) are diminished due to low lung DOX uptake as demonstrated in the tested in vivo models. In contrast, Annamycin exhibits\nconsistent efficacy in vivo in orthotopic and experimental lung metastatic models of sarcoma, breast, and colon cancer. This correlated with high Annamycin concentration\nin lungs, which exceeded DOX levels by 10- to 30-fold.\n• Preclinical tests clearly demonstrate a better cardiac safety profile of Annamycin when compared to DOX and no cardiotoxicity of Annamycin in the in vivo models. No\ncardiotoxicity of Annamycin has been noted in ongoing clinical studies.\n• The observed organotropic properties of Annamycin, its efficacy in vivo, and its promising safety profile warrant further translational studies to evaluate Annamycin in\npatients with primary or metastatic lung cancers, as a single agent and in combination with currently used therapeutics.\n(cid:0)(cid:4) (cid:0)(cid:4) (cid:0)(cid:27) (cid:0)(cid:17) (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)(cid:13) (cid:0)(cid:8) (cid:0)(cid:7) (cid:0)(cid:9) (cid:0)(cid:7) (cid:0)(cid:5) (cid:0)(cid:23)(cid:0)(cid:18) (cid:0)(cid:23)(cid:0)(cid:25)(cid:0)(cid:10) (cid:0)(cid:5) (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)(cid:10) (cid:0) (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)(cid:2) (cid:0)(cid:18) (cid:0)(cid:23)(cid:0)(cid:18) (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)(cid:2) (cid:0)(cid:7) (cid:0)(cid:22) (cid:0)(cid:10) (cid:0)(cid:5) (cid:0)(cid:9) (cid:0)(cid:23)(cid:0)(cid:8) (cid:0)(cid:18) (cid:0)(cid:23)(cid:0)(cid:25)(cid:0)(cid:5) (cid:0)(cid:21) (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)(cid:12) (cid:0)(cid:25)(cid:0)(cid:21) (cid:0)(cid:20) (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)(cid:4) (cid:0)(cid:5) (cid:0)(cid:23)(cid:0)(cid:25)(cid:0)(cid:11)(cid:0)(cid:27) (cid:0)(cid:18) (cid:0)(cid:5) (cid:0)(cid:19) (cid:0)(cid:7) (cid:0)(cid:8) (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)(cid:4) (cid:0)(cid:19) (cid:0)(cid:23)(cid:0)(cid:25)(cid:0)0 (cid:0)(cid:25)(cid:0)(cid:23)(cid:0)(cid:24) (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)(cid:10) (cid:0) (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)(cid:4) (cid:0)(cid:5) (cid:0)(cid:5) (cid:0)(cid:18) (cid:0)(cid:22) (cid:0)(cid:24) (cid:0)(cid:19) (cid:0)(cid:25)(cid:0)(cid:5) (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)(cid:18) (cid:0)(cid:5) (cid:0)(cid:6) (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)1 (cid:0)(cid:10) (cid:0)(cid:5) (cid:0)(cid:11)(cid:0)(cid:27) (cid:0)(cid:18) (cid:0)(cid:8) (cid:0)(cid:6) (cid:0)(cid:25)(cid:0)(cid:10) (cid:0)(cid:23)(cid:0)(cid:10) (cid:0)2 (cid:0)(cid:25)(cid:0)(cid:19) (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)(cid:13) (cid:0)(cid:8) (cid:0)(cid:10) (cid:0)(cid:16) (cid:0)(cid:7) (cid:0)(cid:8) (cid:0)(cid:23)(cid:0)(cid:25)(cid:0)(cid:7) (cid:0)(cid:9)\nPreclinical data regarding the Company’s next-generation anthracycline, Annamycin, was presented at the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) Annual\nMeeting, which took place April 5-10, 2024 in San Diego, CA.

Pursuant to Nasdaq Listing Rule\n5635(d), the exercise of the Series A warrants and Series B warrants were subject to shareholder approval, which was received.\nThe gross proceeds from the offering, before deducting the placement agent’s fees and other offering expenses payable by us, were approximately $5.5 million and we\nwould receive up to an additional approximately $11.0 million in gross proceeds if the warrants are fully exercised for cash. We are using the net proceeds from this offering to\nadvance Annamycin and our other two drug portfolios through clinical development, advance the remainder of our existing portfolio through preclinical studies and into INDs or\ntheir equivalent, sponsor research at MD Anderson and HPI, and for working capital.\n17\nTable of Contents\nResults of Operations\nThe following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, data derived from our statement of operations (table in thousands) and such changes in the periods are discussed\nbelow in approximate amounts:\nMoleculin Biotech, Inc.\nCondensed Consolidated Statements of Operations\n(Unaudited)\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nRevenues $ — $ — $ — $ —\nOperating expenses:\nResearch and development 4,932 3,280 13,274 12,855\nGeneral and administrative 2,172 2,635 6,629 7,765\nDepreciation and amortization 31 32 95 92\nTotal operating expenses 7,135 5,947 19,998 20,712\nLoss from operations (7,135) (5,947) (19,998) (20,712)\nOther income (loss):\n(Loss) gain from change in fair value of warrant liability (1,728) 1 1,423 76\nTransaction costs allocated to warrant liabilities (993) — (993) —\nLoss on issuance of warrant liabilities (847) — (847) —\nOther income, net 9 13 31 30\nInterest income, net 102 324 503 1,106\nNet loss $ (10,592) $ (5,609) $ (19,881) $ (19,500)\n(cid:0)(cid:30) (cid:0)(cid:20) (cid:0)(cid:8) (cid:0)(cid:7) (cid:0)(cid:7) (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)(cid:1) (cid:0)(cid:10) (cid:0)(cid:5) (cid:0)(cid:23)(cid:0)(cid:20) (cid:0)(cid:9) (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)(cid:29) (cid:0)(cid:5) (cid:0)(cid:6) (cid:0)(cid:7) (cid:0)(cid:6) (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)(cid:15) (cid:0)(cid:7) (cid:0)(cid:16) (cid:0)(cid:23)(cid:0)(cid:7) (cid:0)(cid:22) (cid:0)!

Research and development (R&D) expense was $4.9 million and $3.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023,\nrespectively. The increase of $1.6 million is mainly related to costs incurred for clinical trials (clinical research organization and drug production) and sponsored research costs.\nGeneral and Administrative Expense. General and administrative expense was $2.2 million and $2.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023,\nrespectively. The decrease of $0.4 million is mainly related to a decrease in regulatory and legal fees.\n(Loss) Gain from Change in Fair Value of Warrant Liability. We recorded a net loss of $1.7 million in the third quarter of 2024 as compared to a net gain of $0.001 million\nin the third quarter of 2023, for the change in fair value on revaluation of our warrant liability associated with our warrants issued in conjunction with certain of our previous stock\nofferings. We are required to revalue our liability-classified warrants at the time of each warrant exercise, if applicable, and at the end of each reporting period and reflect in the\nstatement of operations a gain or loss from the change in fair value of the warrant in the period in which the change occurred. We calculated the fair value of the warrants\noutstanding using the Black-Scholes model. A gain results principally from a decline in our share price during the period and a loss results principally from an increase in our share\nprice.\nTransaction costs allocated to warrant liabilities and Loss on issuance of warrant liabilities. Proceeds of offerings are allocated between common shares and warrants\nfirst by allocating to the warrants classified as a liability based on their fair value and then allocating the residual to the equity instruments, which would include pre-funded\nwarrants. As the fair value of the liability classified warrants in the August 2024 offering exceeded the total proceeds, no consideration was allocated to the Common Shares or Pre-\nFunded Warrants. The full proceeds of the August 2024 offering were recorded to warrant liabilities, with an initial liability of $6.1 million, and a loss on initial recognition of\n$0.8 million. The loss on modification of certain warrants of $0.4 million was also recorded as a loss on issuance of warrant liabilities in the three months ended September 30, 2024.\nTransaction costs related to the offering were correspondingly fully allocated to warrant liabilities, and $1.0 million in related transaction costs were expensed during the three and\nnine months ended September 30, 2024.\nInterest income, net. Interest income, net decreased by approximately $0.2 million for the comparable quarterly periods due to a decreasing cash balance and decreasing\ninterest rates during the past year.\n(cid:0)1 (cid:0)(cid:25)(cid:0)(cid:5) (cid:0)(cid:7) (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)(cid:1) (cid:0)(cid:10) (cid:0)(cid:5) (cid:0)(cid:23)(cid:0)(cid:20) (cid:0)(cid:9) (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)(cid:29) (cid:0)(cid:5) (cid:0)(cid:6) (cid:0)(cid:7) (cid:0)(cid:6) (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)(cid:15) (cid:0)(cid:7) (cid:0)(cid:16) (cid:0)(cid:23)(cid:0)(cid:7) (cid:0)(cid:22) (cid:0)!

Research and development (R&D) expense was $13.3 million and $12.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and\n2023, respectively. The increase of $0.4 million is mainly related to costs incurred for clinical trials (clinical research organization and drug production) and sponsored research\ncosts. These increases were offset by a $1.5 million decrease mainly related to the WPD sublicense termination in 2023, which enabled the reacquisition of our intellectual property\nrights in certain territories including parts of the European Union.\nGeneral and Administrative Expense. General and administrative expense was $6.6 million and $7.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023,\nrespectively. The decrease of $1.2 million is mainly related to a decrease in regulatory and legal fees.\nGain from Change in Fair Value of Warrant Liability. We recorded a net gain of $1.4 million in the nine months ended 2024 as compared to a net gain of $0.1 million in\nthe nine months ended 2023, for the change in fair value on revaluation of our warrant liability associated with our warrants issued in conjunction with certain of our previous stock\nofferings. We are required to revalue our liability-classified warrants at the time of each warrant exercise, if applicable, and at the end of each reporting period and reflect in the\nstatement of operations a gain or loss from the change in fair value of the warrant in the period in which the change occurred. We calculated the fair value of the warrants\noutstanding using the Black-Scholes model. A gain results principally from a decline in our share price during the period and a loss results principally from an increase in our share\nprice.\n18\nTable of Contents\nTransaction costs allocated to warrant liabilities and Loss on issuance of warrant liabilities. Proceeds of offerings are allocated between common shares and warrants\nfirst by allocating to the warrants classified as a liability based on their fair value and then allocating the residual to the equity instruments, which would include pre-funded\nwarrants.

Interest income, net decreased by approximately $0.6 million for the comparable quarterly periods due to a decreasing cash balance and decreasing\ninterest rates during the past year.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe following table sets forth our primary sources and uses of cash for the period indicated (table in thousands):\nNine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023\nNet cash used in operating activities $ (18,779) $ (18,694)\nNet cash used in investing activities (13) (43)\nNet cash provided by financing activities 4,634 186\nEffect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents 13 (15)\nNet decrease in cash and cash equivalents $ (14,145) $ (18,566)\nAs of September 30, 2024, there was $0.4 million of cash on hand in a bank account in Australia and we know of no related limitations impacting our liquidity in Australia.\nCash used in operating activities\nCash used in operations was $18.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. This $0.1 million increase over the prior year period of $18.7 million was primarily\ndue to the timing of costs incurred and associated payments for drug production and clinical trial expenses.\nCash provided by financing activities\nOn August 19, 2024, we announced the closing of our previously announced public offering of 283,000 shares of common stock and 2,183,368 pre-funded warrants to\npurchase shares of common stock, Series A warrants to purchase up to 2,466,368 shares of common stock and Series B warrants to purchase up to 2,466,368 shares of common\nstock, at a combined public offering price of $2.23 per share (or per pre-funded warrant in lieu thereof) and accompanying warrants. We received gross proceeds of $5.5 million,\nbefore deducting the placement agent's fees and other offering expenses.\nWe believe that our cash on hand and cash equivalents as of September 30, 2024, is sufficient to fund our planned operations into the first quarter of 2025. This takes into\naccount cash outlays for preparations for clinical trials beyond the current active trials. The continuation of our Company as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to\nobtain necessary financing to continue operations and the attainment of profitable operations. We must seek additional funding of approximately $15 million to support MIRACLE\nand our operations into the third quarter of 2025 through a combination of equity offerings, debt financings, government or other third-party funding, commercialization, marketing\nand distribution arrangements, other collaborations, strategic alliances and licensing arrangements and delay planned cash outlays or a combination thereof to continue our\noperations in the near term. We cannot provide assurance that such events or a combination thereof can be achieved.\nIn March 2022, we received a subpoena from the SEC requesting information and documents, including materials related to certain individuals (none of which are our\nofficers or directors) and entities, and materials related to the development of and statements regarding our drug candidate for the treatment of COVID-19. We have received, and\nexpect to continue to receive, periodic further requests from the SEC staff with respect to this matter. We are not aware of the specific nature of the underlying investigation by the\nSEC, and to the extent that this investigation relates to prior public disclosures that we have made, we believe in the accuracy and adequacy of such prior disclosures. The\ncorrespondence from the SEC transmitting the subpoena to us states that the SEC is trying to determine whether there have been any violations of federal securities laws, but that\nits investigation does not mean that the SEC has concluded that anyone has violated the law or that the SEC has a negative opinion of any person, entity, or security. We cannot\npredict when this matter will be resolved or what, if any, action the SEC may take following the conclusion of the investigation. We expensed approximate ly $0.1 million and $0.4\nmillion in related general and administrative fees and expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , respectively, and approximate ly $0.2 million and $1.4\nmillion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , respectively.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates\nThere have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies and use of estimates from those disclosed in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nFor a discussion of our critical accounting policies and use of estimates, refer to Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations –\nCritical Accounting Policies and Significant Estimates in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.\n19\nTable of Contents\nITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKS\nNot applicable as we are a smaller reporting company.\nITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nWe maintain disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure that material information required to be disclosed in our filings under the Securities Exchange Act of\n1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms and that material information is accumulated and\ncommunicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer (CEO), who is our principal executive officer, and Chief Financial Officer (CFO), who is our principal\nfinancial and accounting officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. Our CEO and CFO have evaluated these disclosure controls and\nprocedures as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report on Form 10-Q and have determined that such disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of\nSeptember 30, 2024.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThere was no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15-d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the three months\nended September 30, 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nPART II – OTHER INFORMATION\nITEM 1.

Developing pharmaceutical products, including conducting preclinical\nstudies and clinical trials, is expensive. We estimate supporting of MIRACLE and our operations into the third quarter of 2025 will require additional funds beyond our current cash\nas of September 30, 2024, of approximately $15 million. As such, based on our current cash, in order to fund our operations, including MIRACLE, we will need to raise significant\nfinancing for which we have no commitments. If the FDA or its EU equivalent requires that we perform additional nonclinical studies or clinical trials, our expenses would further\nincrease beyond what we currently expect and the anticipated timing of any potential approval of Annamycin would likely be delayed. Further, there can be no assurance that the\ncosts we will need to incur to obtain regulatory approval of Annamycin will not increase.\n(cid:0)(cid:17) (cid:0)(cid:7) (cid:0)(cid:19) (cid:0)(cid:7) (cid:0)(cid:5) (cid:0)(cid:23)(cid:0)(cid:31)(cid:0)(cid:24) (cid:0)(cid:3) (cid:0)(cid:7) (cid:0)(cid:5) (cid:0)(cid:18) (cid:0)(cid:19) (cid:0)(cid:23)(cid:0)(cid:7) (cid:0)(cid:6) (cid:0)(cid:3) (cid:0)(cid:31)(cid:0)(cid:7) (cid:0)(cid:21) (cid:0)(cid:25)(cid:0)(cid:9) (cid:0)(cid:31)(cid:0)(cid:18) (cid:0)(cid:23)(cid:0)(cid:25)(cid:0)(cid:10) (cid:0)(cid:5) (cid:0)5(cid:0)(cid:3) (cid:0) (cid:0)+ (cid:0)(cid:23)(cid:0)+ (cid:0)(cid:8) (cid:0)(cid:7) (cid:0)(cid:3) (cid:0)(cid:31)(cid:0)(cid:7) (cid:0)(cid:21) (cid:0)(cid:25)(cid:0)(cid:9) (cid:0)(cid:31)(cid:0)(cid:18) (cid:0)(cid:23)(cid:0)(cid:25)(cid:0)(cid:10) (cid:0)(cid:5) (cid:0)(cid:3) (cid:0)(cid:18) (cid:0)(cid:5) (cid:0)(cid:6) (cid:0)(cid:3) (cid:0)(cid:20) (cid:0)(cid:7) (cid:0)(cid:18) (cid:0)(cid:31)(cid:0)(cid:23)(cid:0)(cid:20) (cid:0)(cid:19) (cid:0)(cid:18) (cid:0)(cid:8) (cid:0)(cid:7) (cid:0)(cid:3) (cid:0)(cid:8) (cid:0)(cid:7) (cid:0) (cid:0)(cid:10) (cid:0)(cid:8) (cid:0)(cid:22) (cid:0)(cid:3) (cid:0)(cid:22) (cid:0)(cid:7) (cid:0)(cid:18) (cid:0)(cid:9) (cid:0)+ (cid:0)(cid:8) (cid:0)(cid:7) (cid:0)(cid:9) (cid:0)(cid:3) (cid:0)(cid:22) (cid:0)(cid:18) (cid:0)(cid:24) (cid:0)(cid:3) (cid:0)(cid:25)(cid:0)(cid:5) (cid:0)(cid:19) (cid:0)(cid:8) (cid:0)(cid:7) (cid:0)(cid:18) (cid:0)(cid:9) (cid:0)(cid:7) (cid:0)(cid:3) (cid:0)(cid:23)(cid:0)(cid:20) (cid:0)(cid:7) (cid:0)(cid:3) (cid:0)(cid:6) (cid:0)(cid:25)(cid:0) (cid:0) (cid:0)(cid:25)(cid:0)(cid:19) (cid:0)+ (cid:0)(cid:31)(cid:0)(cid:23)(cid:0)(cid:24) (cid:0)(cid:3) (cid:0)(cid:18) (cid:0)(cid:5) (cid:0)(cid:6) (cid:0)(cid:3) (cid:0)(cid:19) (cid:0)(cid:10) (cid:0)(cid:9) (cid:0)(cid:23)(cid:0)(cid:3) (cid:0) (cid:0)(cid:10) (cid:0)(cid:8) (cid:0)(cid:3) (cid:0)+ (cid:0)(cid:9) (cid:0)(cid:3) (cid:0)(cid:23)(cid:0)(cid:10) (cid:0)(cid:3) (cid:0)(cid:10) (cid:0)!

In response to Biden’s executive order, on September 9, 2021, HHS released a Comprehensive Plan for Addressing High Drug Prices that outlines principles\nfor drug pricing reform and sets out a variety of potential legislative policies that Congress could pursue as well as potential administrative actions HHS can take to advance these\nprinciples. In addition, the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), among other things, (1) directs HHS to negotiate the price of certain high-cost, single-source drugs and biologics\ncovered under Medicare and (2) imposes rebates under Medicare Part B and Medicare Part D to penalize price increases that outpace inflation. The IRA permits HHS to implement\nmany of these provisions through guidance, as opposed to regulation, for the initial years. These provisions will take effect progressively starting in fiscal year 2023, although the\nMedicare drug price negotiation program is currently subject to legal challenges. HHS has and will continue to issue and update guidance as these programs are implemented. It is\ncurrently unclear how the IRA will be implemented but is likely to have a significant impact on the pharmaceutical industry. Under the IRA, certain categories of drugs are excluded\nfrom price negotiations, including drugs that receive orphan drug designation as the only FDA-approved indication. While we have obtained orphan drug designation for\nAnnamycin, if we seek additional indications, or fail to maintain our orphan drug status, we may become subject to the price negotiation process. This could reduce the ultimate\nprice that we receive for Annamycin, which could negatively affect our business, results of operations, financial conditions, and prospects. Further, in response to the Biden\nadministration’s October 2022 executive order, on February 14, 2023, HHS released a report outlining three new models for testing by the Center for Medicare and Medicaid\nInnovation which will be evaluated on their ability to lower the cost of drugs, promote accessibility, and improve quality of care. It is unclear whether the models will be utilized in\nany health reform measures in the future.\n20\nTable of Contents\nAt the state level, individual states in the United States have also increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and\nbiological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency\nmeasures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. Legally mandated price controls on payment amounts by third-party\npayors or other restrictions could harm our business, results of operations, financial condition, and prospects. In addition, regional healthcare authorities and individual hospitals\nare increasingly using bidding procedures to determine what pharmaceutical products and which suppliers will be included in their prescription drug and other healthcare\nprograms.\nIn June 2024, the U.S. Supreme Court reversed its longstanding approach under the Chevron doctrine, which provided for judicial deference to regulatory agencies,\nincluding the FDA. As a result of this decision, we cannot be sure whether there will be increased challenges to existing agency regulations or how lower courts will apply the\ndecision in the context of other regulatory schemes without more specific guidance from the U.S. Supreme Court. For example, this decision may result in more companies bringing\nlawsuits against the FDA to challenge longstanding decisions and policies of the FDA, which could undermine the FDA’s authority, lead to uncertainties in the industry, and\ndisrupt the FDA’s normal operations, which could impact the timely review of any regulatory filings or applications we submit to the FDA.\nWe cannot predict the likelihood, nature, or extent of health reform initiatives that may arise from future legislation or administrative action. We expect that the Affordable\nCare Act and other healthcare reform measures, including those that may be adopted in the future may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding,\nmore rigorous coverage criteria, new payment methodologies and additional downward pressure on the price that we receive for any approved product. Any reduction in\nreimbursement from Medicare or other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from third-party payors. The implementation of cost containment\nmeasures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability or commercialize Annamycin, if approved.\nITEM 2.

This includes data from preclinical in vitro studies recently accepted for online publication at the upcoming American Society of Hematology\n(\"ASH”) Annual Meeting, and correlates with efficacy demonstrated by recent preliminary clinical data in subjects who were relapsed from or refractory to first line Venetoclax\nregimens and were then treated with Annamycin in combination with Ara-C (\"AnnAraC”).\nJorge Cortes, MD, Director of the Georgia Cancer Center at Augusta University and a member of the Company’s Scientific Advisory Board, commented, \"Although Venetoclax has\nbeen an important improvement in first line therapy for AML patients who are unfit for intensive chemotherapy, the rate of relapse is high and overall survival post relapse is just a\nfew months. This turns out to be a large percentage of AML patients in total and we clearly need a better treatment option.”\nMichael Andreeff, MD, PhD, Professor of Medicine, Department of Leukemia, Division of Cancer Medicine, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center and a member of\nthe Company’s Scientific Advisory Board, added, \"Many patients get Ven-Aza, not because they are ‘unfit’ but because of the high initial response rates. When they relapse,\nhowever, our options are very limited. Annamycin combined with Ara-C could significantly advance the standard of care and provide better outcomes for these high-risk patients. I\nam excited to be a part of the next step in the development of this important asset.”\nA prior publication, Outcomes of relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia after frontline hypomethylating agent and venetoclax regimens1, reported that the CR/CRi2 rate\nfor salvage therapy using available standard of care in AML subjects who relapsed from or were refractory to Venetoclax regimens was 12.5% (n=24, 4% CR). The new preliminary\nclinical findings announced today in the MB-106 clinical trial indicate that relapsed or refractory (\"R/R”) AML subjects previously treated with Venetoclax regimens achieved a\n60% CR/CRi rate (n=5, 40% CR), more than 4 times the rate that would be expected based on the above referenced paper. As previously disclosed in MB-106, there was an overall\nCR/CRi rate of 60% (50% CR) in 2nd line subjects (n=10) and 41% (36% CR) in all subjects, 1st-7th line (n=22).\nAn abstract titled, \"Annamycin, a non-cardiotoxic anthracycline, demonstrates unique organotropism and activity against Ara-C and Venetoclax resistant AML,” supporting\nthe clinical activity of Annamycin was accepted for online publication at the ASH Annual Meeting being held December 7-10, 2024, in San Diego, CA. The abstract will be\npublished in a supplemental issue of Blood, expected in late November, and will become part of the permanent ASH and Blood abstracts archive following the conclusion of the\nAnnual Meeting.\nAdditionally, new preliminary data from the Company’s Phase 1B/2 clinical trial evaluating AnnAraC for the treatment of subjects with AML as both first line therapy and for\nsubjects who were refractory to or relapsed after induction therapy (MB-106) demonstrated median overall survival (\"OS”) of 9.1 months for subjects with a wide range of (0-6)\nprior lines of therapy (n=22) and 11.6 months (n=10) for subjects with 1 prior line of therapy (second line therapy).\n\"Moleculin is focusing on development of Annamycin to address the significant unmet need in R/R AML. The growing body of preliminary data continue to bolster our\nconfidence in the safety and efficacy of Annamycin, and its potential to provide patients and physicians with a promising new treatment option in AML,” commented Walter\nKlemp, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Moleculin. \"We believe the latest preliminary OS data we are seeing in our MB-106 trial can now be considered exceptional and we\nlook forward to the initiation of our pivotal registration study, especially now that our recent protocol amendment allows for disclosing unblinded data for the first 45 subjects,\nwhich we expect within the next 12 months.”\nThe Company is advancing the development of Annamycin in a Phase 3 pivotal trial evaluating AnnAraC for the treatment of AML patients who are refractory to or relapsed after\ninduction therapy (R/R AML) (MB-108). This Phase 3 \"MIRACLE” trial (derived from Moleculin R/R AML AnnAraC Clinical Evaluation) will be a global trial, including sites in the\nUS. The Company remains on track to initiate patient treatment in the first quarter of 2025.\n1 A. Maiti, C. Rausch, J.

This Phase 3 \"MIRACLE” trial\n(derived from Moleculin R/R AML AnnAraC Clinical Evaluation) will be a global trial, including sites in the US. Additionally, the Company released a Virtual Investor \"What This\nMeans” segment to discuss the amended protocol. Access the segment here.\n\"Our team has been thoughtful and strategic with the design of the MIRACLE trial, which may allow for possible accelerated approval of Annamycin in combination with\ncytarabine for the treatment of relapsed or refractory AML. This amended protocol enables us to share definitive data earlier, which helps to partially de-risk financing the trial and\npotentially accelerates the timeline for strategic partnering. We believe that the unblinding of data at 45 subjects will enable us to begin assessing all three arms of the study and\nprovide us with a clear path forward in understanding the potential of Annamycin for AML patients. This change now puts us potentially less than 12 months away from definitive\nunblinded data that could be a strong indicator of our likelihood of approval, and the kind of data that is likely to drive advanced partnering discussions,” commented Walter\nKlemp, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Moleculin.\nThe MIRACLE study, subject to appropriate future filings with and potential additional feedback from the FDA and their foreign equivalents, is expected to initially utilize an\nadaptive design whereby the first 75 to 90 subjects will be randomized in Part A of the trial to receive high dose cytarabine (HiDAC) combined with either placebo, 190 mg/m2 of\nAnnamycin, or 230 mg/m2 of Annamycin, such doses were specifically recommended by the FDA in the Company’s end of Phase 1B/2 meeting. The amended protocol will allow\nfor the unblinding of preliminary primary efficacy data (CR) and safety/tolerability of the three arms at 45 subjects. This early unblinding will yield 30 subjects with Annamycin\n(190mg/m2 and 230/m2) and HiDAC and 15 subjects with just HiDAC. The Company expects to reach 45 subjects in the second half of 2025, in addition to the planned unblinding\nexpected in 2026 of the next 30-45 subjects.\nFor Part B of the trial, approximately 244 additional subjects will be randomized to receive either HiDAC plus placebo or HiDAC plus the optimum dose of Annamycin. The\nselection of the optimum dose will be based on the overall balance of safety, pharmacokinetics and efficacy, consistent with the FDA’s new Project Optimus initiative. This\nincrease from 240 to 244 subjects represents the statistical \"cost” of the additional unblinding.\nThe amended protocol is currently being reviewed by the Institutional Review Board (IRB). Once approved, the amended protocol will be filed with the amendment for the\nCompany’s Initial New Drug (IND) application in the US with the FDA.\nAnnamycin currently has Fast Track Status and Orphan Drug Designation from the FDA for the treatment of relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia, in addition to Orphan\nDrug Designation for the treatment of soft tissue sarcoma.
