          "content": "The Sonos Story\nAugust 2024 Investor Presentation\nForward Looking Statements\nThis presentation contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. These forward-looking statements include statements regarding our long-term outlook; our long-term focus, financial, growth, and\nbusiness strategies and opportunities; growth metrics and targets; our ability to manage operating expenses; our business model; product mix, new products, product categories and services; profitability and gross margins;\nchanging component costs and related inventory balances; market growth and our market share; our total addressable market; our incremental revenue opportunity; the timing of new products and the impact of new products on\nrevenue; and other factors affecting variability in our financial results.\nThese forward-looking statements are only predictions and may differ materially from actual results due to a variety of factors, including, but not limited to: our ability to accurately forecast product demand and effectively forecast\nand manage owned and channel inventory levels; our ability to introduce software updates to our new app on a timely basis and otherwise deliver on our action plan to address issues caused by our new app and our customer\ncommitments; our ability to maintain, enhance, and protect our brand image; the impact of global economic, market, and political events, continued inflationary pressures, high interest rates and, in certain markets, foreign\ncurrency exchange rate fluctuations; changes in consumer income and overall consumer spending as a result of economic or political uncertainty or conditions; changes in consumer spending patterns; our ability to successfully\nintroduce new products and services and maintain or expand the success of our existing products; the success of our efforts to expand our direct-to-consumer channel; the success of our financial, growth, and business\nstrategies; our ability to compete in the market and maintain or expand market share; our ability to meet product demand and manage any product availability delays; supply chain challenges, including shipping and logistics\nchallenges and component supply-related challenges; our ability to protect our brand and intellectual property; and the other risk factors set forth under the caption “Risk Factors” in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the\nquarter ended June 29, 2024, and our other filings filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), copies of which are available free of charge at the SEC’s website, www.sec.gov, or upon request from our\ninvestor relations department.\nAll forward-looking statements herein reflect our opinions only as of the date of this letter, and we undertake no obligation, and expressly disclaim any obligation, to update forward-looking statements herein in light of new\ninformation or future events, except to the extent required by law.\nNon-GAAP Measures\nWe have provided in this presentation financial information that has not been prepared in accordance with US generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). We use these non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate our\noperating performance and trends and make planning decisions. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures help identify underlying trends in our business that could otherwise be masked by the effect of the expenses\nand other items that we exclude in these non-GAAP financial measures. Accordingly, we believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our\noperating results, enhancing the overall understanding of our past performance and future prospects, and allowing for greater transparency with respect to a key financial metric used by our management in its financial and\noperational decision-making. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation of, or as an alternative to, measures prepared in accordance with US GAAP.\nWe define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) adjusted to exclude the impact of depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation expense, interest income, interest expense, other income, income taxes, restructuring\nand abandonment costs, legal and transactional related fees and other items that we do not consider representative of our underlying operating performance. We define Adjusted EBITDA margin as Adjusted EBITDA divided by\nrevenue. We define free cash flow as net cash from operations less purchases of property and equipment. We define non-GAAP gross margin as GAAP gross margin, excluding stock-based compensation and amortization of\nintangible assets. We define Adjusted Operating Expenses as operating expenses less stock-based compensation expense, legal and transaction related costs, amortization of intangibles, and restructuring and abandonment\ncosts. We calculate constant currency growth percentages by translating our current period financial results using the prior period average currency exchange rates and comparing these amounts to our prior period reported\nresults. We calculate non-GAAP net income (loss) excluding stock-based compensation, legal and transaction related fees, amortization of intangibles and restructuring and abandonment costs as net income (loss) less\nstock-based compensation, legal and transaction related fees, amortization of intangibles and restructuring and abandonment costs. We calculate non-GAAP diluted earnings (loss) per share excluding stock-based\ncompensation, legal and transaction related fees, amortization of intangibles and restructuring and abandonment costs as net income (loss) less stock-based compensation, legal and transaction related fees, amortization of\nintangibles and restructuring and abandonment costs divided by our number of shares at fiscal year end.\nWe do not provide a reconciliation of forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures to their comparable GAAP financial measures because we cannot do so without unreasonable effort due to unavailability of information needed\nto calculate reconciling items and due to the variability, complexity and limited visibility of the adjusting items that would be excluded from the non-GAAP financial measures in future periods. When planning, forecasting, and\nanalyzing future periods, we do so primarily on a non-GAAP basis without preparing a GAAP analysis as that would require estimates for certain items such as stock-based compensation, which is inherently difficult to predict\nwith reasonable accuracy. Stock-based compensation expense is difficult to estimate because it depends on our future hiring and retention needs, as well as the future fair market value of our common stock, all of which are\ndifficult to predict and subject to constant change. In addition, for purposes of setting annual guidance, it would be difficult to quantify stock-based compensation expense for the year with reasonable accuracy in the current\nquarter. As a result, we do not believe that a GAAP reconciliation would provide meaningful supplemental information about our outlook. 2\nSonos at a Glance\n2002 8 1,700+ 60\nFounded Locations Employees\nCountries distributed\n23 2 3,800+ $1.52B\nProducts Services US Patents and Applications FY24 Revenue\n3\nBroad Product Portfolio Spanning Variety of Price Points and Use Cases\nHome Theater\nRay Beam\n$279 $499\nArc Ultra\n$999\nSub Mini Sub\nArc $429 $799\n$899\nSpeakers\nEra 100 Era 300 Five IKEA SYMFONISK IKEA SYMFONISK IKEA SYMFONISK Picture IKEA SYMFONISK\n$249 $449 $549 Bookshelf speaker Speaker lamp frame speaker Floor lamp speaker\n$119 $249 $259 $299\nHeadphones Portables Components and Architectural Automotive\nAce Sonos and Sonance Sonos and Sonance Sonos and Sonance Sonos and Sonance\n$449 Roam 2 Move 2 Amp Port 8” In-Ceiling 6” In-Ceiling In-Wall Outdoor 4\n$179 $449 $699 $449 $999 $659 $659 $879\nMarket Position\nPremium\nSonos is differentiated by our unique combination\nof an open content and control platform with\nhigh-quality, premium hardware that spans a variety\nof form factors, use cases, and price points.\nNo other company has created an interoperable\nsuite of products serving customers in the home\nand beyond.\n“Big tech” has historically focused on the adoption Legacy\nof their voice assistants through a range of home\nhousehold devices, including more commoditized audio\naudio devices that compromise on privacy, design,\nand sound experience. More recently, we have seen\nthese players reduce their levels of investment here\nand focus their efforts elsewhere.\nLegacy companies have been focused on acoustics\nand hardware for decades, offering single-product Commodity\nsolutions.
