Such forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of words such as \"should,\" \"may,\" \"intends,\" \"anticipates,\" \"believes,\" \"estimates,\" \"projects,\" \"forecasts,\" \"expects,\" \"plans,\" \"proposes\" and similar expressions. Forward-looking statements contained in this press release and other communications include, but are not limited to, statements about the Company’s goals, profitability, growth, prospects, reduction of expenses, and outlook. Although Knightscope believes that the expectations reflected in these forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, there are a number of risks, uncertainties and other important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from such forward-looking statements, including the factors discussed under the heading \"Risk Factors\" in Knightscope’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, as updated by its other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of the document in which they are contained, and Knightscope does not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statements, except as may be required by law.\n\nRegister \n\nShare via Email\n\nOKCancel\n\nCopyright ©2024 Zoom Video Communications, Inc.

If you currently hold Preferred Stock, those shares must first be converted into Class A common stock before the shares can be transferred to a brokerage account. Until you deposit your shares in a brokerage account, the transfer agent will maintain the record of your ownership. Once you deposit your shares with a broker, the broker will maintain that record. (Please see the section below for more information on **“How do I move my shares to a brokerage account after the stock is listed on NASDAQ?”**\n\nWho are Knightscope’s transfer agents?\n\nFor all equity holdings, Computershare is Knightscope’s transfer agent.\n\nFor bonds, Great Lakes Fund Solutions Inc. serves as the depositary, paying agent, and registrar.\n\nHow do I trade my stock if I don’t own Class A common stock?\n\nEffective November 1, 2021, Computershare now serves as Knightscope’s transfer agent. All accounts previously held at Carta, the former transfer agent, were moved to Computershare. \n\n**Please Note:** When shares were migrated from Carta to Computershare, Carta marked all shares as ‘cancelled’ on its platform. However, that does not mean your shares were cancelled – they are held at Computershare. \n\nStockholders who purchased Class B common stock or any series of Preferred Stock are able to convert their shares into Class A common stock by submitting a Conversion Notice to Computershare. The form can be found [here](/static-files/659e9465-ef33-4b4c-bc34-194145eaa7c9).\n\nOnce converted, stock that was purchased in one of our prior Regulation A offerings will be freely tradable through your Investor Center account at Computershare, ([www.computershare.com/investor](https://www.computershare.com/investor)) once you’ve registered your account online, or by using the broker of your choice. Stock that was purchased in one of our prior private placements will be freely tradable through your Computershare account or the broker of your choice, subject to certain conditions (generally, that the stock has been held for more than one year (or 6 months after we have been an SEC reporting company for 90 days) and that the stockholder is not an “affiliate” of Knightscope within the meaning of the SEC’s rules and regulations). This means that investors who purchased stock in one of our prior private placements may not be able to immediately trade those shares until restrictive legends are removed.\n\nHow do I access the Investor Center?\n\nAt the end of 2021, stockholders of record were advised about Knightscope’s change of transfer agents, from Carta to Computershare. Computershare’s Investor Center will provide you access to your account details and statements. \n\nTo log into Computershare, please visit: [www.computershare.com/investor.](https://www.computershare.com/investor)\n\nYou can register your account with or without your account code. However, it should be a faster process to register using your account code. To protect our stockholders, some extra steps are required to access the Investor Center.\n\nTo access the Investor Center, stockholders will be required to properly answer questions only they may know and, thereafter, an access code will be mailed through the **U.S. Post Office** to the stockholder. Immediate access to the Investor Center will not be granted if the security process cannot be successfully completed.**Do not be alarmed if the security questions you are asked do not apply to you. It is simply a security verification process.**\n\nWhat happens to my stock if the Company cannot contact me?\n\nWhat happens to my stock if the Company cannot contact me?\n\nState law governs the Company’s obligations to surrender stock to the state if it cannot locate a stockholder after a period of time. Thus, stockholders are encouraged to keep their addresses up to date with the transfer agent.\n\nWhat if I hold a paper stock certificate?\n\nIf you hold a paper certificate, Computershare, upon request, will provide instructions on how to turn in your paper certificate and convert those shares into book form via the online conversion portal.\n\nDoes Knightscope issue 1099’s or K-1’s?\n\nKnightscope is a C-Corp and, therefore, does not issue K-1’s. Computershare will issue 1099’s, as required by law, based on financial transactions related to any sales of the stock. Therefore, it is important to ensure that your tax ID has been certified. This can be done through your Investor Center account.\n\nWhat number should my broker use to contact Computershare?\n\nThe Dedicated Broker Inquiry Specialist Team can be reached at 1-866-690-8162.\n\nThe number for international brokers is 1-781-575-4019.\n\nWhy did I receive a W-9 Tax Form in the mail from Computershare?\n\nAll Computershare accountholders are required to certify their Tax ID's. This can either be done by mail using the form provided or online via Investor Center or the conversion portal.\n\nHow can I contact Computershare?\n\nStockholders may contact Computershare directly as follows.\n\n**When contacting Computershare, stockholders should indicate they are a Knightscope stockholder to ensure that they are routed to the dedicated****Knightscope support team at Computershare.**\n\nTelephone inquiries: 1-866-481-3485 (U.S.) 1-781-575-2482 (International) Hours of Operation: 8:00 AM to 8:00 PM EST\n\nE-mail inquiries: web.queries@computershare.com\n\nLink to the Computershare Contact Us Page:<https://www-us.computershare.com/Investor/#Contact/Enquiry>\n\nLink for shareholders to login to their account online:<https://www-us.computershare.com/Investor>\n\nMailed Inquiries Should be Sent to: By United States Postal Service:\n\nComputershare Attn: Corp Action Voluntary PO Box 43011 Providence, RI 02940-3011\n\nBy Overnight Courier (FedEx/UPS/DHL, etc.):\n\nComputershare Attn: Corp Action Voluntary 150 Royall Street Suite V Canton, MA 02021\n\nSetting Up Online Access with Computershare\n\n[Learn More](https://ir.knightscope.com/static-files/f22a201c-be2e-4a0d-b5c7-4efeef1f9451)\n\nSelling Shares After Knightscope is a Publicly Traded Company\n\n[Learn More](https://ir.knightscope.com/static-files/706fc4ac-e9c3-474d-a02a-ae9139feee47)\n\n**Forward Looking Statements**\n\nThis document may contain “forward-looking statements” about Knightscope’s future expectations, plans, outlook, projections and prospects. Such forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of words such as “should,” “may,” “intends,” “anticipates,” “believes,” “estimates,” “projects,” “forecasts,” “expects,” “plans,” “proposes” and similar expressions. Although Knightscope believes that the expectations reflected in these forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, there are a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from such forward-looking statements. You are urged to carefully review and consider any cautionary statements and other disclosures, including the statements made under the heading “Risk Factors” in the offering circular filed with the SEC on January 26, 2022.

Enhancing capabilities by an order of magnitude will improve efficiency and response times,\nleverage the power of AI for advanced autonomous cooperation, all while providing a scalable, cost-effective solution that can adapt to future\nchallenges against those seeking to do harm to everyday Americans.\n4\nD ISR UP TIO N B Y A .I.\nOpportunity\nPublic Safety is ripe for disruption by Artificial Intelligence and Robotics. Knightscope represents an opportunity to build a $30 billion company that is\nanalogous to the building of an all-new defense contractor but instead of focusing exclusively on the battlefield, we are focused on deploying groundbreaking\ntechnologies for the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, U.S. Department of Justice, the 19,000+ law enforcement agencies and 8,000 private security\nfirms to safeguard Americans on our soil.\nCrime\nThe 2.5 million law enforcement professionals and security guards, without the proper tools and technology, are woefully inadequate to safeguard 332 million\nAmericans across 50 states. This is evidenced by the fact that crime has a $2+ trillion negative economic impact on the U.S. annually and a violent crime\noccurs every 26 seconds while a property crime occurs every 4 seconds.1\nTechnology\nKnightscope’s unique technology combining autonomy, robotics, AI and EV capabilities has been proven to be effective with nearly 3 million hours of\noperation in real world conditions across every time zone in America, through multiple winters and summers.\nMachines-in-Network\nWe have nearly 10,000 machines-in-network today and long-term we are targeting to put over 1 million machines-in-network to assist the 2.5 million law\nenforcement professionals and security guards with unprecedented capabilities at their fingertips – near superhuman capabilities. Eventually the machines\nwill be able to autonomously “see, feel, hear, smell, speak – and cooperate” and do 100 times more than a human could ever do and do it consistently.\nClients\nOur initial go-to-market was focused on B2B clients including airports, casinos, commercial real estate, corporate campuses, homeowner associations,\nhospitals, hotels, logistics facilities, manufacturing plants, parking, public parks and schools. Recently we have been adding B2G clients such as law\nenforcement agencies and the U.S. Federal Government.\nBusiness Model\nOur Machine-as-a-Service (MaaS) business model delivers recurring revenue for a recurring societal problem with high luxury automotive per unit\neconomics but with long-term software-as-a-service margins. We have generated over $30 million in lifetime revenue during our large-scale proof-of-\nconcept phase and now scaling up across the country.\nMoat\nWe believe that our years of practical application of A.I. robotic applications in the real world combined with recently receiving an Authority to Operate\n(“ATO”) by the U.S. Federal Government after an exhaustive 3-year cyber security review process uniquely positions Knightscope in the marketplace with a\nclear first mover advantage. Additionally, a unified AI driven software platform that brings together both data and autonomous cooperation from a plethora of\nmachines and systems will provide unparalleled situational awareness, analytics, prediction and evidentiary capabilities – and a significant competitive.\nSource: (1) FBI Crime Clock and U.S. Senate hearings. This information is supplied from public sources we believe to be reliable, but we cannot guarantee accuracy. Although we believe our expectations expressed in such forward-looking statements\n5\nare reasonable, we cannot assure you that they will be realized. Investors are cautioned that such forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the anticipated results.\nC OR E TE CH NO LOG Y\nArtificial Intelligence\nKnightscope was founded on AI and runs on AI nationwide since its founding in 2013 and well before\nthe recent mainstream excitement. We utilize it to autonomously operate in highly dynamic outdoor Portfolio Technology Status\nand indoor environments, to autonomously recharge as well as for automated detections of people,\nfaces, and license plates. We believe artificial intelligence is only going to accelerate our portfolio of\nmachines to be able to “see, feel, hear, smell, speak – and cooperate”. KSOC User Interface Production\nK1 Hemisphere Production\nASR K1 Tower Production\nASR Portfolio\nOur Autonomous Security Robots generate over 90 terabytes of data a year and we put that into a K3 Indoor Production\ndigestible format for a human to utilize with our Knightscope Security Operations Center (KSOC)\nK5 Outdoor Production\nuser interface software application.\nKEMS User Interface Production\nK1B Portfolio\nK1 Blue Light Tower Production\nOur K1B lineup is a comprehensive portfolio of beacons of public safety in the form of towers,\nemergency phones and call boxes. Our new software application, the Knightscope Emergency K1B K1 Blue Light E-Phone Production\nManagement System (KEMS), now provides users real-time data and improvements in operational\nK1 Call Box Production\nefficiency.\nK1 Retrofit Kit Production\nDetections\nKnightscope+ Remote Monitoring Production\nOften our clients may not have a fully staffed Security Operations Center (SOC) or 911 Dispatch\nDETECTIONS\nCenter so we can monitor the machines on their behalf 24/7/365 with Knightscope+ Remote Automated Gunshot Detection Production\nMonitoring. Additionally, we recently added an integrated or stand-alone option for hyper accurate\nAutomated Gunshot Detection (AGD).\n6\nFU TU RE T EC HN OL OG Y\nAll New A.I. Mission Control Software Autonomy Platform to Predict and Prevent Crime\nRobots Will Be Everywhere\nThe technology landscape is going to change dramatically over the coming years for public safety and the software tools used today\nwill be replaced. A game changing opportunity exists to redefine the sector by developing an all-new AI driven software platform\nmonitoring and managing a network of autonomous security robots, blue light emergency towers, e-phones, call boxes, aerial\ndrones, autonomous patrol vehicles, quadrupeds, humanoids and other future technologies, powered by AI, enabling machines to\nobserve, learn, reason and act – in concert or solo - to address real world public safety events in real time.\nAutonomous Mission Planning\nIn the event of an actual or forecasted incident, the AI proposes alternative response plans, including the closest machines and\nhumans for rapid deployment, optimal paths for intervention, and necessary resources, coordinating emergency services and alerting\nthe public as needed. Utilizing robot swarming techniques will enable cross-machine autonomous cooperation.\nForecast\nAI algorithms analyze data streams from various machines to identify potential threats or unusual behaviors. The system uses\nhistorical data and machine learning to predict potential public safety incidents allowing preemptive action including optimal resource\nallocation of machines and humans.\nOperations\nReal time mission status as well as health of machines-in-network across all autonomous machines including real time data feeds,\nstatus, configuration, reporting ​ and AI driven preventative maintenance.\nIntegrated Neighborhood Watch\nCross-platform communication integrating with external systems for sharing of critical information and coordinating responses. Multi-\nlevel user access allowing for different stakeholders including administrators, law enforcement, security, as well communities,\nneighborhoods, and civilian access.\n7\nC ON CE PT O F O PE RAT ION S\n8\nC ON CE PT O F O PE RAT ION S\n9\n$4 0B + RE CU RR ING RE VE NU E OP PO RTUN ITY (US A)\nEstimated % Augmentation with Robots Potential Annual Recurring Revenue (estimate)\nEstimated Total\nSelect Vertical Number of\nOfficers and Guards Near-Term Long-Term\nNear-Term Long-Term Per Robot\nOpportunity Opportunity\nCorporate Campuses 12,000 $17M $168M\nHealthcare 193,550 $271M $2,710M\nCasinos 59,160 $70,000 * $83M $828M\n2% 20%\nCommercial Real Estate 260,400 $365M $3,646M\nManufacturing & Logistics 270,869 $379M $3,792M\nLaw Enforcement 1,000,000 $150,000 ** $3B $30B\nTotal ~ 1.8 million ~ 36,000 robots ~ 360,000 robots ~ $4.1 billion ~ $41 billion\n* Assumed average revenue for K1 portfolio, K3 portfolio and K5 portfolio combined as well as future products and services\n** Assumed average revenue for all K7, K10, and K15 versions combined\nNote: near-term opportunity reflects 10+ year domestic business planning period.
