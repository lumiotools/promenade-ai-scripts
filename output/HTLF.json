(NASDAQ: HBT) (the “Company” or “HBT Financial” or “HBT”), the holding company for Heartland Bank and Trust Company, today reported net income of $18.2 million, or $0.57 diluted earnings per share, for the third quarter of 2024. This compares to net income of $18.1 million, or $0.57 diluted earnings per share, for the second quarter of 2024, and net income of $19.7 million, or $0.62 diluted earnings per share, for the third quarter of 2023.\n\nJ. Lance Carter, President and Chief Executive Officer of HBT Financial, said, “In the third quarter, we continued our consistently solid financial performance with net income of $18.2 million, adjusted net income(1) of $19.2 million, adjusted ROAA(1) of 1.53% and adjusted ROATCE(1) of 17.20%. We have also seen tangible equity continue to build, with tangible book value per share increasing 23.3% over the last year. Our net interest margin (tax-equivalent basis)(1) increased 3 basis points to 4.03% while funding costs remained modest, increasing 5 basis points to 1.47%. Our asset quality remains strong with net charge-offs at 0.07% of average loans on an annualized basis during the quarter and nonperforming assets to total assets at 0.17%. We have not seen any significant signs of stress in our loan portfolio, but we continue to monitor the portfolio closely. Noninterest income remained consistent and noninterest expense of $31.3 million was up only 2.1% when compared to the third quarter of 2023, as we remain focused on operational efficiency while continuing to invest in our business. Lastly, all capital ratios had solid increases and can support future organic growth or acquisitions.”____________________________________(1) See “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below for reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to their most closely comparable GAAP financial measures.\n\n**Adjusted Net Income**\n\nIn addition to reporting GAAP results, the Company believes non-GAAP measures such as adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share, which adjust for acquisition expenses, branch closure expenses, gains (losses) on closed branch premises, net earnings (losses) from closed or sold operations, charges related to termination of certain employee benefit plans, realized gains (losses) on sales of securities, and mortgage servicing rights fair value adjustments, provide investors with additional insight into its operational performance. The Company reported adjusted net income of $19.2 million, or $0.61 adjusted diluted earnings per share, for the third quarter of 2024. This compares to adjusted net income of $18.1 million, or $0.57 adjusted diluted earnings per share, for the second quarter of 2024, and adjusted net income of $20.3 million, or $0.63 adjusted diluted earnings per share, for the third quarter of 2023 (see “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” tables below for reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to their most closely comparable GAAP financial measures).\n\n**Net Interest Income and Net Interest Margin**\n\nNet interest income for the third quarter of 2024 was $47.7 million, an increase of 1.5% from $47.0 million for the second quarter of 2024. The increase was primarily attributable to improved loan yields which were mostly offset by an increase in funding costs.\n\nRelative to the third quarter of 2023, net interest income decreased 1.1% from $48.3 million. The decrease was primarily attributable to higher funding costs which were partially offset by higher asset yields and an increase in interest-earning assets.\n\nNet interest margin for the third quarter of 2024 was 3.98%, compared to 3.95% for the second quarter of 2024, and net interest margin (tax-equivalent basis)(1) for the third quarter of 2024 was 4.03%, compared to 4.00% for the second quarter of 2024. Higher yields on interest-earning assets, which increased by 7 basis points to 5.35%, were mostly offset by an increase in funding costs, with the cost of funds increasing by 5 basis points to 1.47%.\n\nRelative to the third quarter of 2023, net interest margin decreased 9 basis points from 4.07% and net interest margin (tax-equivalent basis)(1) decreased 10 basis points from 4.13%. These decreases were primarily attributable to increases in funding costs outpacing increases in interest-earning asset yields.____________________________________(1) See “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below for reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to their most closely comparable GAAP financial measures.\n\n**Noninterest Income**\n\nNoninterest income for the third quarter of 2024 was $8.7 million, a decrease from $9.6 million for the second quarter of 2024. The decrease was primarily attributable to changes in the mortgage servicing rights (“MSR”) fair value adjustment, with a $1.5 million negative MSR fair value adjustment included in the third quarter 2024 results compared to a $0.1 million negative MSR fair value adjustment included in the second quarter 2024 results. Partially offsetting the MSR fair value adjustment was a $0.2 million increase in service charge income and a $0.2 million increase in other noninterest income, primarily attributable to swap fee income.\n\nRelative to the third quarter of 2023, noninterest income decreased 8.3% from $9.5 million. The decrease was primarily attributable to the $1.5 million negative MSR fair value adjustment included in the third quarter 2024 results, partially offset by the absence of $0.8 million in realized losses on the sale of securities included in the third quarter 2023 results.\n\n**Noninterest Expense**\n\nNoninterest expense for the third quarter of 2024 was $31.3 million, a 2.7% increase from $30.5 million for the second quarter of 2024. The increase was primarily attributable to a $0.5 million increase in occupancy expense, driven in part by a seasonal increase in planned building maintenance expenses, and a $0.4 million increase in marketing and customer relations expense.\n\nRelative to the third quarter of 2023, noninterest expense increased 2.1% from $30.7 million. The increase was primarily attributable to a $0.7 million increase in salaries and a $0.4 million increase in employee benefits. Partially offsetting these increases was a $0.3 million decrease in marketing and customer relations expense.\n\nOn February 1, 2023, HBT Financial completed its acquisition of Town and Country Financial Corporation (“Town and Country”) with the core system conversion successfully completed in April 2023. Acquisition-related expenses recognized during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 are summarized below. No Town and Country acquisition-related expenses were recognized subsequent to the second quarter of 2023.\n\n_(dollars in thousands)_| **Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023**  \n---|---  \n**PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES**|  $| 5,924  \n**NONINTEREST EXPENSE**  \nSalaries| 3,584  \nFurniture and equipment| 39  \nData processing| 2,031  \nMarketing and customer relations| 24  \nLoan collection and servicing| 125  \nLegal fees and other noninterest expense| 1,964  \n**Total noninterest expense**|  7,767  \n**Total acquisition-related expenses**|  $| 13,691  \n  \n**Loan Portfolio**\n\nTotal loans outstanding, before allowance for credit losses, were $3.37 billion at September 30, 2024, compared with $3.39 billion at June 30, 2024, and $3.34 billion at September 30, 2023. The $15.7 million decrease from June 30, 2024 was primarily attributable to several larger commercial real estate loan payoffs due to the sale of the property and a couple of larger one-to-four family residential loan payoffs. These decreases were partially offset by increased line usage and term originations in our agricultural and farmland portfolio.\n\n**Deposits**\n\nTotal deposits were $4.28 billion at September 30, 2024, compared with $4.32 billion at June 30, 2024, and $4.20 billion at September 30, 2023. The $38.0 million decrease from June 30, 2024 was primarily attributable to lower balances maintained in retail accounts and a $18.3 million decrease in escrow balances related to seasonal tax payments, partially offset by increases in public funds and business accounts. Additionally, we continue to see a shift towards higher cost deposit products, with decreases in noninterest-bearing deposits, interest-bearing demand, and savings balances being partially offset by an increase in money market and time deposit balances.\n\n**Asset Quality**\n\nNonperforming loans totaled $8.2 million, or 0.24% of total loans, at September 30, 2024, compared with $8.4 million, or 0.25% of total loans, at June 30, 2024, and $6.7 million, or 0.20% of total loans, at September 30, 2023. Additionally, of the $8.2 million of nonperforming loans held as of September 30, 2024, $2.0 million is either wholly or partially guaranteed by the U.S. government. The $0.2 million decrease in nonperforming loans from June 30, 2024 was primarily attributable to the payoff of $0.1 million in nonaccrual agricultural and farmland loans.\n\nThe Company recorded a provision for credit losses of $0.6 million for the third quarter of 2024. The provision for credit losses primarily reflects a $1.2 million increase in required reserves resulting from changes in economic forecasts; a $0.2 million increase in required reserves resulting from qualitative factor changes; a $0.6 million decrease in required reserves driven by decreased loan balances and changes within the loan portfolio; and a $0.2 million decrease in specific reserves.\n\nThe Company had net charge-offs of $0.6 million, or 0.07% of average loans on an annualized basis, for the third quarter of 2024, compared to net charge-offs of $0.7 million, or 0.08% of average loans on an annualized basis, for the second quarter of 2024, and net recoveries of $0.1 million, or 0.01% of average loans on an annualized basis, for the third quarter of 2023. During the third quarter of 2024, net charge-offs were primarily recognized in the commercial and industrial category which had $0.7 million of net charge-offs.\n\nThe Company’s allowance for credit losses was 1.22% of total loans and 499% of nonperforming loans at September 30, 2024, compared with 1.21% of total loans and 484% of nonperforming loans at June 30, 2024. In addition, the allowance for credit losses on unfunded lending-related commitments totaled $4.1 million as of September 30, 2024, compared with $4.3 million as of June 30, 2024.\n\n**Capital**\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company exceeded all regulatory capital requirements under Basel III as summarized in the following table:\n\n**September 30, 2024**| **For Capital****Adequacy Purposes****With Capital****Conservation Buffer**  \n---|---  \nTotal capital to risk-weighted assets| 16.54| %| 10.50| %  \nTier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets| 14.48| 8.50  \nCommon equity tier 1 capital ratio| 13.15| 7.00  \nTier 1 leverage ratio| 11.16| 4.00  \n  \nThe ratio of tangible common equity to tangible assets(1) increased to 9.35% as of September 30, 2024, from 8.74% as of June 30, 2024, and tangible book value per share(1) increased by $0.91 to $14.55 as of September 30, 2024, when compared to June 30, 2024.\n\nDuring the third quarter of 2024, the Company did not repurchase shares of its common stock under its stock repurchase program. The Company’s Board of Directors has authorized the repurchase of up to $15 million of HBT Financial common stock under its stock repurchase program, which is in effect until January 1, 2025. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had $10.6 million remaining under the stock repurchase program.____________________________________(1) See “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below for reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to their most closely comparable GAAP financial measures.\n\n**About HBT Financial, Inc.**\n\nHBT Financial, Inc., headquartered in Bloomington, Illinois, is the holding company for Heartland Bank and Trust Company, and has banking roots that can be traced back to 1920.

This compares to net income of $15.3 million, or $0.48 diluted earnings per share, for the first quarter of 2024, and net income of $18.5 million, or $0.58 diluted earnings per share, for the second quarter of 2023.\n\nJ. Lance Carter, President and Chief Executive Officer of HBT Financial, said, “On behalf of HBT Financial, I would like to first express my condolences to the George Drake family. George passed away on May 13th at the age of 97. He started his banking career just after World War II at the State Bank of Cornland, which had been founded by his father M.B. Drake, and he spent over 70 years in banking before retiring from our Board of Directors in 2019. He formed Heartland Bancorp, Inc. (now HBT Financial) in 1982 as one of the first multi-bank holding companies in Illinois. I had the pleasure of knowing George for 22 years and his kindness and wisdom impacted me. His leadership and vision established the foundation for our success today.\n\nAs for the second quarter, we delivered another set of very strong performance metrics with net income of $18.1 million, a ROAA of 1.45% and ROATCE(1) of 17.21%. In addition, our tangible book value per share of $13.64 has grown 17.8% over the past year. During the quarter, we saw solid loan growth of $39.5 million, or 4.7% on an annualized basis, as well as stability in our core deposit base. We have seen the continued repricing of our loan portfolio and tight management of deposit costs positively impact our net interest margin (tax-equivalent basis)(1) which expanded 1 basis point to 4.00% for the quarter.\n\nWhile we continue to invest in our business, our costs were well controlled during the quarter as demonstrated by our efficiency ratio (tax-equivalent basis)(1) of 52.1%. Our loan portfolio is performing well with no apparent signs of concentrated stress in sub portfolios, such as office and retail commercial real estate, while nonperforming assets represented only 0.17% of total assets and net charge-offs were only 0.08% of average loans on an annualized basis for the quarter.”____________________________________(1) See “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below for reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to their most closely comparable GAAP financial measures.\n\n**Adjusted Net Income**\n\nIn addition to reporting GAAP results, the Company believes non-GAAP measures such as adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share, which adjust for acquisition expenses, branch closure expenses, gains (losses) on closed branch premises, net earnings (losses) from closed or sold operations, charges related to termination of certain employee benefit plans, realized gains (losses) on sales of securities, and mortgage servicing rights fair value adjustments, provide investors with additional insight into its operational performance. The Company reported adjusted net income of $18.1 million, or $0.57 adjusted diluted earnings per share, for the second quarter of 2024. This compares to adjusted net income of $18.1 million, or $0.57 adjusted diluted earnings per share, for the first quarter of 2024, and adjusted net income of $18.8 million, or $0.58 adjusted diluted earnings per share, for the second quarter of 2023 (see “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” tables below for reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to their most closely comparable GAAP financial measures).\n\n**Net Interest Income and Net Interest Margin**\n\nNet interest income for the second quarter of 2024 was $47.0 million, a slight increase of 0.7% from $46.7 million for the first quarter of 2024. The slight increase was primarily attributable to improved asset yields and growth in interest-earning assets which were mostly offset by an increase in funding costs.\n\nRelative to the second quarter of 2023, net interest income decreased 3.8% from $48.9 million. The decrease was primarily attributable to higher funding costs which were partially offset by higher asset yields and an increase in interest-earning assets.\n\nNet interest margin for the second quarter of 2024 was 3.95%, compared to 3.94% for the first quarter of 2024, and net interest margin (tax-equivalent basis)(1) for the second quarter of 2024 was 4.00%, compared to 3.99% for the first quarter of 2024. Higher yields on interest-earning assets, which increased by 5 basis points to 5.28%, were mostly offset by an increase in funding costs, with the cost of funds increasing by 5 basis points to 1.42%.\n\nRelative to the second quarter of 2023, net interest margin decreased 21 basis points from 4.16% and net interest margin (tax-equivalent basis)(1) decreased 22 basis points from 4.22%. These decreases were primarily attributable to increases in funding costs outpacing increases in interest-earning asset yields.____________________________________(1) See “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below for reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to their most closely comparable GAAP financial measures.\n\n**Noninterest Income**\n\nNoninterest income for the second quarter of 2024 was $9.6 million, an increase from $5.6 million for the first quarter of 2024. The increase was primarily attributable to the absence of $3.4 million of losses on sales of securities and $0.6 million of impairment losses related to the closure of two branches recognized during the first quarter of 2024. Additionally, seasonal changes in card income, which increased by $0.3 million, were mostly offset by a $0.2 million decrease in other noninterest income.\n\nRelative to the second quarter of 2023, noninterest income decreased 3.1% from $9.9 million. The decrease was primarily attributable to a $0.2 million change in the mortgage servicing rights fair value adjustment and a $0.2 million decrease in other noninterest income. Partially offsetting these decreases was a $0.3 million increase in wealth management fees, driven by higher values of assets under management during the second quarter of 2024 relative to the second quarter of 2023.\n\n**Noninterest Expense**\n\nNoninterest expense for the second quarter of 2024 was $30.5 million, a 2.4% decrease from $31.3 million for the first quarter of 2024. The decrease was primarily attributable to a $0.3 million decrease in salaries expense, which included higher vacation accruals and payroll taxes in the first quarter of 2024, a $0.3 million decrease in occupancy expense, and a $0.3 million decrease in data processing expense.\n\nRelative to the second quarter of 2023, noninterest expense decreased 10.2% from $34.0 million. The decrease was primarily attributable to the absence of $0.8 million of legal fees and $0.8 million of accruals related to legal matters previously disclosed as well as the absence of $0.6 million of Town and Country Financial Corporation (“Town and Country”) acquisition-related expenses incurred during the second quarter of 2023. Additionally, the realization of planned cost reductions following the Town and Country core system conversion completed in April 2023 further contributed to the decrease in noninterest expense.\n\nAcquisition-related expenses recognized during the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 are summarized below. No Town and Country acquisition-related expenses were recognized subsequent to the second quarter of 2023.\n\n_(dollars in thousands)_| **Three Months EndedJune 30, 2023**| **Six Months EndedJune 30, 2023**  \n---|---|---  \n**PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES**|  $| —| $| 5,924  \n**NONINTEREST EXPENSE**  \nSalaries| 66| 3,584  \nFurniture and equipment| 39| 39  \nData processing| 176| 2,031  \nMarketing and customer relations| 10| 24  \nLoan collection and servicing| 125| 125  \nLegal fees and other noninterest expense| 211| 1,964  \n**Total noninterest expense**|  627| 7,767  \n**Total acquisition-related expenses**|  $| 627| $| 13,691  \n  \n**Income Taxes**\n\nDuring the second quarter of 2024, we recognized an additional $0.5 million of tax expense for a deferred tax asset write-down, primarily as a result of an Illinois tax change. This increased our effective tax rate to 27.6% during the second quarter of 2024 from 25.6% during the first quarter of 2024. We expect this write-down to be earned back over several years through reduced state tax expense.\n\n**Loan Portfolio**\n\nTotal loans outstanding, before allowance for credit losses, were $3.39 billion at June 30, 2024, compared with $3.35 billion at March 31, 2024, and $3.24 billion at June 30, 2023. The $39.5 million increase from March 31, 2024 was primarily attributable to draws on existing construction projects and new construction loans to existing customers. In addition, growth in our municipal, consumer and other portfolio was primarily due to draws on an existing loan to a recurring borrower. The $8.4 million increase in multi-family loans was driven predominately by the completion of projects previously in the construction and land development category.\n\n**Deposits**\n\nTotal deposits were $4.32 billion at June 30, 2024, compared with $4.36 billion at March 31, 2024, and $4.16 billion at June 30, 2023. The $41.9 million decrease from March 31, 2024 was primarily attributable to a $25.8 million decrease in brokered deposits and a $16.1 million decrease in higher cost reciprocal wealth management customer deposits included with money market deposits. Partially offsetting these decreases was a $31.1 million increase in time deposits from a State of Illinois loan matching program, a lower cost source of funding, which totaled $65.0 million as of June 30, 2024.\n\n**Asset Quality**\n\nNonperforming loans totaled $8.4 million, or 0.25% of total loans, at June 30, 2024, compared with $9.7 million, or 0.29% of total loans, at March 31, 2024, and $7.5 million, or 0.23% of total loans, at June 30, 2023. Additionally, of the $8.4 million of nonperforming loans held as of June 30, 2024, $2.1 million is either wholly or partially guaranteed by the U.S. government. The $1.2 million decrease in nonperforming loans from March 31, 2024 was primarily attributable to a $0.4 million reduction in nonaccrual one-to-four family residential loans as well as charge-offs.\n\nThe Company recorded a provision for credit losses of $1.2 million for the second quarter of 2024. The provision for credit losses primarily reflects a $0.9 million increase in required reserves resulting from changes in economic forecasts and a $0.9 million increase in required reserves driven by increased loan balances and changes within the loan portfolio which were mostly offset by a $0.7 million decrease in specific reserves.\n\nThe Company had net charge-offs of $0.7 million, or 0.08% of average loans on an annualized basis, for the second quarter of 2024, compared to net recoveries of $0.2 million, or 0.02% of average loans on an annualized basis, for the first quarter of 2024, and net recoveries of $0.1 million, or 0.01% of average loans on an annualized basis, for the second quarter of 2023. During the second quarter of 2024, net charge-offs were primarily recognized in the commercial and industrial category, which had $0.5 million of net charge-offs, and the multi-family category, which had $0.2 million of net charge-offs.\n\nThe Company’s allowance for credit losses was 1.21% of total loans and 484% of nonperforming loans at June 30, 2024, compared with 1.22% of total loans and 423% of nonperforming loans at March 31, 2024. In addition, the allowance for credit losses on unfunded lending-related commitments totaled $4.3 million as of June 30, 2024, compared with $3.8 million as of March 31, 2024.\n\n**Capital**\n\nAs of June 30, 2024, the Company exceeded all regulatory capital requirements under Basel III as summarized in the following table:\n\n**June 30, 2024**| **For Capital****Adequacy Purposes****With Capital****Conversation Buffer**  \n---|---  \nTotal capital to risk-weighted assets| 16.01| %| 10.50| %  \nTier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets| 13.98| 8.50  \nCommon equity tier 1 capital ratio| 12.66| 7.00  \nTier 1 leverage ratio| 10.83| 4.00  \n  \nThe ratio of tangible common equity to tangible assets(1) increased to 8.74% as of June 30, 2024, from 8.40% as of March 31, 2024, and tangible book value per share(1) increased by $0.45 to $13.64 as of June 30, 2024, when compared to March 31, 2024.\n\nDuring the second quarter of 2024, the Company repurchased 53,522 shares of its common stock at a weighted average price of $18.74 under its stock repurchase program. The Company’s Board of Directors has authorized the repurchase of up to $15 million of HBT Financial common stock under its stock repurchase program, which is in effect until January 1, 2025. As of June 30, 2024, the Company had $10.6 million remaining under the stock repurchase program.____________________________________(1) See “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below for reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to their most closely comparable GAAP financial measures.\n\n**About HBT Financial, Inc.**\n\nHBT Financial, Inc., headquartered in Bloomington, Illinois, is the holding company for Heartland Bank and Trust Company, and has banking roots that can be traced back to 1920.
