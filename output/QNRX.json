(NASDAQ: QNRX) (the “Company” or “Quoin”), a clinical-stage, specialty pharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing novel treatments for rare and orphan diseases, today provides a business update and announces financial results for the three and nine months ended Sept. 30, 2024.\n\nQuoin CEO Dr. Michael Myers said, “The third quarter has been marked by notable achievements, including expanding the clinical reach of our lead product QRX003 into Peeling Skin Syndrome. We are now initiating an investigator-led clinical study in New Zealand to evaluate QRX003 for Peeling Skin Syndrome, for which there is no approved treatment or cure. This is the first step in a planned series of new indications for QRX003 and we believe this will be the first ever formal clinical study for Peeling Skin Syndrome. We have also continued to make real progress on the international expansion of our ongoing Netherton Syndrome clinical program with the announcement of the opening of two additional sites in the United Kingdom at recognized centers of clinical excellence. We look forward to announcing additional expansion into other countries in the future. Finally, the significant insider purchases made by the entire Quoin management team is a clear reflection of our strong belief and confidence in Quoin’s growth trajectory and long-term value creation. As we continue our commitment to the rare disease community, our focus remains on delivering life-changing treatments for underserved patient populations. We are proud of the advancements we’ve made and look forward to the upcoming milestones in our clinical development programs.”\n\n**Recent Corporate Highlights**\n\n  * **Peeling Skin Syndrome (PSS) Study:** In August, Quoin announced the planned initiation of an investigator-led clinical study in New Zealand for QRX003 in pediatric patients with Peeling Skin Syndrome. This rare genetic condition currently has no approved treatments or cures. The first clinical site and patient have been identified, and Quoin is actively evaluating additional clinical sites in other countries.\n  * **Insider Share Purchases:** In September, Quoin’s CEO, COO and CFO made significant insider share purchases, signaling strong leadership confidence in the company’s growth trajectory.\n  * **Netherton Syndrome Clinical Trials Expansion:** Quoin continued its efforts to broaden the clinical trials for QRX003 as a potential treatment for Netherton Syndrome. In October 2024, the company announced the opening of two additional clinical sites in the United Kingdom, recognized centers of excellence for Netherton Syndrome, with plans to further expand in Western and Eastern Europe. The UK sites will operate under Quoin’s open Investigational New Drug (IND) application with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)**.**\n\n\n\n**Financial Highlights**\n\n  * **Cash Position:** Quoin had approximately $10.3 million in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities as of Sept. 30, 2024. This is expected to fund the Company’s operations into late 2025.\n  * **Net Loss:** For the quarter ended Sept. 30, 2024, Quoin reported a net loss of approximately $2.3 million compared to a net loss of approximately $1.9 million for the same period in 2023. For the nine months ended Sept. 30, 2024, the net loss was approximately $6.7 million compared to $6.6 million for the nine months ended Sept. 30, 2023.\n\n\n\n**Looking Ahead** Quoin is committed to advancing its clinical programs and remains focused on expanding the potential indications for QRX003. The company’s efforts in initiating clinical studies in additional rare disease indications, such as Peeling Skin Syndrome, and expanding its global clinical footprint for Netherton Syndrome trials are crucial steps in Quoin’s strategy to bring new treatments to patients with serious unmet needs.\n\nThe Company continues to evaluate M&A opportunities within the rare and orphan disease space as part of its long-term growth strategy.\n\nInvestors are encouraged to read the Company’s Report on Form 10-Q when it is filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), which will contain additional details about Quoin’s financial results as of and for the period ended Sept. 30, 2024.\n\n**About Quoin Pharmaceuticals Ltd.** Quoin Pharmaceuticals Ltd. is a clinical-stage specialty pharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing therapeutic products that treat rare and orphan diseases.

Forward-looking statements may be identified by the use of words referencing future events or circumstances such as “expect,” “intend,” “plan,” “anticipate,” “believe,” “look forward to,” and “will,” among others. All statements that reflect the Company’s expectations, assumptions, projections, beliefs, or opinions about the future, other than statements of historical fact, are forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, statements relating to: plans to initiate clinical study in peeling skin syndrome and the timing thereof, planned series of new indications for QRX003, look forward to announcing additional expansion into other countries in the future, advancing the Company’s clinical programs and expanding the potential indications for QRX003, initiating clinical studies in additional rare disease indication (such as Peeling Skin Syndrome), expanding the Company’s global clinical footprint for Netherton Syndrome trials, continuing to evaluate M&A opportunities in rare and orphan diseases, , plans to further expand in Western and Eastern Europe, the Company’s expected cash runway, and Quoin’s belief that its products in development collectively have the potential to target a broad number of rare and orphan indications, including Netherton Syndrome, Peeling Skin Syndrome, Palmoplantar Keratoderma, Scleroderma, Epidermolysis Bullosa and others. Because such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are based upon the Company’s current expectations and involve assumptions that may never materialize or may prove to be incorrect. Actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from those anticipated in such forward-looking statements as a result of various risks and uncertainties including, but not limited to, the timing of the clinical studies may be delayed, the clinical studies may not generate the results anticipated, the Company being unable to expand into a number of EU countries as planned, the Company needing to raise additional funds sooner than planned, or the clinical studies not generating data which is sufficiently robust and comprehensive to support an NDA filing and the Company’s ability to obtain regulatory approvals. More detailed information about the risks and uncertainties affecting the Company is summarized in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 and in other filings the Company has made and may make with the SEC in the future. One should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date on which they were made. The Company undertakes no obligation to update such statements to reflect events that occur or circumstances that exist after the date on which they were made, except as may be required by law.\n\n**For further information:****PCG Advisory** Jeff Ramson646-863-6893[jramson@pcgadvisory.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=FwiJnvvSY6K4ELq67X12gAI1Gg1Ddh5X7YNgX7K_5_asA9DhIIks0-g_o8rtYuj2U1hd13e6ud5z8L-CRJH2kPT5MEjGysNyLPK0sUtecWQCqveQk9D-5Icsf-VABnmkQJA2fdmiZTsnHVZSh4zh254MuDDXbksN5yo5x7F0x1K-GRmNzPIkbuGMKU-lvJ5wCyXvbtd0J7Pi8Y425wFvPa3D1cfk2UJKfKh6Px-U4rLdj_Af-VkumpppBfsIuRXB6e9hzSjknmtJMIPE-h86gzic5on8FV6IU1TkgSx-ZW8ORfWOunTH5I5FaXtmxMC06adJL4i2xGnTF90Xnue8uDXCu0v1N_DDP2W0dNw5YoZkwQLahhmg62raOl7KxDkYq4k9EXlAsGvOJMhMwXTN8UVyMRgC6TKgKr5JgO-bmgwZmZ-GnJeDG6n4KWJvIVZGlSRkvfCYsGo4J9dgA19t0LnFBo8l-JFPy_Cuou-rx2Rho9xs-EVEcOeKe-kZm4wuMqfuQCzq05nrGAC1TXqNHqsd68k0cFlK4fcVy74ksidT4NIKrSOG3tqRbZGaph-FZbOnyMPfA2RXgUUlQvkDEj5xvAshtIuBi-a44TOGMROK66KJoIL9ybTEd4w5t6LVllPiuc2ZYjuO_3z-03Pnm0ya4jM45VDcyJjOrM2VpRfBqb9D6DQc7a7u-xbDckz3XGklO1jgsmnEAxi5hUxJmYRORFo_eVvZKOQJ8r8NbfienyXumhbkmcOA_FhxKTbpO0CEDsbeWFEapFajedY3A9rrUeTGtczoTM7tLSR2f0TrDWbg1WQWP3oLnt_C9SDdAm0bgNfyCJ0N7JljHUA1bCnkT8fduGyHOsvpfatdB3wNcxh2MJF3IO-QrZlrRSvEx8V5D2hAzoMULd5hdBeXxIvk17O_gcexej5O7zeoRvSfr7gQP7_DPC6N0UaMdy01y6hAJAy2F9OFsEzfcWJldiu1vzmTiayauVj4jLN0yqCouw7f_i7Ei2XG5SiwF5eopmMjPnZikPi4H1eSroLOxopCTW8VloD0zg5X-ua9t-yNITBY2WkLzf6cjx1xCt8En4ghS4VScAf02bNR6fzNpJUJaaTjf2sV_ZF6BSaoFRPjWBvMAvsx8KIp8uA4RLz0oVfycCxgJzmDZMUlrjuFWjS4kFCn4lbTUq1QYySFPPM4UD5orImpmdFBe3sHFQxr)\n\n-tables follow-\n\n**QUOIN PHARMACEUTICALS, LTD.**  \n---  \n**Consolidated Balance Sheets**  \n**September 30,**| **December 31,**  \n**2024**| **2023**  \n**(Unaudited)**  \nASSETS  \nCurrent assets:  \nCash and cash equivalents| $| 3,116,750| $| 2,401,198  \nInvestments| 7,190,138| 8,293,663  \nPrepaid expenses and other current assets| 190,541| 591,034  \nTotal current assets| 10,497,429| 11,285,895  \nPrepaid expenses - long term| 383,390| 300,000  \nIntangible assets, net| 508,334| 583,334  \nTotal assets| $| 11,389,153| $| 12,169,229  \nLIABILITIES AND SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY  \nCurrent liabilities:  \nAccounts payable| $| 222,636| $| 526,523  \nAccrued expenses| 1,504,852| 1,308,706  \nAccrued interest and financing expense| 1,146,251| 1,146,251  \nDue to officers - short term| 600,000| 600,000  \nTotal current liabilities| 3,473,739| 3,581,480  \nDue to officers - long term| 2,473,733| 2,923,733  \nTotal liabilities| $| 5,947,472| $| 6,505,213  \nShareholders' equity:  \nOrdinary shares, no par value per share, 100,000,000 ordinary shares authorized at| $| -| $| -  \nSeptember 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively - 5,049,720 (5,049,720 ADS's) ordinary shares issued and outstanding at September 30, 2024 and 987,220 (987,220 ADS's) at December 31, 2023  \nAdditional paid in capital| 58,296,199| 51,867,336  \nAccumulated deficit| (52,854,518| )| (46,203,320| )  \nTotal shareholders' equity| 5,441,681| 5,664,016  \nTotal liabilities and shareholders' equity| $| 11,389,153| $| 12,169,229  \n  \n**QUOIN PHARMACEUTICALS, LTD.**  \n---  \n**Consolidated Statements of Operations (unaudited)**  \n**Nine months ended September 30,**| **Three months ended September 30,**  \n**2024**| **2023**| **2024**| **2023**  \nOperating expenses  \nGeneral and administrative| $| 4,590,936| $| 4,685,241| $| 1,357,715| $| 1,366,464  \nResearch and development| 2,532,468| 2,475,596| 1,170,287| 758,759  \nTotal operating expenses| 7,123,404| 7,160,837| 2,528,002| 2,125,223  \nOther (income) and expenses  \nUnrealized (gain) loss| (23,043| )| 11,926| (31,729| )| (2,119| )  \nRealized and accrued interest income| (449,163| )| (536,068| )| (146,388| )| (196,425| )  \nTotal other income| (472,206| )| (524,142| )| (178,117| )| (198,544| )  \nNet loss| $| (6,651,198| )| $| (6,636,695| )| $| (2,349,885| )| $| (1,926,679| )  \nLoss per ADS  \nBasic| $| (1.63| )| $| (7.61| )| $| (0.47| )| $| (1.95| )  \nFully-diluted| $| (1.63| )| $| (7.61| )| $| (0.47| )| $| (1.95| )  \nWeighted average number of ADS's outstanding  \nBasic| 4,071,162| 871,835| 5,049,720| 987,220  \nFully-diluted| 4,071,162| 871,835| 5,049,720| 987,220  \n  \n![](https://ml.globenewswire.com/media/NTBhZDQ3NGEtYTBlNS00ZmVmLThiODAtZDlkYzlhNTAyYTRjLTEyMjEwMTA=/tiny/Quoin-Pharmaceuticals-Inc-.png)\n\nManage consent\n"

(NASDAQ: QNRX), a clinical-stage specialty pharmaceutical company focused on novel treatments for rare and orphan diseases, today announced that it has initiated the testing of the safety and efficacy of QRX003 in a young child with Netherton Syndrome (NS), a rare inherited genetic disease. There is currently no approved treatment for NS and no cure.\n\nThe clinical assessment is being led by Dr. Alan Irvine, a consultant dermatologist at Children’s Health Ireland and professor of dermatology at Trinity College Dublin. Dr. Irvine is president of the International Eczema Council and an elected member of the Royal Irish Academy. He has published over 250 peer-reviewed papers in high-impact journals, including many on epithelial genetics.\n\n“We are pleased to announce this latest initiative for Quoin as we strive to generate the broadest and most diverse data set possible for QRX003 in Netherton Syndrome patients. Furthermore, we are delighted that Professor Irvine, one of the world’s leading researchers in this disease, has agreed to perform this assessment of QRX003. Currently, we are testing patients aged 14 years and up in our two ongoing clinical studies and we hope that data generated by Professor Irvine will facilitate lowering the eligibility age further. In addition, we look forward to broadening the scope of this clinical assessment to include three additional pediatric subjects in Spain,” said Dr. Michael Myers, Quoin CEO.\n\nQRX003 is Quoin’s most advanced pipeline product and is currently being evaluated in two late-stage clinical trials as a potential treatment for NS under an open Investigational New Drug application with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Clinical data generated to date for QRX003 in NS patients has been promising with all evaluable subjects demonstrating improvement across a number of endpoints with no treatment-related adverse events recorded. In addition to the five open clinical sites in the United States, a sixth site is opening in Saudi Arabia. On October 22, Quoin also announced the planned opening of two additional clinical sites in the United Kingdom, each of which has a cohort of patients potentially eligible for recruitment.\n\n**About Netherton Syndrome** Netherton Syndrome, a form of Ichthyosis, is a rare hereditary skin disorder caused by a mutation in the SPINK5 gene (serine protease inhibitor, Kazal Type 5) that leads to severe skin barrier defects and recurring infections, as well as a pronounced predisposition to allergies, asthma, and eczema. Patients often suffer from severe dehydration, chronic skin inflammation and stunted growth. Currently, there is no cure for Netherton Syndrome, nor are there any approved therapeutic treatments.\n\n**About QRX003** QRX003 is a topical lotion formulated with a proprietary delivery technology that contains a broad-spectrum serine protease inhibitor, whose mechanism of action is intended to perform the function of a specific protein called LEKTI. The absence of LEKTI in Netherton patients leads to excessive skin shedding, resulting in a highly porous and compromised skin barrier. QRX003 is designed to promote a more normalized skin-shedding process and the formation of a stronger and more effective skin barrier.\n\nFor more information about Quoin’s current clinical trials please visit: [_https://www.nethertonsyndromeclinicaltrials.com/_](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=_BK0-gmm2VRNDurjjDlN7ak1_r1s2E6MbdGmGeK4LnBXM_z9uns58cc-lPYQP20ae9og_Of9xq9hLaWKqSzzEE8mnz_y2D2tTAmZ5Rc755qaJYMF7QmC3hIsdKzDL2wWEpyiYzbSV02bGlnd2PIiJmdrCU0M7Pei3V-2FbF927H_rFYijaYPPy9VvflVdZpwi79Pqtn1yd_EiuMzCj8v-YYchfU0wwncjSWnNxBDeXedLVP-4G2YsQXqRAUIFG8fhKpTfdOkjJ5cbWw1DdU78Ckn-km0XlWBvzU4it6sW-ZUEGA5AZOW3arJ2s70Av01JX2E07nUwc367EVfsGCUl5-X_Vc634tHz252KKWrYFLRZkT_JUcU7YbNq-gvmzsMnpJvrtS-ztrcmlDexyxO7U0oRHvnPVNRv9wQbQX343wTAfR7ENsgaYJVYq449YXBWm50vkpZP5CnQXS7m4ID3Kb1jVPd8SsugqW8WYoS5UKyJAho8ipCNtlka8Os3mqHzXVxpBYmfJTemCiXR76rSh1htOXDAXQverF3HtWfG0i9fJtFDYOkWk9EPuBSTtjyJbAXirI3iX8fZKh3yEce9XvV3zEpRQ8tdznn7hVaKOOF8Kj9UWKQDpBBDdOc6ITuvDzBpP9u8P8T9-N_If0mILgBrtUNvZVBi2r8tdfOtuZAgomSjny0EWHq1tDUk7mUIYeptkmD-RO5czcoIjcrFSQIU9O2PoQM37osPugiqRy_9riD0caysqvqwgTQstFSOjRM7luWokp093vwsyGjEiHvf8YvRq5oyqsa5T9KoMQEusjhDVDTrM3lCoV45n-izhMKnLe6-0znjub0yG09U3os7es0-aVaLkBzrVF-FCLUBrV6k7D_U_QnSnQ3xd5lu87-_KHaKpnaPB8wHGLEjL3ZZQfn_-T5wAKw4ZFxYXPnxYhsGY6Q2S10IsfTOhQQ3ThTqTElZcIrlxHc7UfXO08wKxWR8Ud3Z8etUD4wAwaQwCSc4WjdjePpv1tFOCrTtsGjl-cVITOOUnrHeG0mEfKEkD7Fb9PI8K7oi6lZdPw=)\n\n**About Quoin Pharmaceuticals Ltd.** Quoin Pharmaceuticals Ltd. is an emerging specialty pharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing therapeutic products that treat rare and orphan diseases.

Forward-looking statements may be identified by the use of words referencing future events or circumstances such as “expect,” “intend,” “plan,” “anticipate,” “believe,” and “will,” among others. All statements that reflect the Company’s expectations, assumptions, projections, beliefs, or opinions about the future, other than statements of historical fact, are forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, -a second clinical site to open in Spain with potentially three additional pediatric Netherton patients, the Company striving to generate the broadest and most diverse data set possible for QRX003 in Netherton Syndrome patients, the Company hoping that data generated by Professor Irvine will facilitate the Company lowering the eligibility age further, the Company opening a sixth site in Saudi Arabia, a planned opening of two additional clinical sites in the United Kingdom (each of which has a cohort of patients potentially eligible for recruitment), and Quoin’s products in development collectively having the potential to target a broad number of rare and orphan indications, including Netherton Syndrome, Peeling Skin Syndrome, Palmoplantar Keratoderma, Scleroderma, Epidermolysis Bullosa and others. Because such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are based upon the Company’s current expectations and involve assumptions that may never materialize or may prove to be incorrect. Actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from those anticipated in such forward-looking statements as a result of various risks and uncertainties including, but not limited to, the Company’s ability to deliver a safe and effective treatment for Netherton Syndrome, the clinical study may not be successful may not generate data which is sufficiently robust and comprehensive to support lowering the eligibility age further, the Company’s ability to open the planned sites as and when planned and and other factors discussed in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 and in other filings the Company has made and may make with the SEC in the future. One should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date on which they were made.
