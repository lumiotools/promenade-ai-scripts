Reports Third-Quarter 2024 Financial Results\n\nNov 7, 2024 at 4:10 PM EST\n\n[PDF Version](/node/11271/pdf)\n\nOAKLAND, Calif., Nov. 07, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- ContextLogic Inc. (Nasdaq: LOGC), (“ContextLogic,” the “Company,” “we” or “our”) today reported its financial results for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2024.\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Highlights**\n\n  * _Net Loss_ : Net loss was $1 million, compared to a net loss of $80 million in the third quarter of 2023.\n  * As of September 30, 2024, the Company had $33 million in cash and cash equivalents, $117 million in marketable securities and $8 million in prepaid expenses and other current assets (primarily made up of $7 million in restricted cash). \n\n\n\n**Company Outlook**\n\nOver the last quarter, the Company has created a streamlined administrative structure as it focuses on achieving its strategic goals of acquiring and/or building operating businesses. Management and the Board of Directors are focused on identifying, evaluating and potentially executing strategic opportunities for the benefit of ContextLogic and its stockholders. \n\nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company incurred $3 million of general and administrative expenses primarily related to legal expenses, employee expenses, and other professional services. At the conclusion of the three months ended September 30, 2024, ContextLogic had eight full-time employees.\n\nThe Company earned interest income of $2 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024. With the Company's marketable securities and cash and cash equivalents primarily invested in U.S. government instruments, and subject to changes in interest rates, we expect to earn approximately $2 million of interest income in fourth quarter of fiscal 2024. We project to end fiscal 2024 with cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and restricted cash of approximately $155 million, excluding any advisory costs we may incur in connection with a strategic transaction.\n\nIn addition to the marketable securities and cash and cash equivalents that primarily make up its balance sheet, the Company also has deferred tax assets (including net operating losses) that are currently subject to a full valuation allowance as of September 30, 2024 and as such have a net balance of $0 million as presented on the balance sheet. As set forth in Note 9. Income Taxes in the Notes to the audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023 as contained in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K, as of December 31, 2023 the Company reported a deferred tax asset – net operating losses of $609 million and aggregate deferred tax assets of $671 million, subject to a full valuation allowance until the Company can demonstrate that it is more likely than not that the Company can generate income to utilize such NOLs and the valuation allowance can be released in part or in full. \n\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company reported total liabilities of $5 million and expects the total liabilities to remain low until the Company identifies future targets to utilize and leverage its liquid assets with the goal of building stockholder value. \n\n“We continue to review, identify and evaluate strategic opportunities with our advisors,” said Rishi Bajaj, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board. “We have made encouraging progress over the past several months and are optimistic that we will provide stakeholders with a more substantive update in the coming quarters.” \n\n**About ContextLogic**\n\nContextLogic Inc. is a publicly traded company that previously completed the sale of substantially all of its operating assets and liabilities in April 2024.

Reports Second-Quarter Financial Results\n\nAug 8, 2024 at 4:16 PM EDT\n\n[PDF Version](/node/11226/pdf)\n\nOAKLAND, Calif., Aug. 08, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- ContextLogic Inc. (Nasdaq: LOGC), (“ContextLogic,” the “Company,” “we” or “our”) today reported its financial results for the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2024.\n\n**Company Update**\n\nOn February 10, 2024, the Company entered into an asset purchase agreement (the “Asset Purchase Agreement”) with Qoo10 Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Qoo10 Delaware”), and, for certain specified purposes, Qoo10 Pte. Ltd., a Singapore private limited company and Qoo10 Delaware’s parent company (“Qoo10”), pursuant to which (i) the Company agreed to sell substantially all of its assets to Qoo10 Delaware or an affiliate designated by Qoo10 Delaware (such designated affiliate, the “Buyer”), other than (A) the Company’s net operating losses (“NOLs”) and certain other tax attributes, (B) the Company’s marketable securities and (C) certain of the Company’s cash and cash equivalents, and (ii) Qoo10 agreed to acquire those assets and assume substantially all of the Company’s liabilities as specified in the Asset Purchase Agreement (the “Asset Sale”). On April 18, 2024, the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of the Company’s common stock voted to approve the Asset Sale. Pursuant to such vote and satisfaction of other customary closing conditions, the Asset Sale closed on April 19, 2024, and immediately following the closing of the Asset Sale, the Company received/retained approximately $162 million in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities (consisting of government securities) (“Post-Closing Cash”), as well as the NOLs and other tax attributes described in the Company’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2024. As part of the Asset Sale, the Buyer assumed substantially all of the Company’s liabilities at closing.\n\nPrior to the Asset Sale, the Company owned and operated the Wish platform (“Wish”), which is a mobile e-commerce platform. As a result of the Asset Sale, the Wish platform and all related operating assets were sold to the Buyer. Following the completion of the Asset Sale on April 19, 2024, the Company ceased to operate the prior e-commerce business and other historical operations. The financial statements presented in the Company’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, as filed with the SEC, reflect the pre-Asset Sale operations from April 1, 2024 to April 19, 2024, the results of the Asset Sale, and the limited post-Asset Sale activities from April 20, 2024 to June 30, 2024.\n\n**Second Quarter 2024 Financial Highlights**\n\n  * _Net Loss_ : Net loss was $13 million, compared to a net loss of $80 million in the second quarter of 2023.\n  * As of June 30, 2024, the Company had $103 million in cash and cash equivalents, $47 million in marketable securities and $9 million in prepaid expenses and other current assets (primarily made up of $7 million restricted cash).\n\n\n\n**Company Outlook**\n\nWith the completion of the Asset Sale, the Company began reshaping and re-establishing its operations. The goal is to set up a reduced administrative structure to maintain the Company as it begins to evaluate and execute on its strategic goals of acquiring and/or building operating businesses and otherwise utilizing our NOLs. Management and the Board of Directors will focus on identifying, evaluating and potentially executing strategic opportunities for the benefit of ContextLogic and its stockholders.\n\nDuring the three months ended June 30, 2024, the Company incurred $13 million of general and administrative expenses. Of the incurred general and administrative expenses, $9 million were costs directly associated with prior operations and/or the closing of the Asset Sale, including $2 million of stock-based compensation. All revenue, cost of sales, sales and marketing, product development were related to the prior operations.\n\nThe Company earned interest income of $2 million during the three months ended June 30, 2024. With the Company’s marketable securities and cash and cash equivalents primarily invested in U.S. government instruments, we expected to earn approximately $2 million of interest income per quarter for the remainder of 2024. At the conclusion of the second quarter, ContextLogic had twelve full-time employees, which has since been further reduced to ten full-time employees. The Company will continue to reduce expenses throughout the year and we project to end 2024 with cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and restricted cash of approximately $155 million, excluding any advisory costs we may incur in connection with a strategic transaction.\n\nIn addition to the marketable securities and cash and cash equivalents that primarily make up its balance sheet, the Company also has deferred tax assets (including net operating losses) that are currently subject to a full valuation allowance as of June 30, 2024 and as such have a net balance of $0 million as presented on the balance sheet. As set forth in Note 9. Income Taxes in the Notes to the audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023 as contained in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K, as of December 31, 2023 the Company reported a deferred tax asset – net operating losses of $609 million and aggregate deferred tax assets of $671 million, subject to a full valuation allowance until the Company can demonstrate that it is more likely than not that the Company can generate income to utilize such NOLs and the valuation allowance can be released in part or in full.\n\nAs of June 30, 2024, the Company reported total liabilities of $5 million and expects the total liabilities to remain low until the Company identifies future targets to utilize and leverage its liquid assets with the goal of building stockholder value.\n\n“We have begun reviewing and identifying strategic opportunities with our advisors,” said Rishi Bajaj, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board. “These opportunities will potentially allow the Company to utilize the NOLs and certain other tax attributes which can generate substantial value for our shareholders. We look forward to updating you in the coming quarters regarding our progress.”\n\n**About ContextLogic** Following the completion of the Asset Sale, the Company began trading under a new Nasdaq ticker symbol, “LOGC,” on May 13, 2024.

Reports Third-Quarter 2024 Financial Results\n\nNov 7, 2024 at 4:10 PM EST\n\n[PDF Version](/node/11271/pdf)\n\nOAKLAND, Calif., Nov. 07, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- ContextLogic Inc. (Nasdaq: LOGC), (“ContextLogic,” the “Company,” “we” or “our”) today reported its financial results for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2024.\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Highlights**\n\n  * _Net Loss_ : Net loss was $1 million, compared to a net loss of $80 million in the third quarter of 2023.\n  * As of September 30, 2024, the Company had $33 million in cash and cash equivalents, $117 million in marketable securities and $8 million in prepaid expenses and other current assets (primarily made up of $7 million in restricted cash). \n\n\n\n**Company Outlook**\n\nOver the last quarter, the Company has created a streamlined administrative structure as it focuses on achieving its strategic goals of acquiring and/or building operating businesses. Management and the Board of Directors are focused on identifying, evaluating and potentially executing strategic opportunities for the benefit of ContextLogic and its stockholders. \n\nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company incurred $3 million of general and administrative expenses primarily related to legal expenses, employee expenses, and other professional services. At the conclusion of the three months ended September 30, 2024, ContextLogic had eight full-time employees.\n\nThe Company earned interest income of $2 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024. With the Company's marketable securities and cash and cash equivalents primarily invested in U.S. government instruments, and subject to changes in interest rates, we expect to earn approximately $2 million of interest income in fourth quarter of fiscal 2024. We project to end fiscal 2024 with cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and restricted cash of approximately $155 million, excluding any advisory costs we may incur in connection with a strategic transaction.\n\nIn addition to the marketable securities and cash and cash equivalents that primarily make up its balance sheet, the Company also has deferred tax assets (including net operating losses) that are currently subject to a full valuation allowance as of September 30, 2024 and as such have a net balance of $0 million as presented on the balance sheet. As set forth in Note 9. Income Taxes in the Notes to the audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023 as contained in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K, as of December 31, 2023 the Company reported a deferred tax asset – net operating losses of $609 million and aggregate deferred tax assets of $671 million, subject to a full valuation allowance until the Company can demonstrate that it is more likely than not that the Company can generate income to utilize such NOLs and the valuation allowance can be released in part or in full. \n\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company reported total liabilities of $5 million and expects the total liabilities to remain low until the Company identifies future targets to utilize and leverage its liquid assets with the goal of building stockholder value. \n\n“We continue to review, identify and evaluate strategic opportunities with our advisors,” said Rishi Bajaj, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board. “We have made encouraging progress over the past several months and are optimistic that we will provide stakeholders with a more substantive update in the coming quarters.” \n\n**About ContextLogic**\n\nContextLogic Inc. is a publicly traded company that previously completed the sale of substantially all of its operating assets and liabilities in April 2024.

New risks emerge from time to time. It is not possible for our management to predict all risks, nor can we assess the impact of all factors on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements we may make.
