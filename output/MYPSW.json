(NASDAQ: MYPS) (“PLAYSTUDIOS” or the “Company”), an award-winning developer of free-to-play mobile and social games and the developer of the playAWARDS loyalty platform, today announced financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024.\n\nAndrew Pascal, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of PLAYSTUDIOS, commented, “Despite continued industry pressures, revenues and consolidated AEBITDA came in above consensus expectations this quarter. AEBITDA margins increased to 20.5% and we believe further gains are achievable. We made progress on our many strategic initiatives this quarter including raising the monetization of our games, expanding the Tetris Brand, a full integration of playAWARDS, furthering our DTC initiative, and evaluating new growth opportunities.”\n\nHe continued, “We are also announcing our newly instituted reinvention program. The program will meaningfully lower our cost structure, increase our profitability, and better position our company for long term growth.”\n\n**Third Quarter Financial Highlights**\n\n  * **Revenue** was $71.2 million during the third quarter of 2024, compared to $75.9 million during the third quarter of 2023.\n  * **Net loss** was $3.1 million during the third quarter of 2024, representing a net loss margin of 4.3%, compared to net loss of $3.8 million during the third quarter of 2023, representing a net loss margin of 5.0%.\n  * **Consolidated AEBITDA** , a non-GAAP financial measure defined below, was $14.6 million during the third quarter of 2024, compared to $13.5 million during the third quarter of 2023.\n  * **Consolidated AEBITDA Margins** were 20.5% in the quarter, a 270 basis point increase versus the third quarter of 2023 and a 100 basis point increase versus the second quarter of 2024.\n  * **KPIs playGAMES.** During the third quarter of 2024, PLAYSTUDIOS had Average DAU and Average MAU of 3.0 million and 12.7 million, respectively. ARPDAU was $0.26.\n  * **KPIs playAWARDS.** During the third quarter of 2024, players purchased 451,300 rewards with a retail value of $25 million.\n  * **Liquidity**. As of September 30, 2024, cash and cash equivalents on the balance sheet was $105.2 million. PLAYSTUDIOS’ $81 million revolving credit facility remains undrawn.\n  * **Shares outstanding.** As of September 30, 2024, the Company had 125.2 million shares outstanding.\n\n\n\n**Recent Business Highlights**\n\n  * Launched our reinvention program that will result in a material reduction in costs and increase in profitability. The program will include a reduction in workforce, suspension of sub-scale game development, and consolidation of key business functions, which we expect to result in normalized annual cost savings of approximately $25 million to $30 million.\n  * Resumed the repurchase of stock in the open market. Year to date, we have repurchased an aggregate of 13.6 million shares of our Class A common stock at an average price of $2.15 per share. The remaining availability under our $50 million stock repurchase program was $45.5 million after the most recent purchases.\n  * myVEGAS and Brainium saw double digit increases in ARPDAU in the third quarter compared to the previous year. Each game continues to benefit from recent efforts to increase monetization.\n  * Recently acquired Pixode Games Limited has been integrated into our operations and we have begun work on our new Tetris title. Our goal is to have the game complete and in the market in 2025.\n  * Successfully hosted the inaugural myVIP World Tournament of Slots. The tournament drove increased engagement in our games and elevated awareness of our brands.\n\n\n\n**Outlook**\n\nThe Company is maintaining full year 2024 guidance of net revenue in the range of $285 to $295 million and Consolidated AEBITDA in the range of $55 to $60 million.\n\nWe have not provided the most directly comparable GAAP measure for our Consolidated AEBITDA outlook because certain items that are part of the projected non-GAAP financial measure are outside of our control or cannot be reasonably estimated without unreasonable effort.\n\n**Conference Call Details**\n\nPLAYSTUDIOS will host a conference call at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time today, which will include a brief discussion of the results followed by a question and answer session.\n\nThe call will be accessible via the Internet through <https://ir.playstudios.com> or by calling (866) 405-1203 for domestic callers and (201) 689-8432 for international callers.\n\nA replay of the call will be archived at <https://ir.playstudios.com>.\n\n**About PLAYSTUDIOS, Inc.**\n\nPLAYSTUDIOS (Nasdaq: MYPS) is the creator of the groundbreaking playAWARDS loyalty platform is a publisher and developer of award-winning mobile games, including the iconic Tetris® mobile app, Pop!

Our key performance metrics are impacted by several factors that could cause them to fluctuate on a quarterly basis, such as platform providers’ policies, seasonality, player connectivity, and the addition of new content to games. We believe these measures are useful to investors for the same reasons. The key performance indicators may differ from similarly titled measures presented by other companies. For more information on our key performance indicators, please refer to the definitions below and the “Supplemental Data—playGAMES Key Performance Indicators” and “Supplemental Data—playAWARDS Key Performance Indicators”sections of this press release.\n\nDaily Active Users (“DAU”): DAU is defined as the number of individuals who played a game on a particular day. We track DAU by the player ID, which is assigned for each game installed by an individual. As such, an individual who plays two different PLAYSTUDIOS games on the same day is counted as two DAU while an individual who plays the same PLAYSTUDIOS game on two different devices is counted as one DAU. Brainium tracks DAU by app instance ID, which is assigned to each installation of a game on a particular device. As such, an individual who plays two different Brainium games on the same day is counted as two DAU while an individual who plays the same game on two different devices is counted as two DAU. The term “Average DAU” is defined as the average of the DAU, determined as described above, for each day during the period presented. We use DAU and Average DAU as measures of audience engagement to help us understand the size of the active player base engaged with our games on a daily basis.\n\nMonthly Active Users (“MAU”): MAU is defined as the number of individuals who played a game in a particular month. As with DAU, an individual who plays two different PLAYSTUDIOS games in the same month is counted as two MAU while an individual who plays the same game on two different devices is counted as one MAU, and an individual who plays two different Brainium games on the same day is counted as two MAU while an individual who plays the same game on two different devices is counted as two MAU. The term “Average MAU” is defined as the average of the MAU, determined as described above, for each calendar month during the period presented. We use MAU and Average MAU as measures of audience engagement to help us understand the size of the active player base engaged with our games on a monthly basis.\n\nDaily Paying Users (“DPU”): DPU is defined as the number of individuals who made a purchase in a mobile game during a particular day. As with DAU and MAU, we track DPU based on account activity. As such, an individual who makes a purchase on two different games in a particular day is counted as two DPU while an individual who makes purchases in the same game on two different devices is counted as one DPU. The term “Average DPU” is defined as the average of the DPU, determined as described above, for each day during the period presented. We use DPU and Average DPU to help us understand the size of our active player base that makes in-game purchases. This focus directs our strategic goals in setting player acquisition and pricing strategy.\n\nDaily Payer Conversion: Daily Payer Conversion is defined as DPU as a percentage of DAU on a particular day. Daily Player Conversion is also sometimes referred to as “Percentage of Paying Users” or “PPU”. The term “Average Daily Payer Conversion” is defined as the Average DPU divided by the Average DAU for a given period. We use Daily Payer Conversion and Average Daily Payer Conversion to help us understand the monetization of our active players.\n\nAverage Daily Revenue Per DAU (“ARPDAU”): ARPDAU is defined for a given period as the average daily revenue per Average DAU, and is calculated as game and advertising revenue for the period, divided by the number of days in the period, divided by the Average DAU during the period. We use ARPDAU as a measure of overall monetization of our active players.\n\n**playAWARDS Platform Metrics**\n\nAvailable Rewards: Available Rewards is defined as the monthly average number of unique rewards available in our applications’ rewards stores. A reward appearing in more than one application’s reward store is counted only once. A reward is counted only once irrespective of the inventory available through that reward. For example, one reward for a free night in a hotel room with ten rooms available for such free night is counted as one reward. Available Rewards only include real-world partner rewards and exclude PLAYSTUDIOS digital rewards. We use Available Rewards as a measure of the value and potential impact of the program for an interested player. It is assumed that the greater the variety and breadth of rewards offered, the more likely players will be to ascribe value to the program.\n\nPurchases: Purchases is defined as the total number of rewards purchased for the period identified in which a player exchanges loyalty points for a reward. Purchases are net of refunds. Purchases only include purchases of real-world partner rewards and exclude any PLAYSTUDIOS digital rewards. Purchases are redeemed by the player directly with the rewards partner within the specified terms and conditions of the reward. The Company does not receive any compensation or revenue from Purchases. We use Purchases as a measure of audience interest and engagement with our playAWARDS platform.\n\nRetail Value of Purchases: Retail Value of Purchases is defined as the cumulative retail value of all rewards listed as Purchases for the period identified. The retail value of each reward listed as Purchases is the retail value as determined by the partner upon creation of the reward. In the case where the retail value of a reward adjusts depending on time of redemption, the average retail value is used. Retail Value of Purchases only include the retail value of real-world partner rewards and exclude the cost of any PLAYSTUDIOS branded merchandise. We use Retail Value of Purchases to help us understand the real-world value of the rewards that are purchased by our players.\n\n**Non-GAAP Financial Measures**\n\nTo provide investors with information in addition to results as determined by GAAP, the Company discloses Consolidated Adjusted Earnings Before Interest Taxes Depreciation and Amortization (“Consolidated AEBITDA”) as a non-GAAP measure that management believes provides useful information to investors. This measure is not a financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as a substitute for revenue, net income or any other operating performance measure calculated in accordance with GAAP.\n\nWe define Consolidated AEBITDA as net income (loss) before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, restructuring and related costs (consisting primarily of severance and other restructuring related costs), stock-based compensation expense, and other income and expense items (including special infrequent items, foreign currency gains and losses, and other non-cash items). We also present Consolidated AEBITDA margin, a non-GAAP measure, which we calculate as Consolidated AEBITDA as a percentage of net revenue.\n\nWe believe that the presentation of Consolidated AEBITDA provides useful information to investors regarding the Company’s results of operations because the measure assists both investors and management in analyzing and benchmarking the performance and value of our business. Consolidated AEBITDA provides an indicator of performance that is not affected by fluctuations in certain costs or other items. Accordingly, management believes that this measure is useful for comparing general operating performance from period to period, and management relies on this measure for planning and forecasting of future periods. Additionally, this measure allows management to compare results with those of other companies that have different financing and capital structures. However, other companies may define Consolidated AEBITDA differently, and as a result, our measure of Consolidated AEBITDA may not be directly comparable to that of other companies. For further information regarding these non-GAAP measures, including the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, please refer to the “Reconciliation of Net (Loss) Income to Consolidated AEBITDA” section of this press release.\n\n**Forward-Looking Statements**\n\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including statements regarding our future financial and operating performance (including statements regarding outlook or guidance), our liquidity and capital resources, the development and release plans of our games, the impact of business restructuring and cost control initiatives including estimated amounts and timing of anticipated cost reductions, and our mergers and acquisition strategy, all of which involve risks and uncertainties.

(NASDAQ: MYPS) (“PLAYSTUDIOS” or the “Company”), an award-winning developer of free-to-play mobile and social games and the developer of the playAWARDS loyalty platform, today announced financial results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2024.\n\n**Second Quarter Financial Highlights**\n\n  * Revenue was $72.6 million during the second quarter of 2024, compared to $77.8 million during the second quarter of 2023.\n  * Net loss was $2.6 million during the second quarter of 2024, representing a net loss margin of 3.6%, compared to net loss of $0.8 million during the second quarter of 2023, representing a net loss margin of 1.0%.\n  * Consolidated AEBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure defined below, was $14.1 million during the second quarter of 2024, compared to $16.3 million during the second quarter of 2023.\n\n\n\nAndrew Pascal, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of PLAYSTUDIOS, commented, “We had a busy and productive quarter completing many strategic initiatives that better position our company for future growth. While persistent industry weakness continues to be a challenge for our Social Casino portfolio, I believe we have opportunities in our portfolio that will eventually override this pressure. We have been steadily making progress on these efforts and continued to do so this quarter. Longer term, our focus remains on building a strong and durable business that can produce exceptional returns regardless of industry dynamics.”\n\nHe continued, “Quarterly revenues in our playGAMES division were down 4.6% vs. last year. Weakness in the social casino industry was the main driver of the shortfall with our core portfolio accounting for the majority of the year over year decline. We expect industry weakness to continue throughout the remainder of the year and have adjusted our full year outlook to reflect this. Despite the pressure, our focus remains on implementing structural changes within our games to improve their results regardless of how the industry performs. Our casual portfolio continued to perform strongly this quarter, growing year over year revenues by over 10%. The Tetris brand had its 40th anniversary in June and we celebrated with a refresh of Tetris Mobile and the limited release of a brand new game, Tetris Block Puzzle. Results at Brainium continue to trend strongly with ARPDAU rising on the back of new advertising initiatives.”\n\nHe added, “Consolidated AEBITDA and AEBITDA margins in the quarter were lower than a year ago due to the deleveraging effect of lower social casino revenues and the absence of a licensing deal that benefited second quarter 2023 results. With the expiration of the licensing agreement at the end of second quarter 2023, results will not be impacted by this comparability issue going forward. Consolidated AEBITDA and AEBITDA margins were higher in our growth portfolio with notable gains at Brainium. As implied in our revised guidance, we expect full year AEBITDA margins to be roughly flat with 2023 levels.”\n\nPascal further noted, “For playAWARDS, the focus remains on a full integration within our games. Where the platform is present, we’ve seen a marked increase in player engagement, retention, and monetization. The effect has further increased with the launch of myVIP World Tournament of Slots. This exciting campaign is just the latest way we are utilizing our industry leading loyalty platform to drive player excitement in our games.”\n\nHe concluded, “It was a significant quarter on the capital front as were able to purchase nearly 12 million of our shares from Microsoft Corporation. We were able to buy our stock at a meaningful discount to the average trading price and remove the potential overhang of a prolonged share sale. Combined with our open market purchases, we have bought back nearly 15% of our Class A shares in the past six quarters. This reflects our confidence in the intrinsic value of our company and highlights the undervaluation of our shares in the public markets. We believe this gap has never been higher than it is today. Despite the share purchase and the acquisition of Pixode, our balance sheet remains very strong with over $105 million in cash and no borrowings.”\n\n**Recent Business Highlights**\n\n  * Purchased 11.7 million shares of Class A common stock from Microsoft, or roughly 9% of our outstanding stock. The purchase was made at a discount to the average trading price and funded with available cash on hand.\n  * Announced and completed the acquisition of Pixode Games Limited. Pixode is an Israeli based game studio that has developed a block puzzle game incorporating a unique raid-and-defend mechanic.\n  * Celebrated the 40th anniversary of the Tetris brand with the refresh of our core Tetris game and the limited release of a new Tetris game, Tetris Block Puzzle.\n  * Launched myVIP World Tournament of Slots, which will take place October 24-27 at the Atlantis Paradise Island in the Bahamas. The tournament will feature 500 dedicated players competing for a top cash prize of $1.0 million.\n\n\n\n**Outlook**\n\nThe company is revising its 2024 guidance to incorporate continued weakness in the broader social casino category. Revenues are projected to be in the range of $285 and $295 million compared to the prior outlook of $315 to $325 million. Consolidated AEBITDA is expected to be between $55 and $60 million vs. prior expectations of $65 and $70 million.\n\nWe have not provided the most directly comparable GAAP measure for our Consolidated AEBITDA outlook because certain items that are part of the projected non-GAAP financial measure are outside of our control or cannot be reasonably estimated without unreasonable effort.\n\n**Conference Call Details**\n\nPLAYSTUDIOS will host a conference call at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time today, which will include a brief discussion of the results followed by a question and answer session.\n\nThe call will be accessible via the Internet through <https://ir.playstudios.com> or by calling (866) 405-1203 for domestic callers and (201) 689-8432 for international callers.\n\nA replay of the call will be archived at <https://ir.playstudios.com>.\n\n**About PLAYSTUDIOS, Inc.**\n\nPLAYSTUDIOS (Nasdaq: MYPS) is the creator of the groundbreaking playAWARDS loyalty platform is a publisher and developer of award-winning mobile games, including the iconic Tetris® mobile app, Pop!

Our key performance metrics are impacted by several factors that could cause them to fluctuate on a quarterly basis, such as platform providers’ policies, seasonality, player connectivity, and the addition of new content to games. We believe these measures are useful to investors for the same reasons. The key performance indicators may differ from similarly titled measures presented by other companies. For more information on our key performance indicators, please refer to the definitions below and the “Supplemental Data—Key Performance Indicators” section of this press release.\n\nDaily Active Users (“DAU”): DAU is defined as the number of individuals who played a game on a particular day. We track DAU by the player ID, which is assigned for each game installed by an individual. As such, an individual who plays two different PLAYSTUDIOS games on the same day is counted as two DAU while an individual who plays the same PLAYSTUDIOS game on two different devices is counted as one DAU. Brainium tracks DAU by app instance ID, which is assigned to each installation of a game on a particular device. As such, an individual who plays two different Brainium games on the same day is counted as two DAU while an individual who plays the same game on two different devices is counted as two DAU. The term “Average DAU” is defined as the average of the DAU, determined as described above, for each day during the period presented. We use DAU and Average DAU as measures of audience engagement to help us understand the size of the active player base engaged with our games on a daily basis.\n\nMonthly Active Users (“MAU”): MAU is defined as the number of individuals who played a game in a particular month. As with DAU, an individual who plays two different PLAYSTUDIOS games in the same month is counted as two MAU while an individual who plays the same game on two different devices is counted as one MAU, and an individual who plays two different Brainium games on the same day is counted as two MAU while an individual who plays the same game on two different devices is counted as two MAU. The term “Average MAU” is defined as the average of the MAU, determined as described above, for each calendar month during the period presented. We use MAU and Average MAU as measures of audience engagement to help us understand the size of the active player base engaged with our games on a monthly basis.\n\nDaily Paying Users (“DPU”): DPU is defined as the number of individuals who made a purchase in a mobile game during a particular day. As with DAU and MAU, we track DPU based on account activity. As such, an individual who makes a purchase on two different games in a particular day is counted as two DPU while an individual who makes purchases in the same game on two different devices is counted as one DPU. The term “Average DPU” is defined as the average of the DPU, determined as described above, for each day during the period presented. We use DPU and Average DPU to help us understand the size of our active player base that makes in-game purchases. This focus directs our strategic goals in setting player acquisition and pricing strategy.\n\nDaily Payer Conversion: Daily Payer Conversion is defined as DPU as a percentage of DAU on a particular day. Daily Player Conversion is also sometimes referred to as “Percentage of Paying Users” or “PPU”. The term “Average Daily Payer Conversion” is defined as the Average DPU divided by the Average DAU for a given period. We use Daily Payer Conversion and Average Daily Payer Conversion to help us understand the monetization of our active players.\n\nAverage Daily Revenue Per DAU (“ARPDAU”): ARPDAU is defined for a given period as the average daily revenue per Average DAU, and is calculated as game and advertising revenue for the period, divided by the number of days in the period, divided by the Average DAU during the period. We use ARPDAU as a measure of overall monetization of our active players.\n\n**playAWARDS Platform Metrics**\n\nAvailable Rewards: Available Rewards is defined as the monthly average number of unique rewards available in our applications’ rewards stores. A reward appearing in more than one application’s reward store is counted only once. A reward is counted only once irrespective of the inventory available through that reward. For example, one reward for a free night in a hotel room with ten rooms available for such free night is counted as one reward. Available Rewards only include real-world partner rewards and exclude PLAYSTUDIOS digital rewards. We use Available Rewards as a measure of the value and potential impact of the program for an interested player. It is assumed that the greater the variety and breadth of rewards offered, the more likely players will be to ascribe value to the program.\n\nPurchases: Purchases is defined as the total number of rewards purchased for the period identified in which a player exchanges loyalty points for a reward. Purchases are net of refunds. Purchases only include purchases of real-world partner rewards and exclude any PLAYSTUDIOS digital rewards. Purchases are redeemed by the player directly with the rewards partner within the specified terms and conditions of the reward. The Company does not receive any compensation or revenue from Purchases. We use Purchases as a measure of audience interest and engagement with our playAWARDS platform.\n\nRetail Value of Purchases: Retail Value of Purchases is defined as the cumulative retail value of all rewards listed as Purchases for the period identified. The retail value of each reward listed as Purchases is the retail value as determined by the partner upon creation of the reward. In the case where the retail value of a reward adjusts depending on time of redemption, the average retail value is used. Retail Value of Purchases only include the retail value of real-world partner rewards and exclude the cost of any PLAYSTUDIOS branded merchandise. We use Retail Value of Purchases to help us understand the real-world value of the rewards that are purchased by our players.\n\n**Non-GAAP Financial Measures**\n\nTo provide investors with information in addition to results as determined by GAAP, the Company discloses Consolidated Adjusted Earnings Before Interest Taxes Depreciation and Amortization (“Consolidated AEBITDA”) as a non-GAAP measure that management believes provides useful information to investors. This measure is not a financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as a substitute for revenue, net income or any other operating performance measure calculated in accordance with GAAP.\n\nWe define Consolidated AEBITDA as net income (loss) before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, restructuring and related costs (consisting primarily of severance and other restructuring related costs), stock-based compensation expense, and other income and expense items (including special infrequent items, foreign currency gains and losses, and other non-cash items). We also present Consolidated AEBITDA margin, a non-GAAP measure, which we calculate as Consolidated AEBITDA as a percentage of net revenue.\n\nWe believe that the presentation of Consolidated AEBITDA provides useful information to investors regarding the Company’s results of operations because the measure assists both investors and management in analyzing and benchmarking the performance and value of our business. Consolidated AEBITDA provides an indicator of performance that is not affected by fluctuations in certain costs or other items. Accordingly, management believes that this measure is useful for comparing general operating performance from period to period, and management relies on this measure for planning and forecasting of future periods. Additionally, this measure allows management to compare results with those of other companies that have different financing and capital structures. However, other companies may define Consolidated AEBITDA differently, and as a result, our measure of Consolidated AEBITDA may not be directly comparable to that of other companies. For further information regarding these non-GAAP measures, including the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, please refer to the “Reconciliation of Net Loss to Consolidated AEBITDA” section of this press release.\n\n**Forward-Looking Statements**\n\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including statements regarding our future financial and operating performance (including statements regarding outlook or guidance), our liquidity and capital resources, the development and release plans of our games, our plans to commercialize the playAWARDS platform as a stand-alone service for use by third parties, our increased capacity and use of personnel in European and Asian studios, and our mergers and acquisition strategy, all of which involve risks and uncertainties.

(NASDAQ: MYPS) (“PLAYSTUDIOS” or the “Company”), an award-winning developer of free-to-play mobile and social games and the developer of the playAWARDS loyalty platform, today announced financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024.\n\nAndrew Pascal, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of PLAYSTUDIOS, commented, “Despite continued industry pressures, revenues and consolidated AEBITDA came in above consensus expectations this quarter. AEBITDA margins increased to 20.5% and we believe further gains are achievable. We made progress on our many strategic initiatives this quarter including raising the monetization of our games, expanding the Tetris Brand, a full integration of playAWARDS, furthering our DTC initiative, and evaluating new growth opportunities.”\n\nHe continued, “We are also announcing our newly instituted reinvention program. The program will meaningfully lower our cost structure, increase our profitability, and better position our company for long term growth.”\n\n**Third Quarter Financial Highlights**\n\n  * **Revenue** was $71.2 million during the third quarter of 2024, compared to $75.9 million during the third quarter of 2023.\n  * **Net loss** was $3.1 million during the third quarter of 2024, representing a net loss margin of 4.3%, compared to net loss of $3.8 million during the third quarter of 2023, representing a net loss margin of 5.0%.\n  * **Consolidated AEBITDA** , a non-GAAP financial measure defined below, was $14.6 million during the third quarter of 2024, compared to $13.5 million during the third quarter of 2023.\n  * **Consolidated AEBITDA Margins** were 20.5% in the quarter, a 270 basis point increase versus the third quarter of 2023 and a 100 basis point increase versus the second quarter of 2024.\n  * **KPIs playGAMES.** During the third quarter of 2024, PLAYSTUDIOS had Average DAU and Average MAU of 3.0 million and 12.7 million, respectively. ARPDAU was $0.26.\n  * **KPIs playAWARDS.** During the third quarter of 2024, players purchased 451,300 rewards with a retail value of $25 million.\n  * **Liquidity**. As of September 30, 2024, cash and cash equivalents on the balance sheet was $105.2 million. PLAYSTUDIOS’ $81 million revolving credit facility remains undrawn.\n  * **Shares outstanding.** As of September 30, 2024, the Company had 125.2 million shares outstanding.\n\n\n\n**Recent Business Highlights**\n\n  * Launched our reinvention program that will result in a material reduction in costs and increase in profitability. The program will include a reduction in workforce, suspension of sub-scale game development, and consolidation of key business functions, which we expect to result in normalized annual cost savings of approximately $25 million to $30 million.\n  * Resumed the repurchase of stock in the open market. Year to date, we have repurchased an aggregate of 13.6 million shares of our Class A common stock at an average price of $2.15 per share. The remaining availability under our $50 million stock repurchase program was $45.5 million after the most recent purchases.\n  * myVEGAS and Brainium saw double digit increases in ARPDAU in the third quarter compared to the previous year. Each game continues to benefit from recent efforts to increase monetization.\n  * Recently acquired Pixode Games Limited has been integrated into our operations and we have begun work on our new Tetris title. Our goal is to have the game complete and in the market in 2025.\n  * Successfully hosted the inaugural myVIP World Tournament of Slots. The tournament drove increased engagement in our games and elevated awareness of our brands.\n\n\n\n**Outlook**\n\nThe Company is maintaining full year 2024 guidance of net revenue in the range of $285 to $295 million and Consolidated AEBITDA in the range of $55 to $60 million.\n\nWe have not provided the most directly comparable GAAP measure for our Consolidated AEBITDA outlook because certain items that are part of the projected non-GAAP financial measure are outside of our control or cannot be reasonably estimated without unreasonable effort.\n\n**Conference Call Details**\n\nPLAYSTUDIOS will host a conference call at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time today, which will include a brief discussion of the results followed by a question and answer session.\n\nThe call will be accessible via the Internet through <https://ir.playstudios.com> or by calling (866) 405-1203 for domestic callers and (201) 689-8432 for international callers.\n\nA replay of the call will be archived at <https://ir.playstudios.com>.\n\n**About PLAYSTUDIOS, Inc.**\n\nPLAYSTUDIOS (Nasdaq: MYPS) is the creator of the groundbreaking playAWARDS loyalty platform is a publisher and developer of award-winning mobile games, including the iconic Tetris® mobile app, Pop!

Our key performance metrics are impacted by several factors that could cause them to fluctuate on a quarterly basis, such as platform providers’ policies, seasonality, player connectivity, and the addition of new content to games. We believe these measures are useful to investors for the same reasons. The key performance indicators may differ from similarly titled measures presented by other companies. For more information on our key performance indicators, please refer to the definitions below and the “Supplemental Data—playGAMES Key Performance Indicators” and “Supplemental Data—playAWARDS Key Performance Indicators”sections of this press release.\n\nDaily Active Users (“DAU”): DAU is defined as the number of individuals who played a game on a particular day. We track DAU by the player ID, which is assigned for each game installed by an individual. As such, an individual who plays two different PLAYSTUDIOS games on the same day is counted as two DAU while an individual who plays the same PLAYSTUDIOS game on two different devices is counted as one DAU. Brainium tracks DAU by app instance ID, which is assigned to each installation of a game on a particular device. As such, an individual who plays two different Brainium games on the same day is counted as two DAU while an individual who plays the same game on two different devices is counted as two DAU. The term “Average DAU” is defined as the average of the DAU, determined as described above, for each day during the period presented. We use DAU and Average DAU as measures of audience engagement to help us understand the size of the active player base engaged with our games on a daily basis.\n\nMonthly Active Users (“MAU”): MAU is defined as the number of individuals who played a game in a particular month. As with DAU, an individual who plays two different PLAYSTUDIOS games in the same month is counted as two MAU while an individual who plays the same game on two different devices is counted as one MAU, and an individual who plays two different Brainium games on the same day is counted as two MAU while an individual who plays the same game on two different devices is counted as two MAU. The term “Average MAU” is defined as the average of the MAU, determined as described above, for each calendar month during the period presented. We use MAU and Average MAU as measures of audience engagement to help us understand the size of the active player base engaged with our games on a monthly basis.\n\nDaily Paying Users (“DPU”): DPU is defined as the number of individuals who made a purchase in a mobile game during a particular day. As with DAU and MAU, we track DPU based on account activity. As such, an individual who makes a purchase on two different games in a particular day is counted as two DPU while an individual who makes purchases in the same game on two different devices is counted as one DPU. The term “Average DPU” is defined as the average of the DPU, determined as described above, for each day during the period presented. We use DPU and Average DPU to help us understand the size of our active player base that makes in-game purchases. This focus directs our strategic goals in setting player acquisition and pricing strategy.\n\nDaily Payer Conversion: Daily Payer Conversion is defined as DPU as a percentage of DAU on a particular day. Daily Player Conversion is also sometimes referred to as “Percentage of Paying Users” or “PPU”. The term “Average Daily Payer Conversion” is defined as the Average DPU divided by the Average DAU for a given period. We use Daily Payer Conversion and Average Daily Payer Conversion to help us understand the monetization of our active players.\n\nAverage Daily Revenue Per DAU (“ARPDAU”): ARPDAU is defined for a given period as the average daily revenue per Average DAU, and is calculated as game and advertising revenue for the period, divided by the number of days in the period, divided by the Average DAU during the period. We use ARPDAU as a measure of overall monetization of our active players.\n\n**playAWARDS Platform Metrics**\n\nAvailable Rewards: Available Rewards is defined as the monthly average number of unique rewards available in our applications’ rewards stores. A reward appearing in more than one application’s reward store is counted only once. A reward is counted only once irrespective of the inventory available through that reward. For example, one reward for a free night in a hotel room with ten rooms available for such free night is counted as one reward. Available Rewards only include real-world partner rewards and exclude PLAYSTUDIOS digital rewards. We use Available Rewards as a measure of the value and potential impact of the program for an interested player. It is assumed that the greater the variety and breadth of rewards offered, the more likely players will be to ascribe value to the program.\n\nPurchases: Purchases is defined as the total number of rewards purchased for the period identified in which a player exchanges loyalty points for a reward. Purchases are net of refunds. Purchases only include purchases of real-world partner rewards and exclude any PLAYSTUDIOS digital rewards. Purchases are redeemed by the player directly with the rewards partner within the specified terms and conditions of the reward. The Company does not receive any compensation or revenue from Purchases. We use Purchases as a measure of audience interest and engagement with our playAWARDS platform.\n\nRetail Value of Purchases: Retail Value of Purchases is defined as the cumulative retail value of all rewards listed as Purchases for the period identified. The retail value of each reward listed as Purchases is the retail value as determined by the partner upon creation of the reward. In the case where the retail value of a reward adjusts depending on time of redemption, the average retail value is used. Retail Value of Purchases only include the retail value of real-world partner rewards and exclude the cost of any PLAYSTUDIOS branded merchandise. We use Retail Value of Purchases to help us understand the real-world value of the rewards that are purchased by our players.\n\n**Non-GAAP Financial Measures**\n\nTo provide investors with information in addition to results as determined by GAAP, the Company discloses Consolidated Adjusted Earnings Before Interest Taxes Depreciation and Amortization (“Consolidated AEBITDA”) as a non-GAAP measure that management believes provides useful information to investors. This measure is not a financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as a substitute for revenue, net income or any other operating performance measure calculated in accordance with GAAP.\n\nWe define Consolidated AEBITDA as net income (loss) before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, restructuring and related costs (consisting primarily of severance and other restructuring related costs), stock-based compensation expense, and other income and expense items (including special infrequent items, foreign currency gains and losses, and other non-cash items). We also present Consolidated AEBITDA margin, a non-GAAP measure, which we calculate as Consolidated AEBITDA as a percentage of net revenue.\n\nWe believe that the presentation of Consolidated AEBITDA provides useful information to investors regarding the Company’s results of operations because the measure assists both investors and management in analyzing and benchmarking the performance and value of our business. Consolidated AEBITDA provides an indicator of performance that is not affected by fluctuations in certain costs or other items. Accordingly, management believes that this measure is useful for comparing general operating performance from period to period, and management relies on this measure for planning and forecasting of future periods. Additionally, this measure allows management to compare results with those of other companies that have different financing and capital structures. However, other companies may define Consolidated AEBITDA differently, and as a result, our measure of Consolidated AEBITDA may not be directly comparable to that of other companies. For further information regarding these non-GAAP measures, including the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, please refer to the “Reconciliation of Net (Loss) Income to Consolidated AEBITDA” section of this press release.\n\n**Forward-Looking Statements**\n\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including statements regarding our future financial and operating performance (including statements regarding outlook or guidance), our liquidity and capital resources, the development and release plans of our games, the impact of business restructuring and cost control initiatives including estimated amounts and timing of anticipated cost reductions, and our mergers and acquisition strategy, all of which involve risks and uncertainties.

BUSINESS\nIntroduction\nAcies was incorporated on August 14, 2020 as a Cayman Islands exempted company for the purpose of effecting a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share\npurchase, reorganization, or similar business combination with one or more businesses. Acies completed its initial public offering in October 2020. On June 21, 2021, Acies\nconsummated the Acies Merger with Old PLAYSTUDIOS, pursuant to the Merger Agreement. In connection with the closing of theA cies Merger, we changed our name from\nAcies to PLAYSTUDIOS, Inc. PLAYSTUDIOS continues the existing business operations of Old PLAYSTUDIOS as a publicly traded company. Our website address is\nhttps://playstudios.com.\nOur Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to\nSection 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act are made available free of charge on our website as soon as reasonably practicable after we have electronically filed the material\nwith, or furnished it to, the SEC.\nOverview\nPLAYSTUDIOS is a leading developer of free-to-play casual games for mobile and social platforms. With a focus on creating immersive and engaging experiences,\nwe have built a strong reputation for combining high-quality games that resonate with players worldwide with our groundbreaking playAWARDS loyalty platform, which\nenables players to earn real-world rewards from a global collection of hospitality, entertainment and leisure brands. Our game portfolio includes a diverse range of titles, from\nsocial casino and card games to puzzle and adventure games.\nWe generate revenue primarily through the sale of in-game virtual currency and the monetization of player engagement. Although our games are available to players\nfor free, we historically have derived substantially all of our revenues from the sale of in-game virtual currency when players make voluntary in-game purchases. By offering\nplayers the option to voluntarily purchase in-game virtual currency, we are able to generate a steady stream of revenue while maintaining a free-to-play model. Additionally, we\nutilize in-game advertising as a means of further monetizing player engagement and enhancing our revenue streams.\nPLAYSTUDIOS has successfully established itself as a leader in the mobile gaming industry, with a strong presence in both domestic and international markets. Our\ngames have been downloaded millions of times and have garnered a loyal and dedicated player base. Through continuous innovation and the introduction of new game titles,\nwe aim to further expand our market reach and solidify our position as a top player in the industry.\nThe Power of Play\nWe build award-winning casual games that are among the most popular games available on iTunes and Google Play. Our games, which includem yVEGAS Slots,\nmyVEGAS Blackjack, my KONAMI Slots, POP! Slots, myVEGAS Bingo, MGM Slots Live, Tetris®, Solitaire, Spider Solitaire, Sudoku, and Mahjong, have been downloaded\nover 100 million times and were played by 13.5 million monthly active users for the year ended December 31, 2023. From social casino to casual games, each game has been\nthoughtfully crafted for the people who play it. As a result, we’ve been able to build a loyal and engaged community of players by virtue of our direct development efforts.\nBut we are not just a game company, because at the heart of every game we create is a powerful, one-of-a-kind loyalty program we call playAWARDS. It sets us apart\nfrom other leading game developers and it’s our key to building deep and lasting connections with millions of players. Every time players engage with one of our games, they\nbegin earning valuable loyalty points and elevating their playAWARDS status. Once they have accumulated loyalty points, they can unlock a collection of real-world rewards\nand other benefits that include, but are not limited to, vacations, invitations to special events, and access to our VIP services. Through our loyalty program, with a few swipes\nand a tap, players can be on their way to a complimentary meal, show, or weekend getaway, along with a chance to connect with other players who share their passion for our\ngames.\nOur curated collection of rewards partners represents unique brands including MGM Resorts International, Wolfgang Puck, Royal Caribbean Cruise Lines, and Cirque\ndu Soleil. The appeal of our loyalty program speaks for itself.\n5\nManaging a loyalty program like playAWARDS requires a robust technology platform. We have created a collection of tools and services that allows our network of\nglobal rewards partners to make the most of their in-game promotional presence. With our platform, our rewards partners can launch new rewards directly into our games and\nmake changes to their existing rewards. Then, in real time, they can see how players are responding to and engaging with their brands within our games.\nOur rewards partners recognize the value of showcasing their products and services within our games. The benefits, however, extend well beyond simple brand\nimpressions, because each reward that a player acquires in our games translates to a potential customer for our rewards partners. Extending these rewards to our players helps\nkeep our rewards partners top-of-mind in a way that’s entertaining and engaging, rather than transactional.\nOur loyalty program provides our players a whole new dimension to their gameplay experiences. We often hear player stories of unforgettable memories and personal\nconnections that our players have made through our real-world rewards. And that is what makes PLAYSTUDIOS so much more than a game company.\nOur Loyalty Program\nOur playAWARDS program is grounded in a proven model that provides our players with a rewarding entertainment experience and our rewards partners with\npromotional access to a large and valuable audience. From our perspective as a game developer, our playAWARDS program affords us a key competitive advantage in our\nstrategy to retain, engage, and ultimately monetize our players. The platform’s rules engine allows us to align our reward offerings with players’ preferences based upon certain\nqualifying criteria. We believe our differentiated playAWARDS program benefits our players, rewards partners, and business for a number of reasons as described below.\nWe believe our unique playAWARDS program provides our players with a compelling and differentiated value proposition: “Play Free Games. Earn Real Rewards.”\nOur social casino games and our Tetris®-branded mobile game incorporate loyalty points that are earned by players as they engage with our games. Like miles in a\nfrequent-flyer program, our players accumulate more loyalty points as they demonstrate their ongoing commitment to our games. These loyalty points can then be exchanged\nfor a vast library of real-world rewards. Each of these games features an integrated rewards lobby, enabling our players to easily browse and acquire benefits from a curated\ncollection of rewards. Loyalty points are aggregated across the games, allowing our players to accumulate loyalty points more rapidly by engaging with more of our games.\nThis drives traffic across our entire portfolio of games.\nOne of the key features of our playAWARDS loyalty platform is its tiered loyalty program. Players can progress through tiers based on their level of engagement and\ngameplay. Each tier offers increasingly valuable rewards, such as bonus virtual currency, exclusive in-game items, and access to special events. This tiered system not only\nincentivizes players to continue playing but also creates a sense of achievement and progression within the gaming community. The playAWARDS platform also incorporates\nsocial elements to further engage players. Players can connect with friends, compete in leaderboards, and participate in community challenges. This social aspect not only adds a\ncompetitive element to the gaming experience but also fosters a sense of camaraderie and community among players. By encouraging social interaction, we foster a vibrant and\ndynamic gaming environment that keeps players engaged and invested in our platform.\nBy offering tangible, real-world rewards, we believe playAWARDS enhances the overall gaming experience and enriches the value proposition of our games. We also\nbelieve playAWARDS is a meaningful differentiator that allows our games to stand out among hundreds of thousands of competing games, while also driving deeper\nengagement and enhancing player monetization. Whether it be early adoption, mid-term engagement, or long-term payer conversion, we believe our loyalty program enhances\nthe trajectory and life cycle of our games. By complementing inherently great games with a compelling collection of rewards, we believe we’ve been able to distinguish\nourselves from our competition.\nOur Rewards Partners.\nThe playAWARDS program allows our rewards partners to connect directly with a valuable mobile audience in a way that is engaging, entertaining, and cost effective.\nBy integrating branded content and promotional offerings into our games, playAWARDS converts entertaining digital impressions into real world brand engagement. In the\nprocess of earning loyalty points and redeeming rewards, players make the journey from our world into the world of our rewards partners. This activity helps them acquire new\ncustomers and reactivate ones that have lapsed. In addition, by extending restricted offers, our rewards partners are able to shift customer demand from peak to off-peak\nperiods, allowing them to optimize the utilization of their inventory.\n6\nThe playAWARDS platform provides a comprehensive suite of tools that enables participants in our loyalty program to optimize their participation. Our platform\nincludes operating tools tailored to the needs of our game makers, customer service features for our support and player hosts, and a dedicated console for our rewards partners.\nAll of these participants are empowered to manage their activities in real time, drawing on player insights to optimize the impact and value they derive from the playAWARDS\nprogram.\nAs we have amassed a diverse collection of rewards partners, the scale of our network has become a competitive edge that delivers benefits to both our players and\nrewards partners. As of December 31, 2023, our playAWARDS program offered rewards from 233 entertainment, retail, travel, leisure, and gaming brands from 113 reward\npartners located in 104 countries on 6 continents. Our players have used their loyalty points to acquire over 16 million rewards with a retail value of more than $824 million.\nWe believe there is opportunity to grow our vibrant community of players by continuing to leverage our unique loyalty program. As our players engage with our\ngames, they accumulate loyalty points that enrich their experience in the real world. As they consume their real-world rewards, they drive incremental business value for our\nrewards partners, who more fully engage with our loyalty program and actively promote our games as a means of keeping their brands top-of-mind with target consumers. This\ndrives players back to our games, where they can engage more deeply, accumulate more loyalty points, and repeat the cycle. The more players we drive to our rewards partners,\nthe more rewards partners and rewards inventory we can attract. The more rewards we attract, the more we can offer to our players, making our loyalty program more\ncompelling to an even broader audience.\nOur Core Strengths\nWe build engaging and beautifully executed games.\nWe are dedicated to building fun and beautiful games that feature a captivating complement of graphics, sounds, and visual effects. We undertake an extensive internal\ncreative review process and comprehensive quality assurance testing before publishing any new game. We constantly monitor the performance of our games to improve the\noverall gameplay experience.\nWe have a proprietary loyalty platform with a global network of rewards partners.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, we continued to develop and scale our proprietary loyalty platform across 104 countries and 6 continents, and have\namassed a global, diverse collection of rewards partners across entertainment, retail, technology, travel, leisure, and gaming. Our loyalty platform allows us to provide an\nengaging enhancement to the primary gaming experience of our 13.5 million monthly active users for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nWe believe the combination of our more than twelve years of development investments, operational experience, integration of our loyalty platform within our rewards\npartners’ marketing and operating practices, and the breadth of our corporate relationships, are significant competitive advantages, and to replicate our systems would require\ncompetitors to invest substantial time and incur significant expense.\nWe are experts in live operations.\nWe have established “live operations” as a core competency throughout the company and have dedicated live operations teams within each of our game studios.\nAlthough crafting great content is a necessary ingredient in building an enduring franchise, content alone is not sufficient. Games, and the teams that build and operate them,\nalso must cultivate the capacity to understand, anticipate and respond to player behaviors. This ability is often enabled by sophisticated tools and a disciplined process. When\ndone well, the overall experience, level of difficulty, rate of progress, and breadth of features, can be fine-tuned to the expectations and desires of individual player cohorts. Our\nlive operations teams closely analyze player data in order to design and deliver content, offers, and features to our players at the optimal times during their gameplay. We\nbelieve thorough effective live operations, we can drive paying player conversion, continued monetization, and long-term paying player retention.\nWe are committed to adding value to our player experience through rewards, service, and community.\nWe believe that focusing on the player experience is the key to driving player retention and opportunities for conversion to paying players. We have built a player\nmanagement infrastructure that includes customer support, social media community engagement, hosting for premium players, and real-world meetups and social events with\nour rewards partners.\n7\nWe focus on transparency and accountability, empowering our employees and management to drive the efficient use of capital.\nWe believe that achieving our potential is rooted in the alignment of our teams around our vision, product plans, organization design, and expected results. To achieve\nthis goal, we’ve implemented a company architecture that promotes transparency, engagement, critical thinking, and shared learning. Fundamental to this structure is our studio\nmodel and rigorous planning exercise. Teams evaluate their market opportunities, assess what’s unique about their position, craft or refine their strategies, and translate them\ninto plans that are actionable and measurable.\nWe have built an operating framework that consists of the tools, information systems, communication practices, and disciplines that enables each of our studios to\nfunction independently and optimize its performance. While this model encourages creativity, dynamism, and independence, it also ensures that our values as a company are\ndeeply ingrained in all that we do. This model fosters our commitment to our employees and their growth, our uncompromising attention to innovation and the creative\nexecution of our games, and our relentless focus on creating value for our players and our rewards partners.\nWe have adopted certain organizational conventions to drive collaboration and shared learning including our \"council\" framework, which consists of a collection of\ntopic-specific forums, each comprised of experts across our studios that self-organize, meet, and advance an agenda that serves the interests of the broader business. Today we\nhave numerous active councils focused on areas such as monetization, data science, technology, creative, product execution, user acquisition, player experience, and the\nplayMAKER experience. These councils are designed to drive deeper connections among our key leaders, leverage the collective intelligence from subject matter experts, and\nprovide opportunities for learning and problem solving within key disciplines of the business.\nOur founder-led management team includes industry-leading talent in the casino, leisure, and entertainment industries as well as seasoned game developers and operators.\nOur leadership team is a diverse collection of entrepreneurs, product leaders, technologists, game designers, data scientists, and loyalty marketers. In each case, they\nbring decades of experience, and a shared commitment to assembling teams and building products that are enduring. As a group, they’ve drawn upon their vast experience to\ndesign our operating framework, implement the tools to develop our talent, clarify our strategies, measure our performance, and optimize our decision making.\nWe rely on data-driven performance marketing capabilities to drive return on our ad spend.\nThere are certain functions or areas of responsibility that we’ve elected to centralize for every studio’s benefit. In the case of player acquisition, we leverage a\ncentralized marketing team to achieve efficiencies across our portfolio of games. Our performance marketing capabilities focus on cost-effectively acquiring players. Our player\nacquisition strategy is centered on a payback period methodology, and we strategically balance spend between the acquisition of new players and the reactivation of lapsed\nplayers.\nOur Growth Opportunities\nWe have a collection of growth opportunities that fall into four distinct categories — optimize, expand, acquire and diversify. We will continue to optimize the\nperformance of our existing portfolio of games, attracting, engaging, and monetizing more players. In addition, we intend to broaden our focus and act on acquisition\nopportunities that will allow us to complement our existing franchises by integrating new products and players into our playAWARDS program, as we have done with our\nacquisition of the mobile rights to Tetris® in 2021 and our acquisition of Brainium Studios in 2022. In parallel, we will continue to diversify our business model as we scale\nadvertising within each of our games. We also plan to introduce new playAWARDS features that will enable our players to transact directly with us, which we expect will\nimprove our gross margins. Lastly, we’ll continue to evolve our playAWARDS platform and tools such that we can make them available to strategic partners and third parties\nunder a SaaS model, or in our case, Loyalty-as-a-Service.\nNew Game Launches\nDuring the company's first ten years, we generally grew our business organically by assembling every team, building every product, and acquiring every player\nourselves. Our primary strategy to date has been to expand our portfolio of games and game studios through in-house development, leveraging the talent and culture of our\nteams to develop innovative and award-winning games. We launched our myVEGAS Bingo game in March 2021 and MGM Slots Live in October 2021. These games represent\nan extension of our addressable market and growth opportunity. We continue to look for opportunities to\n8\ncreate new games. As we expand into new genres and games, we expect to leverage loyalty mechanics and our player network to seed, and then grow, each new product.\nExclusive Rights to Tetris® Franchise For Mobile Devices\nThe Tetris® brand is one of the leading and most distinctive video game brands and franchises in the world. Securing the exclusive license for mobile devices globally,\nexcluding China, fully aligns with our strategic priorities and positions us to accelerate our growth, diversify our portfolio, grow our network of players, and scale our unique\nplayAWARDS platform.\nTargeted Strategic Acquisitions\nWe continually seek, evaluate, and pursue strategic transactions which we believe will enhance our business as further described below. In November of 2021, we\nacquired the rights to Tetris® on mobile devices, and in October of 2022 we acquired Brainium Studios LLC. Our intention is to continue to apply the resources obtained from\nbecoming a public company and accelerate our growth through strategic acquisitions. We believe prospective game companies will find us to be a more attractive acquirer,\ngiven the uniqueness of our playAWARDS program and our overall operating framework. Whether it be a young company with untapped potential or a mature business with an\nestablished portfolio of existing games, we intend to apply our experience, resources, and proprietary assets to helping them achieve their full potential. We believe our model,\noperating approach, team, and scale will enable us to compete for the best of these acquisition opportunities.\nOur prior, current, and future acquisition strategy is to expand into new genres, acquire proven games and brands with franchise value, assimilate talented teams, scale\nour audience, and leverage our playAWARDS platform to create value and improve operating performance. The genres and related games we are currently focused on include\ncasual (match, bubble, word, card), niche (racing, sport), midcore (Idle RPG, card battler) and casino (poker, bingo, slots).\nAd Monetization\nWhile most of our revenue is derived from in-game purchases, we introduced ad monetization mechanics into various of our social casino games in recent years. In\naddition, we acquired the rights to Tetris® on mobile devices in November of 2021 and Brainium Studios in October of 2022. The Tetris® mobile game and all ten Brainium\ngames generate most of their revenue through ad monetization. We intend to continue to qualify and scale in-game advertising as a source of revenue.\nDirect Purchase\nIn 2020, we developed and trialed a new collection of web-based myVIP features. In 2022, the service was extended to all players, who were invited to engage with us\nthrough a customized player portal. Each portal is tailored to the player, with a curated collection of unique benefits, rewards, and real-world events. The player is also able to\nreview his or her status and currency balances across all playAWARDS-enabled games, and should the player choose, the player can purchase virtual items from within the\nportal. It’s important to highlight that these players are given preferential access to unique rewards, along with virtual currency packages that are not available within the game.\nThe myVIP player portal is available to all myVIP players at any tier level.\nContinued Conversion of Non-Paying Players into Paying Players\nWe believe we can generate revenue growth by converting more non-paying players into payers. Our average daily conversion rate of non-payers to payers was 0.8%\nfor the year ended December 31, 2023, down from 1.5% for the year ended December 31, 2022. We continually assess the data about our players to develop insights that we can\nuse to improve conversion. We also engage regularly with our players at community events and other occasions associated with their reward redemptions. These opportunities\nenable us to glean additional insights from our players that inform our ongoing product refinements. We intend to continue to explore new strategies to improve our conversion\nof non-paying players into paying players, including continued game enhancements, player outreach, live operations offerings, and data-driven player management strategies.\nIncreasing the Monetization of Our Paying Players\nWe believe we can generate revenue through increasing the monetization of our paying players. Each of our products has a rich roadmap of live events and new\nfeatures focused on deepening the engagement among our existing paying players. From exclusive in-game VIP events and bespoke hosting services, to tailored pricing on store\nbundles and premium\n9\nreal-world rewards, we continue to expand the value we deliver to our players, which we believe will translate to increased levels of purchases by our players.\nLoyalty-as-a-Service\nOur playAWARDS program provides value to our rewards partners while increasing player engagement and retention within our games. As we introduce new games\nand explore potential acquisition opportunities, we will integrate our loyalty program in order to drive value and benefit from our increased scale. We will continue to enhance\nour playAWARDS program by updating the platform and tools, optimizing the redemption funnel and growing our collection of rewards partners. Our robust platform and\nknowledge can be leveraged and applied to other products and services as well. We also plan to explore additional opportunities for monetizing our technology, tools, and\noperating expertise by offering to other game publishers a tightly integrated, full-featured, loyalty-as-a-service solution.\nOur Company Values\nAt PLAYSTUDIOS, the essence of who we are is expressed in three simple truths: PLAY better together, PLAY to win, and the game is for the PLAYer.\nThe founders of our company and many of our key studio-level operating teams have long histories together, and the importance of those relationships sets the tone for\na company that places its highest premium on trust, mutual respect, and genuine regard for one another — even when we disagree. While clichés about close-knit cultures\nabound, we believe that in our case the metaphor of a company as family truly does apply. We recognize that building and growing a successful business requires a tremendous\ncommitment of time and energy. Taking that journey with people you care about makes it all the better, whether shouldering a setback or sharing a success.\nThis leads us to our second value, PLAY to win. We all want an opportunity to do great work and to see the direct impact we have on the success of our company. And\nwhile there are many ways to measure success, for us, it’s all about the quality of what we create — about thoughtful design and attentive execution. To this end, we spend a\ngood deal of time working through details that most people will never notice, but that do make a difference. The result is that our games have become known for their\ninnovative features, distinctive look and feel, and level of quality that has become a hallmark of PLAYSTUDIOS.\nThe closeness of our teams and the quality of our content come together in our conviction that everything we create is for our players. Unlike a retail or a hospitality\nbusiness, most game companies don’t have the luxury of daily encounters with their player base. While it is standard practice to continually evolve games based on a rich set of\nperformance analytics, the importance of face-to-face player feedback cannot be overstated. Thanks to our real-world rewards and loyalty program, and an active calendar of\ncommunity events, we have regular opportunities to socialize with our players in ways that other game companies cannot. Here again, our playAWARDS program affords us a\ndistinct competitive advantage.\nOur Games\nOur portfolio includes 19 games.

Our aim was to transform our loyalty construct into a free-standing and full-featured program that could be more efficiently integrated into future\ngame releases. Our playAWARDS initiative, and the dedicated team that leads it, is focused on further establishing it as the gaming industry’s gold standard. As we continue to\nlook to accelerate our growth through new product introductions and strategic acquisitions, we believe playAWARDS will serve as a catalyst, driving deeper engagement\namong newly acquired audiences.\nResearch and Development\nWe believe our ability to attract new players and retain existing players depends in part on our ability to evolve and expand our content library by continually\ndeveloping differentiated games, systems technology and functionality to enhance player entertainment and user profitability.\nWe have a diverse pool of talent located in game development hubs, including in Israel, Serbia, Hong Kong, Singapore, Vietnam, Mexico, and Chile. This provides us\nwith a funnel of new, internally developed game concepts, ideas for improvements to our systems, and close relationships with those local game-development communities.\nCompetition\nAs a developer of mobile games, we compete with other game makers and other forms of entertainment content.O ur competitors that develop mobile and web games\nin the social casino gaming category vary in size and offerings and include companies such as Aristocrat, DoubleU, Huuuge Games, Playtika, SciPlay (owned by Light &\nWonder), Scopely, Zynga (owned by Take-Two Interactive), and others. In addition, there are competitors that develop mobile and web games that are not currently focused on\nthe social casino gaming category but may move into that space and that may also impede our diversification efforts, including companies such as Activision Blizzard (owned\nby Microsoft and the parent company of King Digital), Electronic Arts (EA Mobile), Epic Games, Netmarble (the parent company of Jam City and Kabam), NetEase (NetEase\nGames), Niantic, Take-Two Interactive Software, Vivendi (the parent company of Gameloft) and others. Our market is continually evolving as new developers and new games\nbecome part of our rapidly growing, mobile gaming ecosystem. We compete on the basis of a number of factors, including quality of player experience, breadth and depth of\ngameplay, ability to create or license compelling content, brand awareness and reputation, and access to distribution channels.\nWe believe we are well positioned as a gaming company with a robust loyalty program. It is our view that our investments in the quality of our games, coupled with\nthe unique value proposition of playAWARDS, will continue to distinguish our products and drive our growth.\n11\nWe believe the value of our playAWARDS program is tied to the breadth of rewards we make available to our players. Our ability to keep the program fresh and\nrelevant is rooted in the value we deliver to our rewards partners. As we continue to demonstrate the productivity and impact of our games as a user acquisition, reactivation and\ninventory management solution, our rewards partners can increase their engagement, optimizing their rewards and the overall merchandising of the program. Driving\ndemonstrable results is key to retaining our existing rewards partners and attracting new ones. We expect to continue to demonstrate the value of our program, and in doing so,\nfurther build upon our substantial collection of rewards partners and rewards.\nWe believe that we can compete favorably in our market. Successful execution of our strategy depends on our ability to attract and retain players, expand the market\nfor our games, convert non-paying players into payers, attract and retain rewards partners, and offer unique and compelling experiences to players. In some cases, we compete\nagainst gaming operators who could expand their product lines to include games that could directly compete with ours. See “Risk Factors — Our industry is very competitive. If\nplayers prefer our competitors’ games over our own, our operating results could suffer.”\nIntellectual Property\nWe have 87 registered U.S. trademarks, 6 pending applications for U.S. trademarks, 18 issued U.S. patents, and 16 pending U.S. patent applications as of December 31,\n2023. We create most of the intellectual property we use in our games, but we also license or otherwise receive rights to third-party intellectual property for use in our games.\nFor example, we use licensed intellectual property from MGM Resorts International, Konami Gaming, Tetris®, Ainsworth Gaming Technology, IGT, and Shaquille O’Neal\namong others, as creative assets in our games. These licenses typically limit our use of intellectual property to specific uses and for specific time periods and include other\ncontractual obligations with which we must comply. Certain intellectual property rights may be licensed to us on a non-exclusive basis, and accordingly, the owners of such\nintellectual property are free to license such rights to third parties, including our competitors, on terms that may be superior to those offered to us, which could place us at a\ncompetitive disadvantage. Competition for these licenses is intense, and often results in one or more of advances, minimum payment guarantees, and royalties that we must pay\nto the licensor, which decreases our profitability. Additionally, in the future, we may identify third-party intellectual property we may need to license in order to engage in our\nbusiness, including to develop or commercialize new games; however, such licenses may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. We expect to continue to use a mix\nof originally created and licensed content in our games. See “Risk Factors — Our ability to acquire and maintain licenses to intellectual property may affect our revenue and\nprofitability. Competition for these licenses may make them more expensive and increase our costs.”\nGovernment Regulation\nWe are subject to a variety of laws in the U.S. and abroad that affect our business, including state and federal laws regarding consumer protection, electronic\nmarketing, data protection and privacy, competition, taxation, intellectual property, export, and national security, which are continuously evolving and developing. The scope\nand interpretation of the laws that are or may be applicable to us are often uncertain and may be conflicting, particularly laws outside the U.S. There is a risk that existing or\nfuture laws may be interpreted in a manner that is not consistent with our current practices and could have an adverse effect on our business. It is also likely that as our business\ngrows and evolves and our games are played in a greater number of countries, we will become subject to laws and regulations in additional jurisdictions or other jurisdictions\nmay claim that we are required to comply with their laws and regulations.\nThere are ongoing academic, political and regulatory discussions in the U.S., Europe, Australia, and other jurisdictions regarding whether social casino games should\nbe subject to a higher level or different type of regulation than other social games to protect consumers, in particular minors and persons susceptible to addiction to social casino\ngames, and, if so, what this regulation should include. It is possible that a number of laws and regulations may be adopted or construed to apply to us in the U.S. and elsewhere\nthat could restrict the online and mobile gaming industries, including player privacy, advertising, taxation, content suitability, copyright, distribution, and antitrust. Furthermore,\nthe growth and development of electronic commerce may prompt calls for more stringent consumer protection laws that may impose additional burdens on companies such as\nours conducting business through the Internet and mobile devices. We anticipate that scrutiny and regulation of our industry will increase, and we will be required to devote\nlegal and other resources to address such regulation. For example, existing laws or new laws regarding the marketing of in-game purchases, labeling of free-to-play games,\nregulation of currency, banking institutions, unclaimed property, or money transmission may be interpreted to cover our games and the purchase of virtual currency within our\ngames. If that were to occur, we may be required to seek licenses, authorizations, or approvals from relevant regulators, the granting of which may be dependent on us meeting\ncertain capital and other requirements and we may be subject to additional regulation and oversight, all of which could significantly increase our operating costs. Changes in\ncurrent laws or regulations or the imposition of new laws and regulations in the U.S. or elsewhere regarding these activities may impede the growth of social game services and\nimpair our\n12\nbusiness, financial condition, or results of operations. See \"Risk Factors — Our business is subject to a variety of U.S. and foreign laws, many of which are unsettled and still\ndeveloping, and which could subject us to claims or otherwise harm our business.\"\nWe are a member of the ISGA, which promotes best practices in gaming\nThe International Social Games Association or ISGA is the worldwide representative body of the social games industry, a thriving segment of the entertainment and\ndigital economies. Its mission is to educate and inform the public, policy makers, and regulators on what the industry does, how it works, and the value it generates for both the\ndigital economy and people that play social games. The ISGA’s “Best Practice Principles” offer guidance to the industry on consumer protection, accountability, and\ntransparency, while its research program provides insight for its key stakeholders. We are a member of the ISGA and our co-founder and Executive Vice President, Paul\nMathews, is the current Chairman of the ISGA. We are committed to ISGA’s Best Practice Principles, including transparency in our game mechanics, functionality, and in-game\npurchase process, striving to adhere to data privacy and protection law, and providing customer support.\nData Privacy and Security\nWe receive, store, and process personal information, including personal information of our players and other player data. We respect the data privacy rights of our\nplayers and strive to comply with all applicable data privacy laws. However, there are numerous federal, state, and local laws around the world regarding data privacy and the\nstoring, sharing, use, processing, disclosure, and protection of personal information, and current laws and regulations are inconsistent across jurisdictions leading to a patchwork\nof data privacy laws that are difficult to fully interpret and adhere to. Some of these laws and regulations authorize the governing agencies to investigate companies under their\njurisdiction to ensure compliance, and to impose fines and other measures against companies who are not in compliance. The applicability of these laws and regulations to us,\nand their scope and interpretation, are constantly evolving, often uncertain, and may conflict between jurisdictions.\nFor example, in the U.S. we are subject to the California Consumer Privacy Act, which was enacted by the State of California and effective on January 1, 2020, and\nestablishes additional data privacy rights for California residents, with corresponding obligations on businesses relating to transparency, deletion rights, and opting-out of the\nselling of personal information, and grants a private right of action for individuals in the event of certain security breaches. In November 2020, California voters passed the\nCalifornia Privacy Rights Act, or CPRA. The CPRA significantly expands the CCPA, including by introducing additional obligations such as data minimization and storage\nlimitations, granting additional rights to consumers, such as correction of personal information and additional opt-out rights, and creates a new entity, the California Privacy\nProtection Agency, to implement and enforce the law. The CCPA and CPRA could subject us to additional compliance costs as well as potential fines, individual claims and\ncommercial liabilities.\nSimilar laws relating to data privacy and security have been adopted in Virginia and Colorado, and proposed in other states and at the federal level, and, if passed, such\nlaws may have potentially conflicting requirements.\nIn Europe, we are subject to the General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 or GDPR, a regulation on data protection and data privacy applicable to companies\nprocessing personal data of users in the European Union (EU) and the European Economic Area that became effective May 25, 2018. The GDPR is wide-ranging in scope and\nimposes strict obligations and restrictions on the ability to collect, use, retain, protect, disclose, transfer, and otherwise process personal information (including restrictions on\ncross-border transfers of personal information), with substantial monetary penalties for violations. The GDPR also provides that EU member states may enact their own\nadditional laws and regulations in relation to certain data processing activities. Recent legal developments in the EU have created complexity and uncertainty regarding transfers\nof personal information from the EU to “third countries,” especially the U.S. For example, in 2020, the Court of Justice of the EU invalidated the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield\nFramework (a mechanism for the transfer of personal information from the EU to the U.S.) and made clear that reliance on standard contractual clauses (an alternative\nmechanism for the transfer of personal information outside of the EU) alone may not be sufficient in all circumstances. That program was subsequently replaced by the EU-U.S.\nData Privacy Framework adopted July 17, 2023. In addition, after the UK left the EU, the UK enacted the UK GDPR, which, together with the amended UK Data Protection\nAct of 2018, retains the GDPR in UK national law, but also creates complexity and uncertainty regarding transfers of personal information between the UK and the EU, which\ncould further limit our ability to use and share personal data and require localized changes to our operating model.\nWe are also subject to data protection and data privacy laws in other jurisdictions, such as the Lei Geral de Proteção de Dados or LGPD, a data privacy act enacted by\nBrazil that became effective September 18, 2020, which created new privacy rights for individuals and include monetary penalties for non-compliance. We are further subject to\nconsumer\n13\nprotection laws, such as general truth in advertising and unfair trade practices that prohibit making false statements about, or otherwise failing to disclose, how we use our\nplayers’ data, as well as federal and state data breach notification laws.\nThe scope of data privacy laws and regulations worldwide continues to evolve, and we anticipate that the number of data privacy laws and the scope of individual data\nprivacy and protection rights will increase, and we will continue to evaluate tools and methods to help us comply with existing and new laws and regulations. The scope and\ninterpretation of the laws that are or may be applicable to us are often uncertain and may be conflicting, particularly laws outside the United States. It is also likely that as our\nbusiness grows and evolves and our games are played in a greater number of countries, we will become subject to additional data privacy, cybersecurity, and consumer\nprotection laws and regulations in additional jurisdictions. If we are not able to comply with these laws or regulations or if we become liable under these laws or regulations, we\ncould be directly harmed, and we may be forced to implement new measures to reduce our exposure to this liability. This may require us to expend substantial resources,\nmodify our games, or block users from a particular jurisdiction, each of which would harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations. In addition, the increased\nattention focused upon liability issues as a result of lawsuits and legislative proposals could harm our reputation or otherwise impact the growth of our business.\nWe require new players who play our games for the first time to accept our privacy policy and terms of service. In our privacy policy, we disclose to our players what\ndata we collect and how we use it. We also provide our players with an online submission form to exercise certain rights with respect to their personal data. We strive to comply\nwith our privacy policy and respond to requests from our players to exercise such rights. However, it is possible that these obligations may be interpreted and applied in a\nmanner that is inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another and may conflict with other rules and regulations to which we are subject.\nSee “Risk Factors — We are subject to laws and regulations concerning data privacy, information security, data protection, and consumer protection, and these laws\nand regulations are continually evolving. Our actual or perceived failure to comply with these laws and regulations could harm our business.”\nHuman Capital\nWe had 697 full-time and 13 part-time employees in ten studios located in eight countries as of December 31, 2023. None of our employees are represented by a labor\norganization or are a party to any collective bargaining agreement with respect to their employment by us, except for certain employees in Vietnam where local law requires\nthose employees to be represented by a trade union. We have never experienced a material interruption of operations due to labor disagreements.\nWe believe that our people are the reason for our success, and we have organized ourselves to maximize productivity and performance. We are also working to build\ndiversity within our workforce.\nOur human capital resources objectives include, as applicable, identifying, hiring, training, integrating, and retaining our existing and additional employees. We\nbelieve we are able to attract and retain top talent by creating a culture that challenges and engages our employees, offering them opportunities to learn, grow, and achieve their\ncareer goals. Further, we believe that our commitment to a culture of inclusion is integral to our goal of attracting and retaining talent.\nWe strive to provide compensation and benefits that are competitive to market and create incentives to attract and retain employees. Our compensation package\nincludes market-competitive base pay, health care, retirement benefits, paid time off and family leave. In addition, we offer stock-based compensation and access to a variety of\nhealth and wellness resources.\n14\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nOur business faces significant risks and uncertainties. In evaluating our business, in addition to the risks and uncertainties discussed above under “Cautionary Note\nRegarding Forward-Looking Statements,” you should carefully consider the specific risks set forth herein. If any of these risks actually occur, it may materially harm our\nbusiness, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations. As a result, the market price of our securities could decline. Additionally, the risks and uncertainties described\nin this Annual Report on Form 10-K are not the only risks and uncertainties that we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently\nbelieve to be immaterial may become material and adversely affect our business.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nOur business will suffer if we are unable to entertain our players, develop new games, and improve the experience within our existing games.\nOur business depends on developing, publishing, and continuing to service casual, “free-to-play” games that players will download and spend time and money playing.\nWe are currently focused on social casino, casual, and puzzle games, offering our games on mobile devices, including smartphones and tablets on Apple’s iOS and Google’s\nAndroid operating systems, on social networking platforms such as Facebook, and on our website. We have devoted and we expect to continue to devote substantial resources to\nthe research, development, analytics, and marketing of our games. Our development and marketing efforts are focused on both improving the experience within our existing\ngames (frequently through new content and feature releases for our live services) and developing new games. We generate revenue primarily through the sale of in-game virtual\ncurrency. For games distributed through third-party platforms, we are required to share a portion of our revenue from in-game sales with the platform providers. Due to our\nfocus on mobile gaming, these costs are expected to remain a significant operating expense. See “Risk Factors—We rely on third-party platforms such as the Apple App Store,\nGoogle Play Store, Amazon Appstore, and Facebook to make our games available to players and collect revenues generated on such platforms, and we rely on third-party\npayment service providers to collect revenues generated on our own platforms.” In order to remain profitable, we need to generate sufficient revenue from our existing and new\ngame offerings to offset our ongoing development, marketing, and operating costs.\nSuccessfully monetizing “free-to-play” games is difficult and requires that we deliver engaging and entertaining player experiences that a sufficient number of players\nwill pay for or we are able to otherwise sufficiently monetize our games. The success of our games depends, in part, on unpredictable and volatile factors beyond our control\nincluding player preferences and spending habits, competing games, and the availability of other entertainment experiences. If our games do not meet player expectations, or if\nnew games are not brought to market in a timely and effective manner, our ability to grow revenue and our financial performance will be negatively affected.\nOur ability to successfully develop games for mobile and web platforms and their ability to achieve commercial success will depend on our ability to:\n• effectively monetize our games;\n• effectively market our games to existing and new players;\n• achieve benefits from our player acquisition costs;\n• achieve organic growth and gain player interest in our games through free or more efficient channels;\n• adapt to changing player preferences and spending habits;\n• negotiate with third parties to provide our players with a diverse inventory of real-world loyalty rewards;\n• achieve and maintain player engagement within our games;\n• expand and enhance games after their initial release;\n• attract, retain, and motivate talented and experienced game designers, product managers, engineers, digital marketing managers, and user acquisition experts;\n• negotiate and manage relationships with third-party platforms;\n15\n• continue to adapt to new technologies and game feature sets for an increasingly diverse set of mobile devices, including various operating systems and specifications,\nlimited bandwidth, and varying processing power and screen sizes;\n• efficiently manage the development of new games and features to increase the cadence of introductions without incurring excessive costs;\n• maintain a quality gaming experience and retain our players;\n• compete successfully against a large and growing number of existing market participants;\n• accurately forecast the timing and expense of our operations, including game and feature development, marketing and player acquisition, player adoption, and revenue\ngrowth;\n• minimize and quickly resolve bugs or outages; and\n• acquire and successfully integrate high quality mobile game assets, personnel, or companies.\nThese and other uncertainties make it difficult to know whether we will succeed in continuing to develop successful games and live operations services and launch new\ngames and features in accordance with our operating plan. If we do not succeed in doing so, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and reputation will suffer.\nIf we are able to develop new games and features that achieve success, it is possible that these new games and features could divert players of our other existing games\nwithout growing our overall player base, which could harm operating results.\nAlthough it is important to our future success that we develop new games and features that are popular with players, it is possible that new games and features may\nreduce the amount of time players spend with our other games without increasing their overall playing time or purchases. In particular, we plan to continue leveraging our\nexisting games to cross-promote new games and features, which may encourage players of existing games to divert some of their playing time and discretionary spending away\nfrom our existing games. If new games and game features do not grow our player base, increase the overall amount of time our players spend with our games, or generate\nsufficient new revenue to offset any declines from our other games, our revenue could be adversely affected.\nWe believe that our players’ level of engagement with our games is partly based on playAWARDS, our real-world rewards loyalty program. If we fail to expand and\ndiversify our playAWARDS program, or external events make it difficult for our players to consume real-world rewards, our business may suffer.\nPlayers accumulate loyalty points by engaging with our games, and players can exchange their loyalty points for real-world rewards through our playAWARDS\nprogram. We believe that our players’ level of engagement with our games is partly based on the perceived value of earning loyalty points and exchanging those loyalty points\nfor real-world rewards that they can redeem at our rewards partners’ establishments. We currently offer real-world rewards relating to, among other things, dining, live\nentertainment shows, and hotel rooms. For example, through an agreement with MGM Resorts International, or MGM, our players are able to exchange loyalty points for,\namong other things, free hotel rooms, meals and show tickets for various Las Vegas properties, including ARIA, Bellagio, and MGM Grand. While we offer some digital\nrewards, many of our real-world rewards are destination based. During the COVID-19 pandemic, we observed a lower level of rewards redemption due to restrictions on the\noperations of rewards partners and on the ability for players to travel or attend public events, and while such restrictions generally have been lifted, we could experience a\nreduced level of rewards redemption as a result of unanticipated future circumstances that have the effect of restricting travel or the in-person attendance of public events. If we\nare unable to expand and diversify our playAWARDS program, in particular to include real-world rewards not based on travel or attending public events or shows, the\nperceived value of exchanging loyalty points for the real-world rewards we offer will diminish and our players may be less likely to play our games or may reduce their level of\nengagement with our games. Such loss of, or reduction in, players or their level of engagement with our games would cause our business, financial condition, and results of\noperations to suffer.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and containment efforts across the globe significantly impacted our business, and the extent to which any future health epidemics or\ncontagious disease outbreaks will impact our future results of operations and overall financial performance remains uncertain.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and related containment and mitigation efforts, including social distancing, shelter-in-place, quarantine and similar policies, practices and\ngovernmental orders, have resulted in widespread disruption in global\n16\neconomies, productivity, and financial markets and materially altered our day-to-day business operations. Any future pandemics, public health epidemics, disease outbreaks,\nmedical emergencies, or other public health crises outside of our control could have a negative impact on our business.\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, we took various precautionary measures intended to minimize the risk of COVID-19 to our employees. Those measures included\ntemporarily closing our offices around the world (including our corporate headquarters in Las Vegas, Nevada) and implementing travel restrictions for our employees. Although\nour facilities have all since reopened, our business may be negatively impacted if we are faced with a similar future event, such as a pandemic, public health epidemic, disease\noutbreak, or other public health crisis, that requires us to implement precautionary measures, which may include temporary closures of some or all of our facilities, travel\nrestrictions, and other measures that could be disruptive to our normal business operations.\nDuring a pandemic, health epidemic or contagious disease outbreak, we may not be able to provide the same level of product features and customer support that our\nplayers expect from us, which could negatively impact our business and operations. While substantially all of our business operations can be performed remotely, many of our\nemployees who work remotely might have to balance additional work-related and personal challenges, including adjusting communication, technical and work expectations, and\nchallenges to collaborate in a hybrid environment with work colleagues and business partners.\nIn addition to the potential direct impacts to our business, the global economy could be significantly weakened as a result of the actions taken in response to any future\npandemic, health epidemic or contagious disease outbreak, and future government intervention remains uncertain. A weakened global economy may impact our players’\npurchasing decisions within our games, in particular given the limitations of redeeming real-world rewards due to government mandated or other restrictions on travel and other\nactivities and limitations on our players’ discretionary spending, consumer activity during the pandemic and its impact on advertising investments, and the ability of our\nbusiness partners, including our rewards partners that provide the real-world rewards available in our games, to navigate a complex social, health, and economic environment,\nany of which could result in disruption to our business and results of our operations.\nThe duration and extent of the impact on our business from any future pandemics, health epidemics or contagious disease outbreaks will depend on future\ndevelopments that cannot accurately be predicted at this time, such as disease severity and transmission rates, the existence of any additional waves of any pandemic, epidemic,\nor outbreak, the impact of new disease variants, the extent and effectiveness of mitigation and containment actions, progress towards widespread rapid testing, effective\ntreatment alternatives and the adoption and efficacy of available vaccines, and the impact of these and other factors on our employees, players, and business partners. If we are\nnot able to respond to and manage the impact of such events effectively, our business may be harmed. To the extent any future pandemic, health epidemic or contagious disease\noutbreak adversely affects our business and financial results, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks to our business described herein.\nOur industry is very competitive. If players prefer our competitors’ games over our own, our operating results could suffer.\nCompetition in the gaming industry, especially the mobile gaming segment, is intense and subject to rapid changes, including changes from evolving player\npreferences and emerging technologies. Many new games are introduced in each major industry segment (mobile, web, PC, and console) each year, but only a relatively small\nnumber of titles account for a significant portion of total revenue in each segment. While we have diversified our product offering, we historically competed primarily in the\nsocial casino gaming category. Our competitors that develop mobile and web games in the social casino gaming category vary in size and offerings and include companies such\nas Aristocrat, DoubleU, Huuuge Games, Playtika, SciPlay, Scopely, Zynga (owned by Take-Two Interactive), and others. In addition, there are competitors that develop mobile\nand web games that are not currently focused on the social casino gaming category but may move into that space and that may also impede our diversification efforts, including\ncompanies such as Activision Blizzard (owned by Microsoft Corporation and the parent company of King Digital), Electronic Arts (EA Mobile), Epic Games, Netmarble (the\nparent company of Jam City and Kabam), NetEase (NetEase Games), Niantic, Take-Two Interactive Software, Vivendi (the parent company of Gameloft), and others. In\naddition, online game developers and distributors that are primarily focused on specific international markets, such as Giant Interactive and Tencent in Asia, and high-profile\ncompanies with significant online presences that to date have not actively focused on social games, such as Facebook, Apple, Google, Amazon, and Netflix, may decide to\ndevelop social games including social casino games which may compete with our games. Some of these current and potential competitors have significant resources for\ndeveloping or acquiring additional games, may be able to incorporate their own strong brands and assets into their games, have a more diversified set of revenue sources than\nwe do and may be less severely affected by changes in player preferences, regulations. or other developments that may impact our\n17\nindustry. Furthermore, certain competitors of our social casino games may provide real-money gambling offerings, which could negatively impact demand for our social casino\ngames.\nThere are relatively low barriers to entry to develop a mobile or online game and we expect new game competitors to enter the market and existing competitors to\nallocate more resources to develop and market competing games and applications. We also compete or will likely compete with a vast number of small companies and\nindividuals who are able to create and launch games and other content for devices and platforms using relatively limited resources and with relatively limited start-up time or\nexpertise. The proliferation of titles in these open developer channels makes it difficult for us to compete for players without substantially increasing our marketing expenses.\nWe also face competition for the leisure time, attention, and discretionary spending of our players from other non-gaming activities, such as social media and messaging\napplications, personal computer and console games, virtual reality and augmented reality games, video streaming services, television, movies, sports, and the Internet. Increasing\ncompetition could result in loss of players, increasing player acquisition and retention costs, and loss of talent, all of which could harm our business, financial condition, or\nresults of operations.\nWe rely on a small portion of our total players for a substantial amount of our revenue and if we fail to grow our player base, or if player engagement declines, our revenue\nand operating results will be harmed.\nCompared to all players who play our games in any period, only a small portion are paying players. In order to sustain and grow our revenue levels, we must attract,\nretain, and increase the number of paying players or more effectively monetize our players through advertising and other strategies. To retain players, we must devote\nsignificant resources so that the games they play retain their interest and attract them to our other games. We also organize periodic in-person events for our players and, in\naddition, provide personal hosting services to our most engaged players, Nevertheless, we might not succeed in our efforts to increase the monetization rates of our players,\nparticularly if we are unable to retain our paying players. If we fail to grow or sustain the number of our paying players, if the rates at which we attract and retain paying players\ndeclines, if the average amount our players pay declines, or if we fail to retain and effectively monetize the relatively small number of players that comprise our most highly\nengaged player tiers, our business may be negatively impacted and our financial results may suffer.\nA substantial portion of our loyalty rewards and significant intellectual property are obtained from MGM, and any change in that relationship could materially and\nadversely affect our business and financial results.\nAlthough we have a portfolio of entertainment, retail, technology, travel, leisure, and gaming brands across the globe providing rewards through our playAWARDS\nprogram, MGM historically has provided a substantial amount of such rewards, and the majority of the rewards redeemed through our playAWARDS program for the year\nended December 31, 2023 were offered by MGM. Under the terms of our marketing agreement and rewards agreement with MGM, MGM has discretion over the types and\nquantities of rewards and whether to make any rewards available for a particular game, and MGM may discontinue any rewards previously made available. The terms of our\nmarketing agreement with MGM requires us to meet certain performance criteria for it to be automatically renewed, and if we fail to meet those performance criteria, MGM\ncould terminate both the marketing agreement and the rewards agreement. If we fail to meet our required performance criteria under the marketing agreement, we could also\nlose certain intellectual property rights that we license from MGM under the marketing agreement and which we use as creative assets in our games. In the event that MGM\noffers fewer or less attractive rewards for our games or if we fail to achieve the required performance milestones and MGM decides not to renew our agreements, our business\nand financial results could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe rely on third-party platforms such as the Apple App Store, Google Play Store, Amazon Appstore, and Facebook to make our games available to players and collect\nrevenues generated on such platforms, and we rely on third-party payment service providers to collect revenues generated on our own platforms.\nWe derive a significant portion of our revenue from the distribution of our games on the Apple App Store, Google Play Store, Amazon Appstore, and Facebook, and\nthe virtual items we sell in our games are purchased using the payment processing systems of these third-party platform providers. Additionally, we have historically acquired a\nsignificant number of our players through Facebook. If we are unable to maintain a good relationship with such platform providers, if their terms and conditions or pricing\nchange to our detriment, if we violate, or if a platform provider believes that we have violated, the terms and conditions of its platform, or if any of these platforms loses market\nshare or falls out of favor, or is unavailable for a prolonged period of time, our business will suffer.\nWe are subject to the standard and non-negotiated policies and terms of service/publisher agreements of third-party platforms, which govern the promotion,\ndistribution, content, and operation generally of games on the platform. Each\n18\nplatform provider has broad discretion to unilaterally change and interpret its terms of service and other policies with respect to us and other developers, and those changes may\nbe unfavorable to us. A platform provider may also change its fee structure, add fees associated with access to and use of its platform, alter how we are able to advertise on the\nplatform, change how the personal information of its users is made available to application developers on the platform, limit the use of personal information for advertising\npurposes, or restrict how players can share information with their friends on the platform or across platforms. Our business could be harmed if:\n• the platform providers discontinue or limit our access to their platforms;\n• governments or private parties, such as Internet providers, impose bandwidth restrictions, increase charges, or restrict or prohibit access to those platforms;\n• the platforms increase the fees they charge us or change the ways in which their fees are determined;\n• the platforms modify their algorithms, discovery mechanisms, communication channels available to developers, respective terms of service, or other policies;\n• the platforms decline in popularity;\n• the platforms adopt changes or updates to their technology that impede integration with other software systems or otherwise require us to modify our technology or\nupdate our games in order to ensure players can continue to access our games and content with ease;\n• the platforms elect or are required to change how they label free-to-play games or take payment for in-game purchases;\n• the platforms block or limit access to the genres of games that we provide in any jurisdiction;\n• the platforms impose restrictions or spending caps or make it more difficult for players to make in-game purchases of virtual items;\n• the platforms change how the personal information of players is made available to developers or develop or expand their own competitive offerings; or\n• we are unable to comply with the platform providers’ terms of service.\nIn addition, third-party platforms also impose certain file size limitations, which limits our ability to create software with additional features that would result in a\nlarger size than the platform providers would support. Aside from these file size limitations, a larger game file size could cause players to delete our games once the file size\ngrows beyond the capacity of their devices’ storage limitations or could reduce the number of downloads of these games.\nChanges in the respective terms of service or policy changes of third-party platforms may decrease the visibility or availability of our games, limit our distribution\ncapabilities, prevent access to our existing games, reduce the amount of revenue we may recognize from in-game purchases, increase our costs to operate on these platforms, or\nresult in the exclusion or limitation of our games or certain in-game features on such platforms. Any such changes could adversely affect our business, financial condition, or\nresults of operations.\nIf our platform providers do not perform their obligations in accordance with our platform agreements, we could be adversely impacted. For example, in the past, some\nof these platform providers have been unavailable for short periods of time, unexpectedly changed their terms or conditions or experienced issues with their features that permit\nour players to purchase virtual items. If any of our third-party service providers is unable to process payments, even for a short period of time, our business could be harmed.\nThese platforms and our third-party online payment service providers may also experience security breaches or other issues with their functionalities. In addition, if we violate,\nor a platform provider believes we have violated, its terms of service, policies, or standard publisher agreements (or if there is any change or deterioration in our relationship\nwith any of these platform providers), that platform provider could limit or discontinue our access to the platform or we may be exposed to liability or litigation. As jurisdictions\nin which we operate and their regulatory bodies adopt or modify laws and regulations, our platform providers may adopt restrictive policies or take other adverse action against\nthe Company and its games in connection with their interpretation and implementation of such laws and regulations. If the platform providers took such actions in jurisdictions\nthat are significant to our operations, it could negatively impact our business.\n19\nIf any such events described above occur on a short-term or long-term basis, or if these third-party platforms and online payment service providers otherwise\nexperience issues that impact the ability of players to download or access our games, access social features, or make in-game purchases, it could materially and adversely affect\nour brands and reputation, as well as our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe rely on third-party hosting and cloud computing providers to operate certain aspects of our business. In particular, a significant portion of our game traffic is hosted by\nAmazon Web Services, or AWS, and any failure, disruption or significant interruption in our network or hosting and cloud services could adversely impact our operations\nand harm our business.\nOur technology infrastructure is critical to the performance of our games, the satisfaction of our players, and our corporate functions. Our games and company systems\nrun on a complex distributed system, or what is commonly known as cloud computing. We own, operate, and maintain elements of this system, but significant elements of this\nsystem are operated by third parties that we do not control and which would require significant time and expense to replace. We expect this dependence on third parties to\ncontinue. We have experienced, and may in the future experience, disruptions, outages, and other performance problems due to a variety of factors, including infrastructure\nchanges, human or software errors, and capacity constraints. If any such interruption is significant or prolonged, if a particular game is unavailable when players attempt to\naccess it or navigation through a game is slower than they expect, players may stop playing the game and may be less likely to return to the game as often, if at all.\nA failure or significant interruption in our game service would harm our reputation and operations. We expect to continue to make significant investments in our\ntechnology infrastructure to maintain and improve all aspects of player experience and game performance. To the extent that our disaster recovery systems are not adequate, or\nwe do not effectively address capacity constraints, upgrade our systems as needed and continually develop our technology and network architecture to accommodate increasing\ntraffic, our business and results of operations may suffer. We do not maintain insurance policies covering losses relating to our network or information technology systems,\nother than losses caused by cybersecurity attacks for which we have limited insurance coverage, which may increase any potential harms that the business may suffer from\nsystems failure or resulting business interruptions.\nIn addition, any changes in these third parties’ service levels may adversely affect our ability to meet the requirements of our players. As our platform’s continuing and\nuninterrupted performance is critical to our success, sustained or repeated system failures would reduce the attractiveness of our offerings. It may become increasingly difficult\nto maintain and improve our performance, especially during peak usage times, as we expand and the usage of our offerings increases. Any negative publicity arising from these\ninterruptions, delays, outages, or other performance problems could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, or reputation. Furthermore, in the\nevent that any of our agreements with these third-party providers are terminated, we may experience significant costs or downtime in connection with the transfer to, or the\naddition of, new hosting or cloud computing providers. Although alternative providers could host our platform on a substantially similar basis, such transition could potentially\nbe disruptive and we could incur significant costs in connection with such transition.\nIn particular, a significant portion of our game traffic, data storage, data processing and other computing services and systems is hosted by AWS. AWS provides us\nwith computing and storage capacity pursuant to an agreement that continues until terminated by either party. The agreement requires AWS to provide us their standard\ncomputing and storage capacity and related support in exchange for timely payment by us. Any disruptions, delays, outages and other performance problems caused by AWS\ncould significantly impact our business due to our many services and systems relying on the AWS services.\nWe have engaged, and expect to engage, third-party game development companies to develop and operate certain mobile games, including myVEGAS Bingo and my\nKonami Slots, and if they fail to perform as expected, our business may suffer.\nWe currently, have in the past, and expect in the future to, engage third-party game development companies to develop and operate certain mobile games on our behalf.\nCurrently, we rely on third-party game development companies to provide operation and development services for our myVEGAS Bingo and my KONAMI Slots games. In\neach instance, we have been, and in the future intend to be, the publisher of our existing games as well as third-party developed or co-developed games when they are available\nto players through platforms such as the Apple App Store, Google Play Store, Amazon Appstore, and Facebook. However, in some cases much of the responsibility to develop\nand operate our games will be undertaken by the development company. Typically when we engage a third-party game development company, we will enter into a contract with\nthem that defines their and our duties and responsibilities. With a third-party game development company, we have limited control over the work performed by the development\ncompany and are therefore subject to risks\n20\nthat differ from, and might be greater than, those we are subject to when our own employees are developing and operating our games. For example, limited control over work\nbeing performed could materially and adversely impact the timely development and completion of our games, and their publication could be delayed due to the development\ncompany’s failure to adhere to our milestones and roadmaps. We have in the past experienced this risk when one of our third-party game development companies failed to\ncomplete development milestones in accordance with our game development roadmap. If our third-party game development companies do not perform in accordance with our\nagreements with them, it could adversely affect the development of our games that are the subject of that agreement, including delaying their availability for launch and their\nperformance once launched, which could materially and adversely impact our ability to meet our forecasts.\nOnce a co-developed game is launched, or in the event we engage a third party to operate an existing game, we will be reliant on the development company’s ability to\nmaintain an adequate number of knowledgeable and experienced personnel to operate and maintain the co-developed game or existing game successfully and to develop and\nimplement future game updates, patches and bug fixes, as well as provide ongoing support services. If the development companies fails to operate and maintain the co-\ndeveloped game or existing game, it could adversely affect that game's performance and player satisfaction, and our business might suffer as a result. Further, if the game\ndevelopment companies breached our agreements with them, or unilaterally elected to discontinue providing services, we would have to find a substitute provider or replace the\nlost services internally, which could disrupt the operation of the games and result in dissatisfied players, increased expenses, lost revenues, and other adverse effects.\nWe do not own or have direct control of the source code of the third-party developed games, but we endeavor to have source code escrow agreements in place under\nwhich the source code and operation documentation of such co-developed games will be held in escrow. If the source code escrow release conditions are triggered under the\napplicable source code escrow agreement, while we may be able to obtain access to and use the source code and operation documentation to operate the relevant co-developed\ngame, it would take significant time for our employees to learn how to manage the operation of the co-developed game or develop future game updates, patches, or bug fixes for\nthe co-developed game, which could adversely affect the co-developed game’s performance and player satisfaction, and our business may suffer as a result.\nIn addition, a co-developed game may incorporate intellectual property owned by the applicable development company. In such cases, we will seek to obtain licenses to\nuse the intellectual property as integrated with and into the co-developed game in order to continue operating the game if our agreement with the co-developer terminates or\nexpires and we wish to continue publishing the co-developed game. If we are unable to obtain such a license, or if the third-party game developer challenged our right to use its\nintellectual property or the manner in which we use such intellectual property, it could materially and adversely affect our ability to continue to publish the co-developed game.\nIf we do not successfully invest in, establish and maintain awareness of our brands and games, or if we incur excessive expenses promoting and maintaining our brands or\nour games, our business, financial condition, results of operations, or reputation could be harmed.\nWe believe that establishing and maintaining our brands is critical to maintaining and creating favorable relationships with players, rewards partners, content licensors,\nand advertisers, as well as competing for key talent. Increasing awareness of our brands and recognition of our games is particularly important in connection with our strategic\nfocus on developing games based on our own intellectual property and successfully cross-promoting our games. In addition, globalizing and extending our brands and\nrecognition of our games requires significant investment and extensive management time to execute successfully. Although we make significant sales and marketing\nexpenditures in connection with the launch of our games, these efforts may not succeed in increasing awareness of our brands or the new games. If we fail to increase and\nmaintain brand awareness and consumer recognition of our games, our potential revenue could be limited, our costs could increase, and our business, financial condition,\nresults of operations, or reputation could suffer.\nWe strive to establish and maintain our brands by obtaining trademark rights, including for our games. However, if our trademarks and trade names are not adequately\nprotected, we may not be able to build name recognition in our markets of interest and our competitive position, business, financial condition, or results of operations may be\nharmed.\nOur ability to acquire and maintain licenses to intellectual property may affect our revenue and profitability. Competition for these licenses may make them more expensive\nand increase our costs.\nMuch of the intellectual property we use in our games is created by us, but we also rely on licenses or rights we receive to third-party intellectual property for use in our\ngames or platform to enhance the experience of our players or otherwise operate our business. For example, we use licensed intellectual property from certain parties such as\nMGM, Tetris®, and Konami Gaming in our games and for marketing and promoting our games. These licenses typically limit our\n21\nuse of intellectual property to specific uses and for specific time periods, and include other contractual obligations, including the achievement of certain performance milestones\nwith which we must comply in order for the license to remain in effect. Moreover, certain intellectual property rights may be licensed to us on a non-exclusive basis, and\naccordingly, the owners of such intellectual property are free to license such rights to third parties, including our competitors, on terms that may be superior to those offered to\nus, which could place us at a competitive disadvantage. Competition for these licenses is intense, and often results in one or more of increased advances, minimum payment\nguarantees, and royalties that we must pay to the licensor, which decreases our profitability. In the future, we may identify additional third-party intellectual property we may\nneed or desire to license in order to engage in our business, including to develop or commercialize new games. However, such licenses may not be available on acceptable terms\nor at all. If we are unable to obtain and remain in compliance with the terms of these licenses or obtain additional licenses on reasonable economic terms, we may be required to\ndiscontinue or limit our use of our games or features therein that include or incorporate the licensed intellectual property, and our revenue and profitability may be adversely\nimpacted.\nWe also cannot be certain that our licensors are not infringing, misappropriating, or otherwise violating the intellectual property rights of others or that our licensors\nhave sufficient rights to the intellectual property to grant us the applicable licenses. If we are unable to obtain or maintain rights to any of such in-licensed intellectual property\nbecause of claims of intellectual property infringement, misappropriation, or other violation claims brought by third parties against our licensors or against us, our ability to\ndevelop games containing such intellectual property could be severely limited and our business could be harmed.\nThe perceived value of our virtual currency is highly dependent on how we manage the economies in our games. If we fail to manage our game economies properly, our\nbusiness may suffer.\nOur games are available to players for free, and historically we have derived substantially all of our revenues from the sale of in-game virtual currency when players\nmake voluntary in-game purchases. Paying players choose to purchase virtual currency in our games because of its perceived value, which is dependent on the relative ease of\nobtaining equivalent virtual currency by simply playing our games. The perceived value of our virtual currency can be impacted by various actions that we take in our games,\nincluding offering discounts for virtual currency, giving away virtual currency in promotions, or providing other non-paid methods of obtaining virtual currency. Managing\ngame economies is difficult, and relies on our assumptions and judgment. If we fail to manage our virtual economies properly or fail to promptly and successfully respond to\nany such disruption, our reputation may suffer and our players may be less likely to play our games and to purchase virtual currency from us in the future, which would cause\nour business, financial condition, and results of operations to suffer.\nOur ability to successfully attract in-game advertisers depends on our ability to design an attractive advertising model that retains players.\nWhile historically we have derived substantially all of our revenues from the sale of in-game virtual currency, our Tetris®-branded mobile game and Brainium games\nderive the majority of their revenues from the sale of in-game advertisements. If we are unable to attract and maintain a sufficient player base or otherwise fail to offer attractive\nin-game advertising models, advertisers may not be interested in purchasing such advertisements in our games, which could adversely affect our revenues from in-game\nadvertising. In addition, if we include in-game advertising in our games that players view as excessive, such advertising may materially detract from players’ gaming\nexperiences, thereby creating player dissatisfaction, which may cause us to lose players and revenues, and negatively affect the experience for players making purchases of\nvirtual currency in our games.\nOur games and other software applications, and our and our vendors' and other partners' information technology and other systems and platforms, have, on occasion,\nexperienced failures, errors, defects, or disruptions. Although such events have not had a material impact in the past, future similar events could disrupt our business,\nimpact our games and related software applications, affect our ability to scale our technical infrastructure, diminish our brand and reputation, subject us to liability, and\nadversely affect our operating results and growth prospects.\nOur games may contain errors, bugs, flaws, corrupted data, defects, and other vulnerabilities, some of which may only become apparent after their launch, particularly\nas we launch new games and release new features to existing games under tight time constraints. Furthermore, our development and testing processes may not detect errors and\nvulnerabilities in our games prior to their release. These defects may only become apparent after we launch a new game or publish an update to an existing game, particularly as\nwe launch new games or updates and rapidly release new features to existing games under tight time constraints. For example, these errors could prevent a player from making\nin-game purchases, which could harm our business. These errors could also be exploited by cheating programs and other forms of misappropriation, be leveraged by nefarious\nactors to expose personal data, or create other issues or problems harming the overall game-playing experience for our players. This could cause players to reduce their playing\ntime or in-game purchases, discontinue playing our games\n22\naltogether, or not recommend our games to other players, which could result in further harm to our business. Such errors could also result in our games being non-compliant\nwith applicable laws or create legal liability for us. Resolving such errors could disrupt our operations, cause us to divert resources from other projects, or harm our results of\noperations. Accordingly, any such errors, flaws, defects, and vulnerabilities may disrupt our operations, violate applicable security standards, adversely affect the game\nexperience of our players, harm our reputation, cause our players to stop playing our games, divert our resources, and delay market acceptance of our games, any of which\ncould result in harm to our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nOur technology infrastructure is critical to the performance of our games and satisfaction of our players and to the general operation of our business. We devote\nsignificant resources to network and data security to protect our systems and data. However, our systems may not be adequately designed with the necessary reliability and\nredundancy to avoid performance delays or outages that could be harmful to our business. We cannot assure you that the measures we take to detect and prevent or hinder\ncybersecurity attacks or other security or data breaches, to protect our systems, data and player information, and to prevent outages, data loss, and fraud, including a disaster\nrecovery strategy for server, equipment, or systems failure and the use of third parties for certain cybersecurity services, will provide sufficient security or be adequate for our\noperations. Our vendors and other partners are also subject to the foregoing risks, and we do not have any control over them. We have experienced, and may in the future\nexperience, system disruptions, outages, and other performance problems, including when releasing new software versions or bug fixes, due to a variety of factors, including\ninfrastructure changes, human or software errors, and capacity constraints. Such disruptions have not had a material impact to date; however, future disruptions from\nunauthorized access to, fraudulent manipulation of, or tampering with our or third parties’ computer systems and technological infrastructure, including the data contained\ntherein or transmitted thereby, could result in a wide range of negative outcomes, including violations of applicable privacy laws which can result in significant fines,\ngovernmental investigations and enforcement actions, legal and financial exposure, contractual liability, and damage to our reputation, each of which could materially adversely\naffect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.\nProgramming errors, defects, and data corruption could also disrupt our operations, cause us to violate applicable data privacy laws, adversely affect the experience of\nour players, harm our reputation, cause our players to stop playing our games, divert our resources, and delay market acceptance of our games, any of which could result in\nlegal liability to us or harm our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.\nIf our player base and engagement continue to grow, and the number and types of games we offer continue to grow and evolve, we will need an increasing amount of\ntechnical infrastructure, including network capacity and computing power, to continue to satisfy our players’ needs and operate our business. Such infrastructure expansion may\nbe complex, and unanticipated delays in completing these projects or availability of components may lead to increased project costs, operational inefficiencies, or interruptions\nin the delivery or degradation of the quality of our games or other operations. In addition, there may be issues related to this infrastructure that are not identified during the\ntesting phases of design and implementation, which may only become evident after we have started to fully use the underlying equipment or software, which could further\ndegrade the player experience or increase our costs. As such, we could fail to continue to effectively scale and grow our technical infrastructure to accommodate increased\ndemands. In addition, our business may be subject to interruptions, delays or failures resulting from adverse weather conditions, other natural disasters, power loss, terrorism,\ncybersecurity attacks, public health emergencies (including the COVID-19 pandemic or other future health epidemics or contagious disease outbreaks), or other catastrophic\nevents.\nWe believe that if our players have a negative experience with our games, or if our brand or reputation is negatively affected, players may be less inclined to continue\nor to engage with us. As such, a failure or significant interruption in our service would harm our reputation, business, and operating results.\nOur success depends on the security and integrity of the games we offer, and security breaches or other disruptions could compromise our information or the information\nof our players and expose us to liability, which would cause our business and reputation to suffer.\nWe believe that our success depends in large part on providing secure games to our players. Our business sometimes involves the collection, storage, processing and\ntransmission of players’ proprietary, confidential and personal information. We also maintain certain other proprietary and confidential information relating to our business and\npersonal information of our personnel. Despite our security measures, our games may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers, players, vendors, or others, or to breaches due to\nmalfeasance or other disruptions. Any such security breach or incident could result in unauthorized access to, misuse of, or unauthorized acquisition of, our or our players’ data,\nthe loss, corruption or alteration of this data, interruptions in our operations, or damage to our equipment or systems or those of our players or third-party platforms. Any\n23\nsuch occurrence could expose us to claims, regulatory investigations, litigation, (including class actions), fines and potential liability., negative reputational impacts that cause\nus to lose existing or future customers, and/or significant costs relating to incident response, system restoration or remediation, or future compliance. Any or all of the foregoing\ncould materially adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nAn increasing number of online services have disclosed security breaches, some of which have involved sophisticated and highly targeted attacks on portions of their\nservices. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently and often are not foreseeable or\nrecognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. If an actual or perceived breach of\nour security occurs, public perception of the effectiveness of our security measures and brand could be harmed, and we could lose players. Data security breaches and other data\nsecurity incidents may also result from non-technical means, such as actions by employees, contractors, or other service providers. Any compromise of our security could result\nin a violation of applicable privacy laws and regulations and could result in governmental investigations, enforcement actions, and legal and financial exposure, including\npotential costs or liabilities that may not be covered by our insurance. Any such security compromise could also result in damage to our reputation and a loss of confidence in\nour security measures. Any of these effects could have a material adverse impact on our business or results of operations.\nIf the use of mobile devices as game platforms and the proliferation of mobile devices generally do not continue to increase, our business could be adversely affected.\nThe number of people using mobile Internet-enabled devices has increased dramatically over time and we expect that this trend will continue. However, the mobile\nmarket, particularly the market for mobile games, may not grow in the way we anticipate. Our future success is substantially dependent upon the continued growth of the market\nfor mobile games. In addition, we do not currently offer our games on all mobile devices. If the mobile devices on which our games are available decline in popularity or\nbecome obsolete faster than anticipated, we could experience a decline in revenue and may not achieve the anticipated return on our development efforts. Any such declines in\nthe growth of the mobile market or in the use of mobile devices for games could harm our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nWhile we have achieved profitability in the past, we also have a history of net losses and our revenue and operating margins may decline. We also may incur substantial\nnet losses in the future and may not sustain profitability.\nOur operating and net income has historically fluctuated and we believe our operating margin could decrease as a result of declining revenue and/or increasing costs\nresulting from the risks discussed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K or in connection with any merger and acquisition activity that we may undertake. We expect to continue\nto expend substantial financial and other resources on game development, our technology stack, game engines, game technology and tools, player acquisition, the expansion of\nour network, international expansion, and marketing. Our operating costs will increase and our operating margins may decline if we do not effectively manage costs, launch new\nproducts on schedule that monetize successfully, and enhance our games so that these games continue to monetize successfully. In addition, weak economic conditions or other\nfactors could cause our revenues to contract, requiring us to implement significant additional cost cutting measures, including a decrease in sales and marketing and paid player\nacquisition, which could harm our long-term prospects. If our revenue does not increase to offset any additional expenses, if we fail to manage or experience unexpected\nincreases in operating expenses, or if we are required to take additional charges related to impairments or restructurings, our financial results and results of operations may\nsuffer and we may not achieve or maintain profitability.\nWe intend to grow our business through strategic acquisitions, investments, and joint ventures that involve numerous risks and uncertainties.\nWe intend to grow our business through strategic transactions, including acquisitions, investments, and joint ventures, that involve numerous risks and uncertainties.\nWe have previously closed several such transactions, including the acquisition of Brainium and the license rights for Tetris®-branded mobile games, and are currently in, and in\nthe future expect to continue to be in, various stages of seeking, evaluating, and pursuing additional strategic transactions both in the U.S. and in non-U.S. jurisdictions. These\ntransactions often require unique approaches to integration due to, among other reasons, the structure of the transactions, the locations, and cultural differences among the other\ncompany’s teams and ours, and have required and will continue to require significant attention from our management team. If we are unable to obtain the anticipated benefits\nfrom these transactions, or if we encounter difficulties in integrating any acquired operations with our business, our financial condition and results of operations could be\nmaterially harmed.\n24\nChallenges and risks from such acquisitions, investments, and joint ventures include:\n• our ability to identify, compete effectively for, or complete suitable acquisitions and investments at prices we consider attractive;\n• our ability to estimate accurately the financial effect of acquisitions and investments on our business, our ability to estimate accurately any synergies or the impact on\nour results of operations of such acquisitions and investments;\n• acquired products, technologies or capabilities, particularly with respect to any that are still in development when acquired, may not perform as expected, may have\ndefects, or may not be integrated into our business as expected;\n• acquired entities or joint ventures may not achieve expected business growth or operate profitably, which could adversely affect our results of operations, and we may be\nunable to recover investments in any such acquisitions or joint ventures;\n• our assumption of legal or regulatory risks, particularly with respect to smaller businesses that have immature business processes and compliance programs, or litigation\nwe may face with respect to the acquired company, including claims from terminated employees, players, former stockholders, or other third parties;\n• negative effects on business initiatives and strategies from the changes and potential disruption that may follow the acquisition;\n• diversion of our management’s attention;\n• declining employee morale and retention issues resulting from changes in compensation, or changes in management, reporting relationships, or future prospects;\n• the need to integrate the operations, systems, technologies, products, and personnel of each acquired company, the inefficiencies and lack of control that may result if\nsuch integration is delayed or not implemented, and unforeseen difficulties and expenditures that may arise in connection with integration;\n• the difficulty in determining the appropriate purchase price of acquired companies may lead to the overpayment of certain acquisitions and the potential impairment of\nintangible assets and goodwill acquired in the acquisitions;\n• the difficulty in successfully evaluating and utilizing the acquired products, technology, or personnel;\n• acquisitions, investments, and joint ventures may require us to spend a significant amount of cash, to incur debt, resulting in increased fixed payment obligations and\ncould also result in covenants or other restrictions on us, or to issue capital stock, resulting in dilution of ownership of our stockholders;\n• the need to implement controls, procedures, and policies appropriate for a larger, U.S.-based public company at companies that prior to acquisition may not have as\nrobust controls, procedures, and policies, in particular, with respect to compliance with privacy and other regulations protecting the rights of users, and compliance with\nU.S.-based economic policies and sanctions which may not have previously been applicable to the acquired company’s operations;\n• the difficulty in accurately forecasting and accounting for the financial impact of an acquisition transaction, including accounting charges and integrating and reporting\nresults for acquired companies that have not historically followed U.S. GAAP;\n• the fact that we may be required to pay contingent consideration in excess of the initial fair value, and contingent consideration may become payable at a time when we\ndo not have sufficient cash available to pay such consideration;\n• the fees and costs of legal, accounting, and other professional advisors engaged by us for such acquisitions, which may be substantial;\n• under purchase accounting, we may be required to write off deferred revenue which may impair our ability to recognize revenue that would have otherwise been\nrecognizable which may impact our financial performance or that of the acquired company;\n• risks associated with our expansion into new international markets and doing business internationally;\n25\n• in the case of foreign acquisitions, the need to integrate operations across different cultures and languages and to address the particular economic, currency, political, and\nregulatory risks associated with specific countries;\n• the potential loss of, or harm to, our relationships with employees, players, rewards partners, content licensors, and other suppliers as a result of integration of new\nbusinesses;\n• our dependence on the accuracy and completeness of statements and disclosures made or actions taken by the companies we acquire or their representatives, when\nconducting due diligence and evaluating the results of such due diligence;\n• liability for activities of the acquired company before the acquisition, including intellectual property and other litigation claims or disputes, cybersecurity and information\nsecurity vulnerabilities, violations of laws, rules, and regulations, commercial disputes, tax liabilities, and other known and unknown liabilities; and\n• we may not be able to effectively influence the operations of our joint ventures, or we may be exposed to certain liabilities if our joint venture partners do not fulfill their\nobligations.\nThe benefits of an acquisition, investment, or joint venture may also take considerable time to develop, and we cannot be certain that any particular transaction will\nproduce the intended benefits, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations. Our ability to grow through future acquisitions,\ninvestments, and joint ventures will depend on the availability of suitable candidates at an acceptable cost, our ability to compete effectively to attract these candidates, and the\navailability of financing to complete larger transactions. In addition, we may encounter challenges in evaluating future acquisitions, investments, and joint ventures and\nintegrating personnel, business practices, and company cultures from acquired companies. Acquisitions, investments, and joint ventures could result in potential dilutive\nissuances of equity securities, use of significant cash balances or incurrence of debt (and increased interest expense), contingent liabilities or amortization expenses related to\nintangible assets, or write-offs of goodwill or intangible assets, which could adversely affect our results of operations and dilute the economic and voting rights of our\nstockholders.\nIn addition, if we divest any businesses, these divestitures would similarly require significant investment of time and resources, may disrupt our business, distract\nmanagement from other responsibilities, and may result in losses on disposal or continued financial involvement in the divested businesses, including through indemnification,\nguarantee, or other financial arrangements, for a period of time following the divestitures, which could adversely affect our financial results.\nOur international operations are, and our strategy to expand internationally will be, subject to increased challenges and risks.\nContinuing to expand our business to attract players in countries outside of the U.S. is an important element of our business strategy. An important part of targeting\ninternational markets is developing offerings that are localized and customized for the players in those markets. While we have international game studios in Hong Kong, Israel,\nSerbia, Singapore, and Vietnam, we expect to continue to expand our international operations in the future by opening new international game studio locations and expanding\nour offerings in new languages. Our ability to expand our business and to attract players and talented employees in other international markets we may enter will require\nconsiderable management attention and resources and is subject to the particular challenges of supporting a rapidly growing business in an environment of multiple languages,\ncultures, customs, economics, legal systems, alternative dispute systems, regulatory systems, and commercial infrastructures.\nExpanding our international focus may subject us to risks that we have not faced before or increase risks that we currently face, including risks associated with:\n• inability to offer certain games in certain foreign countries;\n• recruiting and retaining talented and capable management and employees in foreign countries;\n• challenges caused by distance, language, and cultural differences;\n• developing and customizing games and other offerings that appeal to the tastes and preferences of players in international markets;\n• competition from local game makers with intellectual property rights and significant market share in those markets and with a better understanding of player preferences;\n• obtaining, utilizing, protecting, defending, and enforcing our intellectual property rights;\n26\n• negotiating agreements with local distribution platforms that are sufficiently economically beneficial to us and protective of our rights;\n• the inability to extend proprietary rights in our brand, content, or technology into new jurisdictions;\n• implementing alternative payment methods for virtual currency in a manner that complies with local laws and practices and protects us from fraud;\n• compliance with applicable foreign laws and regulations, including privacy laws and laws relating to content and consumer protection;\n• compliance with anti-bribery laws and anti-corruption laws, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the \"FCPA\");\n• credit risk and higher levels of payment fraud;\n• currency exchange rate fluctuations;\n• protectionist laws and business practices that favor local businesses in some countries;\n• double taxation of our international earnings and potentially adverse tax consequences due to changes in the tax laws of the U.S. or the foreign jurisdictions in which we\noperate;\n• political, economic, and social instability;\n• public health crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic and other future health epidemics or contagious disease outbreaks, which can result in varying impacts to our\nemployees, players, vendors, rewards partners, and commercial partners internationally;\n• higher costs associated with doing business internationally;\n• limitations on, and costs related to, the repatriation of funds;\n• compliance with applicable sanctions regimes regarding business dealings or other business relationships with or involving certain designated persons or countries;\n• export or import regulations; and\n• trade and tariff restrictions.\nCertain of these laws also contain provisions that require accurate record keeping and further require companies to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal\naccounting controls. Although we have policies and controls in place that are designed to ensure compliance with these laws, if those controls are ineffective or an employee or\nintermediary fails to comply with the applicable regulations and policies or if the design of those policies and controls is incomplete or inadequate, we may be subject to\ncriminal and civil sanctions and other penalties. Any such violation could disrupt our business and adversely affect our reputation, results of operations, cash flows and financial\ncondition. In addition, as we operate and sell internationally, we are subject to the FCPA, and other laws that prohibit improper payments or offers of payments to foreign\ngovernments and their officials and political parties and other business entities for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. While we have attempted to implement\nsafeguards to discourage these practices by our employees, consultants and agents, violations of the FCPA may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions, and we may be\nsubject to other liabilities, which would negatively affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nFurther, our ability to expand successfully in foreign jurisdictions involves other risks, including difficulties in integrating foreign operations, risks associated with\nentering jurisdictions in which we may have little experience and the day-to-day management of a growing and increasingly geographically diverse company. We may not\nrealize the operating efficiencies, competitive advantages or financial results that we anticipate from our investments in foreign jurisdictions. In addition, our international\nbusiness operations could be interrupted and negatively affected by terrorist activity, political unrest or other economic or political uncertainties. Moreover, foreign jurisdictions\ncould impose tariffs, quotas, trade barriers and other similar restrictions on our international sales.\nIf we are unable to manage the complexity of our global operations successfully, our business, financial condition, and operating results could be adversely affected.\nAdditionally, our ability to successfully gain market acceptance in any\n27\nparticular market is uncertain, and the distraction of our senior management team could harm our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nOur business is subject to a variety of U.S. and foreign laws, many of which are unsettled and still developing, and which could subject us to claims or otherwise harm our\nbusiness.\nWe are subject to a variety of laws in the U.S. and abroad that affect our business, including state and federal laws regarding consumer protection, electronic\nmarketing, data protection and privacy, competition, taxation, intellectual property, export, and national security, which are continuously evolving and developing. The scope\nand interpretation of the laws that are or may be applicable to us are often uncertain and may be conflicting, particularly laws outside the U.S. There is a risk that existing or\nfuture laws may be interpreted in a manner that is not consistent with our current practices and could have an adverse effect on our business. It is also likely that as our business\ngrows and evolves and our games are played in a greater number of countries, we will become subject to laws and regulations in additional jurisdictions or other jurisdictions\nmay claim that we are required to comply with their laws and regulations.\nThere are ongoing academic, political, and regulatory discussions in the U.S., Europe, Australia, and other jurisdictions regarding whether social casino applications\nshould be subject to a higher level or different type of regulation than other social game applications to protect consumers, in particular minors and persons susceptible to\naddiction to social casino games, and, if so, what this regulation should include. For example, at the end of August 2020, a court approved a settlement of class action litigation\nrelating to alleged violations by Big Fish Games, Inc., the operator of an online social casino game, of a specific anti-gambling law in the State of Washington, in an aggregate\namount equal to $155.0 million. In addition, since 2020 there have been numerous cases filed against social casino game developers, and third party platform providers, alleging\nthat social casino games violate various states' gambling laws. In 2023, two lawsuits were filed against us in Alabama and Tennessee alleging that our social casino-themed\ngames constitute illegal gambling under applicable state laws and seeking to recover amounts paid by the residents of the applicable state in connection with such games. In\naddition, we received four demands for arbitration in 2023 alleging that our games constitute illegal gambling under applicable state law. These demands generally attempt to\nrecover amounts spent by third parties on the Company’s games by relying on state gambling loss recovery statutes and/or by seeking to have the applicable Terms of Service\ndeclared invalid. We cannot predict the timing or outcome of any litigation or arbitration proceedings. While we believe our games operate differently from games implicated in\nthe Big Fish Games class action litigation, if new social casino regulations are imposed, or if anti-gambling laws or other regulations are interpreted to apply to our social casino\ngames, certain, or all, of our casino-themed games may become subject to the rules and regulations and we may be exposed to civil and criminal penalties, fines, and other\nliabilities, which could be material and could harm our business or financial condition. Any costs incurred as a result of these potential liabilities, including defense costs, could\nharm our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nIt is possible that a number of laws and regulations may be adopted or construed to apply to us in the U.S. and elsewhere that could restrict the online and mobile\nindustries, including player privacy, advertising, taxation, content suitability, copyright, distribution, and antitrust. Furthermore, the growth and development of electronic\ncommerce may prompt calls for more stringent consumer protection laws that may impose additional burdens on companies such as ours conducting business through the\nInternet and mobile devices. We anticipate that scrutiny and regulation of our industry will increase and we will be required to devote legal and other resources to addressing\nsuch regulation. For example, existing laws or new laws regarding the marketing of in-game purchases, labeling of free-to-play games, regulation of currency, banking\ninstitutions, unclaimed property, or money transmission may be interpreted to cover our games and the virtual currency, goods, or payments that we receive. If that were to\noccur, we may be required to seek licenses, authorizations, or approvals from relevant regulators, the granting of which may be dependent on us meeting certain capital and\nother requirements and we may be subject to additional regulation and oversight, all of which could significantly increase our operating costs. Changes in current laws or\nregulations or the imposition of new laws and regulations in the U.S. or elsewhere regarding these activities may lessen the growth of social game services and impair our\nbusiness, financial condition, or results of operations.\nWe may be subject to future litigation in the operation of our business. An adverse outcome in one or more proceedings could adversely affect our business.\nWe may be involved in claims, suits, government investigations, and proceedings arising in the ordinary course of our business, including actions with respect to\nintellectual property claims, privacy, data protection, law enforcement matters, tax matters, labor and employment claims, commercial and acquisition-related claims, class\naction lawsuits, and other matters. Such claims, suits, government investigations, and proceedings are inherently uncertain and their results cannot be predicted with certainty.\nRegardless of their outcomes, such legal proceedings can have an adverse impact on us because of legal costs, diversion of management and other personnel, and other factors.\nIt is possible that a resolution of one or more such proceedings could result in liability, penalties, or sanctions, as well as judgments, consent decrees, or orders preventing\n28\nus from offering certain features, functionalities, products, or services, or requiring a change in our business practices, products or technologies, which could in the future\nmaterially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nFailure to obtain, maintain, protect, or enforce our intellectual property rights could harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nWe regard the protection of our trade secrets, software, trademarks, service marks, trade dress, domain names, patents, and other intellectual property rights as critical\nto our success. We strive to protect our intellectual property rights by relying on a combination of federal, state, and common law trademark, copyright, patent, and trade secret\nprotection laws, as well as contractual restrictions and business practices. We enter into proprietary information and invention assignment agreements with our employees and\ncontractors and confidentiality agreements with parties with whom we conduct business in order to limit access to, and disclosure and use of, our proprietary information. While\nthese agreements will give us contractual remedies upon any unauthorized use or disclosure of our proprietary business information or intellectual property, we may not always\nbe able to effectively monitor or prevent such unauthorized use or disclosure or misappropriation of our proprietary information or intellectual property or deter independent\ndevelopment of similar technologies by others. Enforcing a claim that a party illegally disclosed or misappropriated our proprietary information is difficult, expensive, and time-\nconsuming, and the outcome is unpredictable, and therefore, we may not be able to obtain adequate remedies. In addition, some courts inside and outside the U.S. are less\nwilling or unwilling to protect trade secrets. If any of our trade secrets were to be lawfully obtained or independently developed by a competitor or other third party, we would\nhave no right to prevent them from using that technology or information to compete with us, which could harm our competitive position, business, financial condition, results of\noperations, and prospects.\nWe own registered trademarks and issued patents, and have filed, and may continue in the future to file, trademark and patent applications to protect certain of our\ninnovations and intellectual property. This process can be expensive and time-consuming, may not always be successful depending on the intellectual property laws of the\napplicable jurisdiction in which we seek protection or other circumstances, in which case we may be unable to secure intellectual property protection for all of our technology\nand methodologies. We also may choose not to pursue registrations in every jurisdiction depending on the nature of the project to which the intellectual property rights pertain.\nWe may, over time, increase our investments in protecting our innovations and other technology. Even if we are successful in obtaining effective intellectual property\nprotection, it is expensive to maintain these rights and the costs of defending our rights could be substantial. Moreover, our failure to develop and properly manage new\ninnovations and other technology could hurt our market position and business opportunities.\nWhile our software and other proprietary technology may be protected under copyright law, we have chosen not to register any copyrights in these works, and instead,\nprimarily rely on protecting our software as a trade secret. In order to bring a copyright infringement lawsuit in the U.S., the applicable copyright must be registered.\nAccordingly, the remedies and damages available to us for unauthorized use of our software may be limited.\nFurthermore, our intellectual property and other proprietary rights may be challenged, knowingly or unknowingly infringed, misappropriated, circumvented, declared\ngeneric, or determined to be infringing on or dilutive of third-party intellectual property rights, and we may not be able to prevent infringement or misappropriation or other\nviolation of our intellectual property and other proprietary rights without incurring substantial expense. Litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights,\nprotect our trade secrets, or determine the validity and scope of proprietary rights claimed by others. Monitoring unauthorized use of our intellectual property is difficult and\ncostly, and while it is our policy to protect and defend our rights to our intellectual property, we cannot predict whether steps taken by us to enforce and protect our intellectual\nproperty rights will be adequate to prevent infringement, misappropriation, dilution, or other violations of our intellectual property rights.\nLitigation or other legal proceedings relating to intellectual property claims, even if resolved in our favor, may cause us to incur significant expenses and could distract\nour technical and management personnel from their normal responsibilities. In addition, there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions, or other\ninterim proceedings or developments, and if securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a substantial adverse effect on the price of our\ncommon stock. We may not have sufficient financial or other resources to conduct such litigation or proceedings adequately. Some of our competitors may be able to sustain the\ncosts of such litigation or proceedings more effectively than we can because of their greater financial resources and more mature and developed intellectual property portfolios.\nUncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of intellectual property proceedings could harm our ability to compete in the marketplace. In addition, because of the\nsubstantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be\n29\ncompromised by disclosure during this type of litigation. Any of the foregoing could harm our competitive position, business, financial condition, results of operations and\nprospects.\nAny inability to meaningfully enforce our intellectual property rights could harm our ability to compete and reduce demand for our games. Moreover, in any lawsuit\nwe bring to enforce our intellectual property rights, a court may refuse to stop the other party from using the technology at issue on grounds that our intellectual property rights\ndo not cover the technology in question. Further, in such proceedings, the defendant could counterclaim that our intellectual property is invalid or unenforceable and the court\nmay agree, in which case we could lose valuable intellectual property rights. Any litigation of this nature, regardless of outcome or merit, could result in substantial costs,\nadverse publicity, and diversion of management and technical resources, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations. If we\nfail to maintain, protect, and enhance our intellectual property rights, our business, financial condition, or results of operations may be harmed.\nWe have been in the past, and may be in the future, subject to intellectual property disputes, which are costly to defend and could require us to pay significant damages and\ncould limit our ability to use certain technologies in the future.\nOur commercial success depends in part on our ability to operate without infringing, misappropriating, or otherwise violating the intellectual property rights of others.\nWe have faced, and may in the future face, allegations that we have infringed, misappropriated, or otherwise violated the trademarks, copyrights, patents, and other intellectual\nproperty rights of third parties, including from our competitors and non-practicing entities. We may also be subject to claims that our employees, consultants, or other advisors\nhave wrongfully used or disclosed alleged trade secrets of their former employers or claims asserting ownership of what we regard as our intellectual property. Intellectual\nproperty litigation may be protracted and expensive, and the results are difficult to predict. As the result of any court judgment or settlement, we may be obligated to cancel the\nlaunch of a new game, stop offering a game or certain features of a game in a particular geographic region or worldwide, pay significant royalties, settlement costs, or damages\n(including potential treble damages and attorneys’ fees if we are found to have willfully infringed intellectual property rights), obtain licenses (which may not be available on\nacceptable terms or at all), modify our games and features, or develop substitutes. Even if we were able to obtain a license, it could be non-exclusive, thereby giving our\ncompetitors and other third parties access to the same technologies licensed to us. Furthermore, even if intellectual property disputes do not result in litigation, the time and\nresources necessary to resolve them could harm our business, results of operations, financial condition, and reputation.\nOur games utilize third-party open source software components, which may pose particular risks to our proprietary software, technologies, and games in a manner that\ncould negatively affect our business.\nWe use open source software in our game development and expect to continue to use open source software in the future. Use and distribution of open source software\nmay entail greater risks than use of third-party commercial software, as open source licensors generally do not provide support, warranties, indemnification, or other contractual\nprotections regarding infringement claims or the quality of the open source software code. To the extent that our games depend upon the successful operation of open source\nsoftware, any undetected errors or defects in this open source software could prevent the deployment or impair the functionality of our games, delay new releases, result in a\nfailure of our games, and injure our reputation. For example, undetected errors or defects in open source software could render it vulnerable to breaches or security attacks and,\nas a result, make our systems more vulnerable to data breaches. In addition, the public availability of such software may make it easier for others to compromise our platform\nand games.\nMoreover, some open source software licenses require users who distribute open source software as part of their proprietary software to publicly disclose all or part of\nthe source code to such software or make available any derivative works or modifications of the open source code on unfavorable terms or at no cost. If we combine our\nproprietary software with open source software in a certain manner, we could, under certain open source licenses, be required to release or license the source code of our\nproprietary software to the public, and from time to time, we may face claims from third parties that incorporate open source software into their products, claiming ownership\nof, or demanding release of, the source code of the open source software or derivative works that were developed using such software, or otherwise seeking to enforce the terms\nof the applicable open source license. The terms of various open source licenses have not been interpreted by courts, and there is a risk that such licenses could be construed in\na manner that imposes unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our use of the open source software. We monitor our use of open source software and try to use open source\nsoftware in a manner that will not require the disclosure of the source code to our proprietary software or prevent us from charging fees to our players for use of our proprietary\nsoftware. However, we cannot guarantee that these efforts will be successful, and thus there is a risk that the use of such open source software may ultimately result in litigation,\npreclude us from charging fees for the use of certain of our proprietary software, require us to replace certain code used in our games, pay damages, settlement fees,\n30\nor a royalty to use some open source software, make the source code of our games publicly available, or discontinue certain games. Any of the foregoing would have a negative\neffect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nWe are subject to laws and regulations concerning data privacy, information security, data protection, and consumer protection, and these laws and regulations are\ncontinually evolving. Our actual or perceived failure to comply with these laws and regulations could harm our business.\nWe receive, store, process, use, and share data, some of which contains personal information and other data relating to our players, employees and business contacts,\nand we enable our players to share their personal information with each other and with third parties, including on the Internet and mobile platforms. There are numerous federal,\nstate, and local laws around the world regarding privacy and the storing, sharing, use, processing, disclosure, and protection of personal information, the scopes of which are\nchanging, subject to differing interpretations, and may be inconsistent between jurisdictions or conflict with other rules.\nWe are subject to European Union rules with respect to cross-border transfers of personal data out of the EEA and the UK. Recent legal developments in Europe have\ncreated complexity and uncertainty regarding transfers of personal data from the EEA and the UK to the U.S. On July 16, 2020, the Court of Justice of the European Union\n(\"CJEU\") invalidated the EU-US Privacy Shield Framework, or Privacy Shield, under which personal data could be transferred from the EEA to U.S. entities, such as ourselves,\nwho had self-certified under the Privacy Shield scheme. While the CJEU upheld the adequacy of the standard contractual clauses (a standard form of contract approved by the\nEuropean Commission as an adequate personal data transfer mechanism, and potential alternative to the Privacy Shield), it made clear that reliance on them alone may not\nnecessarily be sufficient in all circumstances.\nThese recent and ongoing developments will require us to continually review and amend the legal mechanisms by which we make and/ or receive personal data\ntransfers to in the U.S. As supervisory authorities issue further guidance on personal data export mechanisms, including circumstances where the standard contractual clauses\nand other mechanisms cannot be used, and/or start taking enforcement action, we could suffer additional costs, complaints, and regulatory investigations or fines, or if we are\notherwise unable to transfer personal data between and among countries and regions in which we operate, it could affect the manner in which we provide our services, the\ngeographical location or segregation of our relevant systems and operations, and could adversely affect our financial results.\nIn addition, various government and consumer agencies have called for new regulation and changes in industry practices and are continuing to review the need for\ngreater regulation for the collection of information concerning consumer behavior on the Internet, including regulation aimed at restricting certain targeted advertising practices.\nIn the U.S., there are numerous federal and state privacy and data protection laws and regulations governing the collection, use, disclosure, protection, and other\nprocessing of personal information, including federal and state data privacy laws, data breach notification laws, and consumer protection laws. For example, the California\nConsumer Privacy Act of 2018, or CCPA, became effective on January 1, 2020 and created new privacy rights for consumers residing in the state of California. The CCPA\ngives California residents expanded rights to access and delete their personal information, opt out of certain personal information sharing, and receive detailed information about\nhow their personal information is used. The CCPA allows for the California Attorney General to impose civil penalties for violations and also provides a private right of action\nfor certain data breaches. In November 2020, California voters passed the California Privacy Rights Act, or CPRA, which became effective on January 1, 2023. The CPRA\nsignificantly expands the CCPA, including by introducing additional obligations such as data minimization and storage limitations, granting additional rights to consumers, such\nas correction of personal information and additional opt-out rights, and creates a new entity, the California Privacy Protection Agency, to implement and enforce the law. The\nCCPA and CPRA could subject us to additional compliance costs as well as potential fines, individual claims and commercial liabilities.\nThere currently are a number of additional proposals related to data privacy or security pending before federal, state, and foreign legislative and regulatory bodies, and\na number of U.S. states have adopted consumer protection laws similar to the CCPA. This legislation may add additional complexity, variation in requirements, restrictions and\npotential legal risk, require additional investment in resources to compliance programs, and could impact strategies and availability of previously useful data and could result in\nincreased compliance costs and/or changes in business practices and policies.\nIn the European Economic Area, or EEA, we are subject to the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, which became effective in May\n2018, and from January 1, 2021, we are also subject to the UK GDPR and UK Data Protection Act 2018, which retains the GDPR in UK national law. The GDPR and national\nimplementing legislation in EEA member states and the UK impose a strict data protection compliance regime in relation to our collection,\n31\ncontrol, processing, sharing, disclosure, and other use of personal data, including providing detailed disclosures about how personal data is collected and processed, granting\nnew rights for data subjects to access, delete, or object to the processing of their data, mandatory breach notification to supervisory authorities (and in certain cases, affected\nindividuals) of certain data breaches, and significant documentary requirements to demonstrate compliance through policies, procedures, training, and audit. In particular,\nEuropean Union privacy supervisory authorities have focused on compliance with requirements relating to the processing of children’s personal data and ensuring that services\noffered to children are age appropriate, and we may be subject to regulatory scrutiny and subsequent enforcement actions if we are found to be processing children’s data given\nthe nature of our services.\nWe are also subject to European Union rules with respect to cross-border transfers of personal data out of the EEA and the UK. Recent legal developments in Europe\nhave created complexity and uncertainty regarding transfers of personal data from the EEA and the UK to the U.S. On July 16, 2020, the Court of Justice of the European\nUnion, or CJEU, invalidated the EU-US Privacy Shield Framework, or Privacy Shield, under which personal data could be transferred from the EEA to U.S. entities, such as\nourselves, who had self-certified under the Privacy Shield scheme. While the CJEU upheld the adequacy of the standard contractual clauses (a standard form of contract\napproved by the European Commission as an adequate personal data transfer mechanism, and potential alternative to the Privacy Shield), it made clear that reliance on them\nalone may not necessarily be sufficient in all circumstances.\nThe U.S. Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (\"COPPA\"), regulates the collection, use and disclosure of personal information from children under 13 years of\nage. While our social casino games do not target children under 18 years of age as their primary audience, the Federal Trade Commission (the \"FTC\"), as well as consumer\norganizations, may consider whether the characteristics of our games attract children under 13 years of age. The FTC has taken action against other gaming companies\nrelating to children’s’ privacy, including against Epic Games, the maker of the popular game Fortnite, pursuant to which Epic Games agreed to pay a $275 million fine for\nalleged violations of COPPA as well as take other corrective actions. While none of our games are directed at children under 13 years of age, if COPPA were to apply to us,\nfailure to comply with COPPA may increase our costs, subject us to expensive and distracting government investigations and could result in substantial fines. Although we\nhave taken measures to identify which of our games are subject to COPPA due to their child-appealing nature and to comply with COPPA with respect to those games, if\nCOPPA were to apply to us in a manner other than we have assessed or prepared for, our actual or alleged failure to comply with COPPA may increase our costs, subject us to\nexpensive and distracting lawsuits or government investigations, could result in substantial fines or civil damages and could cause us to temporarily or permanently\ndiscontinue certain games or certain features and functions in games.\nWhile our social casino games do not target children under 18 years of age as their primary audience, the United Kingdom in 2020 enacted the “Age Appropriate\nDesign Code” (commonly referred to as the “Children’s Code”), a statutory code of practice pursuant to the United Kingdom Data Protection Act 2018, which became\nenforceable on September 2, 2021. The code requires online services, including our games that are likely to be accessed by children under 18, to put the best interests of the\nchild’s privacy first in the design, development and data-related behavior of the game. The UK government is also separately consulting on legislation in relation to user safety\nonline. The Data Protection Commission in Ireland published its Fundamentals for a Child-Oriented Approach to Data Processing, introducing certain child-specific data\nprotection measures. It is possible that other countries within and outside the European Union will follow with their own codes or guidance documents relating to processing\npersonal information from children or in relation to online harms; currently, other countries are considering or have issued drafts of similar codes, including France, Denmark,\nand Switzerland. These may result in substantial additional costs and may necessitate changes to our business practices which may compromise our growth strategy, adversely\naffect our ability to attract, monetize or retain players, and otherwise adversely affect our business, reputation, legal exposures, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, in some cases, we are dependent upon our platform providers to solicit, collect and provide us with information regarding our players that is necessary\nfor compliance with these various types of regulations. Our business, including our ability to operate and expand internationally, could be adversely affected if laws or\nregulations are adopted, interpreted or implemented in a manner that is inconsistent with our current business practices and that require changes to these practices, the design\nof our games, game features, or our privacy policy. These platform providers may dictate rules, conduct or technical features that do not properly comply with federal, state,\nlocal and foreign laws, regulations and regulatory codes and guidelines governing data privacy, data protection and security, including with respect to the collection, storage,\nuse, processing, transmission, sharing and protection of personal information and other consumer data. In addition, these platforms may dictate rules, conduct or technical\nfeatures relating to the collection, storage, use, transmission, sharing and protection of personal information and other consumer data, which may result in substantial costs and\nmay necessitate changes to our business practices, which in turn may compromise our growth strategy,\n32\nadversely affect our ability to attract, monetize or retain players, and otherwise adversely affect our business, reputation, legal exposures, financial condition and results of\noperations. Any failure or perceived failure to comply with these platform-dictated rules, conduct or technical features may result in platform-led investigations or enforcement\nactions, litigation, or public statements against us, which in turn could result in significant liability or temporary or permanent suspension of our business activities with these\nplatforms, cause our players to lose trust in us, and otherwise compromise our growth strategy, adversely affect our ability to attract, monetize or retain players, and otherwise\nadversely affect our business, reputation, legal exposures, financial condition and results of operations.\nPlayer interaction with our games is subject to our privacy policy and terms of service. If we fail to comply with our posted privacy policy or terms of service or if we\nfail to comply with existing privacy-related or data protection laws and regulations, it could result in proceedings or litigation against us by governmental authorities or others,\nwhich could result in fines or judgments against us, damage our reputation, impact our financial condition and harm our business. If regulators, the media or consumers raise\nany concerns about our privacy and data protection or consumer protection practices, even if unfounded, this could also result in fines or judgments against us, damage our\nreputation, and negatively impact our financial condition and damage our business.\nIn the area of information security and data protection, many jurisdictions have passed laws requiring notification when there is a security breach involving personal\ndata or requiring the adoption of minimum information security standards that are often vaguely defined and difficult to implement. Our security measures and standards may\nnot be sufficient to protect personal information and we cannot guarantee that our security measures will prevent security breaches. A security breach that compromises\npersonal information could harm our reputation and result in a loss of player and/or employee confidence in our games and ultimately in a loss of players, which could\nadversely affect our business and impact our financial condition. A security breach could also involve loss or unavailability of business-critical data and could require us to\nspend significant resources to mitigate and repair the breach, which in turn could compromise our growth and adversely affect our ability to attract, monetize or retain players.\nThese risks could also subject us to liability under applicable security breach-related laws and regulations and could result in additional compliance costs, costs related to\nregulatory inquiries and investigations, and an inability to conduct our business.\nIn addition, Brazil’s passage of the Lei Geral de Protecao de Dados Pessoais, or LGPD, became effective September 2020 and created new privacy rights for\nconsumers residing in Brazil.\nCompliance with the GDPR, LGPD, CCPA, CPRA, and similar legal requirements has required us to devote significant operational resources and incur significant\nexpenses. We expect the number of jurisdictions adopting their own data privacy laws to increase, which will require us to devote additional significant operational resources\nand incur additional significant expenses and will also increase our exposure to risks of claims by our players that we have not complied with all applicable data privacy laws.\nAll of our games are subject to our online privacy policy and our terms of service accessible through our platform providers’ storefronts, from our games, and on our\ncorporate website. While we strive to comply with such policies and all applicable laws, regulations, other legal and contractual obligations, and certain industry standards and\ncodes of conduct relating to data privacy and data protection, these obligations may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another\nand may conflict with other rules or our practices. It is also possible that new laws, regulations, other legal obligations or industry codes of conduct may be adopted, or existing\nlaws, regulations, other legal obligations or industry codes of conduct may be interpreted in such a way that results in us having to take further compliance steps and/or could\nprevent us from being able to offer services to citizens of a certain jurisdiction or makes it costlier or more difficult for us to do so.\nAny failure or perceived failure by us to comply with our privacy policy and terms of service, or our data privacy-related legal obligations including those to our\nplayers or other third parties, or any compromise of security that results in the unauthorized release or transfer of personal information, including personal information about our\nplayers, may result in regulatory investigations, governmental enforcement actions, and significant fines, which, as an example, can be up to 20 million euros or up to 4% of the\nannual global revenue of the noncompliant undertaking, whichever is greater, for violations of certain requirements of the GDPR. The UK GDPR mirrors the fines under the\nGDPR. In addition to the foregoing, we may suffer reputational damage, orders to cease or change our processing of our data, civil claims including representative actions and\nother class action type litigation (where individuals have suffered harm), potentially amounting to significant compensation or damages liabilities, or public statements against\nus by consumer advocacy groups or others which could cause our players to lose trust in us, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or\nresults of operations. Additionally, if third parties we work with such as our players or vendors violate applicable laws or our policies, such violations may also put personal\ninformation at risk and expose us to potential liability and reputational harm. Further, public scrutiny of, or complaints about, technology companies or their data handling or\ndata protection practices,\n33\neven if unrelated to our business, industry, or operations, may lead to increased scrutiny of technology companies, including us, and may cause government agencies to enact\nadditional regulatory requirements, or to modify their enforcement or investigation activities. Any of the foregoing could have an adverse effect on our business, financial\ncondition, or results of operations.\nOur business depends on our ability to collect and use data to deliver relevant content and marketing materials, and any limitation on the collection and use of this data\ncould cause us to lose revenue.\nWhen our players use our games, we may collect both personal and non-personal data about our players. We use some of this data to provide a better experience for\nour players by delivering relevant content and marketing materials. Our players may decide not to allow us to collect some or all of this data or may limit our use of this data.\nAny limitation on our ability to collect data about our players and game interactions would likely make it more difficult for us to deliver targeted content and marketing\nmaterials to our players. Interruptions, failures or defects in our data collection, analysis and storage systems, as well as privacy concerns, increasing public scrutiny, and\nregulatory restrictions regarding the collection of data, could also limit our ability to aggregate and analyze player data. If that happens, we may not be able to successfully adapt\nto player preferences to improve and enhance our games, retain existing players, and maintain the popularity of our games, which could cause our business, financial condition,\nor results of operations to suffer.\nWe are also subject to evolving EU and UK privacy laws on cookies and similar technologies and eMarketing. In the EU and the UK, regulators are increasingly\nfocusing on compliance with requirements in the online behavioral advertising ecosystem, and current national laws that implement the ePrivacy Directive are highly likely to\nbe replaced by an EU regulation known as the ePrivacy Regulation which will significantly increase fines for non-compliance. In the EU and the UK, informed consent is\nrequired for the placement of a cookie or similar technologies on a user’s device and for direct electronic marketing. The GDPR also imposes conditions on obtaining valid\nconsent, such as a prohibition on pre-checked consents and a requirement to ensure separate consents are sought for each type of cookie or similar technology. While the text of\nthe ePrivacy Regulation is still under development, a recent European court decision and regulators’ recent guidance are driving increased attention to cookies and tracking\ntechnologies. If regulators start to enforce the strict approach endorsed in recent guidance, this could lead to substantial costs, require significant systems changes, limit the\neffectiveness of our marketing activities, divert the attention of our technology personnel, adversely affect our margins, increase costs, and subject us to additional liabilities.\nRegulation of cookies and similar technologies, and any decline in the use of cookies or similar online tracking technologies as a means to identify and potentially target\nplayers, may lead to broader restrictions and impairments on our marketing and personalization activities and may negatively impact our efforts to understand our players.\nAdditionally, Internet-connected devices and operating systems controlled by third parties increasingly contain features that allow device users to disable functionality\nthat allows for the delivery of advertising on their devices, including through Apple’s Identifier for Advertising, or IDFA, or Google’s Advertising ID, or AAID, for Android\ndevices. Device and browser manufacturers may include or expand these features as part of their standard device specifications. Advertising identifiers are frequently used as a\nmeans to deliver targeted advertising to devices. While historically we have conducted limited advertising to our players in our games (often referred to as “ad monetization”), it\nis a meaningful way to generate revenue for many mobile game companies. We introduced ad monetization mechanics as a limited pilot program and expanded it throughout\n2021 and 2022 into our legacy social casino games. In addition, our Tetris®-branded mobile game and all ten Brainium games currently generate most of their revenue through\nad monetization. Since we intend to continue to qualify and scale in-game advertising to generate revenue, we will be limited in how and to whom we can present with in-game\nadvertising, which could adversely affect our ability to generate revenues from advertising.\nWe rely on assumptions and estimates to calculate certain of our key metrics, and real or perceived inaccuracies in such metrics may harm our reputation and negatively\naffect our business.\nCertain of our key metrics, including Daily Active Users, or DAU, Monthly Active Users, or MAU, Average Daily Revenue per DAU, or ARPDAU, Daily Paying\nUsers, or DPU, and Daily Payer Conversion, as well as metrics relating to our playAWARDS loyalty program, are calculated using data tracked by our internal analytics\nsystems based on tracking activity of player accounts. The analytics systems and the resulting data have not been independently verified. While these numbers are based on\nwhat we believe to be reasonable calculations for the applicable period of measurement, there are inherent challenges in measuring usage and player engagement across our\nplayer base and our recently acquired operations, and factors relating to player activity and systems may impact these numbers.\nOur rewards partners, content licensors, advertisers, and investors rely on our key metrics as a representation of our performance. We regularly review and may adjust\nour processes for calculating our internal metrics to improve their accuracy. If we determine that we can no longer calculate any of our key metrics with a sufficient degree of\naccuracy, and we cannot find an adequate replacement for the metric, our business, financial condition, or results of operations may be harmed.\n34\nIn addition, if rewards partners, content licensors, or advertisers do not perceive our player metrics to be accurate representations of our user base or player engagement, or if we\ndiscover material inaccuracies in our user metrics, our reputation may be harmed and rewards partners, content licensors, or advertisers may be less willing to allocate their\nresources, intellectual property, or budgets to our games, which could negatively affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nCompanies and governmental agencies may restrict access to platforms, our website, mobile applications, or the Internet generally, which could lead to the loss or slower\ngrowth of our player base.\nOur players generally need to access the Internet and, in particular, platforms such as Facebook, Apple, Google, Amazon, and our website to play our games.\nSubstantially all of our games rely on data transferred over the Internet, including wireless Internet, and accordingly stable and timely Internet accessi s necessary to provide a\nsatisfactory player experience to the players of our games. Companies and governmental agencies could block access to any platform, our website, mobile applications, or the\nInternet generally, or could limit the speed of data transmissions, for a number of reasons such as security or confidentiality concerns or regulatory reasons, or they may adopt\npolicies that prohibit employees from accessing Facebook, Apple, Google, Amazon, and our website or any other social platform. In addition, telecommunications companies\nmay implement certain measures, such as increased cost or restrictions based on the type or amount of data transmitted, that would impact players’ ability to access our games.\nIf companies or governmental entities block or limit such access or otherwise adopt policies restricting players from playing our games, our business could be negatively\nimpacted and could lead to the loss or slower growth of our player base.\nOur business depends on the growth and maintenance of wireless communications infrastructure.\nOur success depends on the continued growth and maintenance of wireless communications infrastructure in the United States and internationally. This includes\ndeployment and maintenance of reliable next-generation digital networks with the speed, data capacity and security necessary to provide reliable wireless communications\nservices. Wireless communications infrastructure may be unable to support the demands placed on it if the number of subscribers continues to increase, or if existing or future\nsubscribers increase their bandwidth requirements. Wireless communications have experienced a variety of outages and other delays as a result of infrastructure and equipment\nfailures and could face outages and delays in the future. These outages and delays could reduce the level of wireless communications usage as well as our ability to distribute\nour games successfully. In addition, changes by a wireless carrier to network infrastructure may interfere with downloads of our games and may cause players to lose\nfunctionality in our games that they have already downloaded. This could harm our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations.\nDespite our security measures, we have been subject to attacks by hackers, and our information technology and infrastructure may in the future be vulnerable to attacks by\nhackers or breached due to employee error, malfeasance, or other disruptions. Any such breach could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be\naccessed, publicly disclosed, lost, or stolen. Any such access, disclosure, or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability under laws that\nprotect the privacy of personal information, regulatory penalties, disruption of our operations and the services we provide to players, damage to our reputation, and a loss of\nconfidence in our products and services, which could adversely affect our business.\nCybersecurity attacks, including breaches, computer malware and ransomware, computer hacking, and insider threats have become more prevalent in our industry, and\nexperts have warned that the global disruption related to the COVID-19 pandemic and remote working conditions may result in increased threats and malicious activity. Any\ncybersecurity breach caused by hacking, which involves efforts to gain unauthorized access to information or systems, or to cause intentional malfunctions, loss or corruption of\ndata, software, hardware, or other computer equipment, or the inadvertent transmission of computer viruses or other unauthorized access to our systems caused by employee\nerror, malfeasance, or other disruptions could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, or reputation.\nOur information technology has been and in the future may be subject to cybersecurity attacks, viruses, malicious software, break-ins, theft, computer hacking,\nemployee error or malfeasance or other security breaches. While to date no incidents have had a material impact on our operations or financial results, we cannot guarantee that\nmaterial incidents will not occur in the future. Hackers and data thieves, state-sponsored threat actors, criminal actors, hacktivists and others are increasingly sophisticated and\noperate large-scale and complex automated attacks through a variety of vectors such as social engineering/phishing, company insiders, suppliers or providers, and as a result of\nhuman or technological errors, including misconfigurations, bugs, or other vulnerabilities in software and hardware. Experienced computer programmers and hackers may be\nable to penetrate our security controls and misappropriate or compromise sensitive personal, proprietary or confidential information, create system disruptions or cause\nshutdowns. They also may be able to develop and deploy malicious software programs that attack our systems or otherwise exploit any security vulnerabilities. Our systems and\nthe\n35\ndata stored on those systems may also be vulnerable to security incidents or security attacks, acts of vandalism or theft, coordinated attacks by activist entities, misplaced or lost\ndata, human errors, or other similar events that could negatively affect our systems and the data stored on those systems, and the data of our business partners. Further, third\nparties, such as hosted solution providers, that provide services to us could also be a source of security risks in the event of a failure of their own security systems and\ninfrastructure.\nCybersecurity attacks are expected to accelerate on a global basis in frequency and magnitude as threat actors are becoming increasingly sophisticated in using\ntechniques and tools – including artificial intelligence – that circumvent security controls, evade detection and remove forensic evidence. As a result, we may be unable to\ndetect, investigate, remediate or recover from future attacks or incidents, or to avoid a material adverse impact to our security systems and infrastructure and the protection of\nour confidential information and our business.\nThe costs to eliminate or address the foregoing security threats and vulnerabilities before or after a cybersecurity incident could be significant. Our remediation efforts\nmay not be successful and could result in interruptions, delays or cessation of service, and loss of existing or potential suppliers or players. As threats related to cybersecurity\nattacks develop and grow, we may also find it necessary to make further investments to protect our data and infrastructure, which may impact our results of operations.\nAlthough we have insurance coverage for protecting against cybersecurity attacks, it may not be sufficient to cover all possible claims stemming from security breaches,\ncybersecurity attacks and other types of unlawful activity, or any resulting disruptions from such events, and we may suffer losses that could have a material adverse effect on\nour business. We could also be negatively impacted by existing and proposed laws and regulations in the United States, Israel, the European Union, and other jurisdictions in\nwhich we operate, as well as government policies and practices related to cybersecurity, data privacy, data localization and data protection. Furthermore, the platforms on which\nwe distribute games may encourage, or require, compliance with certain security standards, such as the voluntary cybersecurity framework released by the National Institute of\nStandards and Technology, or NIST, which consists of controls designed to identify and manage cybersecurity risks, and we could be negatively impacted to the extent we are\nunable to comply with such standards.\nIn addition, we store sensitive information, including personal information about our employees, and our games involve the storage and transmission of players’\npersonal information on equipment, networks, and corporate systems run by us or managed by third-parties including Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google, and Microsoft. We\nare subject to a number of laws, rules, and regulations requiring us to provide notification to players, investors, regulators, and other affected parties in the event of a security\nbreach of certain personal data, or requiring the adoption of minimum information security standards that are often vaguely defined and difficult to practically implement. The\ncosts of compliance with these laws and regulations, including the GDPR,the CCPA, and the CPRA, have increased and may increase in the future. Our corporate systems,\nthird-party systems, and security measures have been subject to a breach and may be breached in the future due to the actions of outside parties, employee error, malfeasance, a\ncombination of these, or otherwise, and, as a result, an unauthorized party may obtain access to, or compromise the integrity of, our data, our employees’ data, our players’ data,\nor any third-party data we may possess. Any such data security breach could require us to comply with various breach notification laws, create significant exposure for us,\nincluding under applicable data privacy laws and regulations such as the GDPR, the CCPA, and the CPRA, in particular if we have failed to take appropriate security measures,\nmay affect our ability to operate, and may expose us to litigation, remediation and investigation costs, increased costs for security measures, loss of revenue, damage to our\nreputation and potential liability, each of which could be material.\nChanges in tax laws or tax rulings could materially affect our effective tax rates, financial position, and results of operations.\nThe tax regimes we are subject to or operate under are unsettled and may be subject to significant change. Changes in tax laws (including in response to the COVID-19\npandemic or other future health epidemics or contagious disease outbreaks) or changes in interpretations of existing laws could cause us to be subject to additional income-\nbased taxes and non-income based taxes (such as payroll, sales, use, value-added, digital services, excise, net worth, property, and goods and services taxes), which in turn could\nmaterially affect our financial position and results of operations. For example, in December 2017, the U.S. federal government enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or the 2017\nTax Act. The 2017 Tax Act significantly changed the existing U.S. corporate income tax laws by, among other things, lowering the corporate tax rate, implementing a partially\nterritorial tax system, and imposing a one-time deemed repatriation toll tax on cumulative undistributed foreign earnings. Many of the provisions of the 2017 Tax Act are highly\ncomplex and may be subject to further interpretive guidance from the Internal Revenue Service, or IRS, or others. Some of the provisions of the 2017 Tax Act may be changed\nby Congress and may face future challenges by the World Trade Organization, or WTO, such as the favorable tax treatment for foreign-derived intangible income claimed by us.\nAlthough we cannot predict the nature or outcome of such future interpretive guidance, or actions by Congress or WTO, they could adversely impact the consolidated results of\nour operations and financial position. In addition, many countries in the EU, as well as a number of other countries and\n36\norganizations such as the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, have recently proposed or recommended changes to existing tax laws or have enacted new\nlaws that could impact our tax obligations. Any significant changes to our future effective tax rate may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results\nof operations, or cash flows.\nWe could be required to collect additional sales, value-added, or similar taxes or be subject to other tax liabilities that may increase the costs of our players to engage with\nour games and adversely affect our results of operations.\nOne or more U.S. states or foreign jurisdictions may seek to impose incremental or new sales, value-added, use, or other tax collection obligations on us. While we\ngenerally are not responsible for taxes generated on games accessed and operated through third-party platforms, we are responsible for collecting and remitting applicable sales,\nvalue-added, or other similar taxes for revenue generated on games accessed and operated on our own platforms. Historically, we paid taxes on revenue generated from games\naccessed on our own platforms in U.S. states where we had a sufficient physical presence or “nexus” based on the location of our U.S. offices and servers. However, there is\nuncertainty as to what constitutes sufficient physical presence or nexus for a U.S. state to levy taxes, fees, and surcharges for sales made over the Internet. Furthermore, an\nincreasing number of states have considered or adopted laws that impose sales tax collection obligations on out-of-state companies. This is also the case in respect of the EU,\nwhere value-added taxes may be imposed on non-EU companies making digital sales to consumers within the EU. In addition, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in South Dakota v.\nWayfair, Inc., or Wayfair, that online sellers can be required to collect sales and use tax despite not having a physical presence in the customer’s state. In response to Wayfair,\nor otherwise, state and local governments have adopted and begun to enforce, laws requiring us to calculate, collect, and remit sales taxes in their jurisdictions. Similarly, many\nforeign jurisdictions have considered or adopted laws that impose value-added, digital services, or similar indirect taxes on companies despite not having a physical presence in\nthe foreign jurisdiction.\nA successful assertion by one or more states, or other countries or jurisdictions, requiring us to collect taxes where we presently do not do so, or to collect more taxes in\na jurisdiction in which we currently collect some taxes, could result in substantial liabilities, including taxes on past sales as well as penalties and interest. We continually\nmonitor the ever-evolving tax landscape in the jurisdictions in which we operate and those jurisdictions where our players reside. The requirement to collect sales, value-added,\nor similar indirect taxes by foreign, state, or local governments for sellers that do not have a physical presence in the jurisdiction could also create additional administrative\nburdens for us, put us at a competitive disadvantage if they do not impose similar obligations on our competitors, or decrease our future sales, which may materially and\nadversely affect our business, and results of operations.\nWe may have exposure to greater than anticipated tax liabilities.\nOur income tax obligations are based in part on our corporate operating structure and intercompany arrangements. The tax laws applicable to our business, including\nthe laws of the U.S. and other jurisdictions, are subject to interpretation, and certain jurisdictions are aggressively interpreting their laws in new ways in an effort to raise\nadditional tax revenue. Our existing corporate structure and intercompany arrangements have been implemented in a manner we believe is in compliance with current prevailing\ntax laws. However, the taxing authorities of the jurisdictions in which we operate may challenge our methodologies for intercompany arrangements, which could impact our\nworldwide effective tax rate and harm our financial position and results of operations. In addition, changes to our corporate structure and intercompany agreements, including\nthrough acquisitions, could impact our worldwide effective tax rate and harm our financial position and results of operation.\nOur ability to utilize our research credit carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may have been limited by “ownership changes” and may be further limited.\nOur ability to utilize our research credit carryforwards to offset potential future income taxes that would otherwise be due is dependent upon our generation of future\nincome tax liabilities before the expiration dates of the research credit carryforwards, and we cannot predict with certainty when, or whether, we will generate sufficient income\ntax liabilities to use all of our research credit carryforwards.\nUnder Section 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and corresponding provisions of state law, if a corporation undergoes an “ownership change”\n(generally defined as a greater than 50 percentage point change (by value) in its equity ownership over a rolling three-year period), the corporation’s ability to use its research\ncredit carryforwards and other pre-change tax attributes to offset its post-change income taxes may be limited. We may have experienced, and we may in the future experience,\nownership changes, either as a result of the Acies Merger or other changes in our stock ownership (some of which are not within our control). As a result, if we incur income tax\nliability, our ability to use our pre-change research credit carryforwards to offset U.S. federal income taxes may be subject to limitations under Section 383, which could\npotentially result in increased future tax liability to us. In addition, at the state level, there may be periods during which\n37\nthe use of research credit carryforwards is suspended or otherwise limited, which could accelerate or permanently increase state taxes owed.\nRisks Related to Managing Our Business Operations in Israel\nPotential political, economic, and military instability in Israel and the surrounding region may adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe have a significant number of employees based at our studio in Tel Aviv, Israel. Accordingly, political, economic, and military conditions in Israel and the\nsurrounding region could directly affect our business and operations. In October 2023, Hamas conducted a series of coordinated attacks from the Gaza Strip against the Israeli\npeople, resulting in the outbreak of war between the State of Israel and Hamas. In addition, Israel is engaged in ongoing hostilities with Hezbollah in Lebanon. Any armed\nconflict or other hostilities involving Israel, or the interruption or curtailment of trade within Israel or between Israel and other countries, could adversely affect our business\noperations.\nIn addition, political uprisings in various countries in the Middle East in recent years have affected the political stability of those countries and have led to a decline in\nthe regional security situation. Such instability could also lead to deterioration in the political and trade relationships that exist between Israel and these countries. Any armed\nconflicts, terrorist activities, or political instability involving Israel or other countries in the region could adversely affect our business operations. In addition, political events\nwithin Israel may significantly affect our business, assets or operations. Social unrest, acts of terrorism, regime changes, changes in laws and regulations, political upheaval, and\npolicy changes or enactments in Israel or other countries in the region could negatively impact our business.\nThe relationship between the United States and Israel could be subject to fluctuation and periodic tension. Changes in political conditions in Israel and changes in the\nstate of U.S. relations with Israel are difficult to predict and could adversely affect our operations. Parties with whom we do business may be disinclined to travel to Israel\nduring periods of heightened unrest or tension, forcing us to make alternative arrangements when necessary to meet with our business partners. In addition, the political and\nsecurity situation in Israel may result in parties with whom we have agreements involving performance in Israel claiming that they are not obligated to perform their\ncommitments under those agreements pursuant to force majeure provisions in such agreements.\nOur insurance may not cover losses that we incur as a result of the security situation in Israel or for any resulting disruption in our business operations. Although the\nIsraeli government has in the past covered the reinstatement value of direct damages that were caused by terrorist attacks or acts of war, we cannot be assured that this\ngovernment coverage will be maintained or, if maintained, will be sufficient to compensate us fully for any damages we incur. In addition, the Israeli government may cease\nproviding such coverage in the future, or it may limit the amount or scope of coverage provided, and as a result any such coverage may be insufficient to cover potential\ndamages we may incur. Any losses or damages incurred by us could have a material adverse effect on our business. Any armed conflicts, political instability, terrorism,\ncybersecurity attacks or any other hostilities involving, or threatening Israel could negatively affect business conditions generally and harm our results of operations.\nOur operations may be disrupted because of the activation of Israeli citizens for military service.\nOur operations could also be disrupted by absences due to employees and service providers in Israel being activated for military service. Some of our employees in\nIsrael are obliged to perform military reserve duty and, in certain emergency circumstances, such employees may be called to immediate and unlimited active duty. As a result\nof Israel’s October 7, 2023 declaration of a state of war and activation of Article 8 of the Reserve Service Law (2008), a number of our employees in Israel were activated for\nmilitary duty and we expect that additional employees could be activated if the war continues or expands. Any major escalation in hostilities in the region could result in a\nportion of our employees and service providers in Israel being called up to perform military duty for an extended period. Our operations could be disrupted by such call-ups.\nWhile we have implemented business continuity measures to address the military call-ups, any resulting disruption could materially adversely affect our business operations,\nfinancial condition, and results of operations.\n38\nWe incur operating expenses that are denominated in currencies other than the US Dollar, including expenses denominated in New Israeli Shekels, and as a result our\nfinancial condition and results of operations may be harmed by currency exchange rate fluctuations.\nWe are exposed to currency fluctuation risks. Although our functional currency is the U.S. Dollar and our revenues and expenses are reported in U.S. Dollars, we\nregularly incur operating expenses that are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. A significant portion of our headcount related expenses, consisting principally\nof salaries and related personnel expenses, as well as leases and certain other operating expenses, are denominated in New Israeli Shekels, or NIS. We also incur operating\nexpenses denominated in the Hong Kong Dollar, Euro, Serbian Dinar, Vietnamese Dong, Singaporean Dollar, Mexican Peso, and Chilean Peso.\nAs a result, fluctuations in the exchange rates of the NIS and other foreign currencies relative to the U.S. Dollar have an influence on our operating expenses, which are\nall reported in U.S. Dollars regardless of the currency in which they are incurred. From time to time, we may enter into currency hedging arrangements to decrease the risk of\nfinancial exposure from fluctuations in the exchange rate of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. Dollar. Such arrangements may not be sufficient to fully protect us, and our\noperating results and financial condition could be adversely impacted by currency exchange rate fluctuations notwithstanding any risk mitigation measures we might employ\nfrom time to time.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nEconomic downturns and political and market conditions beyond our control could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, or prospects.\nOur financial performance is subject to U.S. economic conditions and their impact on levels of spending by players, our rewards partners, and our advertisers.\nEconomic recessions have had, and may continue to have, far-reaching adverse consequences across many industries, including the gaming industries, which may adversely\naffect our business and financial condition. In the past decade, the U.S. economy experienced tepid growth following the financial crisis in 2008 and 2009 and experienced a\nrecession in 2020 due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic as well as international trade and monetary policy and other changes. If the U.S. economy experiences another\nrecession or any of the relevant regional or local economies suffers a prolonged downturn, our business, financial condition, results of operations, or prospects may be\nadversely affected.\nIn addition, changes in general market, economic and political conditions in domestic and foreign economies or financial markets, including fluctuation in stock\nmarkets resulting from, among other things, trends in the economy as a whole, inflation, unemployment, consumer debt levels, geopolitical events, and other challenges\nimpacting the global economy, including the COVID-19 pandemic, disruption of supply chains, and armed conflict between Ukraine and Russia, may adversely affect\nconsumer confidence or cause a reduction to our players’ disposable income or our rewards partners’ budgets resulting in fewer or less desirable rewards to be offered to our\nplayers. In addition, the impact of inflation on our operating expenses may decrease profitability. Any one of these changes could materially and adversely affect our business,\nfinancial condition, results of operations, or prospects.\nOur results of operations may fluctuate due to various factors and, therefore, our periodic operating results will not be guarantees of future performance.\nOur financial results and operating metrics have fluctuated in the past and we expect such results to fluctuate in the future. These fluctuations may be due to a variety of\nfactors, some of which are outside of our control and may not fully reflect the underlying performance of our business.\nOur financial results and operations in any given period may be influenced by numerous factors, many of which we are unable to predict or are outside of our control.\nPlayer engagement with our games may decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including the popularity of the underlying games, the player’s level of satisfaction\nwith our games, our ability to improve and innovate games and to attract new rewards partners, outages and disruptions of online services, the services offered by our\ncompetitors, our marketing and advertising efforts, or declines in player activity generally as a result of economic downturns, among others. Any decline or fluctuation in the\nrecurring portion of our business may have a negative impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or prospects.\nOur reported financial results may be affected by changes in accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S.\nGenerally accepted accounting principles in the U.S., or GAAP, are subject to interpretation by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, the SEC and\nvarious bodies formed to promulgate and interpret appropriate accounting principles. A change in these principles or interpretations could have a significant effect on our\nreported financial\n39\nresults, and could affect the reporting of transactions completed before the announcement of a change. Any difficulties in implementing any future changes to accounting\nprinciples could cause us to fail to meet our financial reporting obligations, which could result in regulatory discipline and harm investors’ confidence in us.\nSecurities analysts may not publish favorable research or reports about our business or may publish no information at all, which could cause our stock price or trading\nvolume to decline.\nOur stock price and trading volume may be heavily influenced by the way analysts and investors interpret our financial information and other disclosures. If securities\nor industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business, delay publishing reports about our business, or publish negative reports about our business, regardless\nof accuracy, the trading price and trading volume of our Class A common stock could decline.\nThe trading market for shares of our Class A common stock may be influenced to some extent by the research and reports that industry or financial analysts publish\nabout us and our business. We do not control these analysts. The analysts who publish information about us may have had relatively little experience with us, which could\naffect their ability to accurately forecast our results and could make it more likely that we fail to meet their estimates. In the event we obtain securities or industry analyst\ncoverage, if any of the analysts who cover us provide inaccurate or unfavorable research or issue an adverse opinion regarding our stock price, the trading price of our Class A\ncommon stock could decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of us or fail to publish reports covering us regularly, we could lose visibility in the market, which\nin turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.\nEven if we are actively covered by analysts, we do not have any control over the analysts or the measures that analysts or investors may rely upon to forecast our future\nresults. Overreliance by analysts or investors on any particular metric to forecast our future results may lead to forecasts that differ significantly from our own.\nWe may require additional capital to support our growth plans, and such capital may not be available on terms acceptable to us, if at all. This could hamper our growth and\nadversely affect our business.\nWe intend to continue to make significant investments to support our business growth and may require additional funds to respond to business challenges, including the\nneed to develop new games and features or enhance our existing games, improve our operating infrastructure or acquire complementary businesses, personnel, and technologies.\nAccordingly, we may need to engage in equity or debt financings to secure additional funds. If we raise additional funds through future issuances of equity or convertible debt\nsecurities, our existing stockholders could suffer significant dilution, and any new equity securities we issue could have rights, preferences and privileges superior to those of\nholders of our Class A common stock. In June 2021, we entered into the Credit Agreement, which subjects us to certain operational and financial covenants.\nAny additional debt financing that we secure in the future could involve offering additional security interests and undertaking restrictive covenants relating to our\ncapital raising activities and other financial and operational matters, which may make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital and to pursue business opportunities,\nincluding potential acquisitions. Additionally, current economic and political conditions, including inflation and higher interest rates, have disrupted capital markets, and if we\nseek to access additional capital or increase our borrowing, there can be no assurance that debt or equity financing may be available to us on favorable terms, if at all. If we are\nunable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us when we require it, our ability to continue to support our business growth and to respond to business\nchallenges could be significantly impaired, and our business, financial condition, or results of operations may be harmed.\nOur investments may become impaired by deterioration of the financial markets.\nOur investment portfolio consist primarily of short-term investments of our available cash. These funds have been invested with a goal of preserving our access to\ncapital, and the investments generally consist of highly liquid, short-term instruments such as money market funds, corporate debt securities, U.S. government and government\nagency debt securities, mutual funds, certificates of deposit, and time deposits. We follow an investment policy and set of guidelines to monitor and help mitigate our exposure\nto interest rate and credit risk, which guidelines include credit quality and concentration standards to help manage investment risk. Volatility in the global financial markets can\nnegatively impact the value of our investments. Although we intend to manage our investment portfolio for a low risk of material impairment, we cannot predict future market\nconditions, market liquidity or credit availability, and can provide no assurance that our investment portfolio will remain materially unimpaired.\n40\nThe requirements of being a public company may strain our resources and divert management’s attention, and the increases in legal, accounting and compliance expenses\nmay be greater than we anticipate.\nWe are a public company, and as such (and particularly after we are no longer an “emerging growth company”) we incur significant legal, accounting, and other\nexpenses that we did not incur as a private company. We are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, and are required to comply with the applicable\nrequirements of the U.S. Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, as well as the rules\nand regulations subsequently implemented by the SEC and the listing standards of the Nasdaq, including changes in corporate governance practices and the establishment and\nmaintenance of effective disclosure and financial controls. Compliance with these rules and regulations can be burdensome. Our management and other personnel need to\ndevote a substantial amount of time to these compliance initiatives. Moreover, these rules and regulations have increased, and will continue to increase, our historical legal and\nfinancial compliance costs and will make some activities more time-consuming and costly. For example, we expect that these rules and regulations may make it more difficult\nand more expensive for us to attract and retain qualified members to the Board of Directors. In particular, we expect to incur significant expenses and devote substantial\nmanagement effort toward ensuring compliance with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which will increase when we are no longer an “emerging\ngrowth company.” We will need to hire additional accounting and financial staff, and engage outside consultants, all with appropriate public company experience and technical\naccounting knowledge and maintain an internal audit function, which will increase our operating expenses. Moreover, we could incur additional compensation costs in the event\nthat we decide to pay cash compensation closer to that of other publicly listed companies, which would increase our general and administrative expenses and could materially\nand adversely affect our profitability. We are evaluating these rules and regulations, and cannot predict or estimate the amount of additional costs we may incur or the timing of\nsuch costs.\nWe may not have adequate personnel with the appropriate level of knowledge, experience, and training in the accounting policies, practices, or internal control over\nfinancial reporting required of public companies. Our management will need to continually assess our staffing and training procedures to improve our internal control over\nfinancial reporting. Further, the development, implementation, documentation, and assessment of appropriate processes, in addition to the need to remediate any potential\ndeficiencies, will require substantial time and attention from management. The development and implementation of the standards and controls necessary for us to achieve the\nlevel of accounting standards required of a public company may require costs greater than expected. It is possible that we will be required to expand our employee base and hire\nadditional employees to continue to support our operations as a public company which will increase our operating costs in future periods.\nAs a private company, Old PLAYSTUDIOS was not required to document and test internal controls over financial reporting, management was not required to certify the\neffectiveness of internal controls, and auditors were not required to opine on the effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting. Failure to maintain adequate\nfinancial, information technology, and management processes and controls could result in material weaknesses which could lead to errors in our financial reporting,\nwhich could adversely affect our business.\nOld PLAYSTUDIOS was not required to document and test internal controls over financial reporting, management was not required to certify the effectiveness of our\ninternal controls, and auditors were not required to opine on the effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting. We are not currently subject to the auditor attestation\nrequirement of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. However, when we lose our emerging growth company status and become subject to the auditor attestation\nrequirements of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, we may not be able to complete our evaluation, testing, and any required remediation in a timely fashion. In\naddition, our current controls and any new controls that we develop may become inadequate because of poor design and changes in our business, including increased\ncomplexity resulting from our international operations and our contemplated international expansion. Any failure to implement and maintain effective internal controls over\nfinancial reporting could adversely affect the results of assessments by our independent registered public accounting firm and its attestation reports.\nIf we are unable to certify the effectiveness of our internal controls, or if our internal controls have one or more material weaknesses, we may not detect errors timely,\nour financial statements could be misstated, we could be subject to regulatory scrutiny and a loss of confidence by stakeholders, which could harm our business and adversely\naffect the trading price of our Class A common stock.\nWe are currently an “emerging growth company” within the meaning of the Securities Act and have taken advantage of certain exemptions from disclosure requirements\navailable to emerging growth companies, which could make our\n41\nsecurities less attractive to investors and may make it more difficult to compare our performance to the performance of other public companies.\nWe are currently an “emerging growth company” as defined in Section 2(a)(19) of the Securities Act, as modified by the JOBS Act. As such, we are eligible for and\nhave taken advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies, and we intend\nto continue to take advantage of such exemptions for as long as we continue to be an emerging growth company, including, but not limited to: (i) not being required to comply\nwith the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, (ii) reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic\nreports and proxy statements, and (iii) exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any\ngolden parachute payments not previously approved. As a result, our stockholders may not have access to certain information they may deem important. We will remain an\nemerging growth company until the earliest of (1) the last day of the fiscal year in which the market value of our Class A common stock that are held by non-affiliates exceeds\n$700 million as of June 30 of that fiscal year, (2) the last day of the fiscal year in which we have total annual gross revenue of $1.07 billion or more during such fiscal year (as\nindexed for inflation), (3) the date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt in the prior three-year period, or (4) the last day of the fiscal year\nfollowing the fifth anniversary of the date of the first sale of Acies Class A ordinary shares. Investors may find our securities less attractive because we have relied on these\nexemptions. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result of our reliance on these exemptions, the trading prices of our securities may be lower than they\notherwise would be, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the trading prices of our securities may be more volatile.\nFurther, Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards\nuntil private companies (that is, those that have not had a Securities Act registration statement declared effective or do not have a class of securities registered under the\nExchange Act) are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting standards. The JOBS Act provides that a company can elect to opt out of the extended\ntransition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies but any such election to opt out is irrevocable. We have elected not to opt out\nof such extended transition period which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private companies, we, as an\nemerging growth company, can adopt the new or revised standard at the time private companies adopt the new or revised standard. This may make comparison of our financial\nstatements with another public company which is neither an emerging growth company nor an emerging growth company which has opted out of using the extended transition\nperiod difficult or impossible because of the potential differences in accounting standards used.\nOur workforce and operations have grown substantially since our inception and we expect that they will continue to do so. If we are unable to effectively manage that\ngrowth, our financial performance and future prospects will be adversely affected.\nSince our inception, we have experienced growth in the U.S. and internationally. This expansion increases the complexity of our business and has placed, and will\ncontinue to place, significant strain on our management, personnel, operations, systems, technical performance, financial resources, and internal financial control and reporting\nfunctions. We may not be able to manage our growth effectively, which could damage our reputation and negatively affect our operating results.\nProperly managing our growth will require us to continue to hire, train, and manage qualified employees and staff, including engineers, operations personnel, finance\nand accounting staff, and sales and marketing staff, and to improve and maintain our technology. If our new hires perform poorly, if we are unsuccessful in hiring, training,\nmanaging, and integrating these new employees and staff, or if we are not successful in retaining our existing employees and staff, our business may be harmed. Moreover, in\norder to optimize our organizational structure, we have implemented reductions in force and may in the future implement other reductions in force. Any reduction in force may\nyield unintended consequences and costs, such as attrition beyond the intended reduction in force, the distraction of employees, and reduced employee morale. Any reduction in\nforce also could adversely affect our reputation as an employer, which could make it more difficult for us to hire new employees in the future and increase the risk that we may\nnot achieve the anticipated benefits from the reduction in force. Properly managing our growth will require us to establish consistent policies across regions and functions, and a\nfailure to do so could harm our business.\nOur failure to upgrade our technology or network infrastructure effectively to support our growth could result in unanticipated disruptions. To manage the growth of\nour operations and personnel and improve the technology that supports our business operations, as well as our financial and management systems, disclosure controls and\nprocedures, and internal controls over financial reporting, we will be required to commit substantial financial, operational, and technical resources.\n42\nOur current and planned personnel, systems, procedures, and controls may not be adequate to support our future operations. If we are unable to expand our operations and\nhire additional qualified personnel in an efficient manner, or if our operational technology is insufficient to reliably service our games, we could potentially face difficulties in\nretaining players, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nOur organizational structure is complex and will continue to grow as we add additional employees. We will need to scale our operational, financial, and management\ncontrols as well as our reporting systems and procedures to support the growth of our organizational structure. We will require capital and management resources to grow and\nmature in these areas. If we are unable to effectively manage the growth of our business, the quality of our games may suffer, and we may be unable to address competitive\nchallenges, which would adversely affect our business, operations, and financial condition.\nContinued growth and success will depend on the performance of our current and future employees, including certain key employees. Recruitment and retention of these\nindividuals is vital to growing our business and meeting our business plans. The loss of any of our key executives or other key employees could harm our business.\nOur ability to compete and grow depends in large part on the efforts and talents of our employees and executives. Our success depends in a large part upon the continued\nservice of our senior management team, including Andrew Pascal, our Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer. Mr. Pascal is critical to our vision, strategic direction, culture,\nproducts, and technology, and the continued retention of our entire senior management team is important to the success of our operating plan. We do not have employment\nagreements with members of our senior management team, all of whom are \"at-will\" employees, and we do not maintain key man insurance for members of our senior\nmanagement team. The loss of any member of our senior management team could cause disruption and harm our business, financial condition, results of operations, or\nreputation.\nIn addition, our ability to execute our strategy depends on our continued ability to identify, hire, develop, motivate, and retain highly skilled employees, particularly in\nthe competitive fields of game design, product management, engineering, and data science. These employees are in high demand, and we devote significant resources to\nidentifying, recruiting, hiring, training, and successfully integrating and retaining them. Interviewing, hiring, and integrating new employees has and will continue to be\nparticularly challenging following the COVID-19 pandemic and the increase in hybrid/remote working arrangements. Furthermore, we have observed labor shortages, increased\ncompetition for talent, and a rise in employee attrition. We will continue to devote increased efforts to maintaining the collaborative culture of the corporate headquarters and\neach of our domestic and international game studios through the use of videoconferencing and other online communication and sharing tools, and to monitoring the health,\nsafety, morale, and productivity of our employees, including new employees, as we evaluate the impacts of this challenging situation on our business and employees.\nWe believe that two critical components of our success and our ability to retain our best people are our culture and our competitive compensation practices. As we\ncontinue to operate as a public company, we may find it difficult to maintain our entrepreneurial, execution-focused culture. In addition, any volatility in our operating results\nand the trading price of our Class A common stock may cause our employee base to be more vulnerable to be targeted for recruitment by competitors. While we believe we\ncompete favorably, competition for highly skilled employees is intense. If we are unable to identify, hire, and retain our senior management team and our key employees, our\nbusiness, financial condition, or results of operations could be harmed. Moreover, if our team fails to work together effectively to execute our plans and strategies on a timely\nbasis, our business, financial condition, or results of operations could be harmed.\nAny restructuring actions and cost reduction initiatives that we have undertaken or may undertake in the future may not deliver the expected results and these actions may\nadversely affect our business.\nWe have implemented restructurings in the past and may implement restructurings in the future for purpose of reducing costs, streamlining operations, and improving\ncost efficiencies to better align our operating expenses with our revenue. Such restructurings may include reducing our headcount, rationalizing our product pipeline, reducing\nmarketing and technology expenditures, and downsizing or closing certain game studios. We plan to continue to manage costs to better and more efficiently manage our\nbusiness. Our restructuring plans and other such efforts could result in disruptions to our operations and adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of\noperations.\nWe actively monitor our costs, however, if we do not fully realize or maintain the anticipated benefits of any restructuring actions and cost reduction initiatives, our\nbusiness, financial condition, or results of operations could be adversely affected, and additional restructuring actions and cost reduction initiatives may be necessary. In\naddition, we cannot be sure that such actions and initiatives will be as successful in reducing our overall expenses as expected or that additional costs will not offset any such\nreductions. If our operating costs are higher than we expect or if we do not maintain adequate control of our costs and expenses, our operating results will suffer. In addition, any\ncost reduction measures could\n43\nnegatively impact our business, financial condition, or results of operations including but not limited to, delaying the introduction of new games, features, or content, delaying\nintroduction of new technology, impacting our ability to react nimbly to game or technology issues, or impacting employee retention and morale.\nOur systems and operations are vulnerable to damage or interruption from natural disasters, power losses, telecommunications failures, cybersecurity attacks, terrorist\nattacks, acts of war, human errors, break-ins and similar events.\nWe have in the past and may continue to experience disruption as a result of catastrophic events. The occurrence of a catastrophic event, such as a global pandemic\nlike the COVID-19 pandemic or the consequences of climate change, may result in our inability to continue business operations and may result in system interruptions,\nreputational harm, delays in application development, lengthy interruptions in our services, breaches of data security and loss of critical data, such as player, customer and\nbilling data, as well as intellectual property rights, software, or other relevant data regarding operations, and there can be no assurances that our insurance policies will provide\ncoverage for any resulting losses, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur insurance may not provide adequate levels of coverage against claims.\nWe believe that we maintain insurance customary for businesses of our size and type. However, there are types of losses we may incur that cannot be insured against\nor that we believe are not economically reasonable to insure. Moreover, any loss incurred could exceed policy limits and policy payments made to us may not be made on a\ntimely basis. Such losses could adversely affect our business prospects, results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition.\nBecause we are a “controlled company” within the meaning of the Nasdaq rules, our stockholders may not have certain corporate governance protections that are\navailable to stockholders of companies that are not controlled companies.\nSo long as more than 50% of the voting power for the election of directors is held by an individual, a group or another company, we will qualify as a “controlled\ncompany” within the meaning of the Nasdaq corporate governance standards. As of December 31, 2023, the Founder Group controlled more than 70% of the combined voting\npower of our outstanding capital stock. As a result, we are a “controlled company” within the meaning of the Nasdaq corporate governance standards and are not subject to the\nrequirements that would otherwise require us to have: (i) a majority of independent directors; (ii) a nominating committee comprised solely of independent directors; (iii)\ncompensation of our executive officers determined by a majority of the independent directors or a compensation committee comprised solely of independent directors; and (iv)\ndirector nominees selected, or recommended for the Board of Directors selection, either by a majority of the independent directors or a nominating committee comprised solely\nof independent directors. As of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we do not utilize any of these exemptions, however, should we later choose to do so, you may not\nhave the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of these corporate governance requirements.\nThe Founder Group may have its interest in us diluted due to future equity issuances or its own actions in selling shares of our Class B common stock, in each case,\nwhich could result in a loss of the “controlled company” exemption under the Nasdaq listing rules. We would then be required to comply with those provisions of the Nasdaq\nlisting requirements.\nThe dual class structure of our common stock has the effect of concentrating voting power with Andrew Pascal, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, which limits\nan investor’s ability to influence the outcome of important transactions, including a change in control.\nShares of our Class B common stock are entitled to twenty (20) votes per share, while shares of our Class A common stock are entitled to one (1) vote per share. Mr.\nPascal and his affiliated entities included in the Founder Group hold all of the issued and outstanding shares of our Class B common stock. Accordingly, as of December 31,\n2023, the Founder Group, including Mr. Pascal, beneficially owned more than 70% of the combined voting power of our outstanding common stock, and is able to control\nmatters submitted to our stockholders for approval, including the election of directors, amendments to our organizational documents and any merger, consolidation, sales of all\nor substantially all of our assets or other major corporate transactions. Mr. Pascal may have interests that differ from yours and may vote in a way with which you disagree and\nwhich may be adverse to your interests. This concentrated control may have the effect of delaying, preventing, or deterring a change in control of our company, could deprive\nour stockholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their capital stock as part of a sale of our company, and may ultimately affect the market price of shares of our Class\nA common stock.\n44\nWe cannot predict the impact our dual class structure may have on the stock price of our Class A common stock.\nWe cannot predict whether our dual class structure will result in a lower or more volatile market price of our Class A common stock or in adverse publicity or other\nadverse consequences. For example, certain index providers have announced restrictions on including companies with multiple-class share structures in certain of their indexes.\nUnder these policies, our dual class capital structure would make us ineligible for inclusion in certain indices, and as a result, mutual funds, exchange-traded funds, and other\ninvestment vehicles that attempt to passively track those indices will not be investing in our stock. It is unclear what effect, if any, these policies will have on the valuations of\npublicly traded companies excluded from such indices, but it is possible that they may depress valuations, as compared to similar companies that are included. As a result, the\nmarket price of shares of our Class A common stock could be adversely affected.\nWe may issue preferred stock or additional common stock, including under the 2021 Plan and 2021 Employee Stock Purchase Plan. Any such issuances would dilute the\ninterest of our stockholders and likely present other risks.\nWe may issue shares of preferred stock (which may be convertible into a substantial number of shares of common stock) or additional shares of common stock,\nincluding under the 2021 Plan and 2021 Employee Stock Purchase Plan. Any such issuances of shares of preferred stock or additional shares of common stock:\n• may significantly dilute the equity interests of our stockholders;\n• may subordinate the rights of holders of common stock if preferred stock is issued with rights senior to those afforded our common stock;\n• could cause a change in control if a substantial number of shares of our common stock are issued, which may affect, among other things, our ability to use our net\noperating loss carry forwards, if any, and could result in the resignation or removal of our present officers and directors; and\n• may adversely affect prevailing market prices for our Class A common stock.\nLegal proceedings in connection with the Acies Merger, the outcomes of which are uncertain, could divert management’s attention and adversely affect our daily\noperations.\nOn March 2, 2021, a lawsuit was filed in the Superior Court of California, Los Angeles County, by a purported Acies shareholder in connection with the Acies Merger:\nMcCart v. Acies Acquisition Corp., et al. (Sup. Ct. L.A. County) (the “McCart Complaint”). The McCart Complaint names Acies and members of Acies’ board of directors as\ndefendants. The McCart Complaint alleges breaches of fiduciary duties against members of Acies’ board of directors and aiding and abetting the board of directors’ alleged\nbreaches of fiduciary duties against Acies. The McCart Complaint also alleges that the registration statement is materially deficient and omits and/or misrepresents material\ninformation including, among other things, certain financial information, certain details regarding Acies’ financial advisors, and other information relating to the background of\nthe Acies Merger. The McCart Complaint generally seeks to enjoin the Acies Merger or in the event that it is consummated, recover damages.\nAnother purported Acies shareholder sent a demand letter on February 19, 2021 (the “Demand”), making similar allegations as those made in the McCart Complaint\nand demanding additional disclosure regarding the Acies Merger.\nWhile the McCart Complaint was voluntarily dismissed by the plaintiff on August 6, 2021, and we have not received any further communications relating to the\nDemand, additional lawsuits may be filed against us or our directors and officers in connection with the Acies Merger.\nOn April 6, 2022, a class action lawsuit was filed in the United Stated District Court, Northern District of California, by a purported Company shareholder in\nconnection with alleged federal securities law violations: Christian A. Felipe et. al. v. PLAYSTUDIOS, Inc. (the “Felipe Complaint”). On July 15, 2022, the lawsuit was\ntransferred to the United States District Court of Nevada, Southern District. On October 4, 2022, the plaintiffs filed an amendment to the Felipe Complaint. The Felipe\nComplaint names the Company, several current and former board members of the Company, board members and officers of Acies Acquisition Corp., and Andrew Pascal, the\nCompany’s Chairman and CEO, as defendants. The Felipe Complaint alleges misrepresentations and omissions regarding the state of the Company’s development of the\nKingdom Boss game and its financial projections and future prospects in the S-4 Registration Statement filed by Acies that was declared effective on May 25, 2021, the Proxy\nStatement filed by Acies on May 25, 2021, and other public statements that touted Old PLAYSTUDIOS’ financial performance and operations, including statements made on\nearnings calls and the Amended S-1 Registration Statement filed by the Company that was declared effective on July 30, 2021. The Felipe Complaint alleges that the\nmisrepresentations and omissions resulted in stock price drops of 13% on August 12, 2021, and 5% on February 25, 2022,\n45\nfollowing (i) the Company’s release of financial results for the second quarter of 2021, ended on June 30, 2021, and (ii) the filing of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-\nK for the year ended December 31, 2021 and issuance of a press release summarizing financial results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2021, respectively.\nThe Felipe Complaint seeks an award of damages for an unspecified amount.\nDefending the Felipe Complaint and any such additional lawsuits could require us incur significant costs and draw the attention of the management team away from\nthe daily operations of our business. Further, the defense or settlement of any lawsuit or claim may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and\ncash flows.\nWarrants may be exercised for our Class A common stock, and Earnout Shares and Sponsor Shares may become issuable or vest, each of which would increase the\nnumber of shares eligible for future resale in the public market and result in dilution to our stockholders.\nOutstanding Warrants to purchase an aggregate of 10,996,631 shares of our Class A common stock became exercisable in accordance with the terms of the Warrant\nAgreement governing those securities on October 27, 2021. The exercise price of these Warrants is $11.50 per share. The Company completed an offer to purchase each of its\nWarrants in the Tender Offer (as defined and described in Note 12—Warrant Liabilities in the accompanying consolidated financial statements) on May 13, 2022, in which\nholders of 1,792,463 outstanding Public Warrants tendered their Public Warrants for a purchase price of $1.00 per warrant. Following redemption of the Public Warrants\ntendered in the Tender Offer, approximately 5.4 million Public Warrants and approximately 3.8 million Private Warrants remained outstanding. In addition, up to 15,000,000\ncontingently issuable shares (the \"Earnout Shares\") may be issued, and up to 900,000 unvested shares previously issued to the sponsor of Acies (the \" Sponsor Shares\") may\nvest and become unrestricted, upon the closing price of the Class A common stock exceeding $12.50 and $15.00 per share, respectively, for any 20 trading days within any 30-\ntrading day window commencing on or after November 18, 2021 and ending no later than June 21, 2026 (the Earnout Shares will also vest based on the price targets in\nconnection with a sale of our company). To the extent such Warrants are exercised and the Earnout Shares are issued or the Sponsor Shares vest and become unrestricted,\nadditional shares of our Class A common stock will be issued or become eligible for resale, which will result in dilution to the holders of our common stock and increase the\nnumber of shares eligible for resale in the public market. Actual or potential sales of Earnout Shares or Sponsor Shares in the public market, or the fact that additional shares are\nissuable upon exercise of such Warrants, could adversely affect the market price of our Class A common stock.\nRegulatory and licensing requirements may limit the ability of third parties seeking to make investments in us or acquire us.\nMany states require prior approval of acquisitions of “control,” as defined under each state’s laws and regulations, which may apply to an investment without regard to\nthe intent of the investor. In some states, the obligation to obtain approval is imposed on the licensee, and in other states, the prospective investor bears the statutory obligation.\nDepending on the form of entity, the threshold trigger may be limited to voting stock. A failure to make the relevant filings and receive the requisite approvals could result in\nadministrative sanctions against the prospective investor or the licensee, including the potential suspension of the license in that state until the requisite approval is obtained.\nThese regulatory requirements may discourage potential acquisition proposals or investments that would result in a change of control of us, may delay or prevent acquisition of\nshares that would result in a change in control of us, and, as a result, may adversely impact demand for, and the trading price of, our Class A common stock.\nAdditional Risks Related to Ownership of Our Class A Common Stock and Our Operation as a Public Company\nThe price of our Class A common stock and Public Warrants may be volatile.\nThe price of our Class A common stock, as well as our Public Warrants, may fluctuate due to a variety of factors, including:\n• changes in the industries in which we and our vendors operate;\n• developments involving our competitors;\n• changes in laws and regulations affecting our business;\n• variations in our operating performance and the performance of our competitors in general;\n• actual or anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly or annual operating results;\n46\n• publication of research reports by securities analysts about us or our competitors or our industry;\n• the public’s reaction to our press releases, our other public announcements, and our filings with the SEC;\n• sales of shares of Class A common stock by our stockholders, including the PIPE Investors (as defined in Note 4—Business Combinations);\n• the issuance and potential sales of 15,000,000 Earnout Shares and potential sale of 900,000 Sponsor Shares upon the occurrence of an Earnout Triggering Event;\n• additions and departures of key personnel;\n• commencement of, or involvement in, litigation against us;\n• changes in our capital structure, such as future issuances of securities or the incurrence of additional debt;\n• the volume of shares of our Class A common stock available for public sale; and\n• general economic and political conditions, such as the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, inflation, recessions, interest rates, local and national elections, fuel prices,\ninternational currency fluctuations, corruption, political instability, armed conflict between Israel and Hamas in Gaza and between Israel and Hezbollah in Jordan and\nthe West Bank, armed conflict between Ukraine and Russia, or other acts of war or terrorism.\nThese market and industry factors may materially reduce the market price of our Class A common stock and Public Warrants regardless of our operating performance.\nIn addition, fluctuations in the price of our securities could contribute to the loss of all or part of your investment. If an active market for our securities develops and\ncontinues, the trading price of our securities could be volatile and subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control. Any of the\nfactors listed above could have a material adverse effect on your investment in our securities, and our securities may trade at prices significantly below the price you paid for\nthem. In such circumstances, the trading price of our securities may not recover and may experience a further decline.\nWe do not intend to pay cash dividends for the foreseeable future.\nWe currently intend to retain our future earnings, if any, to finance the further development and expansion of our business and do not intend to pay cash dividends in\nthe foreseeable future. Any future determination to pay dividends will be at the discretion of the Board of Directors and will depend our financial condition, results of\noperations, capital requirements, restrictions contained in future agreements and financing instruments, business prospects, and such other factors as the Board of Directors\ndeems relevant.\nWe are currently, and in the future may be, subject to securities litigation, which is expensive and could divert management attention.\nThe market price of our Class A common stock may be volatile and, in the past, companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been\nsubject to securities class action litigation. In addition to the Felipe Complaint, we may be the target of this type of litigation in the future. Additional securities litigation against\nus could result in substantial costs and divert management’s attention from other business concerns, which could seriously harm our business.\nFuture resales of Class A common stock may cause the market price of our securities to drop significantly, even if our business is doing well.\nPursuant to the Sponsor Support Agreement and the Bylaws and subject to certain exceptions, the holders of: (i) the shares of our common stock issued as\nconsideration pursuant to the Acies Merger, (ii) any Old PLAYSTUDIOS Options; (iii) the shares of our common stock underlying the Old PLAYSTUDIOS Options; (iv)\nSponsor Shares; or (v) Private Warrants, in each case, were restricted from selling or transferring any of the securities described in clauses (i), (ii), (iii), (iv), or (v) (the “Lock-\nUp Securities”) from the Closing through June 21, 2022.\nSince such lock-up period has expired, the Sponsor and the Old PLAYSTUDIOS stockholders are no longer restricted from selling shares of our Class A common\nstock held by them, other than by applicable securities laws. Additionally, the PIPE Investors were not restricted from selling any of their shares of our Class A common stock,\nother than\n47\nby applicable securities laws. Since the lock-up period has expired and with registration statements (filed after the Closing to provide for the resale of certain shares from time to\ntime) available for use, sales of a substantial number of shares of our Class A common stock in the public market could occur at any time. These sales, or the perception in the\nmarket that the holders of a large number of shares intend to sell shares, could have the effect of increasing the volatility in the share price of our Class A common stock or\nreducing the market price of our Class A common stock.\nThe Public Warrants may never be in the money and they may expire worthless, and the terms of the Public Warrants may be amended in a manner adverse to a holder if\nholders of at least 65% of the then outstanding Public Warrants approve of such amendment.\nThe Public Warrants were issued in registered form under a Warrant Agreement between Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, as warrant agent, and Acies. The\nWarrant Agreement provides that the terms of the Public Warrants may be amended without the consent of any holder to cure any ambiguity or correct any defective provision,\nbut requires the approval by the holders of at least 65% of the then outstanding Public Warrants to make any change that adversely affects the interests of the registered holders\nof Public Warrants. Accordingly, we may amend the terms of the Public Warrants in a manner adverse to a holder if holders of at least 65% of the then outstanding Public\nWarrants approve of such amendment. Although our ability to amend the terms of the Public Warrants with the consent of at least 65% of the then outstanding Public Warrants\nis unlimited, examples of such amendments could be amendments to, among other things, increase the exercise price of the Public Warrants, shorten the exercise period or\ndecrease the number of shares of Class A common stock purchasable upon exercise of a Public Warrant.\nWe may redeem the Public Warrants prior to their exercise at a time that is disadvantageous to the holders of Public Warrants.\nWe have the ability to redeem outstanding Public Warrants at any time after they become exercisable and prior to their expiration, at a price of $0.01 per Public\nWarrant if, among other things, the last reported sale price of our Class A common stock for any 20 trading days within a 30-trading day period ending on the third trading day\nprior to the date on which we send the notice of redemption to the holders of the Public Warrants equals or exceeds $18.00 per share (as adjusted for share splits, share\ndividends, rights issuances, subdivisions, reorganizations, recapitalizations, and the like). If and when the Public Warrants become redeemable by us, we may exercise our\nredemption right even if we are unable to register or qualify the underlying securities for sale under all applicable state securities laws. As a result, we may redeem the Public\nWarrants as set forth above even if the holders are otherwise unable to exercise the Public Warrants. Redemption of the outstanding Public Warrants as described above could\nforce the holders of Public Warrants to: (i) exercise the Public Warrants and pay the exercise price therefor at a time when it may be disadvantageous for them to do so; (ii) sell\nthe Public Warrants at the then-current market price when they might otherwise wish to hold their warrants; or (iii) accept the nominal redemption price which, at the time the\noutstanding Public Warrants are called for redemption, we expect would be substantially less than the market value of the Public Warrants. None of the Private Warrants will be\nredeemable by us (subject to limited exceptions) so long as they are held by our Sponsor or its permitted transferees.\nIn addition, we have the ability to redeem the outstanding Public Warrants at any time after they become exercisable and prior to their expiration, at a price of $0.10\nper Public Warrant if, among other things, the last reported sale price of our Class A common stock for any 20 trading days within a 30-trading day period ending on the third\ntrading day prior to the date on which we send the notice of redemption to the holders of the Public Warrants equals or exceeds $10.00 per share (as adjusted for share splits,\nshare dividends, rights issuances, subdivisions, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like). In such a case, the holders will be able to exercise their Public Warrants prior to\nredemption for a number of shares of Class A common stock determined based on the redemption date and the fair market value of our Class A common stock. The value\nreceived upon exercise of the Public Warrants (i) may be less than the value the holders would have received if they had exercised their Public Warrants at a later time where\nthe underlying share price is higher and (ii) may not compensate the holders for the value of the Public Warrants, including because the number of shares of our Class A\ncommon stock received is capped at 0.361 shares of Class A common stock per Public Warrant (subject to adjustment) irrespective of the remaining life of the Public Warrants.\nFurthermore, the shares of Class A common stock issued upon exercise of the Public Warrants or Private Warrants (or upon the redemption of such Public Warrants for\nshares of our Class A common stock) will result in dilution to the existing holders of our common stock.\n48\nDelaware law and our organizational documents contain certain provisions, including anti-takeover provisions, that limit the ability of stockholders to take certain actions\nand could delay or discourage takeover attempts that stockholders may consider favorable.\nOur organizational documents, and the Delaware General Corporation Law (\"DGCL\"), contain provisions that could have the effect of rendering more difficult,\ndelaying or preventing an acquisition that stockholders may consider favorable, including transactions in which stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their\nshares. These provisions could also limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our Class A common stock, and therefore depress the trading\nprice of our Class A common stock. These provisions could also make it difficult for stockholders to take certain actions, including electing directors who are not nominated by\nthe current members of the Board of Directors or taking other corporate actions, including effecting changes in our management. Among other things, the organizational\ndocuments include provisions regarding:\n• the ability of the Board of Directors to issue shares of preferred stock, including “blank check” preferred stock and to determine the price and other terms of those shares,\nincluding preferences and voting rights, without stockholder approval, which could be used to significantly dilute the ownership of a hostile acquirer;\n• the Certificate of Incorporation will prohibit cumulative voting in the election of directors, which limits the ability of minority stockholders to elect director candidates;\n• the limitation of the liability of, and the indemnification of, our directors and officers;\n• the ability of the Board of Directors to amend the Bylaws, which may allow the Board of Directors to take additional actions to prevent an unsolicited takeover and\ninhibit the ability of an acquirer to amend the Bylaws to facilitate an unsolicited takeover attempt; and\n• advance notice procedures with which stockholders must comply to nominate candidates to the Board of Directors or to propose matters to be acted upon at a\nstockholders’ meeting, which could preclude stockholders from bringing matters before annual or special meetings of stockholders and delay changes in the Board of\nDirectors and also may discourage or deter a potential acquirer from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect the acquirer’s own slate of directors or otherwise\nattempting to obtain control of our company.\nThese provisions, alone or together, could delay or prevent hostile takeovers and changes in control or changes in the Board of Directors or management.\nThe provisions of our Certificate of Incorporation requiring exclusive forum in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware for certain types of lawsuits may have the\neffect of discouraging lawsuits against our directors and officers.\nOur Certificate of Incorporation provides that, to the fullest extent permitted by law, and unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court\nof Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, in the event the Chancery Court does not have jurisdiction, the federal district court for the District of Delaware or other state courts of\nthe State of Delaware) will be the sole and exclusive forum for: (i) any derivative action, suit, or proceeding brought on our behalf; (ii) any action, suit, or proceeding asserting a\nclaim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers, or stockholders to us or our stockholders; (iii) any action, suit, or proceeding arising pursuant to any\nprovision of the DGCL or our Bylaws or our Certificate of Incorporation (as either may be amended from time to time); (iv) any action, suit, or proceeding as to which the\nDGCL confers jurisdiction on the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware; or (v) any action, suit, or proceeding asserting a claim against us or any of our current or former\ndirectors, officers, or stockholders governed by the internal affairs doctrine. Notwithstanding the foregoing, our Certificate of Incorporation provides that the exclusive forum\nprovision will not apply to suits brought to enforce a duty or liability created by the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, or any other claim for which the federal courts have\nexclusive jurisdiction. Section 22 of the Securities Act creates concurrent jurisdiction for federal and state courts over all suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by\nthe Securities Act or the rules and regulations thereunder. Similarly, Section 27 of the Exchange Act creates exclusive federal jurisdiction over all suits brought to enforce any\nduty or liability created by the Exchange Act or the rules and regulations thereunder. The organizational documents also provide that, unless we consent in writing to the\nselection of an alternative forum, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the U.S. federal district courts shall be the exclusive forum for the resolution of any complaint asserting a\ncause of action arising under the Securities Act.\nThese provisions may have the effect of discouraging lawsuits against our directors and officers. The enforceability of similar choice of forum provisions in other\ncompanies’ certificates of incorporation has been challenged in legal\n49\nproceedings, and it is possible that, in connection with any applicable action brought against us, a court could find the choice of forum provisions contained in our Certificate of\nIncorporation to be inapplicable or unenforceable in such action.\nITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS\nNone.\nITEM 1C. CYBERSECURITY\nWe and our third-party vendors employ information technology, including networks, systems, and applications, to support our business processes and decision-making\nin our business. Our information technology infrastructure supports the flow of information throughout our business processes and is susceptible to cybersecurity threats.\nAccordingly, we have implemented and maintain various information security processes designed to identify, assess, and manage material risks from cybersecurity threats to\nour critical computer networks, third party hosted services, communications systems, hardware and software, and our critical data, including intellectual property, confidential\ninformation that is proprietary, strategic or competitive in nature, and data related to our customers and employees (“Information Systems and Data”).\nWe have a cybersecurity leadership team comprised of our Chief Information Security Officer, our Head of Infrastructure, and other senior leaders on our Information\nTechnology group (“Cybersecurity Leadership Team”). Our Cybersecurity Leadership Team works with third-party service providers to help identify, assess, and manage our\ncybersecurity threats and risks, including through the use of our cybersecurity risk assessment program. Our Cybersecurity Leadership Team identifies and assesses risks from\ncybersecurity threats by monitoring and evaluating our threat environment and our risk profile using various methods, including automated and manual tools, third-party threat\nfeeds, internal audits, access control assessments, and evaluating threats reported to us by various third-party enterprise threat reporting services.\nDepending on the environment, we implement and maintain various technical, physical, and organizational measures, processes, standards, and policies designed to\nmanage and mitigate material risks from cybersecurity threats to our Information Systems and Data.\nOur assessment and management of material risks from cybersecurity threats are integrated into our overall risk management processes. For example, cybersecurity\nrisks are considered a part of our overall business strategy, financial planning, and capital allocation.\nWe use third-party service providers to assist us from time to time in identifying, assessing, and managing material risks from cybersecurity threats. Our Cybersecurity\nLeadership Team inventories and prioritizes information security risks and evaluates material risks from cybersecurity threats, and reports those periodically to the Audit\nCommittee of our Board of Directors, which evaluates our overall enterprise risk.\nTo date, the Company has not experienced a cybersecurity threat or incident that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect the Company. The\nCompany, however, has experienced and expects to continue to experience cyber incidents of varying degrees. Cybersecurity threats may, among other things, cause material\ndisruptions to our operations, which may materially affect our results of operations and/or financial condition. For more information about risks from cybersecurity threats that\nmay materially affect us and how they may do so, see \"Risk Factors — Despite our security measures, we have been subject to attacks by hackers, and our information\ntechnology and infrastructure may in the future be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error, malfeasance, or other disruptions.\" as well as the other\nrisk factors contained in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOur Board of Directors has ultimate oversight responsibility over cybersecurity-related matters and has assigned oversight of cybersecurity risk management to the\nAudit Committee. The Audit Committee assists the Board in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities with respect to the management of risks arising from cybersecurity threats\nand, in furtherance thereof, regularly receives reports from our senior management and Cybersecurity Leadership Team on cybersecurity matters. These reports are intended to\nhighlight the state of our cybersecurity and data security programs, as well as our progress on key initiatives in this area. In addition, the Board receives reports addressing\ncybersecurity as part of our overall enterprise risk management program and to the extent cybersecurity matters are addressed in regular business updates. As appropriate, the\nBoard also may receive information regarding specific cybersecurity incidents and resulting mitigation efforts.\n50\nITEM 2. PROPERTIES\nOur principal business operations are located in offices owned by us in Las Vegas, Nevada. We lease facilities in eight locations throughout the world, including San\nFrancisco, California; Santa Monica, California; Portland, Oregon; Tel-Aviv, Israel; Hong Kong; Belgrade, Serbia; Hanoi, Vietnam; and Singapore for our game development\nand operation functions. We believe our existing facilities are sufficient for our current needs. We may add new facilities and expand our existing facilities as we add employees\nand expand into new locations. We believe suitable additional space will be available as needed to accommodate our needs.\nITEM 3.

MARKET FOR REGISTRANT'S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY\nSECURITIES\nCommon Stock Information\nOur Class A common stock is traded on the Nasdaq Global Market under the ticker symbol MYPS. There is no public market for our Class B common stock.\nHolders of our Common Stock\nAs of February 29, 2024, there were 131 holders of record of our Class A common stock, five holders of record of our Class B common stock and five holders of\nrecord of our Warrants. The number of record holders does not include Depository Trust Company participants or beneficial owners holding shares through nominee names.\nDividend Policy\nWe do not anticipate paying cash dividends on our shares of Class A common stock or Class B common stock for the foreseeable future.\nStock Performance Graph\nThe following graph compares the cumulative total stockholder return on our Class A common stock with the cumulative total return on the Standard & Poor’s\n(“S&P”) 500 Index and the Nasdaq Composite Index. The graph assumes an initial investment of $100 in our common stock at the market close on December 21, 2020, which\nwas the initial trading day of the Class A ordinary shares of Acies (our predecessor) on a stand-alone basis. The Acies Merger was announced on February 2, 2021 and closed on\nJune 21, 2021. Data for the S&P 500 Index and the Nasdaq Composite Index assume reinvestment of dividends. Total return equals stock price appreciation plus reinvestment\nof dividends.\n52\nThe performance graph should not be deemed filed or incorporated by reference into any other Company filing under the Securities Act of 1933 or the Exchange Act\nof 1934, except to the extent the Company specifically incorporates the performance graph by reference therein.\nRecent Sales of Unregistered Securities\nNone\nUse of Proceeds\nNone\n53\nIssuer Purchases of Equity Securities\nThe following table provides information about share repurchases made by us of our Class A common stock during the quarter ended December 31, 2023:\nDollar Value of Shares\nthat May Yet be\nTotal Number of Shares Purchased Under the\nTotal Number of Shares Average Price Paid per Purchased as Part of a Publicly Program3\nPeriod Purchased1 Share2 Announced Program (In thousands)\nOctober 1, 2023 - October 31, 2023 406 $ 3.12 — $ 30,000\nNovember 1, 2023 - November 30, 2023 65,295 2.48 — 50,000\nDecember 1, 2023 - December 31, 2023 — — — 50,000\n1. These amounts consist entirely of shares surrendered to satisfy tax withholding obligations upon the vesting of equity awards under our 2021 Equity Incentive Plan (as\namended, the “Plan”). Under the Plan and applicable award agreements, the Company has the discretionary right to collect payment of mandatory tax withholding\nobligations by deducting from the shares otherwise deliverable to a participant upon vesting and settlement of an award under the Plan a number of shares having a fair\nmarket value equal or less than such participant’s tax withholding obligations. All shares so deducted from shares that otherwise would be deliverable to participants\nunder the Plan are considered repurchased pursuant to the terms of the Plan and applicable award agreements and not pursuant to any publicly announced share\nrepurchase program.\n2. Average price paid per share includes costs associated with the repurchases.\n3. The repurchases are being executed from time to time, subject to general business and market conditions, through open market purchases or privately negotiated\ntransactions, including through Rule 10b5-1 trading plans, pursuant to a stock repurchase program. On November 10, 2021, the Company’s Board of Directors approved\na stock repurchase program authorizing the Company to repurchase, within a 12 month period, up to $50.0 million of the Company’s Class A common stock at such\ntimes and in such amounts as the Company’s Board of Directors deems appropriate, based on factors such as market conditions, legal requirements, and other business\nconsiderations. The Company publicly announced the approval of such stock repurchase program on November 12, 2021. On November 2, 2022, the Company’s Board\nof Directors approved an extension of the time period for repurchases under the stock repurchase program for an additional 12 months from November 10, 2022 to\nNovember 10, 2023. On November 1, 2023, the Company's Board of Directors extended the stock repurchase program through November 10, 2024 and increased the\nremaining amount authorized to $50.0 million. The Company publicly announced such extension and increase on November 2, 2023. See Note 19—Stockholders’\nEquity of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information relating to share repurchases.\nITEM 6.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis provides information which our management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of our consolidated results of\noperations and financial condition. The discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto contained in\nthis Annual Report on Form 10-K. Unless the context otherwise requires, references to “we”, “us”, “our”, and “the Company” are intended to mean the business and\noperations of PLAYSTUDIOS, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries.\nThis discussion contains forward-looking statements and involves numerous risks and uncertainties. Our actual results and the timing of certain events may differ\nsignificantly from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause such a discrepancy include, but are not limited to, those discussed\nelsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, particularly in the section titled “Risk Factors” set forth in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. All forward-\nlooking statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are based on information available to us as of the date hereof, and we assume no obligation to update any such\nforward-looking statements to reflect future events or circumstances, except as required by law.\nOverview\nWe are a developer and publisher of free-to-play casual games for mobile and social platforms. Over our twelve-year history, we developed a portfolio of free-to-play social\ncasino games that are considered to be among the most innovative and unique in the genre. In 2021 we added our Tetris®-branded mobile game and in late 2022 we acquired\nBrainium, a developer and publisher of free-to-play casual games. Our games include the award-winning POP! Slots, myVEGAS Slots, my KONAMI Slots, MGM Slots Live,\nmyVEGAS Blackjack, myVEGAS Bingo, Tetris®, Solitaire, Spider Solitaire, Jumbline 2, Sudoku, and Mahjong. Our games are based on original content as well as third-party\nlicensed brands and are downloadable and playable for free on multiple social and mobile-based platforms, including the Apple App Store, Google Play Store, Amazon\nAppstore, and Facebook.\nEach of our legacy social casino games and our Tetris®-branded mobile game is powered by our proprietaryp layAWARDS program and incorporates loyalty points that are\nearned by players as they engage with our games. The rewards are provided by our collection of rewards partners, with the majority of rewards partners providing their rewards\nat no cost to us, in exchange for product integration, marketing support, and participation in our loyalty program. The program is enabled by our playAWARDS platform which\nconsists of a robust suite of tools that enable our rewards partners to manage their rewards in real time, measure the value of our players’ engagement, and gain insight into the\neffectiveness and value they derive from the program. Through our self-service platform, rewards partners can launch new rewards, make changes to existing rewards, and in\nreal time see how players are engaging with their brands. The platform tools also provide rewards partners the ability to measure the off-line value our players generate as\nconsumers and patrons of their real-world establishments.\nPLAYSTUDIOS' playAWARDS platform embodies all of the features, tools, and capabilities needed to deliver loyalty programs tailored for the games industry. Our\nconsumer-facing brand for our loyalty program is myVIP. The myVIP program is an aspirational benefits framework, with in-game mechanics and rewards features, along with\na player development and hosting program. The program dynamically ranks and assigns players to tiers based on their accumulation of tier points, which are a proxy for their\noverall engagement with our games. The tier points are separate from and are not interchangeable with the loyalty points earned in the playAWARDS program. Qualified\nplayers are provided access to enhanced benefits that increase with each tier. Higher tiers provide access to a myVIP player portal where players can view and purchase special\nchip bundles, redeem loyalty points for a curated set of rewards, and communicate directly with a dedicated personal host. The VIP player portal, concierge, and host programs,\nenhance the in-game and real-world reward experience with both in-game and in-person, invitation-only special events. We believe that the myVIP program drives increased\nplayer engagement and retention, and therefore extends each game's life-cycle and revenue potential.\nWe have primarily generated our revenue from the sale of in-game virtual currency, which players can choose to purchase at any time to enhance their playing experience.\nOnce purchased, our virtual currency cannot be withdrawn from the game, transferred from one game to another or from one player to another, or be redeemed for monetary\nvalue. Players who install our games receive free virtual currency upon the initial launch of the game, and they may also collect virtual currency free of charge at periodic\nintervals or through targeted marketing promotions. Players may exhaust the free virtual currency and may choose to purchase additional virtual currency. Additionally, players\ncan send free “gifts” of virtual currency to their friends on Facebook. Our revenue from virtual currency has been generated world-wide, but is largely concentrated in North\nAmerica.\n55\nWe also generate revenue from in-game advertising. Advertisements can be in the form of an impression, click-throughs, banner ads, or offers, where players are rewarded\nwith virtual currency or loyalty points for watching a short video. While we historically have derived most of our revenue from the sale of in-game virtual currency, we\nintroduced in-game advertising as a limited pilot program and expanded it throughout 2021 and 2022. In addition, our Tetris®-branded mobile game and our Brainium games\ngenerate most of their revenue through in-game advertising.\nKey Factors Affecting Our Performance\nThere are a number of factors that affect the performance of our business, and the comparability of our results from period to period, including:\n• Third-Party Platform Agreements—Historically we derived substantially all of our revenue from in-game purchases of virtual currency that are processed by platform\nproviders such as the Apple App Store, Google Store, Amazon Appstore, and on Facebook. The platform providers charge us a transaction fee to process payments from our\nplayers for their purchase of in-game virtual currency. These platform fees are generally set at 30% of the in-game purchase. Each platform provider has broad discretion to\nset its platform fees and to change and interpret its terms of service and other policies with respect to us and other developers in its sole discretion, and those changes may be\nunfavorable to us.\n• Player Acquisition—Establishing and maintaining a loyal network of players and paying players is vital for our success. As such, we spend a significant amount on\nadvertising and other forms of player acquisition, such as traditional marketing and advertising, email and push notifications, and cross promoting between our games in\norder to grow our player base. These expenditures are generally related to new content launches, game enhancements, and ongoing programs to drive new player acquisition\nand the reactivation of lapsed player engagement. Our player acquisition strategy is centered on a payback period methodology, and we strive to optimize spend between the\nacquisition of new players and the reactivation of inactive players.\n• Player Monetization—Our revenue to date has been primarily driven through the sale of virtual currency. Paying players purchase virtual currency in our games because of\nthe perceived value, which is dependent on the relative ease of obtaining equivalent virtual currency by simply playing our game. The perceived value of our virtual currency\ncan be impacted by various actions that we take in our games including offering discounts for virtual currency or giving away virtual currency in promotions. Managing game\neconomies is difficult and relies on our assumptions and judgment. If we fail to manage our virtual economies properly or fail to promptly and successfully respond to any\nsuch disruption, our reputation may suffer and our players may be less likely to play our games and to purchase virtual currency from us in the future, which would cause\nour business, financial condition, and results of operations to suffer.\n• Investment in Game Development—In order to maintain interest from existing players and add new players and achieve our desired revenue growth, we must continually\nimprove the content, offers, and features in our existing games and the release of new games. As a result, we invest a significant amount of our technological and creative\nresources to ensure that we support an appropriate cadence of innovative content that our players will find appealing. These expenditures generally occur in advance of the\nrelease of new content or the launch of a new game, and the resulting revenue may not exceed the development costs, or the game or feature may be abandoned in its entirety.\n• Investment in our playAWARDS and myVIP programs—In order to drive player engagement and retention we invest a significant amount of resources to enhance the\nplayAWARDS and myVIP programs. We continually evaluate these programs through an iterative feedback process with our players and rewards partners and update them\nso that both our players and rewards partners are able to optimize their personalized experience. As a result, we continuously incur expenses to enhance and update these\nprograms. However, the results may not generate revenue and the enhancements may require additional significant modifications or be abandoned in their entirety.\n• Real-World Rewards—We currently offer real-world rewards relating to, among other things, dining, live entertainment shows, and hotel rooms, and we plan to continue to\nexpand and diversify our rewards loyalty program in order to maintain and enhance the perceived value offering to our players. Our players’ willingness to make in-game\npurchases is directly impacted by our ability to provide desirable rewards. The real-world rewards we offer to our players are provided at no cost to us by our rewards\npartners, and there is no obligation for us to pay or otherwise compensate either our rewards partners or players for any player redemptions under our rewards partner\nagreements.\nKey Performance Indicators\nWe manage our business by regularly reviewing several key operating metrics to track historical performance, identify trends in player activity, and set strategic goals for\nthe future. Our key performance metrics are impacted by several factors\n56\nthat could cause them to fluctuate on a quarterly basis, such as platform providers’ policies, seasonality, player connectivity, and the addition of new content to games. We\nbelieve these measures are useful to investors for the same reasons. In addition, we also present certain non-GAAP performance measures. These performance measures are\npresented as supplemental disclosure and should not be considered superior to or as a substitute for the consolidated financial statements prepared under U.S. GAAP. The non-\nGAAP measures presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K should be read together with the consolidated financial statements and the respective related notes thereto\nincluded elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The key performance indicators and non-GAAP measures presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K may differ\nfrom similarly titled measures presented by other companies and are not a substitute for financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nKey Performance Indicators - playGAMES\nDaily Active Users (“DAU”)\nDAU is defined as the number of individuals who played a game on a particular day. For Tetris and our free-to-play social casino games, we track DAU by the player ID,\nwhich is assigned for each game installed by an individual. As such, an individual who plays two of these games on the same day is counted as two DAU while an individual\nwho plays the same game on two different devices is counted as one DAU. For our Brainium suite of casual games, we track DAU by app instance ID, which is assigned to each\ninstallation of a game on a particular device. As such, an individual who plays two different Brainium games on the same day is counted as two DAU and an individual who\nplays the same Brainium game on two different devices is also counted as two DAU. The term \"Average DAU\" is defined as the average of the DAU, determined as described\nabove, for each day during the period presented. We use DAU and Average DAU as measures of audience engagement to help us understand the size of the active player base\nengaged with our games on a daily basis.\nMonthly Active Users (“MAU”)\nMAU is defined as the number of individuals who played a game in a particular month. As with DAU, an individual who plays two different non-Brainium games in the\nsame month is counted as two MAU while an individual who plays the same non-Brainium game on two different devices is counted as one MAU, and an individual who plays\ntwo different Brainium games on the same day is counted as two MAU while an individual who plays the same Brainium game on two different devices is also counted as two\nMAU. The term \"Average MAU\" is defined as the average of the MAU, determined as described above, for each calendar month during the period presented. We use MAU and\nAverage MAU as measures of audience engagement to help us understand the size of the active player base engaged with our games on a monthly basis.\nDaily Paying Users (“DPU”)\nDPU is defined as the number of individuals who made a purchase in a game during a particular day. As with DAU and MAU, we track DPU based on account activity. As\nsuch, an individual who makes a purchase in two different games in a particular day is counted as two DPU while an individual who makes purchases in the same game on two\ndifferent devices is counted as one DPU. The term \"Average DPU\" is defined as the average of the DPU, determined as described above, for each day during the period\npresented. We use DPU and Average DPU to help us understand the size of our active player base that makes in-game purchases. This focus directs our strategic goals in setting\nplayer acquisition and pricing strategy.\nDaily Payer Conversion\nDaily Payer Conversion is defined as DPU as a percentage of DAU on a particular day. Daily Payer Conversion is also sometimes referred to as \"Percentage of Paying\nUsers\" or \"PPU\". The term \"Average Daily Payer Conversion\" is defined as the Average DPU divided by Average DAU for a given period. We use Daily Payer Conversion and\nAverage Daily Payer Conversion to help us understand the monetization of our active players.\nAverage Daily Revenue Per DAU (“ARPDAU”)\nARPDAU is defined for a given period as the average daily revenue per Average DAU, and is calculated as game and advertising revenue for the period, divided by the\nnumber of days in the period, divided by the Average DAU during the period. We use ARPDAU as a measure of overall monetization of our active players.\n57\nKey Performance Indicators - playAWARDS\nAvailable Rewards\nAvailable Rewards is defined as the monthly average number of unique rewards available in our applications’ rewards stores. A reward appearing in more than one\napplication’s reward store is counted only once. A reward is counted only once irrespective of the inventory available through that reward. For example, one reward for a free\nnight in a hotel room with ten rooms available for such free night is counted as one reward. Available Rewards only include real-world partner rewards and exclude\nPLAYSTUDIOS digital rewards. We use Available Rewards as a measure of the value and potential impact of the program for an interested player. It is assumed that the\ngreater the variety and breadth of rewards offered, the more likely players will be to ascribe value to the program.\nPurchases\nPurchases is defined as the total number of rewards purchased for the period identified in which a player exchanges loyalty points for a reward. Purchases are not\nadjusted for refunds. Purchases only include purchases of real-world partner rewards and exclude any PLAYSTUDIOS digital rewards. The Company does not receive any\ncompensation or revenue from Purchases. We use Purchases as a measure of audience interest and engagement with our playAWARDS platform.\nRetail Value of Purchases\nRetail Value of Purchases is defined as the cumulative retail value of all rewards listed as Purchases for the period identified. The retail value of each reward listed as\nPurchases is the retail value as determined by the partner upon creation of the reward. In the case where the retail value of a reward adjusts depending on time of redemption, the\naverage retail value is used. Retail Value of Purchases only include the retail value of real-world partner rewards and exclude the cost of any PLAYSTUDIOS branded\nmerchandise. We use Retail Value of Purchases to help us understand the real-world value of the rewards that are purchased by our players.\nResults of Operations\nComparison of the year ended December 31, 2023 versus the year ended December 31, 2022\nThe following table summarizes our consolidated results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 (in thousands, except percentages):\nYears Ended December 31,\n2023 2022 $ Change % Change\nNet revenue $ 310,886 $ 290,309 $ 20,577 7.1 %\nOperating expenses 321,373 318,390 2,983 0.9 %\nOperating loss $ (10,487) $ (28,081) $ 17,594 (62.7)%\nNet loss $ (19,393) $ (17,783) $ (1,610) 9.1 %\nNet loss margin (6.2)% (6.1)% (0.1)pp 1.6 %\npp = percentage points\nNet Revenue by Segment\nYear Ended December 31,\n2023 2022 Change % Change\nNet revenue\nplayGAMES $ 306,714 $ 284,476 $ 22,238 7.8 %\nplayAWARDS 4,172 5,833 (1,661) (28.5)%\nNet revenue $ 310,886 $ 290,309 $ 20,577 7.1 %\n58\nRevenue information by geography is summarized as follows (in thousands, except percentages):\nYears Ended December 31,\n2023 2022 Change % Change\nUnited States $ 265,660 $ 253,556 $ 12,104 4.8 %\nAll other countries 45,226 36,753 8,473 23.1 %\nNet revenue $ 310,886 $ 290,309 $ 20,577 7.1 %\nplayGAMES\nplayGAMES revenue was $306.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to $284.5 million for year ended December 31, 2022.\nThe following table shows net revenues and key performance indicators for our playGAMES division (in thousands, except percentages and ARPDAU):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2023 2022 Change % Change\nVirtual\ncurrency $ 247,929 $ 261,620 $ (13,691) (5.2) %\nAdvertising 58,236 21,839 36,397 166.7 %\nOther\nrevenue 549 1,017 (468) (46.0) %\nNet revenue $ 306,714 $ 284,476 $ 22,238 7.8 %\nAverage\nDAU 3,524 1,917 1,607 83.8 %\nAverage\nMAU 13,489 7,932 5,557 70.1 %\nAverage\nDPU 27 29 (2) (6.9) %\nAverage\nDaily Payer\nConversion 0.8 % 1.5 % (0.7) pp (46.7) %\nARPDAU (in\ndollars) $ 0.24 $ 0.41 $ (0.17) (41.5) %\npp =\npercentage points\nNet revenue increased $22.2 million, or 7.8%, to $306.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to $284.5 million during the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022. The increase was primarily due to full year realization of the Brainium portfolio of games, which was acquired in October 2022 as well as an increase in\nadvertising revenue from the Tetris game. The increase was offset by a $13.7 million decrease in virtual currency primarily driven by decreases in DPU and ARPDAU despite\noverall increases in DAU and MAU. DAU and MAU increased 83.8% and 70.1%, respectively, compared to year ended December 31, 2022, driven by the addition of the\nBrainium portfolio of games. Our daily conversion rate and ARPDAU both decreased compared to year ended December 31, 2022 due to addition of high-volume, low-\nmonetizing Brainium portfolio of games and the Tetris application diluting both metrics.\nplayAWARDS\nThe following table shows net revenues and key performance indicators for our playAWARDS division (in thousands):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2023 2022 Change % Change\nNet revenue $ 4,172 $ 5,833 $ (1,661) (28.5) %\nAvailable Rewards (in units) 578 556 22 4.0 %\nPurchases (in units) 1,760 2,224 (464) (20.9) %\nRetail Value of Purchases $ 105,847 $ 127,803 $ (21,956) (17.2) %\nNet revenue decreased by $1.7 million, or 28.5%, due to the non-renewal of a licensing arrangement with a customer. The key performance indicators presented above\nare used by management to assess the playAWARDS segment's operating performance, however are not indicative revenue metrics.\n59\nOperating Expenses\nThe following table summarizes our consolidated operating expenses for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 (in thousands, except percentages):\nYears Ended December 31, % of Net Revenue\n2023 2022 $ Change % Change 2023 2022\nOperating expenses:\nCost of revenue $ 77,800 $ 85,400 $ (7,600) (8.9)% 25.0 % 29.4 %\nSelling and marketing 74,360 80,819 (6,459) (8.0)% 23.9 % 27.8 %\nResearch and development 70,298 63,315 6,983 11.0 % 22.6 % 21.8 %\nGeneral and administrative 45,072 40,274 4,798 11.9 % 14.5 % 13.9 %\nDepreciation and amortization 45,259 35,562 9,697 27.3 % 14.6 % 12.2 %\nRestructuring expenses 8,584 13,020 (4,436) (34.1)% 2.8 % 4.5 %\nTotal operating expenses $ 321,373 $ 318,390 $ 2,983 0.9 % 103.4 % 109.7 %\nCost of Revenue\nCost of revenue decreased by $7.6 million, or 8.9%, during the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the year ended December 31, 2022. The decrease was due to a\ndecline in virtual currency revenue. As a percentage of net revenue, cost of revenue decreased from 29.4% for the year ended December 31, 2022 to 25.0% for the year\nended December 31, 2023. The decrease was due to an increase in advertising revenue which does not incur platform fees, and a reduction in royalty expenses associated with\nour revenue.\nSelling and Marketing\nSelling and marketing expenses decreased by $6.5 million, or 8.0%, during the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the year ended December 31, 2022. The\ndecrease was primarily due to a $8.4 million reduction of user acquisition costs. This increase was partially offset by a $1.1 million increase of payroll expenses and $0.8\nmillion increase of other selling and marketing expenses. As a percentage of net revenue, selling and marketing expenses decreased from 27.8% for the year\nended December 31, 2022 to 23.9% for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development expenses increased by $7.0 million, or 11.0%, during the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the year ended December 31, 2022. The\nincrease was primarily due to an increase in additional payroll expenses of $3.8 million, an increase of IT expenses of $2.0 million, an increase in facilities costs of $1.0 million,\nand an increase in other research and development expenses of $0.2 million. As a percentage of net revenue, research and development expenses increased from 21.8% for the\nyear ended December 31, 2022 to 22.6% for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased by $4.8 million, or 11.9%, during the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the year ended December 31, 2022. The\nincrease was primarily due to $4.6 million of additional payroll expenses and $0.2 million of other general and administrative costs. As a percentage of net revenue, general and\nadministrative expenses increased from 13.9% for the year ended December 31, 2022, to 14.5% for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation and amortization expenses increased by $9.7 million, or 27.3%, during the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the year ended December 31, 2022.\nThe increase was primarily due to the acquisitions of Brainium and WonderBlocks, increased amortization as a result of additional licenses, and additional depreciation of\nproperty and equipment. As a percentage of net revenue, depreciation and amortization expenses increased from 12.2% for the year\n60\nended December 31, 2022 to 14.6% for the year ended December 31, 2023. See Note 10—Intangible Assets and Internal-Use Software, Net.\nRestructuring Expenses\nRestructuring expenses decreased by $4.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the year ended December 31, 2022. The decrease was primarily\ndue to $6.3 million less of non-cash impairment charges and a decrease of $1.6 million related to fees for various merger and acquisition opportunities. This decrease was offset\nby an increase of $2.6 million related to management restructurings and severance and an increase of $0.7 million related to other restructuring expenses. As a percentage of net\nrevenue, restructuring expenses decreased from 4.5% for the year ended December 31, 2022 to 2.8% for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nOther Income, Net\nThe following table summarizes our consolidated other income, net for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 (in thousands, except percentages):\nYears Ended December 31,\n2023 2022 $ Change % Change\nChange in fair value of warrant liabilities $ 2,596 $ 1,047 $ 1,549 147.9 %\nInterest income, net 4,858 1,925 2,933 152.4 %\nOther income, net 513 1,491 (978) (65.6)%\nTotal other income, net $ 7,967 $ 4,463 $ 3,504 78.5 %\nThe change in fair value of warrant liabilities is related to the warrants discussed in Note 12—Warrant Liabilities to our consolidated financial statements herein.\nInterest income, net is related to interest earned on cash and cash equivalents offset by fees and expenses associated with the Credit Agreement as discussed in Note 15—Long-\nTerm Debt to our consolidated financial statements herein. Other income, net primarily relates to gains or (losses) from equity investments.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nIncome tax expense was approximately $16.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared to an income tax benefit of $5.8 million for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022. The income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2023 reflected an effective income tax rate of negative 669.7%, which was less than the statutory\ntax rate of 21% primarily due to the recording of a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets, the effect of additional foreign taxes paid related to a settlement with the Israel\nTax Authority, impacts from foreign branch income, and other nondeductible expenses. The decrease in our effective tax rate was partially offset by benefits from the exercise\nof non-qualified stock options, changes to the fair value adjustment of the warrant liability, and the deduction of foreign taxes paid. The income tax benefit reflected an effective\nincome tax rate of 24.6% for the year ended December 31, 2022, which was greater than the statutory federal rate of 21.0% primarily due to benefits from the exercise of non-\nqualified stock options, state taxes, and research and development credits. The increase in our effective tax rate was partially offset by the reduction of our foreign tax credit\ncarryforward and conversion to foreign tax deductions, as well as a valuation allowance on a portion of our California research credits.\nComparison of the year ended December 31, 2022 versus the year ended December 31, 2021\nSee Part II, Item 7.

The decrease was primarily driven by $18.5 million decrease in virtual currency primarily driven by decreases in DPU and ARPDAU despite overall increases in\nDAU and MAU. DAU and MAU increased 54.1% and 92.9%, respectively, compared to year ended December 31, 2021, driven by the addition of the Brainium portfolio of\ngames. This decrease was offset by the acquisition of the Brainium portfolio of games, which was acquired in October 2022 as well as an increase in advertising revenue from\nthe Tetris game. Our daily conversion rate and ARPDAU both decreased compared to year ended December 31, 2021 due to addition of high-volume, low-monetizing Brainium\nportfolio of games and the Tetris application diluting both metrics.\nplayAWARDS\nThe following table shows net revenues and key performance indicators for our playAWARDS division:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2022 2021 Change % Change\nNet revenue $ 5,833 $ — $ 5,833 100.0 %\nAvailable Rewards (in units) 556 477 79 16.6 %\nPurchases (in units) 2,224 1,970 254 12.9 %\nRetail Value of Purchases (in dollars) 127,803 114,426 13,377 11.7 %\nNet revenue increased by $5.8 million due to a licensing arrangement with a customer.

AEBITDA is our reportable segment GAAP measure,\nwhich we utilize as the primary profit measure for our reportable segments. See Note 3—Segment Reporting in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for\nadditional information. Consolidated AEBITDA is a non-GAAP measure, discussed within “Non-GAAP Measures” below.\n62\nComparison of the year ended December 31, 2023 versus the year ended December 31, 2022\nYear Ended December 31,\n2023 2022 Change % Change\nAEBITDA\nplayGAMES $ 88,676 $ 58,999 $ 29,677 50.3 %\nplayAWARDS (10,379) (5,189) (5,190) 100.0 %\nCorporate and other (16,005) (15,557) (448) 2.9 %\nConsolidated AEBITDA $ 62,292 $ 38,253 $ 24,039 62.8 %\nSegment AEBITDA Margin:\nplayGAMES 28.9 % 20.7 % 8.2 % 39.4 %\nplayAWARDS (248.8)% (89.0)% (159.8)% 179.7 %\nplayGAMES\nplayGAMES AEBITDA was $88.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to $59.0 million for year ended December 31, 2022, an increase of 50.3%.\nplayGAMES AEBITDA margin was 28.9% for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to 20.7% for year ended December 31, 2022. The current year benefited from the\nfull years' realization of Brainium's portfolio of games acquired in October 2022 and an increase in revenue from the Tetris game, both which do not incur significant platform\nfees driving a reduction in cost of sales, and a reduction in overall user acquisition expenses. These increases were offset by the increase in payroll and benefits from Brainium\nand other general and administrative expenses.\nplayAWARDS\nplayAWARDS AEBITDA was $(10.4) million for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to $(5.2) million for year ended December 31, 2022. The decrease in\nAEBITDA can be attributed to lower net revenue and an increase in employee costs associated with the myVIP program and the further advancement of the playAWARDS\nplatform.\nComparison of the year ended December 31, 2022 versus the year ended December 31, 2021\nYear Ended December 31,\n2022 2021 Change % Change\nAEBITDA\nplayGAMES $ 58,999 $ 57,865 $ 1,134 2.0 %\nplayAWARDS (5,189) (8,990) 3,801 (42.3)%\nCorporate and other (15,557) (9,329) (6,228) 66.8 %\nConsolidated AEBITDA $ 38,253 $ 39,546 $ (1,293) (3.3)%\nSegment AEBITDA Margin:\nplayGAMES 20.7 % 20.1 % 0.6 % 3.0 %\nplayAWARDS (89.0)% nm nm nm\nnm - not meaningful\nplayGAMES\nplayGAMES AEBITDA was $59.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to $57.9 million for year ended December 31, 2021. The increase in\nplayGAMES AEBITDA was driven by the increase in net revenues from the Tetris game as well as consolidation of the Brainium portfolio of games. These products generate\nnet revenues from advertising, which has lower cost of sales and higher margins. The increase was offset by a decline in net revenues from virtual currencies.\n63\nplayAWARDS\nplayAWARDS AEBITDA was $(5.2) million for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to $(9.0) million for December 31, 2021. The increase in AEBITDA\nwas primarily driven by a licensing arrangement with a customer that commenced in 2022.\nNon-GAAP Measures\nConsolidated AEBITDA and Consolidated AEBITDA Margin\nConsolidated AEBITDA, as used herein, is a non-GAAP financial performance measure that is presented as a supplemental disclosure and is reconciled to net income as\nthe most directly comparable GAAP measure. We define Consolidated AEBITDA as net income before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, restructuring and\nrelated costs (consisting primarily of severance and other restructuring related costs), stock-based compensation expense, changes in fair value of warrant liabilities, and other\nincome and expense items (including special infrequent items, foreign currency gains and losses, and other non-cash items). We also use Consolidated AEBITDA Margin,\nanother non-GAAP measure, which we calculate as Consolidated AEBITDA as a percentage of net revenue.\nWe use Consolidated AEBITDA and Consolidated AEBITDA Margin to monitor and evaluate the performance of our business operations, facilitate internal comparisons\nof our operating performance, and to analyze and evaluate decisions regarding future budgets and initiatives. We believe that both measures are useful because they provide\ninvestors with information regarding our operating performance that is used by our management in its reporting and planning processes. Consolidated AEBITDA and\nConsolidated AEBITDA Margin as calculated herein may not be comparable to similarly titled measures and disclosures reported by other companies.\nThe following table sets forth the reconciliation of Consolidated AEBITDA and Consolidated AEBITDA Margin to net income and net income margin, the most directly\ncomparable GAAP measure (in thousands, except percentages):\nYears Ended December 31,\n2023 2022 2021\nRevenue $ 310,886 $ 290,309 $ 287,419\nNet (loss) income $ (19,393) $ (17,783) $ 10,737\nNet (loss) income margin (6.2)% (6.1)% 3.7 %\nAdjustments:\nDepreciation & amortization 45,259 35,562 27,398\nIncome tax expense (benefit) 16,873 (5,835) (258)\nStock-based compensation expense 18,722 17,727 4,455\nChange in fair value of warrant liability (2,596) (1,047) (13,933)\nChange in fair value of contingent consideration (950) (2,411) —\nSpecial infrequent(1) — — 7,500\nRestructuring and related(2) 8,584 13,020 3,082\nOther(3) (4,207) (980) 565\nConsolidated AEBITDA $ 62,292 $ 38,253 $ 39,546\nConsolidated AEBITDA Margin 20.0 % 13.2 % 13.8 %\n(1) Amounts reported during the year ended December 31, 2021 represent a $5.0 million transaction bonus and a $2.5 million charitable contribution per the terms of the Merger\nAgreement.\n(2) Amounts reported include mergers and acquisition related expenses, management restructuring and severance, assets impairments and write-downs, and extraordinary\nexpenses related to the war in Israel and other various nonrecurring expenses.\n(3) Amounts reported in “Other, net” include interest expense, interest income, gains/losses from investments, foreign currency gains/losses, and non-cash gains/losses on the\ndisposal of assets.\n64\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had cash and cash equivalents of $132.9 million, which consisted of cash on hand and money market mutual funds. Historically, we have\nfunded our operations, including capital expenditures, primarily through cash flow from operating activities. We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, the cash\ngenerated from operations, and the borrowing capacity under our Credit Agreement as described below will be sufficient to fund our operations and capital expenditures for at\nleast the next twelve (12) months. However, we intend to continue to make significant investments to support our business growth and may require additional funds to respond\nto business challenges, including the need to develop new games and features or enhance our existing games, improve our operating infrastructure, or acquire complementary\nbusinesses, personnel and technologies. Accordingly, we may need to engage in equity or debt financings to secure additional funds or we may decide to do so opportunistically.\nDebt\nOn June 24, 2021, in connection with the Closing, Old PLAYSTUDIOS terminated and replaced its then existing revolving credit facility with Silicon Valley Bank\n(the “Revolver”). We, one of our subsidiaries, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., Silicon Valley Bank and Wells Fargo\nSecurities, LLC, as joint bookrunners and joint lead arrangers entered into a credit agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) which provides for a five year revolving credit facility in\nan aggregate principal amount of $75 million. Borrowings under the Credit Agreement may be borrowed, repaid, and re-borrowed by us, and are available for working capital,\ngeneral corporate purposes, and permitted acquisitions. Commitment fees and interest rates are determined on the basis of either a Eurodollar rate or an Alternate Base Rate plus\nan applicable margin. The applicable margins are initially 2.50%, in the case of Eurodollar loans, and 1.50%, in the case of Alternate Base Rate loans. The applicable margin is\nsubject to adjustment based upon our Total Net Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement). Eurodollar rates and the Alternate Base Rate are subject to floors of 0.00%\nand 1.00%, respectively. The Credit Agreement contains various affirmative and negative financial and operational covenants applicable to us and our subsidiaries. We are also\nobligated to comply with two financial maintenance covenants as of the end of each fiscal quarter, commencing with the quarter ended September 30, 2021: (i) we must\nmaintain a Total Net Leverage Ratio not to exceed 3.50:1.00 (subject to increase to 4.00:1.00 following consummation of certain material acquisitions) and (ii) we must\nmaintain a Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio of not less than 1.25:1.00.\nOn May 13, 2022, the Company entered into the Amendment No. 1 to the Credit Agreement, which amended the Credit Agreement to, among other things, exclude\nfrom the definition of Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio certain funds, up to $15,000,000, expended or to be expended by the Company in connection with the Tender Offer.\nOn August 9, 2022, the Company entered into the Amendment No. 2 to the Credit Agreement, which further amended the Credit Agreement (as amended by\nAmendment No. 1 to the Credit Agreement) to, among other things, (i) increase the total current available line of credit from $75 million to $81 million, (ii) change the basis for\ncalculation of interest under the facility from LIBOR to SOFR, and (iii) exclude from the calculation of the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio (A) up to $6 million for the acquisition\nof, and improvements to, the real property located at 10150 Covington Cross Drive, Las Vegas, Nevada 89144 incurred on or prior to the first anniversary of the effective date\nof Amendment No. 2 to the Credit Agreement, and (B) up to $20,000,000 for the repurchase or redemption of up to 10,996,631 warrants to purchase shares of Class A common\nstock of the Company, and shares of Class A common stock of the Company, on or before December 31, 2023, of which as of the date of Amendment No. 2 to the Credit\nAgreement, the Company had used $1,792,463 to redeem outstanding warrants to purchase Class A common stock in connection with the Tender Offer.\nOn August 16, 2023, the Company, a subsidiary of the Company, the Lenders party thereto, and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as Administrative Agent, entered into\nan Amendment No. 3 to Credit Agreement (the “Amendment No. 3”), to, among other things, exclude from the Restricted Payments covenant certain repurchases of Equity\nInterests of the Company deemed to occur upon the exercise, settlement or vesting of stock options, warrants or other equity-based awards if and to the extent such Equity\nInterests represent a portion of the exercise price of, or satisfy any tax withholding obligations with respect to, such options, warrants or other equity-based awards.\nAs of December 31, 2023, we do not have any outstanding amounts under the Credit Agreement.\n65\nCash Flows\nThe following table presents a summary of our cash flows for the periods indicated (in thousands):\nYears Ended December 31,\n2023 2022\nNet cash provided by operating activities $ 51,724 $ 33,384\nNet cash used in investing activities (32,306) (102,349)\nNet cash used in financing activities (20,184) (9,571)\nEffect of exchange rate on cash and cash equivalents (345) (966)\nDecrease in cash and cash equivalents $ (1,111) $ (79,502)\nOperating Activities\nYear Ended December 31, 2023 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2022. During the year ended December 31, 2023, operating activities provided $51.7 million of\nnet cash as compared to $33.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase in net cash provided from operating activities primarily related to the full year\nrealization of the Brainium portfolio of games as well as increased advertising revenue from the Tetris game.\nInvesting Activities\nYear Ended December 31, 2023 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2022. During the year ended December 31, 2023, investing activities used $32.3 million of net\ncash as compared to $102.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2022. The decrease of cash used in investing activities was primarily due to the $70.4 million of cash\npaid related to the Brainium and WonderBlocks acquisitions and $5.6 million of additional property and equipment purchased in the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to\nthe current year. The decrease was partially offset by $4.4 million of cash paid related to licensing agreements in the current year and $1.6 million of other investing activities.\nFinancing Activities\nYear Ended December 31, 2023 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2022. During the year ended December 31, 2023, financing activities used $20.2 million of net\ncash, while financing activities used $9.6 million of net cash during the year ended December 31, 2022. This increase is primarily due to an increase of share repurchases made\nduring the year ended December 31, 2022.\nContractual Obligations, Commitments, and Contingencies\nThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2023 (in thousands):\nTotal Less than 1 year Years 2 and 3 Years 4 and 5 More than 5 years\nOperating leases $ 10,655 $ 4,580 $ 4,317 $ 1,758 $ —\nMinimum guarantee obligations 31,760 7,760 12,000 12,000 —\nOther licensing agreements 7,400 7,400 — — —\nTotal $ 49,815 $ 19,740 $ 16,317 $ 13,758 $ —\nOur other long-term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet include unrecognized tax benefits and related interest and penalties. As of December 31, 2023, we had\ngross unrecognized tax benefits of $0.3 million and an additional $0.1 million for interest and penalties classified as long-term liabilities. At this time, we are unable to make a\nreasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years in connection with these tax liabilities; therefore, such amounts are not included in the above\ncontractual obligation table.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur management's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been\nprepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported\namounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, as well as the reported revenue\ngenerated and expenses incurred during the reporting periods. Our estimates are based on our\n66\nhistorical experience and various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about items that\nare not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nInternal-Use Software\nThe Company recognizes internal-use software development costs in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 350-40,I nternal-Use Software.\nCapitalized costs include consulting fees, payroll and payroll-related costs, and stock-based compensation for employees who devote time to the Company’s internal-use\nsoftware projects. Capitalization begins when the preliminary project stage is complete and the Company commits resources to the software project and continues during the\napplication development stage. Capitalization ceases when the software has been tested and is ready for its intended use. Qualified costs incurred during the post-\nimplementation/post-operation stage of the Company’s software applications relating to upgrades and enhancements are capitalized to the extent it is probable that they will\nresult in added functionality. Costs that cannot be separated between maintenance of, and minor upgrades and enhancements to, internal-use software are expensed as incurred.\nCapitalized internal-use software development costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over a three-year estimated useful life. The Company believes that a straight-line basis\nfor amortization best represents the pattern through which the Company derives value from internal-use software. The Company evaluates the useful lives of these assets and\ntest for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances occur that could impact the recoverability of these assets.\nBusiness Combinations\nThe Company applies the provisions of ASC 805, Business Combinations and allocates the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible assets acquired,\nliabilities assumed, and intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values. The excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of these\nidentifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. When determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, management makes significant estimates\nand assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets.\nSignificant estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include, but are not limited to, future expected cash flows from customer relationships, acquired technology\nand acquired trademarks from a market participant perspective, useful lives and discount rates. Management's estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be\nreasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ from estimates.\nRevenue Recognition\nOur revenue recognition policies described in Note 2—Summary Of Significant Accounting Policies requires us to make significant judgments and estimates, which\ninclude the consumption period. The amount of outstanding purchased virtual currency at each reporting date is based on player behavior because the Company is unable to\ndistinguish between the consumption of purchased or free virtual currency.\nVirtual Currency\nThe Company develops and operates free-to-play games which are downloaded and played on social and mobile platforms. Players may collect virtual currency free of\ncharge through the passage of time or through targeted marketing promotions. Additionally, players can send free “gifts” of virtual currency to their friends through interactions\nwith certain social platforms. Players may also purchase additional virtual currency through accepted payment methods offered by the respective platform. Once a purchase is\ncompleted, the virtual currency is deposited into the player’s account and is not separately identifiable from previously purchased virtual currency or virtual currency obtained\nby the player for free. Once obtained, virtual currency (either free or purchased) cannot be redeemed for cash nor exchanged for anything other than game play. When virtual\ncurrency is consumed in our games, the player could “win” and would be awarded additional virtual currency or could “lose” and lose the future use of that virtual currency. As\nthe player does not receive any additional benefit from our games, nor is the player entitled to any additional rights once the player’s virtual currency is substantially consumed,\nthe Company has concluded that the virtual currency represents consumable goods.\nPlayers can earn loyalty points through a variety of activities, including but not limited to playing the Company’s games, engaging with in-game advertising, engaging\nwith marketing emails, and logging into the game. The loyalty points can be redeemed for rewards offered by the Company’s rewards partners. There is no obligation for the\nCompany to pay or otherwise compensate the Company’s rewards partners for any player redemptions under the Company’s rewards partner agreements. In addition, both\npaying and non-paying players can earn loyalty points. Therefore, the loyalty points earned by\n67\nplayers are marketing offers and do not provide players with material rights. Accordingly, the loyalty points do not require any allocation to the transaction price of virtual\ncurrency.\nAdditionally, certain of the Company’s games participate in an additional program which ranks players into different tiers based on tier points earned during a given\ntime frame. Tier points can be earned through a variety of player engagement activities, including but not limited to logging into our games, achieving multi-day log-in streaks,\ncollecting hourly bonuses, and purchasing virtual currency bundles. Depending on the tier, players are granted access to special benefits at the Company’s discretion. Similar to\nloyalty points that are redeemable for real-world rewards, the tier points are not awarded as a result of a contract with a customer since both paying and non-paying players can\nearn these tier points. As a result, the tier points earned by players do not provide players with material rights and do not require any allocation to the transaction price of virtual\ncurrency.\nThe Company has the performance obligation to display and provide access to the virtual currency purchased by the Company’s player within the game whenever the\nplayer accesses the game until the virtual currency is consumed. Payment is required at the time of purchase and the transaction price is fixed. The transaction price, which is the\namount paid for the virtual currency by the player, is allocated entirely to this single performance obligation.\nAs virtual currency represents consumable goods, the Company recognizes revenue as the virtual currency is consumed over the estimated consumption period. Since\nthe Company is unable to distinguish between the consumption of purchased or free virtual currency, the Company must estimate the amount of outstanding purchased virtual\ncurrency at each reporting date based on player behavior. The Company has determined through a review of player behavior that players who purchase virtual currency\ngenerally are not purchasing additional virtual currency if their existing virtual currency balances have not been substantially consumed. As the Company can track the duration\nbetween purchases of virtual currency for individual players, the Company is able to reliably estimate the period over which virtual currency is consumed. Based upon an\nanalysis of players’ historical play behavior, the timing difference between when virtual currency is purchased by a player and when such virtual currency is consumed in\ngameplay is relatively short, currently one to seven days with an average consumption period of approximately one day. The Company recognizes revenue from in-game\npurchases of virtual currency over this estimated average period between when the virtual currency is purchased and consumed. If applicable, the Company records the\nunconsumed virtual currency in “Deferred revenue” and records the prepaid payment processing fees associated with this deferred revenue in “Prepaid expenses”.\nThe Company continues to gather detailed player behavior and assess this data in relation to its revenue recognition policy. To the extent the player behavior changes,\nthe Company reassesses its estimates and assumptions used for revenue recognition prospectively on the basis that such changes are caused by new factors indicating a change\nin player behavior patterns.\nAdvertising Revenue\nThe Company has contractual relationships with various advertising service providers for advertisements within the Company’s games. Advertisements can be in the\nform of an impression, click-throughs, banner ads, or offers. Offers are advertisements where the players are rewarded with virtual currency for watching a short video. The\nCompany has determined the advertising service provider to be its customer and displaying the advertisements within its games is identified as the single performance\nobligation. Revenue from advertisements and offers are recognized at a point in time when the advertisements are displayed, or when the player has completed the offer as the\nadvertising service provider simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits provided from these services. The price can be determined by the applicable evidence of the\narrangement, which may include a master contract or a third-party statement of activity.\nThe transaction price is generally the product of the advertising units delivered (e.g. impressions, videos viewed) and the contractually agreed upon price per\nadvertising unit. Further, the price per advertising unit can also be based on revenue share percentages stated in the contract. The number of advertising units delivered is\ndetermined at the end of each month so there is no uncertainty about the transaction price. Payment terms are stipulated as a specific number of days subsequent to end of the\nmonth, ranging from 45 to 60 days.\nPrincipal Agent Considerations\nThe Company’s games are played on various social and mobile third-party platforms for which such third parties collect monies from players and remit net proceeds\nafter deducting payment processing fees. The Company is primarily responsible for providing access to the virtual currency, has control over the content and functionality of\ngames before they are accessed by players, and has the discretion to establish the pricing for the virtual currency. Therefore, the Company concluded that it is the principal and\nas a result, revenues are reported gross of payment processing fees. Payment processing\n68\nfees are recorded as a component of “Cost of revenue” in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations. The Company reports its advertising revenue net of\namounts retained by advertising service providers.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with ASC 740 ,Income Taxes, which requires recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected\nfuture tax consequences of events that have been included in its consolidated financial statements or tax returns. Under ASC 740, the Company determines deferred tax assets\nand liabilities based on the temporary difference between the consolidated financial statements and tax bases of assets and liabilities using the enacted tax rates in effect for the\nyear in which it expects the differences to be recovered or settled. The Company establishes valuation allowances when necessary, based on the weight of the available positive\nand negative evidence, to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized.\nThe Company accounts for uncertain tax positions in accordance with ASC 740, which requires companies to adjust their consolidated financial statements to reflect\nonly those tax positions that are more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the issue. ASC 740 prescribes a\ncomprehensive model for the consolidated financial statement recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in\nincome tax returns. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the provision for income taxes.\nWe have elected to account for the impact of the global intangible low-taxed income (GILTI) inclusion and base erosion anti-avoidance tax (BEAT) based on the\nperiod cost method.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 2—Summary Of Significant Accounting Policies to our consolidated financial statements for more information about recent accounting pronouncements, the\ntiming of their adoption, and our assessment, to the extent we have made one, of their potential impact on our financial condition and our results of operations.\nITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nMarket risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices, such as interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. We are exposed to\nmarket risks in the ordinary course of our business. These risks primarily include interest rate risk, investment risk, and foreign currency risk as follows:\nInterest Rate Risk\nOur exposures to market risk for changes in interest rates relate primarily to our Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement and Revolver are floating rate facilities.\nTherefore, fluctuations in interest rates will impact the amount of interest expense we incur and have to pay. We did not have any borrowings outstanding under our Credit\nAgreement at December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively.\nWe do not purchase or hold any derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.\nInvestment Risk\nWe had cash and cash equivalents totaling $132.9 million and $134.0 million as of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. Our investment policy\nand strategy primarily attempt to preserve capital and meet liquidity requirements without significantly increasing risk. Our cash and cash equivalents primarily consist of cash\non hand and money market mutual funds. We have not entered into investments for trading or speculative purposes. Changes in rates would primarily impact interest income\ndue to the relatively short-term nature of our investments. A hypothetical 100 basis point change in interest rates would have increased or decreased our interest income for a\ntwelve-month period by an immaterial amount.\nForeign Currency Risk\nOur functional currency is the U.S. Dollar and our revenues and expenses are primarily denominated in U.S. Dollars. Our indirect foreign currency transaction\nexposure results mainly from the sale of our virtual currency to players outside of the U.S. While players outside of the U.S. make purchases in currencies other than the U.S.\nDollar, we are paid by platform providers and record revenue in U.S. Dollars pursuant to the terms of the relevant contracts. While we have the ability to change the foreign\ncurrency pricing of our virtual currency, sudden and significant changes in the exchange rates of the\n69\nCanadian and Australian Dollars and Pound Sterling to the U.S. Dollar could have a material impact on our results of operations.\nHowever, a significant portion of our headcount related expenses, consisting principally of salaries and related personnel expenses, as well as leases and certain other\noperating expenses, are denominated in New Israeli Shekels, or NIS. We also have foreign currency risks related to our operating expenses denominated in currencies other than\nthe U.S. Dollar, including the Hong Kong Dollar, Euro, Serbian Dinar, Vietnamese Dong, Singaporean Dollar, Mexican Peso, and Chilean Peso. Accordingly, changes in\nexchange rates in the future may negatively affect our future operating results as expressed in U.S. Dollars.\nWe have experienced and will continue to experience fluctuations in our net income as a result of transaction gains or losses related to remeasurement of our asset and\nliability balances that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the entities in which they are recorded.\nAs of December 31, 2023, we entered into derivative contracts to purchase certain foreign currencies, including the NIS, at future dates. The notional value of amounts\nhedged was approximately $2.5 million, and all contracts are expected to mature during the upcoming 12 months. Subsequent to December 31, 2023, we entered into additional\nderivatives contracts to purchase certain foreign currencies, including the NIS, at future dates. The notional value of amounts hedged was approximately $30.4 million, and all\ncontracts are expected to mature within 12 months of the purchase date.\n70\nITEM 8.

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly,\nin all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years\nin the period ended December 31, 2023, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our\naudits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with\nrespect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the\nPCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about\nwhether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an\naudit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the\npurpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that\nrespond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included\nevaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe\nthat our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n/s/ Deloitte & Touche LLP\nLas Vegas, Nevada\nMarch 12, 2024\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2018.\n72\nPLAYSTUDIOS, INC.\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\n(in thousands, except par value amounts)\nDecember 31,\n2023 2022\nASSETS\nCurrent assets:\nCash and cash equivalents $ 132,889 $ 134,000\nReceivables 30,465 27,016\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets 11,529 14,963\nTotal current assets 174,883 175,979\nProperty and equipment, net 17,549 17,532\nOperating lease right-of-use assets 9,369 15,562\nIntangibles assets and internal-use software, net 110,933 77,231\nGoodwill 47,133 47,133\nDeferred income taxes 2,764 13,969\nOther long-term assets 3,690 4,603\nTotal non-current assets 191,438 176,030\nTotal assets $ 366,321 $ 352,009\nLIABILITIES AND STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY\nCurrent liabilities:\nAccounts payable 1,907 4,425\nWarrant liabilities 1,086 3,682\nOperating lease liabilities, current 4,236 4,571\nAccrued and other current liabilities 38,796 21,473\nTotal current liabilities 46,025 34,151\nMinimum guarantee liability 24,000 1,500\nDeferred income taxes 1,198 —\nOperating lease liabilities, non-current 5,699 11,660\nOther long-term liabilities 1,048 2,385\nTotal non-current liabilities 31,945 15,545\nTotal liabilities $ 77,970 $ 49,696\nCommitments and contingencies\nStockholders’ equity:\nPreferred stock, $0.0001 par value (100,000 shares authorized, 0 shares issued and outstanding as of December 31, 2023 and\nDecember 31, 2022) — —\nClass A common stock, $0.0001 par value (2,000,000 shares authorized, 122,923 and 116,756 shares issued, and 118,200 and\n115,635 shares outstanding as of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively) 12 11\nClass B common stock, $0.0001 par value (25,000 shares authorized, 16,457 and 16,457 shares issued and outstanding as of\nDecember 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively). 2 2\nAdditional paid-in capital 310,944 290,337\n(Accumulated deficit) retained earnings (2,637) 16,756\nAccumulated other comprehensive income (loss) 124 (151)\nTreasury stock, at cost, 4,723 and 1,166 shares at December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively (20,094) (4,642)\nTotal stockholders’ equity 288,351 302,313\nTotal liabilities and stockholders’ equity $ 366,321 $ 352,009\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.\n73\nPLAYSTUDIOS, INC.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS\n(in thousands, except per share data)\nYears Ended December 31,\n2023 2022 2021\nNet revenue $ 310,886 $ 290,309 $ 287,419\nOperating expenses:\nCost of revenue(1) 77,800 85,400 91,642\nSelling and marketing 74,360 80,819 79,042\nResearch and development 70,298 63,315 61,343\nGeneral and administrative 45,072 40,274 27,902\nDepreciation and amortization 45,259 35,562 27,398\nRestructuring and related 8,584 13,020 3,082\nTotal operating costs and expenses 321,373 318,390 290,409\nLoss from operations (10,487) (28,081) (2,990)\nOther income (expense), net:\nChange in fair value of warrant liabilities 2,596 1,047 13,933\nInterest income (loss), net 4,858 1,925 (235)\nOther income (expense), net 513 1,491 (229)\nTotal other income, net 7,967 4,463 13,469\n(Loss) income before income taxes (2,520) (23,618) 10,479\nIncome tax (expense) benefit (16,873) 5,835 258\nNet (loss) income $ (19,393) $ (17,783) $ 10,737\nNet (loss) income attributable to common stockholders per share:\nBasic $ (0.15) $ (0.14) $ 0.10\nDiluted $ (0.15) $ (0.14) $ 0.09\nWeighted average shares of common stock outstanding:\nBasic 132,978 128,353 111,718\nDiluted 132,978 128,353 124,898\n(1) Amounts exclude depreciation and amortization.\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.\n74\nPLAYSTUDIOS, INC.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF COMPREHENSIVE (LOSS) INCOME\n(in thousands)\nYears Ended December 31,\n2023 2022 2021\nNet (loss) income $ (19,393) $ (17,783) $ 10,737\nOther comprehensive income (loss):\nChange in foreign currency translation adjustment(1) (11) (544) (88)\nUnrealized gain from derivative financial instruments(1) 757 — —\nRealized gain from settlement of derivative financial instruments(1) (471) — —\nTotal other comprehensive income (loss) 275 (544) (88)\nComprehensive (loss) income $ (19,118) $ (18,327) $ 10,649\n(1) These amounts are presented gross of the effect of income taxes.

noted)\nNOTE 1—BACKGROUND AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION\nOrganization and Description of Business\nPLAYSTUDIOS, Inc., formerly known as Acies Acquisition Corp. (the \"Company\" or \"PLAYSTUDIOS\"), was incorporated on August 14, 2020 as a Cayman Islands\nexempted company, and domesticated into a Delaware corporation on June 21, 2021 (the \"Domestication\"). The Company's legal name became PLAYSTUDIOS, Inc. following\nthe closing of the Acies Merger discussed in Note 4—Business Combinations. The prior period financial information represents the financial results and conditions of Old\nPLAYSTUDIOS (as defined in Note 4—Business Combinations).\nThe Company develops and operates online and mobile social gaming applications (“games” or “game”), many of which incorporate a unique loyalty program offering\n“real world” rewards provided by a collection of rewards partners. The Company’s games are free-to-play and available via the Apple App Store, Google Play Store, Amazon\nAppstore, and Facebook (collectively, “platforms” or “platform operators”). The Company creates games based on its own original content as well as third-party licensed\nbrands. The Company generates revenue through the in-game sale of virtual currency and through advertising. We have two operating segments as discussed in Note 3\n—Segment Reporting.\nUnless the context indicates otherwise, all references herein to “PLAYSTUDIOS,” the “Company,” “we,” “us,” and “our” are used to refer collectively to\nPLAYSTUDIOS, Inc. and its subsidiaries.\nBasis of Presentation and Consolidation\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S.\nGAAP”) and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of\nPLAYSTUDIOS, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries. In the opinion of management, all adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation have been recorded within\nthe accompanying financial statements, and all intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated upon consolidation. Certain reclassifications in these consolidated\nfinancial statements have been made to comply with U.S. GAAP applicable to public companies and SEC Regulation S-X.\nPursuant to the Acies Merger as discussed in Note 4—Business Combinations, the Acies Merger was accounted for as a reverse recapitalization in accordance with U.S.\nGAAP. Under this method of accounting, Acies was treated as the “acquired” company for financial reporting purposes and the consolidated financial statements represent the\naccounts of Old PLAYSTUDIOS “as if” Old PLAYSTUDIOS is the predecessor to the Company.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in\nthe consolidated financial statements and notes thereto. Significant estimates and assumptions reflected in the Company’s consolidated financial statements include the\nestimated consumption rate of virtual currency that is used in the determination of revenue recognition, useful lives of property and equipment and definite-lived intangible\nassets, the expensing and capitalization of research and development costs for internal-use software, assumptions used in accounting for income taxes, stock-based\ncompensation, and the evaluation of goodwill and long-lived assets for impairment. The Company believes the accounting estimates are appropriate and reasonably determined.\nDue to the inherent uncertainties in making these estimates, actual amounts could differ materially.\nEmerging Growth Company\nAt December 31, 2023, the Company qualified as an “emerging growth company,” as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act, as modified by the Jumpstart Our\nBusiness Startups Act of 2012 (the “JOBS Act”), and the Company has taken and may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are\napplicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation\nrequirements of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy\nstatements, and exemptions from the requirements of\n80\nholding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved.\nSection 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until\nprivate companies are required to comply with the new or revised standards. The JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can elect to opt out of the extended\ntransition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies but any such election to opt out is irrevocable. The Company has opted to take\nadvantage of such extended transition period available to emerging growth companies which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application\ndates for public or private companies, the Company can adopt the new or revised standard at the time private companies adopt the new or revised standard. As a result of the\nCompany's qualification as an emerging growth company, the Company does not expect to adopt any accounting pronouncements currently deferred based on private company\nstandards until a year subsequent to 2023. The Company will reevaluate its eligibility to retain emerging growth company status at the end of its second quarter of 2024, and\notherwise as required.\nNOTE 2—SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents consist of cash on hand and highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less from the date of purchase and are\nstated at the lower of cost or market value.\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist of cash and cash equivalents and receivables. The Company maintains cash and\ncash equivalent balances at several banks. Cash accounts located in the U.S. are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). Although balances may exceed\namounts insured by the FDIC, the Company believes that it is not exposed to any significant credit risk related to its cash or cash equivalents and has not experienced any losses\nin such accounts.\nReceivables and Allowance for Uncollectible Amounts\nThe Company’s receivables consist primarily of amounts due from social and mobile game platform operators, including Apple, Google, Facebook, and Amazon.\nAccounts receivable are typically non-interest bearing and are initially recorded at cost. The Company regularly reviews accounts receivable, considers current economic\nconditions and the financial positions of the Company’s platform operators. Accounts are written off when the Company deems the account to be uncollectible. Recoveries of\naccounts previously written off are recorded when received. The Company reserves an estimated amount for receivables that may not be collected to reduce receivables to their\nnet carrying amount, which approximates fair value. Methodologies for estimating the allowance for uncollectible amounts range from specific reserves to various percentages\napplied to aged receivables. Historical collection rates are considered in determining reserves.\nThe following table summarizes the major receivables of the Company as a percentage of the total receivables, net as of the dates indicated:\nDecember 31, December 31,\n2023 2022\nApple, Inc. 45.6 % 33.6 %\nGoogle, Inc. 20.8 % 27.2 %\nAs of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the Company did not have any additional counterparties that exceeded 10% of the Company’s accounts receivable.\nProperty and Equipment, net\nThe Company states property and equipment at cost net of accumulated depreciation. The Company capitalizes the costs of improvements that extend the life of the\nasset, while costs of repairs and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred. Gains or losses on the disposition of property and equipment are included in the determination\nof income.\nComputer equipment, furniture, and fixtures are depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Leasehold improvements are\namortized over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset or the related lease term.\n81\nEstimated Useful Life\nComputer equipment 3 years\nPurchased software 3 years\nFurniture and fixtures 3 - 7 years\nBuilding 39 years\nBuilding improvements 15 years\nLand improvements 5 years\nLeasehold improvements Lesser of 10 years or remaining lease term\nProperty and equipment are reviewed for impairment whenever events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable.\nRecoverability of these assets is measured by a comparison of the carrying amounts to the future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate. If property and\nequipment are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized equals the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair market value. If the\nCompany reduces the estimated useful life assumption for any asset, the remaining unamortized balance would be amortized or depreciated over the revised estimated useful\nlife.\nBusiness Combinations\nThe Company applies the provisions of ASC 805, Business Combination and allocates the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities\nassumed, and intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values. The excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable\nassets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. When determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, management makes significant estimates and\nassumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets.\nSignificant estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include, but are not limited to, future expected cash flows from customer relationships, acquired technology\nand acquired trademarks from a market participant perspective, useful lives and discount rates. Management's estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be\nreasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ from estimates.\nGoodwill\nIn accordance with Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2014-02, Intangibles—Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Accounting for Goodwill, goodwill is recorded\nas the excess of the purchase price over acquisition-date fair value of identifiable tangible and intangible assets and liabilities. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually as of\nOctober 1st of each year, or when a triggering event occurs. If a triggering event occurs, qualitative factors are first assessed to determine whether a quantitative impairment test\nis required. If a quantitative test is required, the fair value of the asset is compared to the asset's carrying amount. Any impairment would be recognized for the difference\nbetween the fair value and the carrying amount limited to the carrying amount of goodwill. Impairment testing for goodwill is performed at the reporting unit level. The\nCompany has identified a single reporting unit based on the Company’s management structure.\nIntangible Assets\nIntangible assets are classified into one of the two categories: (1) intangible assets with definite lives subject to amortization and (2) intangible assets with indefinite\nlives not subject to amortization.\nFor definite-lived intangible assets, amortization is recorded using the straight-line method, which materially approximates the pattern of the assets’ use. The Company\ncontinually evaluates whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate the remaining estimated useful life of intangible assets may warrant revision or that the\nremaining balance may not be recoverable. These factors may include a significant deterioration of operating results, changes in business plans, or changes in anticipated cash\nflows.\n82\nThe estimated useful lives of the Company’s intangible assets are as follows:\nEstimated Useful Life\nLicenses 2 - 6 years\nTrade names 5 - 10 years\nAcquired technology 5 years\nCustomer relationships 5 years\nPatents and trademarks 10 - 20 years\nWhen factors indicate that a definite-lived intangible asset should be evaluated for possible impairment, the Company reviews intangible assets to assess recoverability\nfrom future operations using undiscounted cash flows. If future undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying value, an impairment is recognized in earnings to the extent\nthat the carrying value exceeds fair value.\nFor indefinite-lived intangible assets, the Company conducts impairment tests annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that it is more\nlikely than not that the fair value of an indefinite-lived asset is less than its carrying value, or when circumstances no longer continue to support an indefinite useful life. If a\ntriggering event occurs, qualitative factors are first assessed to determine whether a quantitative impairment test is required. If a quantitative test is required, the fair value of the\nintangible is compared to the asset’s carrying amount. Any impairment would be recognized for the difference between the fair value and the carrying amount. The Company\nperforms its annual impairment testing as of October 1 of each year.\nInternal-Use Software\nThe Company recognizes internal-use software development costs in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 350-40,I nternal-Use Software.\nCapitalized costs include consulting fees, payroll and payroll-related costs, and stock-based compensation for employees who devote time to the Company’s internal-use\nsoftware projects. Capitalization begins when the preliminary project stage is complete and the Company commits resources to the software project and continues during the\napplication development stage. Capitalization ceases when the software has been tested and is ready for its intended use. Qualified costs incurred during the post-\nimplementation/post-operation stage of the Company’s software applications relating to upgrades and enhancements are capitalized to the extent it is probable that they will\nresult in added functionality. Costs that cannot be separated between maintenance of, and minor upgrades and enhancements to, internal-use software are expensed as incurred.\nCapitalized internal-use software development costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over a three-year estimated useful life. The Company believes that a straight-line basis\nfor amortization best represents the pattern through which the Company derives value from internal-use software. The Company evaluates the useful lives of these assets and\ntest for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances occur that could impact the recoverability of these assets.\nLicense Agreements & Minimum Guarantees\nThe Company enters into long-term license agreements with third parties in which it is obligated to pay a minimum guaranteed amount of royalties, typically annually\nover the life of the contract. The Company accounts for the minimum guaranteed obligations within “Accrued liabilities” and “Minimum guarantee liability” at the onset of the\nlicense arrangement and records a corresponding licensed asset within “Intangibles, net” in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. The licensed intangible assets\nrelated to the minimum guaranteed obligations are amortized over the term of the license agreement with the amortization expense recorded in “Depreciation and amortization”\nin the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations. The Company classifies minimum royalty payment obligations as current liabilities to the extent they are\ncontractually due within the next 12 months. The long-term portion of the liability related to the minimum guaranteed obligations is reduced as royalty payments are made as\nrequired under the license agreement. The Company assesses the recoverability of license agreements whenever events arise or circumstances change that indicate the carrying\nvalue of the licensed asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of the licensed asset and the amount of impairment, if any, are determined using the Company’s policy for\nintangible assets with finite useful lives.\nWarrant Liabilities\nThe Company evaluates all of its financial instruments, including issued warrants, to determine if such instruments are liability classified, pursuant to ASC Topic 480,\nDistinguishing Liabilities from Equity (“ASC 480”) or derivatives or\n83\ncontain features that qualify as embedded derivatives pursuant to ASC Topic 815,D erivatives and Hedging (“ASC 815”). The classification of instruments, including whether\nsuch instruments should be recorded as liabilities or as equity, is re-assessed at the end of each reporting period. Issuance costs incurred with the Acies Merger that are\nattributable to liability classified warrants are expensed as incurred.\nFair Value Measurements\nThe carrying amounts of the Company’s financial instruments, including accounts receivable, accounts payable, and accrued liabilities, approximate fair value because\nof their short-term maturities.\nAccording to ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a\nliability (an exit price) in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The fair value hierarchy establishes three tiers, which prioritize the inputs\nused in measuring fair value as follows:\nLevel 1—Observable inputs, such as quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;\nLevel 2—Inputs, other than quoted prices in active markets, that are observable either directly or indirectly; and\nLevel 3—Unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data, which require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions.\nEntities are permitted to choose to measure certain financial instruments and other items at fair value. The Company has not elected the fair value measurement option\nfor any of the Company’s assets or liabilities that meet the criteria for this election.\nLeases\nThe Company is the lessee primarily under non-cancelable office real estate and data center leases. The Company accounts for its leases under ASU No. 2016-02,\nLeases (Topic 842). Operating lease right-of-use (\"ROU\") assets and liabilities are recognized at the commencement date and initially measured based on the present value of\nlease payments and lease incentives received over the defined lease term. The Company’s lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease. The Company\nassesses these options using a threshold of whether the Company is reasonably certain to exercise the option to extend or terminate the lease. For leases the Company is\nreasonably certain to renew, those option periods are included within the lease term and, therefore, the measurement of the right-of-use asset and lease liability. Lease expense\nfor lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The Company’s real estate lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees,\nrestrictions or covenants. The Company’s lease agreements with lease and non-lease components are accounted for separately.\nAs most of the Company’s leases do not provide an implicit rate, the incremental borrowing rate is estimated based upon the capital structure of the Company and\nupon the other information available at the lease commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. The implicit rate will be used when readily\ndeterminable. The operating lease ROU assets also include any prepaid lease payments made and are net of lease incentives. The Company does not record an asset or liability\nfor operating leases with a term of 12 months or less.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company determines revenue recognition in accordance with ASC 606, Revenues from Contracts with Customers, by:\n• identifying the contract, or contracts, with a customer;\n• identifying the performance obligations in each contract;\n• determining the transaction price;\n• allocating the transaction price to the performance obligations in each contract; and\n• recognizing revenue when, or as, the Company satisfies performance obligations by transferring the promised goods or services.\n84\nVirtual Currency\nThe Company develops and operates free-to-play games which are downloaded and played on social and mobile platforms. Players may collect virtual currency free of\ncharge through the passage of time or through targeted marketing promotions. Additionally, players can send free “gifts” of virtual currency to their friends through interactions\nwith certain social platforms. Players may also purchase additional virtual currency through accepted payment methods offered by the respective platform. Once a purchase is\ncompleted, the virtual currency is deposited into the player’s account and are not separately identifiable from previously purchased virtual currency or virtual currency obtained\nby the player for free. Once obtained, virtual currency (either free or purchased) cannot be redeemed for cash nor exchanged for anything other than gameplay. When virtual\ncurrency is consumed in our games, the player could “win” and would be awarded additional virtual currency or could “lose” and lose the future use of that virtual currency. As\nthe player does not receive any additional benefit from our games, nor is the player entitled to any additional rights once the player’s virtual currency is substantially consumed,\nthe Company has concluded that the virtual currency represents consumable goods.\nPlayers can earn loyalty points through a variety of activities, including but not limited to playing the Company’s games, engaging with in-game advertising, engaging\nwith marketing emails, and logging into the game. The loyalty points can be redeemed for rewards offered by the Company’s rewards partners. There is no obligation for the\nCompany to pay or otherwise compensate the Company’s rewards partners for any player redemptions under the Company’s rewards partner agreements. In addition, both\npaying and non-paying players can earn loyalty points. Therefore, the loyalty points earned by players are marketing offers and do not provide players with material rights.\nAccordingly, the loyalty points do not require any allocation to the transaction price of virtual currency.\nAdditionally, certain of the Company’s games participate in an additional program which ranks players into different tiers based on tier points earned during a given\ntime frame. Tier points can be earned through a variety of player engagement activities, including but not limited to logging into our games, achieving multi-day log-in streaks,\ncollecting hourly bonuses, and purchasing virtual currency bundles. Depending on the tier, players are granted access to special benefits at the Company’s discretion. Similar to\nloyalty points that are redeemable for real-world rewards, the tier points are not awarded as a result of a contract with a customer since both paying and non-paying players can\nearn these tier points. As a result, the tier points earned by players do not provide players with material rights and do not require any allocation to the transaction price of virtual\ncurrency.\nThe Company has the performance obligation to display and provide access to the virtual currency purchased by the Company’s player within the game whenever the\nplayer accesses the game until the virtual currency is consumed. Payment is required at the time of purchase and the transaction price is fixed. The transaction price, which is the\namount paid for the virtual currency by the player, is allocated entirely to this single performance obligation.\nAs virtual currency represents consumable goods, the Company recognizes revenue as the virtual currency is consumed over the estimated consumption period. Since\nthe Company is unable to distinguish between the consumption of purchased or free virtual currency, the Company must estimate the amount of outstanding purchased virtual\ncurrency at each reporting date based on player behavior. The Company has determined through a review of player behavior that players who purchase virtual currency\ngenerally are not purchasing additional virtual currency if their existing virtual currency balances have not been substantially consumed. As the Company can track the duration\nbetween purchases of virtual currency for individual players, the Company is able to reliably estimate the period over which virtual currency is consumed. Based upon an\nanalysis of players’ historical play behavior, the timing difference between when virtual currency is purchased by a player and when such virtual currency is consumed in\ngameplay is relatively short, currently one to seven days with an average consumption period of approximately one day. The Company recognizes revenue from in-game\npurchases of virtual currency over this estimated average period between when the virtual currency is purchased and consumed. If applicable, the Company records the\nunconsumed virtual currency in “Deferred revenue” and records the prepaid payment processing fees associated with this deferred revenue in “Prepaid expenses”.\nThe Company continues to gather detailed player behavior and assess this data in relation to its revenue recognition policy. To the extent the player behavior changes,\nthe Company reassesses its estimates and assumptions used for revenue recognition prospectively on the basis that such changes are caused by new factors indicating a change\nin player behavior patterns.\nAdvertising Revenue\nThe Company has contractual relationships with various advertising service providers for advertisements within the Company’s games. Advertisements can be in the\nform of an impression, click-throughs, banner ads, or offers. Offers are\n85\nadvertisements where the players are rewarded with virtual currency for watching a short video. The Company has determined the advertising service provider to be its\ncustomer and displaying the advertisements within its games is identified as the single performance obligation. Revenue from advertisements and offers are recognized at a\npoint in time when the advertisements are displayed, or when the player has completed the offer as the advertising service provider simultaneously receives and consumes the\nbenefits provided from these services. The price can be determined by the applicable evidence of the arrangement, which may include a master contract or a third-party\nstatement of activity.\nThe transaction price is generally the product of the advertising units delivered (e.g. impressions, videos viewed) and the contractually agreed upon price per\nadvertising unit. Further, the price per advertising unit can also be based on revenue share percentages stated in the contract. The number of advertising units delivered is\ndetermined at the end of each month so there is no uncertainty about the transaction price. Payment terms are stipulated as a specific number of days subsequent to end of the\nmonth, ranging from 45 to 60 days.\nPrincipal Agent Considerations\nThe Company’s games are played on various social and mobile third-party platforms for which such third parties collect monies from players and remit net proceeds\nafter deducting payment processing fees. The Company is primarily responsible for providing access to the virtual currency, has control over the content and functionality of\ngames before they are accessed by players, and has the discretion to establish the pricing for the virtual currency. Therefore, the Company concluded that it is the principal and\nas a result, revenues are reported gross of payment processing fees. Payment processing fees are recorded as a component of “Cost of revenue” in the accompanying\nConsolidated Statements of Operations. The Company reports its advertising revenue net of amounts retained by advertising service providers.\nCost of Revenue\nCost of revenue relates to direct expenses incurred to generate revenue from online and mobile games and are recorded as incurred. The Company’s cost of revenue\nconsists primarily of payment processing fees, hosting and data center costs related to operating its games, and royalties for licensed games. Payment processing fees consist of\nfees paid to third-party social and mobile platform operators. If applicable, other than the deferral of payment processing fees associated with deferred revenues, payment\nprocessing fees are expensed as incurred.\nResearch and Development\nThe Company incurs various direct costs in relation to the development of future social and mobile games along with costs to improve current social and mobile\ngames. Research and development costs consist primarily of payroll and related personnel costs, stock-based compensation, and consulting fees. The Company evaluates\nresearch and development costs incurred to determine whether the costs relate to the development of software and are, therefore, qualified to be capitalized under ASC 350-40,\nInternal-Use Software. All other research and development costs are expensed as incurred.\nAdvertising\nAdvertising expenses for our games was $60.7 million, $69.1 million and $70.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively.\nAdvertising expenses are included in “Selling and marketing” expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nShare-Based Compensation\nThe Company measures compensation expense for all share-based awards at fair value on the date of grant and recognizes compensation expense over the service\nperiod on a straight-line basis for awards expected to vest.\nThe Company uses the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model to determine the fair value for option awards. In valuing our option awards, the Company makes\nassumptions about risk-free interest rates, dividend yields, volatility, and weighted-average expected lives. The Company accounts for forfeitures as they occur. Risk-free\ninterest rates are derived from U.S. Treasury securities as of the option award grant date. Expected dividend yield is based on our historical cash dividend payments, which have\nbeen zero to date. The expected volatility for shares of the Company's Class A common stock is estimated using our historical volatility. The weighted-average expected life of\nthe option awards is estimated based on our historical exercise data.\nThe Company's dual class structure was created upon the Domestication (as defined in Note 4—Business Combinations). The Class B common stock, including Class\nB common stock underlying stock options, held by Mr. Andrew Pascal, the Company's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, or his affiliates (the \"Founder Group\") carry a\nsuper vote\n86\npremium. As the Founder Group did not have control of Old PLAYSTUDIOS prior to the Acies Merger, and Mr. Pascal is an employee of the Company, the incremental value\nresulting from the super vote premium is accounted for as incremental compensation costs.\nThe Company utilized the market approach by observing other market participants with (i) dual class structures, (ii) super vote premiums for a single class and (iii)\nboth classes trading on a national exchange. Based on the observed data, management selected a premium for the Class B common stock and the stock options held by members\nof the Founder Group.\nForeign Currency Derivative Contracts\nThe Company uses foreign currency derivative contracts to reduce our exposure to fluctuating exchange rates between the United States dollar (as our functional\ncurrency) and certain expense lines denominated in New Israeli Shekels (“NIS”). Our derivative contracts are designated as cash flow hedges under ASC 815. We monitor the\neffectiveness of our hedges on a quarterly basis, both qualitatively and quantitatively, and expect these hedges to remain highly effective at offsetting fluctuations in exchange\nrates through their respective maturity dates. See Note 19—Stockholders’ Equity for additional discussion.\nThe fair value of derivative financial instruments is recognized as an asset or liability at each balance sheet date, with changes in fair value recorded in other\ncomprehensive income on the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss) until the future underlying transactions occur. The fair value approximates the amount\nwe would pay or receive if these contracts were settled at the respective valuation dates. The inputs used to measure the fair value of our foreign currency derivative contracts\nare categorized as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy as established by ASC 820. As of December 31, 2023, the fair value of these foreign currency derivatives contracts were\nimmaterial. Cash flows from derivatives, which are designated as accounting hedges, are presented consistently with the cash flow classification of the related hedged items.\nForeign Currency Translation and Transactions\nThe functional currency of each of the Company’s wholly owned foreign subsidiaries is the applicable local currency. The translation of foreign currencies into U.S.\ndollars is performed for assets and liabilities using current foreign currency exchange rates in effect at the consolidated balance sheet date and for revenue and expense accounts\nusing average foreign currency exchange rates during the year. Capital accounts are translated at historical foreign currency exchange rates. Translation gains and losses are\nincluded in stockholders’ equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. Adjustments that arise from foreign currency exchange rate changes on\ntransactions, primarily driven by intercompany transactions, denominated in a currency other than the functional currency are included in “Other income (expense), net” in the\nConsolidated Statements of Operations.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with ASC 740 ,Income Taxes, which requires recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected\nfuture tax consequences of events that have been included in its consolidated financial statements or tax returns. Under ASC 740, the Company determines deferred tax assets\nand liabilities based on the temporary difference between the consolidated financial statements and tax bases of assets and liabilities using the enacted tax rates in effect for the\nyear in which it expects the differences to be recovered or settled. The Company establishes valuation allowances when necessary, based on the weight of the available positive\nand negative evidence, to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized.\nThe Company accounts for uncertain tax positions in accordance with ASC 740, which requires companies to adjust their consolidated financial statements to reflect\nonly those tax positions that are more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the issue. ASC 740 prescribes a\ncomprehensive model for the consolidated financial statement recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in\nincome tax returns. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the provision for income taxes.\nWe have elected to account for the impact of the global intangible low-taxed income (GILTI) inclusion and base erosion anti-avoidance tax (BEAT) based on the\nperiod cost method.\n87\nNet (Loss) Income Per Share\nNet (loss) income per share (“EPS”) is calculated using the two-class method required for participating securities and multiple classes of common stock. Basic income\nper share is computed by dividing net income available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Net income available to\ncommon stockholders represents net income attributable to common stockholders reduced by the allocation of earnings to participating securities. Diluted income per share\nadjusts basic loss per share for the potentially dilutive impact of stock options, warrants, restricted stock, and contingently issuable earnout shares. The dilutive effect of stock\noptions, warrants, restricted stock, and contingently issuable earnout shares is computed using the treasury stock method. Diluted EPS excludes all dilutive potential shares if\ntheir effect is anti-dilutive.\nEPS calculations for all periods prior to the Acies Merger have been retrospectively adjusted for the equivalent number of shares outstanding immediately after the\nAcies Merger to effect the reverse recapitalization. Subsequent to the Acies Merger, net income per share was calculated based on the weighted average number of common\nstock then outstanding.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2023-07,S egment Reporting (Topic 280):\nImprovements to Reportable Segment Disclosures, which requires public entities to disclose information about their reportable segments’ significant expenses and other\nsegment items on an interim and annual basis. Public entities with a single reportable segment are required to apply the disclosure requirements in ASU 2023-07, as well as all\nexisting segment disclosures and reconciliation requirements in ASC 280 on an interim and annual basis. ASU 2023-07 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December\n15, 2023, and for interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of\nadopting ASU 2023-07.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09,I ncome Taxes (Topic 740). ASU 2023-09 requires that public business entities expand their annual disclosures\nrelated to rate reconciliation and income taxes paid, and provide a disaggregated presentation between domestic and foreign income or loss from continuing operations before\nincome tax expense and income tax expense or benefit from continuing operations. This guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024. The\nCompany is currently evaluating the impact of adopting ASU 2023-09.\nNOTE 3—SEGMENT REPORTING\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company revised the presentation of segment information to align with changes to how the chief operating decision maker\n(\"CODM \") manages the business, allocates resources, and assesses operating performance. The CODM is the Company's Chief Executive Officer. Prior to the fourth quarter of\n2023, the Company had a single operating and reportable segment. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company reports operating results based on two reportable\nsegments: playGAMES and playAWARDS. Each reportable segment has a different service offering and different customer base. As of December 31, 2023, the Company's\noperating segments are the same as the reportable segments, which are as follows:\nplayGAMES: This segment is a leading developer and publisher of digital games on mobile and web platforms. It operates primarily in the social gaming market,\nwhich is characterized by gameplay online or on mobile devices, that is social, competitive, and self-directed in pace and session length. playGAMES also operate in the casual\nspace. playGAMES generates a substantial portion of our revenue from in-app purchases in the form of virtual currencies, which players can use to play social casino games.\nPlayers who install our social casino games typically receive free virtual currency upon the initial launch of the game and additional virtual currencies at specific time intervals.\nPlayers may exhaust the virtual currencies that they receive for free and may choose to purchase additional virtual currencies in order to extend their time of game play. Once\nobtained, virtual currencies (either free or purchased) cannot be redeemed for cash nor exchanged for anything other than game play within our games. playGAMES generate\nadditional revenue in the casual space from the receipt of advertising revenue. Players who install our casual games receive free, unlimited gameplay that requires viewing of\nperiodic in-game advertisements.\nplayAWARDS: This segment consists of all of our loyalty assets globally in which we are developing an end-to-end loyalty solutions to help clients reward, enrich,\nmotivate and retain customers, including program design, points management and administration, and broad-based fulfillment and redemption across multiple channels.\n88\nThe CODM evaluates the performance of each operating segment using revenue and segment Adjusted EBITDA. Expenses include indirect costs that are allocated to\noperating segments based on a reasonable allocation methodology, which are generally related to sales and marketing activities and general and administrative overhead.\nRevenue and expenses exclude transactions between the Company's operating segments. The CODM does not evaluate operating segments using asset information.\nAdjusted EBITDA (\"AEBITDA\") is the Company’s reportable segment GAAP measure, which management utilizes as the primary profit measure for its reportable\nsegments and underlying operating segments. AEBITDA is a measure defined as net income (loss) before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, restructuring\nand related costs (consisting primarily of severance and other restructuring related costs), stock-based compensation expense, and other income and expense items (including\nspecial infrequent items, foreign currency gains and losses, and other non-cash items). Expenses include indirect costs that are allocated to operating segments based on a\nreasonable allocation methodology, which are generally related to sales and marketing activities, general and administrative overhead, and costs associated with administering\nthe playAWARDS myVIP program in the playGAMES applications. Revenue excludes transactions between the Company's operating segments. Certain expenses incurred by\nplayAWARDS have been allocated to playGAMES at cost.\n89\nThe following tables present the Company’s segment information:\nFor the Year Ended December 31,\n2023 2022 2021\nNet revenue\nplayGAMES $ 306,714 $ 284,476 $ 287,419\nplayAWARDS 4,172 5,833 —\nReportable segment net revenue 310,886 290,309 287,419\nCorporate and other — — —\nNet revenue $ 310,886 $ 290,309 $ 287,419\nAEBITDA\nplayGAMES $ 88,676 $ 58,999 $ 57,865\nplayAWARDS (10,379) (5,189) (8,990)\nReportable segment AEBITDA $ 78,297 $ 53,810 $ 48,875\nOther operating expense\nCorporate and other $ 16,005 $ 15,557 $ 9,329\nRestructuring expenses 8,584 13,020 3,082\nOther reconciling items(1) 214 25 7,601\nStock based compensation 18,722 17,727 4,455\nDepreciation and amortization 45,259 35,562 27,398\n$ (10,487) $ (28,081) $ (2,990)\nNon-operating income (expense)\nChange in fair value of warrant liabilities $ 2,596 $ 1,047 $ 13,933\nInterest income (expense), net 4,858 1,925 (235)\nOther income (expense), net 513 1,491 (229)\n$ 7,967 $ 4,463 $ 13,469\n(Loss) income before income taxes $ (2,520) $ (23,618) $ 10,479\nIncome tax (expense) benefit (16,873) 5,835 258\nNet (loss) income $ (19,393) $ (17,783) $ 10,737\n(1) Includes miscellaneous income and losses on the disposal of assets.

The closing of the acquisition occurred on October 12,\n2022, and Brainium became an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. The purchase price for the membership interests was $70.0 million at closing, as adjusted for\ncash, indebtedness, and working capital, and between zero and $27.3 million following the closing subject to the satisfaction of certain financial milestones for the fiscal year\nended December 31, 2022.\nThe Company recorded the excess of the fair value of the consideration transferred in the acquisition over the fair value of net assets acquired as goodwill. The\ngoodwill reflects our expectations of favorable future growth opportunities and anticipated synergies through the scale of our operations. The Company expects that\nsubstantially all of the goodwill will be deductible for federal income tax purposes.

As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the\nCompany has no remaining liability reflected in the financial statements.\nMerger with Acies Acquisition Corp.\nOn June 21, 2021 (the “Closing Date”), Acies Acquisition Corp., a Cayman Islands exempted company (prior to the Closing Date, “Acies”), consummated the\npreviously announced business combination (“Acies Merger”) with PlayStudios, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Old PLAYSTUDIOS”) pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of\nMerger, dated as of February 1, 2021 (the “Merger Agreement”), by and among Acies, Catalyst Merger Sub I, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a direct wholly owned subsidiary\nof Acies (“First Merger Sub”), Catalyst Merger Sub II, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and a direct wholly owned subsidiary of Acies (“Second Merger Sub”), and\nOld PLAYSTUDIOS.\nIn connection with the closing of the Acies Merger, Acies filed a notice of deregistration with the Cayman Islands Registrar of Companies, together with the necessary\naccompanying documents, and filed a certificate of incorporation (the “Certificate of Incorporation”) and a certificate of corporate domestication with the Secretary of State of\nthe State of Delaware, under which Acies was domesticated and continues as a Delaware corporation, changing its name to PLAYSTUDIOS, Inc. As a consequence of filing the\nCertificate of Incorporation, the Company adopted a dual class structure, comprised of the Company’s Class A common stock, which is entitled to one vote per share, and the\nCompany’s Class B common stock, which is entitled to 20 votes per share. See Note 19—Stockholders’ Equity for further discussion on the dual class structure.\nIn connection with the Acies Merger, Acies entered into subscription agreements with certain investors (\"PIPE Investors\"), whereby it issued2 5.0 million shares of\nClass A common stock at $10.00 per share (the \"PIPE Shares\") for an aggregate purchase price of $250.0 million (the \"PIPE Financing\"), which closed simultaneously with the\nconsummation of the Acies Merger. $20.0 million of the PIPE Financing was used to terminate the profit share provision of an agreement with MGM Resorts International, one\nof the PIPE Investors.\nIn connection with the Acies Merger, the Company incurred direct and incremental costs of $32.8 million related to the equity issuance, consisting primarily of\ninvestment banking and other professional fees, which were recorded to additional paid-in capital as a reduction of proceeds.\nThe Company incurred approximately $1.4 million of expenses primarily related to advisory, legal, and accounting fees in conjunction with the Acies Merger. Of this,\n$0.1 million and $1.3 million was recorded in general and administrative expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the years ended December 31, 2021 and\nDecember 31, 2020, respectively.\n92\nThe aggregate consideration for the Acies Merger was approximately $1,041.0 million, payable in the form of the Company's Class A and Class B common stock and\ncash. The following table summarizes the merger consideration (in thousands, except per share information):\nConsideration\nCash consideration $ 102,020\nShares transferred at closing(1) 86,838\nValue per share $ 10.00\nShare consideration $ 868,380\nTotal consideration $ 970,400\nShares of common stock underlying vested options 7,060\nValue per share $ 10.00\nTotal consideration for vested options 70,600\nAggregate consideration $ 1,041,000\n(1) Excludes shares of common stock underlying stock options that are vested but unexercised as of the closing date of the Acies Merger. Since the shares do not represent\nlegally outstanding shares of common stock at closing, they are excluded from the total consideration amount.\nThe following table reconciles the elements of the Acies Merger to the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the year ended December 31, 2021:\nCash - Acies Trust and cash (net of redemptions) $ 101,965\nCash - PIPE 230,000\nLess: Cash consideration (102,020)\nLess: Transaction costs, net of proceeds received from exercises of Old PLAYSTUDIOS' warrants (44,775)\nNet Acies Merger and PIPE Financing $ 185,170\nThe Acies Merger was accounted for as a reverse recapitalization and Acies was treated as the “acquired” company for accounting purposes. The Acies Merger was\naccounted as the equivalent of Old PLAYSTUDIOS issuing stock for the net assets of Acies, accompanied by a recapitalization. Accordingly, all historical financial\ninformation presented in these consolidated financial statements represents the accounts of Old PLAYSTUDIOS “as if” Old PLAYSTUDIOS is the predecessor to the\nCompany. The common stock and net income per share, prior to the Acies Merger, have been adjusted to share amounts reflecting the recapitalization exchange ratio of\napproximately 0.233 for Old PLAYSTUDIOS common stock.\nNOTE 5—RELATED-PARTY TRANSACTIONS\nThe following table is a summary of balance sheet assets and liabilities from related parties:\nDecember 31, December 31,\n2023 2022 Financial Statement Line Item\nMarketing Agreement $ 1,000 $ 1,000 Intangibles, net\nThe Company did not have material revenues recognized from related parties during the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021.\nIn connection with the Acies Merger and in accordance with the Merger Agreement, during the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company paid $2.5 million to\nPLAYSTUDIOS Impact Fund, formerly myCause Charitable Foundation (\"myCause\"), a 501(c)(3) foundation established and administered by certain members of management\nof the Company.\nThe Company’s remaining expenses recognized from related parties were immaterial during the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021.\n93\nMGM Resorts International (“MGM”)\nMGM is a stockholder and MGM's Chief Commercial Officer also serves on the Company’s Board of Directors. MGM owned approximately 16.6 million shares of the\nCompany's outstanding Class A common stock as of each of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022.\nMarketing Agreement\nIn April 2011, the Company entered into a joint marketing agreement with MGM (as amended, the “Marketing Agreement”) in exchange for assistance with marketing\ncampaigns and the exclusive right to utilize MGM’s licensed marks and licensed copyrights for the development of certain of the Company’s social casino games. The initial\nterm was for one year from the go-live date of the first such game in July 2012, with an automatic renewal provision for successivet wo-year terms based on our games meeting\ncertain performance criteria. If our games do not achieve the specified performance criteria, the term will be automatically renewed for a one-year period and the right to utilize\nMGM’s licensed marks and copyrights will become non-exclusive. The non-exclusive term will be automatically renewed for successive one-year periods so long as our games\nmeet certain other performance criteria. As consideration for the use of MGM’s intellectual property, the Company issued 19.2 million shares of its common stock representing\n10% of its then-outstanding common stock; and in lieu of royalty payments, the Company agreed to pay MGM a profit share of: (i) during the exclusive term, a mid- to high-\nsingle digit percentage of cumulative net operating income, as defined in the Marketing Agreement, and (ii) during the non-exclusive term, a low- to mid-single digit percentage\nof cumulative net operating income. As further described in Note 11—Goodwill, the Marketing Agreement was recorded as an indefinite-lived intangible asset.\nOn October 30, 2020, the Company and MGM agreed to amend the Marketing Agreement (the “MGM Amendment”), under which the Company and MGM agreed to\nterminate the profit share provision. In exchange, the Company agreed to remit to MGM a one-time payment of $20.0 million, payable on the earliest to occur of (i) the PIPE\nFinancing, (ii) the date that the Company waives MGM’s commitment to participate in the PIPE Financing, or (iii) two years from the date of the MGM Amendment. In\naddition, MGM agreed to reinvest in the Company at a minimum amount of $20.0 million by participating in the PIPE Financing or a private placement of equity offering to\nthird party investors for minimum gross proceeds to the Company of $50.0 million. As a result of the termination, the Company is no longer obligated to make profit share\npayments, but the other rights and obligations under the Marketing Agreement continue in full force and effect. The Company recorded zero, zero, and $0.3 million as profit\nshare expense during the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively.\nOn June 21, 2021, the Company consummated the Acies Merger and MGM participated in the PIPE Financing. In connection with the PIPE Financing, the Company\nrecorded an equity contribution from MGM as a settlement of the $20.0 million liability. As of December 31, 2021, the $20.0 million liability was settled in full and no amount\nremained outstanding.\nNOTE 6—RECEIVABLES\nReceivables consist of the following:\nDecember 31, December 31,\n2023 2022\nTrade receivables $ 29,952 $ 25,020\nOther receivables 690 1,996\nAllowance for uncollectible amounts (177) —\nTotal receivables, net $ 30,465 $ 27,016\nTrade receivables represent amounts due to the Company from social and mobile platform operators, including Apple, Google, Amazon, and Facebook.

As a result, beginning in the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company reports operating results based on two reportable segments, playGAMES and playAWARDS.\nThis change also resulted in a change in reporting units to coincide with the new operating segments. Given the change in reporting units, the Company performed a relative fair\nvalue calculation to allocate historical goodwill of $47.1 million between the two new reporting units, with all of the goodwill allocated to playGAMES. The Company also\nperformed a qualitative impairment test immediately before and after the change in reporting units and determined that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the\nreporting units is less than their carrying amounts, including goodwill. Accordingly, the Company concluded that the goodwill relating to those reporting units was not\nimpaired.\nThe following table provides the changes in the carrying amount of goodwill allocated to the playGAMES segment for the years ended December 31, 2023 and\nDecember 31, 2022:\nAccumulated\nGoodwill, Gross Impairment Goodwill, Net\nBalance as of December 31, 2021 $ 5,059 $ — $ 5,059\nAdditions from acquisitions 42,074 — 42,074\nMeasurement period adjustments — — —\nBalance as of December 31, 2022 47,133 — 47,133\nAdditions from acquisitions — — —\nMeasurement period adjustments — — —\nBalance as of December 31, 2023 $ 47,133 $ — $ 47,133\nNOTE 12—WARRANT LIABILITIES\nPublic Warrants and Private Warrants\nUpon the closing of the Acies Merger, there were approximately 7.2 million publicly-traded redeemable warrants to purchase shares of Class A common stock (the \"Public\nWarrants\") and 3.8 million redeemable warrants to purchase shares of Class A common stock initially issued to the Sponsor in a private placement (the \"Private Warrants\") by\nAcies. Each whole Public Warrant entitles the registered holder to purchase one whole share of the Company’s Class A common stock at a price of $11.50 in cash per share,\nsubject to adjustment as discussed below, as of October 27, 2021. Pursuant to the Warrant Agreement, a holder of Public Warrants may exercise the Public Warrants only for a\nwhole number of shares of Class A common stock. The Public Warrants will expire 5 years after the completion of the Acies Merger, or earlier upon redemption or liquidation.\nThe Private Warrants are identical to the Public Warrants, except that the Private Warrants and the shares of Class A common stock issuable upon exercise of the Private\nWarrants were not transferable until after the completion of the Acies Merger, subject to certain limited exceptions. Additionally, the Private Warrants are non-redeemable so\nlong as they are held by the initial holder or any of its permitted transferees. If the Private Warrants are held by someone other than the initial holder or its permitted transferees,\nthe Private Warrants will be redeemable by the Company and exercisable by such holders on the same basis as the Public Warrants. The Private Warrants may be exercised on a\ncashless basis so long as held by the Sponsor or certain permitted transferees.\nThe Company may redeem the outstanding Public Warrants in whole, but not in part, at a price of $0.01 per Public Warrant upon a minimum of 30 days’ prior written\nnotice of redemption, if and only if the last sale price of the Company’s Class A common stock equals or exceeds $18.00 per share for any 20-trading days within a 30-trading\nday period ending three business days before the Company sends the notice of redemption to the holders of the Public Warrants. If the Company calls the Public Warrants for\nredemption, management will have the option to require all holders that wish to exercise the Public Warrants to do so on a cashless basis. In no event will the Company be\nrequired to net cash settle the exercise of Public Warrants.\nOn April 1, 2022, the Company commenced (i) an offer to each holder of its outstanding Public Warrants and Private Warrants (collectively, the “Warrants”) the\nopportunity to receive $1.00 in cash, without interest, for each outstanding Warrant tendered by the holder pursuant to the offer (the “Offer to Purchase”), and (ii) the solicitation\nof consents (the “Consent Solicitation”) from holders of the outstanding Warrants to amend the Warrant Agreement, dated as of October 22, 2020, by and between the\nCompany (formerly Acies Acquisition Corp.) and Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, which governs all of the Warrants (the “Warrant Amendment”) (collectively\nthe \"Tender Offer\").\n98\nThe Tender Offer expired midnight, Eastern Time, at the end of the day on May 13, 2022 (the “Expiration Date”), in accordance with its terms. Broadridge Corporate\nIssuer Solutions, Inc., the depositary for the Tender Offer, indicated that as of the Expiration Date, (i) 1,792,463 outstanding Public Warrants, or approximately 25% of the\noutstanding Public Warrants were validly tendered in and not withdrawn from the Offer to Purchase, and (ii) none of the outstanding Private Warrants were validly tendered in\nand not withdrawn from the Offer to Purchase. The Warrant Amendment was not approved.\nThe Company paid $1.8 million for all Public Warrants tendered by the holders pursuant to the Offer to Purchase and $1.1 million of fees, expenses, and other related\namounts incurred in connection with the Tender Offer.\nAt December 31, 2023, there were approximately 5.4 million Public Warrants and 3.8 million Private Warrants outstanding.

A significant piece of objective negative evidence evaluated was the cumulative loss the Company expects to enter within the next three months. Such\nobjective evidence limits the ability to consider other subjective evidence, such as our projections for future growth. On the basis of this evaluation, as of December 31, 2023, a\nvaluation allowance of $18.3 million has been recorded to recognize only the portion of the deferred tax asset that is more likely than not to be realized. The amount of the\ndeferred tax asset considered realizable, however, could be adjusted if estimates of future taxable income during the carryforward period are reduced or increased, or if objective\nnegative evidence in the form of cumulative losses is no longer present and additional weight is given to subjective evidence such as our projections for growth.\n103\nThe following is a tabular reconciliation of the total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits:\nYears Ended December 31,\n2023 2022 2021\nBalance at beginning of period $ 533 $ 637 $ —\nIncreases for tax positions of prior years 75 313 609\nIncreases for tax positions of current year — — 148\nDecreases for tax positions of prior years — — —\nSettlements — (183) (120)\nDecreases for lapses in statute of limitations (261) $ (234) $ —\nBalance at end of period $ 347 $ 533 $ 637\nThe Company has analyzed filing positions in all of the federal, state, and foreign jurisdictions where it is required to file income tax returns and for all open tax years. As\nof December 31, 2023, the Company recorded approximately $0.3 million of unrecognized tax benefits, all of which would impact the effective tax rate, if recognized. The\nCompany does not anticipate that its unrecognized tax benefits will materially change within the next 12 months. The Company’s policy for recording interest and penalties\nassociated with audits and unrecognized tax benefits is to record such items as a component of income tax expense. As of December 31, 2023, income tax expense includes an\naccrual of $0.1 million for the payment of interest and penalties associated with unrecognized tax benefits.\nThe Company is subject to taxation in the U.S. and various states and foreign jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is subject to examination for both U.S.\nfederal and state tax returns for the years 2020 to present. In late 2019, the Company was notified by the Israel Tax Authority that the Company’s Israel tax returns for the tax\nyears ended December 31, 2016 through 2018 were under examination. In 2023, the company settled this examination with the Israel Tax Authority closing tax years 2016\nthrough 2021. Therefore, only tax years starting from 2022 remain open to examination under the statute of limitations by the Israel Tax Authority for Israel. The tax years\nstarting from 2020 remain open to examination by the Hong Kong Inland Revenue Department for Asia. For the remaining jurisdictions, the Company is subject to examination\nby tax authorities from the date the Company started operations in the respective foreign jurisdiction to present.\nNOTE 18—COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\nMinimum Guarantee Liability\nThe following are the Company’s total minimum guaranteed obligations:\nYears Ended December 31,\n2023 2022\nMinimum guarantee liability-current $ 7,760 $ 1,500\nMinimum guarantee liability-noncurrent 24,000 1,500\nTotal minimum guarantee obligations $ 31,760 $ 3,000\nWeighted-average remaining term (in years) 2.6 2.0\n104\nThe following are the Company’s remaining expected future payments of minimum guarantee obligations as of December 31, 2023:\nMinimum Guarantee\nYear Ending December 31, Obligations\n2024 $ 7,760\n2025 6,000\n2026 6,000\n2027 6,000\n2028 6,000\nTotal $ 31,760\nN3TWORK, Inc.\nOn November 22, 2021, the Company entered into agreements with N3TWORK Inc. and The Tetris Company, LLC pursuant to which the Company acquired the rights to\ndevelop and operate Tetris®-branded mobile games for an initial term through August 2024.

On a case-by-case basis, the Company engages inside and outside counsel to assess\nthe probability of potential liability resulting from such litigation. After making such assessments, the Company makes an accrual for the estimated loss only when the loss is\nreasonably probable and an amount can be reasonably estimated. The Company does not expect the outcome of any pending litigation to have a material effect on the\nCompany’s Consolidated Balance Sheets, Consolidated Statements of Operations, or Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\nOn March 2, 2021, a lawsuit was filed in the Superior Court of California, Los Angeles County, by a purported Acies shareholder in connection with the Acies Merger:\nMcCart v. Acies Acquisition Corp., et al. (Sup. Ct. L.A. County) (the “McCart Complaint”). The McCart Complaint names Acies and members of Acies’ board of directors as\ndefendants. The McCart Complaint alleges breaches of fiduciary duties against members of Acies’ board of directors and aiding and abetting the board of directors’ alleged\nbreaches of fiduciary duties against Acies. The McCart Complaint also alleges that the registration statement for the Acies Merger was materially deficient and omitted and/or\nmisrepresented material information including, among other things, certain financial information, certain details regarding Acies’ financial advisors, and other information\nrelating to the background of the Acies Merger. The McCart Complaint generally sought to recover damages related to the Acies Merger. The lawsuit was voluntarily dismissed\nby the plaintiff on August 6, 2021.\nAnother purported Acies shareholder sent a demand letter on February 19, 2021, making similar allegations as those made in the McCart Complaint and demanding\nadditional disclosure regarding the Acies Merger. We have not received any further correspondence from such shareholder.\nWe are a party to a pending litigation matter brought by TeamSava d.o.o. Beograd, or TeamSava, and other related parties. The plaintiffs filed a Statement of Claim in\nMay 2021 in Tel Aviv District Court in Israel, alleging claims, among other things, that we breached the terms of a commercial contract relating to services provided by\nTeamSava and related parties in connection with the sourcing and administrative management of personnel in Serbia who provided game development services exclusively for\nus. The pending litigation seeks damages of 27.3 million New Israeli Shekels (NIS) (or\n105\napproximately $7.5 million based on prevailing exchange rates as of December 31, 2023). On November 30, 2023, we entered into a settlement agreement to resolve and settle\nall claims brought by the plaintiffs against the Company, its Israeli subsidiary and its employees and former employees, and all claims brought by the Company's affiliates\nagainst the plaintiffs. The settlement is contingent upon the confirmation by the respective courts in Israel and Serbia that all related lawsuits have been dismissed. The\nCompany expects to finalize the settlement before June 30, 2024, but cannot make any assurances that it will be completed by the date, or that one or more of the parties\nwithdraw from the settlement.\nOn April 6, 2022, a class action lawsuit was filed in the United States District Court, Northern District of California, by a purported Company shareholder in\nconnection with alleged federal securities law violations: Christian A. Felipe et. al. v. PLAYSTUDIOS, Inc. (the “Felipe Complaint”). On July 15, 2022, the Felipe Complaint\nwas transferred to the United States District Court for the District of Nevada, Southern Division. On October 4, 2022, the plaintiffs filed an amendment to the Felipe Complaint.\nThe Felipe Complaint names the Company, several current and former board members of the Company, board members and officers of Acies Acquisition Corp., and Andrew\nPascal, the Company’s Chairman and CEO, as defendants. The Felipe Complaint alleges misrepresentations and omissions regarding the state of the Company’s development of\nthe Kingdom Boss game and its financial projections and future prospects in the S-4 Registration Statement filed by Acies that was declared effective on May 25, 2021, the\nProxy Statement filed by Acies on May 25, 2021, and other public statements that touted Old PLAYSTUDIOS’ and the Company’s financial performance and operations,\nincluding statements made on earnings calls and the Amended S-1 Registration Statement filed by the Company that was declared effective on July 30, 2021. The Felipe\nComplaint alleges that the misrepresentations and omissions resulted in stock price drops of 13% on August 12, 2021, and 5% on February 25, 2022, following (i) the\nCompany’s release of financial results for the second quarter of 2021, ended on June 30, 2021, and (ii) the filing of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year\nended December 31, 2021 and issuance of a press release summarizing financial results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2021, respectively. The Felipe\nComplaint seeks an award of damages for an unspecified amount. The Company believes that the claims are without merit and the Company intends to vigorously defend\nagainst them; however, there can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in the defense of this litigation. The Company is not able to reasonably estimate the\nprobability or amount of loss and therefore has not made any accruals.\nOn March 8, 2023, Angel Deann Pilati, a purported adult resident citizen of Franklin County, Alabama, filed a civil lawsuit against PLAYSTUDIOS US, LLC in the\nCircuit Court of Franklin County Alabama, alleging that PLAYSTUDIOS US, LLC makes available online games and applications across multiple platforms that are games of\nchance and thus illegal gambling under Alabama law and seeking to recover, under Alabama’s loss recovery act, all sums paid by Alabama residents to PLAYSTUDIOS US,\nLLC in its online gambling games during the period beginning one year before the filing of the complaint until the case is resolved. On August 23, 2023, the plaintiff amended\nthe complaint to exclude recovery for Alabama residents who lost $75,000 or more during the statute of limitations period. The plaintiff claims to seek this recovery \"to go to\nthe benefit of the families\" of players who paid money to play the games. The Company believes the claims are without merit and intends to vigorously defend against them;\nhowever, there can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in the defense of this litigation. The Company is not able to reasonably estimate the probability or\namount of loss relating to this litigation and therefore has not made any accruals.\nOn November 13, 2023, Sandra Tucker Duckworth, a purported citizen of Tennessee, filed a civil lawsuit against PLAYSTUDIOS US, LLC in the Circuit Court for\nthe 14th Judicial District of Tennessee alleging that PLAYSTUDIOS US, LLC makes available online games of chance that constitute illegal gambling under Tennessee law\nand seeking to recover, under Tennessee's loss recovery act, all sums paid by Tennessee residents to PLAYSTUDIOS US, LLC in its online gambling games during the period\nbeginning one year before the filing of the lawsuit until the case is resolved, excluding recovery of money lost by a Tennessee resident who lost $75,000 or more during the\nstatute of limitations period. The plaintiff claims to seek this recovery for the benefit of each individual player's spouse, or if not spouse, child or children, and if not child or\nchildren, the next of kin. The Company believes the claims are without merit and intends to vigorously defend against them; however, there can be no assurance that the\nCompany will be successful in the defense of this litigation. The Company is not able to reasonably estimate the probability or amount of loss relating to this litigation and\ntherefore has not made any accruals.\nOn February 20, 2024, Tyler Kuhk, a purported citizen of Washington, filed a class action lawsuit against PLAYSTUDIOS US, LLC in the Superior Court of the State\nof Washington for the County of King, alleging that PLAYSTUDIOS US, LLC makes available online games of chance that constitute illegal gambling under Washington law,\nthat PLAYSTUDIOS US, LLC engaged in unfair and deceptive practices by advertising to and soliciting the general public in Washington state to play its unlawful online\ncasino games of chance, and that PLAYSTUDIOS US, LLC was unjustly enriched by this conduct. The plaintiff seeks to recover all sums paid by Washington residents to\nPLAYSTUDIOS US, LLC in its online gambling games during an unspecified period of time under Washington’s “Recovery of money lost gambling” statute, for treble\ndamages under Washington’s Consumer Protection Act, and for disgorgement and restitution of any money\n106\nPLAYSTUDIOS US, LLC has retained through unlawful and/or wrongful conduct alleged in the lawsuit. The Company believes the claims are without merit and intends to\nvigorously defend against them; however, there can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in the defense of this litigation. The Company is not able to reasonably\nestimate the probability or amount of loss relating to this litigation and therefore has not made any accruals.\nThe Company received four demands for arbitration during 2023 claiming that the games operated by PLAYSTUDIOS US, LLC constitute illegal gambling under the\nlaws of various states. These demands generally attempt to recover amounts spent by third parties on the Company’s games by relying on state gambling loss recovery statutes\nand/or by seeking to have the applicable Terms of Service declared invalid. The Company believes that the claims are without merit and the Company intends to vigorously\ndefend against them; however, there can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in the defense of this litigation. The Company is not able to reasonably estimate\nthe probability or amount of loss and therefore has not made any accruals.\nNOTE 19—STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY\nThe Consolidated Statements of Stockholders’ Equity reflect the reverse recapitalization as discussed in Note 4—Business Combinations as of June 21, 2021. As Old\nPLAYSTUDIOS was deemed the accounting acquirer in the reverse recapitalization with Acies, all periods prior to the consummation date reflect the balances and activity of\nOld PLAYSTUDIOS. The consolidated balances and the audited consolidated financial statements of Old PLAYSTUDIOS, as of December 31, 2020, and the share activity and\nper share amounts in these Consolidated Statements of Stockholders' Equity were retroactively adjusted, where applicable, using the recapitalization exchange ratio of 0.233 for\nOld PLAYSTUDIOS common stock. Old PLAYSTUDIOS Series A Preferred Stock, Old PLAYSTUDIOS Series B Preferred Stock, Old PLAYSTUDIOS Series C-1\nPreferred Stock, and Old PLAYSTUDIOS Series C Preferred Stock were deemed converted into shares of Old PLAYSTUDIOS common stock at a share conversion factor of\n1.0 as a result of the reverse recapitalization. Old PLAYSTUDIOS warrants to purchase preferred stock were deemed exercised and the underlying shares converted based on\nthe respective preferred stock conversion ratio. See Note 4—Business Combinations for further discussion.\nCommon Stock\nSubject to the prior rights of the holders of any preferred stock, the holders of common stock are entitled to receive dividends out of the funds legally available at the times\nand in the amounts determined by the Company's Board of Directors. Each holder of Class A common stock is entitled to one vote for each share of Class A common stock held\nand each holder of Class B common stock is entitled to twenty votes for each share of Class B common stock held. After the full preferential amounts due to preferred\nstockholders have been paid or set aside, the remaining assets of the Company available for distribution to its stockholders, if any, are distributed to the holders of common\nstock ratably in proportion to the number of shares of common stock then held by each such holder. None of the Company’s common stock is entitled to preemptive rights or\nsubject to redemption. With the exception of the conversion of the Class B common stock into Class A common stock as described below, the Company’s common stock is not\nconvertible into any other shares of the Company’s capital stock.\nThe shares of Class B common stock are subject to a “sunset” provision that would be triggered if any member of the Founder Group transfers shares of Class B common\nstock outside the Founder Group (except for certain permitted transfers). In the event of such non-permitted transfers, any share transferred will automatically convert into\nshares of Class A common stock. In addition, the outstanding shares of Class B common stock will be subject to a “sunset” provision by which all outstanding shares of Class B\ncommon stock will automatically convert into shares of Class A common stock (i) if holders representing a majority of the Class B common stock vote to convert the Class B\ncommon stock into Class A common stock, (ii) if the Founder Group and its permitted transferees collectively no longer beneficially own at least 20% of the number of shares\nof Class B common stock collectively held by the Founder Group as of the closing of the Acies Merger, or (iii) on the nine-month anniversary of the Founder’s death or\ndisability, unless such date is extended by a majority of independent directors of the Company.\n107\nAccumulated Other Comprehensive (Loss) Income\nThe following tables show a summary of changes in accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income:\nCurrency\nForeign Currency Derivative Translation Total Accumulated Other\nContracts Adjustment Comprehensive (Loss) Income\nBalance as of December 31, 2022 $ — $ (151) $ (151)\nNet gains recognized in other comprehensive income before reclassifications 286 — 286\nForeign currency translation — (11) (11)\nBalance as of December 31, 2023 $ 286 $ (162) $ 124\nCurrency\nTranslation Total Accumulated Other\nAdjustment Comprehensive Income (Loss)\nBalance as of December 31, 2021 $ 393 $ 393\nForeign currency translation (544) (544)\nBalance as of December 31, 2022 $ (151) $ (151)\nForeign Currency Derivative Contracts\nAt December 31, 2023, the Company had outstanding foreign currency derivative contracts to purchase certain foreign currencies at future dates. The amount of future\noperating expenses the Company had hedged was approximately $2.5 million, and all contracts are expected to mature during the upcoming 12 months. The aggregate fair value\nof the Company’s derivative contracts was a net asset of $0.3 million as of December 31, 2023 and was recorded in \"Prepaid expenses and other current assets\" in the\naccompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company did not have any derivative contracts as of December 31, 2022. Subsequent to December 31, 2023, the Company\nentered into additional foreign currency derivative contracts of $30.4 million related to hedged future operating expenses.\nStock Repurchase Program\nOn November 10, 2021, the Company’s Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program authorizing the Company to purchase up to $50.0 million of the\nCompany’s Class A common stock over a period of 12 months. On November 2, 2022, the Company’s Board of Directors approved an extension of the time period for\nrepurchases under the stock repurchase program for an additional 12 months from November 10, 2022 to November 10, 2023. On November 1, 2023, the Company's Board of\nDirectors extended the stock repurchase program through November 10, 2024 and increased the remaining amount authorized to $50.0 million. Subject to applicable rules and\nregulations, the shares may be purchased from time to time in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. Such purchases will be at times and in amounts as the\nCompany deems appropriate, based on factors such as market conditions, legal requirements, and other business considerations.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company has acquired 4.7 million shares of its Class A common stock under this program at an aggregate value of $20.0 million and an\naverage of $4.23 per share. Repurchased shares were held in treasury. The remaining availability under the stock repurchase program was $50.0 million as of December 31,\n2023.\nNOTE 20—STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION\n2011 and 2021 Equity Incentive Plans\nThe Company has two equity incentive plans: Old PLAYSTUDIOS' 2011 Omnibus Stock and Incentive Plan (the “2011 Plan”) and the 2021 Equity Incentive Plan (the\n“2021 Plan”). The 2021 Plan provides for the grant of non-qualified stock options, incentive stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units and\nother stock awards, and performance awards to employees, officers, non-employee directors and independent service providers of the Company.\n108\nThe 2021 Plan became effective immediately upon the closing of the Acies Merger and replaced the 2011 Plan. No additional awards will be available for future issuance under\nthe 2011 Plan.\nEach Old PLAYSTUDIOS stock option from the 2011 Plan that was outstanding immediately prior to the Acies Merger and held by current employees or service\nproviders, whether vested or unvested, was converted into an option to purchase 0.233 shares of Class A common stock (each such option, an “Exchanged Option”). Except as\nspecifically provided in the Merger Agreement, following the Acies Merger, each Exchanged Option continues to be governed by the same terms and conditions (including\nvesting and exercisability terms) as were applicable to the corresponding former Old PLAYSTUDIOS option immediately prior to the consummation of the Acies Merger. All\nequity awards activity was retroactively restated to reflect the Exchanged Options.\nThe number of shares of Class A common stock available under the 2021 Plan will increase annually on the first day of each calendar year, beginning with the calendar\nyear ended December 31, 2022, with such annual increase equal to the lesser of (i) 5% of the number of shares of common stock issued and outstanding on the last business day\nof the immediately preceding fiscal year and (ii) an amount determined by the Company's Board of Directors. If any award (or any award under the 2011 Plan) is forfeited,\ncancelled, expires, terminates or otherwise lapses or is settled in cash, in whole or in part, without the delivery of Class A common stock or Class B common stock, then the\nshares (including both the Class A common stock and Class B common stock) covered by such forfeited, expired, terminated or lapsed award shall again be available as shares\nfor grant under the 2021 Plan.\nAs of December 31, 2023, a total of 30.8 million shares of the Company’s Class A common stock had been allocated to awards granted under the 2021 Plan and1 3.9\nmillion of those shares remained available for future grants.\nStock-Based Compensation\nIn connection with the Domestication and the closing of the Acies Merger, the Founder Group beneficially owned 16.1 million shares of Class B common stock, resulting\nin 74.6% of voting power of the Company. In addition, on the Closing Date of the Acies Merger, the Founder Group was the beneficial owner of2 .2 million fully vested options\nunderlying shares of Class B common stock, which accounted for all of Mr. Pascal's outstanding options on the Closing Date of the Acies Merger. As a result of the Acies\nMerger, the Founder Group has a controlling interest in the Company. As the Founder Group did not have control of Old PLAYSTUDIOS immediately prior to the Acies\nMerger, and as Mr. Pascal is an employee of the Company, the incremental value resulting from the super vote premium is accounted for as incremental compensation costs.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company incurred $1.1 million of additional compensation expense related to the Founder Group's beneficial ownership interest\nin Class B common stock and the underlying vested options as of the Closing Date.\nThe following table summarizes stock-based compensation expense that the Company recorded in (loss) income from operations for the periods shown:\nYears Ended December 31,\n2023 2022 2021\nSelling and marketing $ 621 $ 813 $ 72\nGeneral and administrative 9,236 8,547 1,704\nResearch and development 8,865 8,367 2,679\nStock-based compensation expense $ 18,722 $ 17,727 $ 4,455\nCapitalized stock-based compensation $ 1,800 $ 2,530 $ 657\nStock Options\nAll of the options granted under the 2011 Plan have time-based vesting periods vesting over a period of three to four years and a maximum term of 10 years from the grant\ndate.\nThe following is a summary of stock option activity for time-based options for the year ended December 31, 2023 (in thousands, except weighted-average exercise price\nand remaining term):\n109\nNo. of Weighted-Average Weighted-Average Aggregate\nOptions Exercise Price Remaining Term (in Years) Intrinsic Value\nOutstanding - December 31, 2022 9,222 $ 1.11\nGranted — —\nExercised (3,672) 0.85\nForfeited (79) 1.89\nExpired (76) 1.63\nOutstanding - December 31, 2023 5,395 1.27 4.1 $ 8,339\nUnvested - December 31, 2023 107 2.67 6.7 136\nExercisable - December 31, 2023 5,288 1.25 4.0 8,203\nAs of December 31, 2023, there were 5.4 million options outstanding, of which 3.5 million options are issuable into Class A common stock and1 .9 million options are\nissuable into Class B common stock. As of December 31, 2023, there was approximately $0.4 million of total unrecognized compensation expense related to stock options to\nemployees. As of December 31, 2023, this cost is expected to be recognized over a remaining average period of 0.7 years. The total intrinsic value of stock options exercised\nunder the provisions of the 2011 Plan during the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, was $12.3 million, $20.0 million, and $17.6 million, respectively.\nRestricted Stock Units (\"RSUs\")\nRSUs are typically granted using a three or four year vesting schedule, either vesting pro rata annually or a cliff vest over the requisite service period, subject to\ncontinued employment. Except as provided in an award agreement between the Company and the employee, if an employee is terminated (voluntarily or involuntarily), any\nunvested awards as of the date of termination will be forfeited. RSUs settle for outstanding shares of the Company’s Class A common stock upon vesting, net of shares withheld\nfor taxes.\nThe following is a summary of RSU activity for the year ended December 31, 2023 (in thousands, except weighted-average grant date fair value):\nNo. of Weighted-Average Grant Total Fair Value of Shares\nRSUs Date Fair Value Vested\nOutstanding - December 31, 2022 11,521 $ 4.28\nGranted 4,704 3.87\nVested (3,239) 4.26 $ 13,788\nForfeited (1,284) 4.12\nOutstanding - December 31, 2023 11,702 $ 4.15\nAs of December 31, 2023, there was approximately $34.7 million of total unrecognized compensation expense related to RSUs granted to employees and other service\nproviders and this cost is expected to be recognized over a remaining average period of 2.5 years. The total intrinsic value of RSUs vested during the years ended December 31,\n2023, 2022, and 2021, was $12.4 million, $9.0 million, and $0.0 million, respectively.\n110\nNOTE 21—NET (LOSS) INCOME PER SHARE\nBasic net (loss) income per share is computed by dividing net (loss) income attributable to Class A and Class B common stockholders by the weighted-average number of\nshares of each respective class of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted net (loss) income per share is computed by dividing net (loss) income attributable to\nClass A and Class B common stockholders by the weighted-average number of each respective class of common stock outstanding, including the potential dilutive securities.\nFor the calculation of diluted net (loss) income per share, net income attributable to Class A and Class B common stockholders is adjusted to reflect the potential effect of\ndilutive securities.\nAs result of the reverse recapitalization, the Company has retroactively adjusted the weighted average shares outstanding prior to the Acies Merger to give effect to the\nExchange Ratio used to determine the number of shares of common stock into which they were converted.\nThe following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted net (loss) income attributable to Class A and Class B common stockholders per share (in thousands\nexcept per share data):\nYears Ended December 31,\n2023 2022 2021\nClass A Class B Class A Class B Class A Class B\nNumerator\nNet (loss) income attributable to common stockholders –\nbasic $ (16,992) $ (2,401) $ (15,535) $ (2,248) $ 9,182 $ 1,555\nPotential dilutive effect of derivative instruments — — — — 4 (4)\nNet (loss) income attributable to common stockholders –\ndiluted $ (16,992) $ (2,401) $ (15,535) $ (2,248) $ 9,186 $ 1,551\nDenominator\nWeighted average shares of common stock outstanding -\nbasic 116,520 16,458 112,133 16,220 95,588 16,130\nPotential dilutive effect of stock options — — — — 11,229 1,951\nPotential dilutive effect of restricted stock units — — — — — —\nWeighted average shares of common stock outstanding -\ndilutive 116,520 16,458 112,133 16,220 106,817 18,081\nNet (loss) income attributable to common stockholders\nper share\nBasic $ (0.15) $ (0.15) $ (0.14) $ (0.14) $ 0.10 $ 0.10\nDiluted $ (0.15) $ (0.15) $ (0.14) $ (0.14) $ 0.09 $ 0.09\nFor the periods presented above, the net (loss) income per share amounts are the same for Class A and Class B common stock because the holders of each class are entitled\nto equal per share dividends or distributions in liquidation in accordance with the Certificate of Incorporation. The undistributed (losses) earnings for each period\n111\nare allocated based on the contractual participation rights of the Class A and Class B common stock as if the (losses) earnings for the period had been distributed. As the\nliquidation and dividend rights are identical, the undistributed (losses) earnings are allocated on a proportionate basis.\nThe following equity awards outstanding at the end of each period presented have been excluded from the computation of diluted net (loss) income per share of common\nstock for the periods presented due to their anti-dilutive effect:\nDecember 31, 2023 December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021\nStock options 5,394 9,222 —\nRestricted stock units 11,702 11,521 —\nPublic Warrants 5,383 5,383 7,175\nPrivate Warrants 3,822 3,822 3,821\nEarnout Shares 15,000 15,000 15,000\n41,301 44,948 25,996\n112\nITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANT ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE\nNone.\nITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nAs of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our\nmanagement, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as\ndefined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act). Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information\nrequired to be disclosed in our reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in and\npursuant to the requirements of the SEC's rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to provide\nreasonable assurance that information we are required to disclose in reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management,\nincluding our principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required\ndisclosure. Based on the evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial\nOfficer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on\nForm 10-K.\nManagement's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nManagement is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the\nExchange Act. Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the\npreparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures\nthat (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; (ii) provide\nreasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures\nare being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of\nunauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of\neffectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies\nor procedures may deteriorate. Management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023. In making this assessment, we\nused the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013). Based on our\nassessment we concluded that, as of December 31, 2023, our internal control over financial reporting was effective based on those criteria.\nAn attestation of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting by our independent registered public accounting firm is not included as we are an Emerging\nGrowth Company and are exempt from the auditor attestation requirement of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by Rules 13a-15(d) and 15d-15(d) of the\nExchange Act that occurred during the three months ended December 31, 2023 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control\nover financial reporting.\nLimitations on the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nOur management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over\nfinancial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and implemented, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance\nthat the control system’s objectives will be met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must\nbe considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no\n113\nevaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues within a company are detected. The inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in\ndecision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple errors or mistakes. Controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons,\nby collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error\nor fraud may occur and may not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate\nbecause of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In light of the foregoing, our disclosure\ncontrols and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and our Chief Executive\nOfficer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that such controls and procedures are, in fact, effective at providing such\nreasonable assurance.\nITEM 9B. OTHER INFORMATION\nTrading Plans\nDuring the quarter ended December 31, 2023, no directors or officers (as defined in Rule 16a-1(f) of the Exchange Act) of the Companya dopted or terminated any “Rule\n10b5-1 trading arrangement” or “non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement,” as each term is defined in Item 408(a) of Regulation S-K.\nITEM 9C.

The Participant hereby acknowledges and agrees that the Company shall have\nthe authority to administer the Mandatory Sell to Cover arrangement in its sole discretion with a registered broker-dealer that is a member of the\nFinancial Industry Regulatory Authority (a “FINRA Dealer”) as the Company may select as the agent (the “Agent”) who will sell on the open\nmarket at the then prevailing market price(s), as soon as practicable on or after each date on which the Participant’s PSUs vest, the number\n(rounded up to the next whole number) of the Shares to be delivered to the Participant in connection with the vesting of the PSUs sufficient to\ngenerate proceeds to cover (i) the Withholding Taxes that the Participant is required to pay pursuant to the Plan and this Agreement as a result of\nthe vesting of the PSUs (or Shares being issued thereunder, as applicable) and (ii) all applicable fees and commissions due to, or required to be\ncollected by, the Agent with respect thereto, and any remaining funds shall be remitted to the Participant.\n4.3If, for any reason, such Mandatory Sell to Cover does not result in sufficient proceeds to satisfy the Withholding Taxes, the Company or the\nEmployer may, in its sole discretion, satisfy all or any portion of the Withholding Taxes relating to the Participant’s PSU by any of the following\nmeans or by a combination of such means: (i) withholding from any compensation otherwise payable to the Participant by the Company or the\nEmployer; (ii) causing the Participant to tender a cash payment (which may be in the form of a check, electronic wire transfer or other method\npermitted by the Company or the Employer); or (iii) withholding Shares from the Shares issued or otherwise issuable to the Participant in\nconnection with the Participant’s PSUs with a Fair Market Value (measured as of the date Shares are issued to Participant) equal to the amount\nof such Withholding Taxes; provided, however, that the number of such Shares so withheld will not exceed the amount necessary to satisfy the\nCompany’s and/or the Employer’s required tax withholding obligations using the maximum statutory withholding rates for federal, state, local and\nforeign tax purposes, including payroll taxes, that are applicable to supplemental taxable income; and to the\nextent necessary to qualify for an exemption from application of Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act, if applicable, such share withholding\nprocedure will be subject to the express prior approval of the Company’s Board or Compensation Committee.\n4.4Unless the tax withholding obligations of the Company and/or the Employer with respect to the Tax-Related Items are satisfied, the Company\nshall have no obligation to deliver to the Participant any Shares.\n4.5In the event the Company’s and/or the Employer’s obligation to withhold arises prior to the delivery to the Participant of Shares or it is determined\nafter the delivery of Shares to the Participant that the amount of the Tax-Related Items withholding obligation was greater than the amount\nwithheld by the Company or the Employer, the Participant agrees to indemnify and hold the Company and the Employer harmless from any\nfailure by the Company or the Employer to withhold the proper amount.\n4.6The Participant acknowledges that the Mandatory Sell to Cover is imposed by the Company on the Participant pursuant to the terms of the PSU.\n4.7The Company may withhold or account for Tax-Related Items by considering applicable minimum statutory withholding amounts, or other\napplicable withholding rates, including maximum applicable rates in the Participant’s jurisdiction(s). If the maximum rate is used, any over-\nwithheld amount may be refunded to the Participant in cash by the Company or the Employer (with no entitlement to the equivalent in Shares), or\nif not refunded, the Participant may seek a refund from the local tax authorities. The Participant must pay to the Company and/or the Employer\nany amount of Tax-Related Items that the Company and/or the Employer may be required to withhold or account for as a result of the\nParticipant’s participation in the Plan that cannot be satisfied by the means previously described.\n4.8Notwithstanding any other provision contained in the Agreement, in lieu of implementing a Mandatory Sell to Cover, the Company shall have the\nright in its discretion, but not the obligation, to collect payment of the Withholding Taxes by instead deducting from the Shares otherwise\ndeliverable to the Participant in settlement of the Award a number of whole Shares having a Fair Market Value, as determined by the Company\nas of the date on which the tax withholding obligations arise, not in excess of the amount of such Withholding Taxes, with any remainder tax\nwithholding amount less than the value of one share deducted from other cash compensation otherwise payable by the Company or the\nEmployer to the Participant, or alternatively causing the Participant to tender a cash payment (which may be in the form of a check, electronic\nwire transfer or other method permitted by the Company) (a “Net Settlement”). Any Net Settlement which is implemented by the Company in\nlieu of a Mandatory Sell to Cover shall be implemented on the same date that the Mandatory Sell to Cover would otherwise have occurred.\nAdditionally, to the extent necessary to qualify for an exemption from application of Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act, any Net Settlement will be\nsubject to the express prior approval of the Company’s Board or Compensation Committee.\n5. SETTLEMENT.\n5.1 Except as otherwise set forth in the Plan the vested PSUs will be settled in Shares and the Participant shall receive in settlement an issuance of\na number of Shares that corresponds to the number of PSUs that have become vested as of the applicable vesting date, which settlement shall\nbe delivered on the applicable vesting date; provided, however, if such vesting date falls on a date that is not a business day, such delivery date\nshall instead fall on the next following business day (the “Original Distribution Date”).\n5.2Notwithstanding the foregoing, if selling Shares in the public market on the Original Distribution Date to satisfy the Participant’s tax withholding\nobligation in accordance with the terms of Section 4 of this Agreement is prohibited for any reason, then such Shares shall not be delivered on\nsuch Original Distribution Date and shall instead be delivered to the Participant on the first date that the Participant is not prohibited from selling\nShares in the open market; provided, however, that notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event will the Shares be delivered to the Participant any\nlater than: (A) December 31 of the calendar year\nin which the Original Distribution Date occurs (that is, the last day of the taxable year in which the Original Distribution Date occurs), or (B) if and\nonly if permitted in a manner that complies with Treasury Regulations Section 1.409A-1(b)(4), no later than the date that is the 15th day of the\nthird calendar month of the applicable year following the year in which the Shares are no longer subject to a “substantial risk of forfeiture” within\nthe meaning of Treasury Regulations Section 1.409A-1(d). Delivery of the Shares is intended to comply with the requirements for the short-term\ndeferral exemption available under Treasury Regulations Section 1.409A-1(b)(4) and shall be construed and administered in such manner.\n6. DIVIDEND EQUIVALENT PAYMENTS. Until the PSUs settle, if the Company pays a dividend on Shares, the Participant will be entitled to a payment in\nthe same amount as the dividend the Participant would have received if he or she held Shares in respect of his or her vested and unvested PSUs held\nbut not previously forfeited immediately prior to the record date of the dividend (a “Dividend Equivalent”). No such Dividend Equivalents will be paid to the\nParticipant with respect to any PSU that is thereafter cancelled or forfeited prior to the applicable vesting date. The Committee will determine the form of\npayment in its sole discretion and may pay Dividend Equivalents in Shares, cash or a combination thereof. The Company will pay the Dividend\nEquivalents within forty-five (45) days of the vesting date of the PSUs to which such Dividend Equivalents relate.\n7. NONTRANSFERABILITY. No portion of the PSUs may be sold, assigned, transferred, encumbered, hypothecated, or pledged by the Participant, other\nthan to the Company as a result of forfeiture of the PSUs as provided herein, unless and until payment is made in respect of vested PSUs in accordance\nwith the provisions hereof and the Participant has become the holder of record of the vested Shares issuable hereunder, unless otherwise provided by\nthe Committee.\n8. RIGHTS AS STOCKHOLDER. The Participant will not have any rights as a stockholder in the Shares corresponding to the PSUs prior to settlement of\nthe PSUs.\n9. SECURITIES LAW COMPLIANCE. The Company may, if it determines it is appropriate, affix any legend to the stock certificates representing Shares\nissued upon settlement of the PSUs and any stock certificates that may subsequently be issued in substitution for the original certificates. The Company\nmay advise the transfer agent to place a stop order against such Shares if it determines that such an order is necessary or advisable.\n10. COMPLIANCE WITH LAW. Any sale, assignment, transfer, pledge, mortgage, encumbrance or other disposition of Shares issued upon settlement of the\nPSUs (whether directly or indirectly, whether or not for value and whether or not voluntary) must be made in compliance with any applicable constitution,\nrule, regulation or policy of any of the exchanges, associations or other institutions with which the Company has membership or other privileges, and any\napplicable law, or applicable rule or regulation of any governmental agency, self-regulatory organization or state or federal regulatory body.\n11.

The Participant agrees to take whatever additional action and execute whatever additional documents the\nCompany may deem necessary or advisable to carry out or give effect to any of the obligations or restrictions imposed on either the Participant or\nthis Award pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement.\n11.11Compliance with Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code.\n(a) The PSUs are intended to comply with Section 409A of the Code (“ Section 409A”) to the extent subject thereto and shall be interpreted\nin accordance with Section 409A and treasury regulations and other interpretive guidance issued thereunder, including without limitation\nany such regulations or other guidance that may be issued after the Grant Date. The Company reserves the right to modify the terms of\nthis Agreement, including, without limitation, the payment provisions applicable to the PSUs, to the extent necessary or advisable to\ncomply with Section 409A and reserves the right to make any changes to the PSUs so that the PSUs do not become deferred\ncompensation under Section 409A.\n(b) For purposes of this Agreement, each amount to be paid or benefit to be provided shall be construed as a separate identified payment for\npurposes of Section 409A.\n(c) Notwithstanding any provision in the Plan or this Agreement to the contrary, if the Participant is a “specified employee” and a payment\nsubject to Section 409A (and not excepted therefrom) to the Participant is due upon Termination of Service, such payment shall be\ndelayed for a period of six (6) months after the date the Participant Terminates Service (or, if earlier, the death of the Participant). Any\npayment that would otherwise have been due or owing during such six-month period will be paid immediately following the end of the\nsix-month period unless another compliant date is specified in the applicable agreement. If the PSUs include a “series of installment\npayments” (within the meaning of Treas. Reg. § 1.409A-2(b)(2)(iii)), the Participant’s right to such series of installment payments shall be\ntreated as a right\nto a series of separate payments and not as a right to a single payment, and if the PSUs include “dividend equivalents” (within the\nmeaning of Treas. Reg. § 1.409A-3(e)), the Participant’s right to such dividend equivalents shall be treated separately from the right to\nother amounts under the PSUs.\n(d) Notwithstanding any provision of the Plan or this Agreement to the contrary, in no event shall the Company or an affiliate, including the\nEmployer, be liable to the Participant on account of failure of the PSUs to (i) qualify for favorable U.S. or foreign tax treatment or (ii) avoid\nadverse tax treatment under U.S. or foreign law, including, without limitation, under Section 409A.\nExhibit 21.1\nPLAYSTUDIOS, INC.\nLIST OF SUBSIDIARIES\n(As of December 31, 2023)\nName Country (State) Percent Ownership\nPLAYSTUDIOS, Inc.

Introduction\nThe Compensation Committee (the “Committee”) and the Board of Directors (the “Board”) of PLAYSTUDIOS, Inc. (the “Company”) believe\nthat it is in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders to adopt this Mandatory Recoupment Policy (this “Policy”). This Policy is intended to\ncomply with (i) Section 954 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, as codified in Section 10D of the Exchange\nAct and implemented by Rule 10D-1 thereunder, and (ii) the listing standards of any national securities exchange on which the Company's securities are\nlisted.\n2. Definitions\nFor purposes of this Policy, the following definitions shall apply:\n“Company Group” means the Company, together with each of its direct and indirect subsidiaries.\n“Covered Person” means the persons designated as “Officers” for purposes of Section 16 of the Exchange Act, and the rules and\nregulations promulgated thereunder at any time during the Lookback Period.\n“Effective Date” means October 2, 2023.\n“Erroneously Awarded Incentive-Based Compensation” means the amount (if any), calculated on a pre-tax basis, by which (i) the\nIncentive-Based Compensation received by a Covered Person (after the Effective Date and after such individual became an “Officer” for purposes of\nSection 16 of the Exchange Act) exceeds (ii) the amount that would have been received by such Covered Person if calculated based upon the applicable\nFinancial Reporting Measures had the errors corrected by a Financial Restatement not been made. In instances where the amount of Erroneously\nAwarded Incentive-Based Compensation is not subject to mathematical recalculation directly from the information in such Financial Restatement, the\namount of Erroneously Awarded Incentive-Based Compensation shall be based on the Company’s reasonable estimate of the effect of the Financial\nRestatement on the applicable Financial Reporting Measure (documentation of which the Company shall maintain and provide to any national securities\nexchange on which the Company's securities are listed to the extent required by any applicable rules, regulations, or listing standards). In the event of\nErroneously Awarded Incentive-Based Compensation in the form of equity awards, if such equity is still held by the Covered Person at the time of\nrecoupment, the Erroneously Awarded Incentive-Based Compensation shall be the number of shares (or shares underlying the applicable award)\nreceived in excess of the number of shares that should have been received applying the restated Financial Reporting Measure, in each case calculated on\na pre-tax basis.\n“Exchange Act” means the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.\n“Financial Reporting Measure” means a measure determined and presented in accordance with the accounting principles used in\npreparing the Company’s financial statements and includes any measures derived wholly or in part from such measure, and also includes stock price and\ntotal shareholder return. For the avoidance of doubt, a financial measure need not be presented within the Company’s financial statements or included in\na filing with the SEC in order to be considered a “Financial Reporting Measure” for purposes of this Policy.\n“Financial Restatement” means an accounting restatement due to material noncompliance of the Company with any financial reporting\nrequirement under applicable securities laws, including any required restatement (i) to correct an error in previously issued financial statements that is\nmaterial to such previously issued financial statements, or (ii) that would result in a material misstatement if the error were either corrected or left\nuncorrected in the current period. For the avoidance of doubt, “Financial Restatement” does not include any accounting restatement due to retrospective\napplication of changes in accounting rules or standards, or retrospective revisions or reclassifications made to reflect a change in the structure or\noperations of the Company.\n“Incentive-Based Compensation” means any compensation granted, earned or vested based wholly or in part upon the attainment of any\nFinancial Reporting Measure including, without limitation, any such (i) cash bonus\nawarded under the Company’s annual short-term incentive plan, and (ii) equity-based award granted pursuant to the Company’s long-term incentive\nplans. Incentive-Based Compensation is deemed received by the Covered Person in the fiscal year to which the attainment of such Financial Reporting\nMeasure is attributed, even if the payment or grant of the incentive-based compensation occurs after the end of that period. For the avoidance of doubt,\nIncentive-Based Compensation does not include (A) base salary, (B) amounts paid solely at a Board or Board Committee’s discretion and which\namounts are not paid from a “bonus pool” or similar fund the aggregate amount of which is determined by the satisfaction of a Financial Reporting\nMeasure, or (C) amounts, non-equity incentive plan awards or equity awards that, in each case, are subject only to time-based vesting conditions and/or\nsatisfying one or more subjective, strategic, or operational performance measures that are not Financial Reporting Measures.\n“Lookback Period” means the three (3) completed fiscal years immediately preceding the Restatement Date.\n“Restatement Date” means (i) the date the Board, or a committee of the Board, or the officer or officers of the Company authorized to\ntake such action if Board action is not required, concludes, or reasonably should have concluded, that the Company is required to prepare a Financial\nRestatement, or (ii) the date a court, regulator, or other legally authorized body directs the Company to prepare a Financial Restatement.\n“SEC” means the United States Securities and Exchange Commission.\n3. Recoupment Due to Financial Restatement\n(a) Subject to Section 3(b) below, in the event of a Financial Restatement, the Company shall recoup from a Covered Person Erroneously\nAwarded Incentive-Based Compensation received during the Lookback Period.\n(b) The Company shall so recoup Erroneously Awarded Incentive-Based Compensation unless the committee of the Company’s independent\ndirectors responsible for executive compensation decisions, or in the absence of such a committee, a majority of the independent directors\nserving on the Board, determines such recoupment would be impracticable because:\n(i) the direct expenses paid to a third party to assist in enforcing the policy would exceed the amount of recoupment and the Company\nhas made a reasonable attempt to recoup (documentation of which the Company shall provide to any national securities exchange\non which the Company's securities are listed),\n(ii) the recoupment would violate a home country law that was adopted prior to November 28, 2022 (as determined pursuant to an\nopinion of home country counsel acceptable to, and which opinion is provided to, any national securities exchange on which the\nCompany's securities are listed), or\n(iii) recoupment would likely cause an otherwise tax-qualified retirement plan, under which benefits are broadly available to\nemployees of the Company, to fail to meet the requirements of Section 401(a)(13) or Section 411(a) of the Internal Revenue Code\nof 1986, as amended, or the regulations promulgated thereunder.\n(c) For the avoidance of doubt, any right of recoupment under Section 3(a) of this Policy is in addition to, and not in lieu of, any recoupment\nrequired by any other remedies or rights of recovery that may be available to the Company pursuant to the terms of any employment\nagreement, equity award agreement, or similar agreement and any other legal remedies available to the Company.\n4. Administration; Method of Recoupment\n(a) This Policy shall be administered by the Board or, if so delegated by the Board, the Committee or other committee of independent\ndirectors of the Board. The Board has the sole discretion to interpret the terms of this Policy and make determinations under it, and any\naction taken by the Board pursuant to this Policy shall be within the absolute discretion of the Board. Any interpretations or determinations\nmade by the\nBoard shall be final and binding on all affected individuals. It is intended that this Policy be interpreted in a manner that is consistent with\nthe requirements of Section 10D of the Exchange Act and any applicable rules or standards adopted by the SEC or any national securities\nexchange on which the Company's securities are listed.\n(b) Subject to applicable law, if the Board determines to seek recoupment pursuant to this Policy, it shall make a written demand for\nrecoupment from the Covered Person and, if such Covered Person does not reasonably promptly tender repayment in response to such\ndemand or make other arrangements for such repayment that are acceptable to the Board, and the Board determines that such Covered\nPerson is unlikely to do so, the Board may seek a court order against such Covered Person for such repayment, or seek to recoup the\namount sought in any other manner consistent with applicable law, including but not limited to cancelling prior awards, whether vested or\nunvested, or paid or unpaid, or cancelling or setting-off against planned future awards.\n(c) The Company shall not (i) indemnify any current or former Covered Person against (A) the loss of any Erroneously Awarded Incentive-\nBased Compensation that is repaid, returned, or recovered pursuant to the terms of this Policy, or (B) any claims relating to the Company’s\nenforcement of its rights under this Policy, or (ii) pay or reimburse any current or former Covered Person for insurance premiums to\nrecover losses incurred under this Policy.\n5. Acknowledgment by Covered Persons\nThe Company shall provide notice and obtain written acknowledgement of this Policy from each Covered Person substantially in the form\nattached hereto as Exhibit A, as soon as practicable after the later of (a) the Effective Date and (b) the date on which such person is appointed as a\nCovered Person, providing that the Company may recoup amounts as and according to the terms and conditions provided herein; provided, however, that\nobtaining such acknowledgment is not a prerequisite to the Board’s authority to enforce this Policy.\n6. Amendment; Termination\nThe Board may amend this Policy from time to time in its discretion and shall amend this Policy as it deems necessary to reflect final regulations\nadopted by the SEC under Section 10D of the Exchange Act and to comply with any rules or standards adopted by a national securities exchange on\nwhich the Company's securities are listed. The Board may terminate this Policy at any time.\n7. Other Recoupment Rights\n(a) The Board intends that this Policy will be applied to the fullest extent of the law. The Board may require that any employment agreement,\nequity award agreement, or similar agreement entered into on or after the Effective Date shall, as a condition to the grant of any benefit\nthereunder, require a Covered Person to agree to abide by the terms of this Policy. Any right of recoupment under this Policy is in addition\nto, and not in lieu of, any other remedies or rights of recoupment that may be available to the Company pursuant to (i) the terms of any\nrecoupment provisions in any employment agreement, incentive or equity compensation plan or award or other agreement, (ii) any other\nlegal requirements, including, but not limited to, Section 304 of Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, and (iii) any other legal rights or remedies\navailable to the Company.\n(b) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, to prevent duplicative recovery:\n(i) to the extent that the amount of any Erroneously Awarded Incentive-Based Compensation is recovered from any current or former\nCovered Persons under this Policy, the Company will not be entitled to recover any such amounts under any other compensation\nrecovery or recoupment policy of the Company or any applicable provisions of plans, agreements, awards or other\narrangements of the Company that provide for the recoupment or recovery of compensation from Covered Persons; and\n(ii) to the extent that any Erroneously Awarded Incentive-Based Compensation includes any amounts that have been actually\nreimbursed to the Company from any Covered Person pursuant to Section 304 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the amount of any\nErroneously Awarded Incentive-Based Compensation to be recovered from any such Covered Person shall be reduced by the\namount of such reimbursement.\n8. Supersedure.\nThis Policy will supersede any provisions in any agreement, plan, or other arrangement applicable to the Company, or in any organizational\ndocuments of any entity that is part of Company Group that, in any such case, (a) exempt any Incentive-Based Compensation from the application of this\nPolicy, (b) waive or otherwise prohibit or restricts the Company Group’s right to recover any Erroneously Awarded Incentive-Based Compensation,\nincluding, without limitation, in connection with exercising any right of setoff as provided herein, and/or (c) require or provide for indemnification to the\nextent that such indemnification is prohibited under Section 4 above.\n9. Successors\nThis Policy shall be binding and enforceable against all Covered Persons and their beneficiaries, heirs, executors, administrators or other legal\nrepresentatives.\n* * * * *\nExhibit A\nPLAYSTUDIOS, INC.\nMANDATORY RECOUPMENT POLICY\nCOVERED PERSON ACKNOWLEDGMENT\nI hereby certify and acknowledge that:\n1. I have received and read the PLAYSTUDIOS, Inc. Mandatory Recoupment Policy (the “Policy”), and I understand the terms thereof;\n2. I agree that the Company may recoup, and I agree to repay, amounts as and according to the terms and conditions provided in the Policy, whether\nunder any compensation plan, award, agreement, employment agreement, communication, or any other plan, policy, or agreement of the Company\n(collectively, “Incentive Compensation Agreements”), including amounts already awarded, granted, earned, vested, or paid, notwithstanding any\ncontrary provisions of any such Incentive Compensation Agreements; and\n3. For the avoidance of doubt, I confirm and agree that any recoupment effected under the Policy shall not, in and of itself, constitute grounds for me\nto terminate my employment for “Good Reason” (or any term of similar meaning) under any Incentive Compensation Agreement or under any\nemployment agreement, offer letter, or similar documentation relating to the terms of my employment, nor shall it constitute a constructive\ntermination or material modification of the terms of my employment.\nSignature:\nPrint Name:\nDate:"
