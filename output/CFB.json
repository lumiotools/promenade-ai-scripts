Announce Transformative Partnership\n\nAugust 27, 2024\n\n[PDF Version](/node/10456/pdf)\n\n**Creates Compelling and Diversified Commercial Banking Franchise with $20 Billion in Assets, Extending Busey’s Market Presence to Arizona, Colorado, Kansas, New Mexico, Oklahoma and Texas**\n\nCHAMPAIGN, Ill. and LEAWOOD, Kan., Aug. 27, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- First Busey Corporation (“Busey”) (Nasdaq: BUSE), the holding company for Busey Bank, and CrossFirst Bankshares, Inc. (“CrossFirst”) (Nasdaq: CFB), the holding company for CrossFirst Bank, jointly announced today the signing of a definitive agreement and plan of merger, pursuant to which CrossFirst will merge with and into Busey (the “Merger”) in an all-common stock transaction valued at approximately $916.8 million, based on Busey’s closing stock price of $27.39 as of August 26, 2024. The combined company, which will operate under the Busey brand, will have approximately $20 billion in total assets, approximately $17 billion in total deposits and approximately $13 billion in wealth management assets under care.\n\n“The partnership between our high-quality franchises is a great fit from a strategic, financial and cultural perspective, and we look forward to capitalizing on the many opportunities we see as a combined company in 2025 and beyond,” said Busey Chairman and CEO Van Dukeman. “CrossFirst is a natural fit alongside Busey’s established commercial and wealth management offerings and our payment technology solutions business, FirsTech, Inc. By leveraging CrossFirst’s established presence in attractive markets with compelling growth potential, this partnership is expected to serve as a catalyst for additional commercial banking growth as well as expanded opportunities to grow our existing wealth management and payments businesses. We are excited for our associates, customers and shareholders to experience our next chapter as Busey and CrossFirst combine to form a premier commercial bank that maintains the community bank values our customers and communities expect and deserve.”\n\nMike Maddox, CrossFirst CEO, President and Director, stated, “Founded on the ideals of extraordinary, personal service provided by outstanding, local bankers, our dedicated associates at CrossFirst have built strong, trusting relationships with our clients and the markets we serve. We believe Busey is the right partner to continue CrossFirst’s customer- and community-focus. Because of our like-minded cultures, our complementary business models and manner in which we operate, we are confident this partnership will create significant benefits for our teams, customers, communities and shareholders.”\n\n**Strategic Benefits of the Partnership** The partnership will extend Busey’s regional operating model in the high-growth metro markets of Kansas City, Wichita, Dallas/Fort Worth, Denver and Phoenix while bolstering its commercial banking relationships and offering additional opportunities to grow its wealth management business and FirsTech, Inc., Busey’s payment technology solutions subsidiary. The combined company will further strengthen its deep commitment to and extensive skill set in commercial banking. \n\nThe combination is expected to create a premier full-service commercial bank serving clients from 77 full-service locations across 10 states with combined total assets of approximately $20 billion, $17 billion in total deposits, $15 billion in total loans and $13 billion in wealth assets under care. With a diversified client, loan and deposit base, this scale provides opportunities to augment business models through new customer and product channels.\n\nThrough compatible banking philosophies and cultures, complementary business models, combined capital strength and increased economies of scale, the combination is expected to significantly enhance key performance metrics with meaningful improvements in net interest margin and efficiency, driving increased profitability and returns to our shareholders. Pro forma calculations estimate Busey earnings per share accretion of approximately 20% in 2026, the first full year of combined operations, excluding one-time merger-related charges and assuming fully phased-in cost savings. Tangible book value per share dilution is projected to be modest at -0.6% with a forecasted earnback period of approximately six months. Capital ratios are expected to be significantly above “well-capitalized” thresholds with 9.6% leverage, 11.0% CET1 and 14.1% total risk-based capital. The transaction is expected to result in an internal rate of return of over 19%. With a combined loan-to-deposit ratio of 86%, C&D concentration of 60% and CRE concentration of 250%, the pro forma company will be well-positioned for future growth.\n\nBoth Busey and CrossFirst have extensive experience in successfully integrating with merger partners and are acutely focused on ensuring a smooth transition. Between the two management teams, Busey and CrossFirst have successfully navigated 11 mergers and integrations since 2013.\n\n**Transaction Details** The merger has been unanimously approved by each company’s board of directors.\n\nIn the merger, CrossFirst shareholders will receive 0.6675 shares of Busey common stock for each share held of CrossFirst common stock. CrossFirst’s common shareholders, which currently do not receive a dividend, will be eligible to receive Busey’s ongoing dividends as declared following the closing of the merger.\n\nUpon completion of the transaction, Busey’s shareholders will own approximately 63.5% of the combined company and CrossFirst’s shareholders will own approximately 36.5% of the combined company, on a fully-diluted basis, which will continue to trade on the Nasdaq under the “BUSE” stock ticker symbol.\n\nCompletion of the merger is subject to customary closing conditions, including the approval of both Busey and CrossFirst shareholders and the regulatory approvals for the holding company merger and the bank merger. With approvals, the parties expect to close the holding company merger in the first or second quarter of 2025.\n\n**Name and Headquarters** The combined holding company will continue to operate under the First Busey Corporation name and the combined bank will operate under the Busey Bank name. It is anticipated that CrossFirst Bank will merge with and into Busey Bank in mid-2025. At the time of the bank merger, CrossFirst Bank locations will become service centers of Busey Bank.\n\nBusey Bank’s headquarters will remain in Champaign, Illinois—near where Busey was founded more than 155 years ago. The majority of Busey’s stable deposit base and wealth management assets under care are within its legacy footprint.\n\nThe headquarters of the holding company will move to Leawood, Kansas—at the site of the current CrossFirst headquarters in the Kansas City area, which will be central to the combined company’s new footprint, providing benefits for ease of travel, accessibility and visibility.\n\n**Governance, Leadership and Culture** The Board of Directors of the combined company will be comprised of thirteen (13) members, eight (8) from Busey or Busey Bank and five (5) from CrossFirst, with Van Dukeman serving as Executive Chairman and CEO, Mike Maddox as President and Executive Vice Chairman, and Rod Brenneman—current independent Chairman of the Board of CrossFirst—as Lead Independent Director.\n\nManagement of the combined company will be a combination of both Busey and CrossFirst executives. Van Dukeman will continue to serve as Executive Chairman and CEO of Busey and Executive Chairman of Busey Bank. Mike Maddox will become President and Executive Vice Chairman of Busey and CEO of Busey Bank. Mr. Maddox will succeed Mr. Dukeman as CEO of Busey on the earlier of the one-year anniversary of the bank merger or the 18-month anniversary of the holding company merger, with Dukeman remaining the Executive Chairman of both Busey and Busey Bank.\n\nThe remainder of the management team of the combined company will be led by a well-respected group of individuals with significant financial services and M&A integration experience. This group will provide continuity of leadership both during and beyond integration. Current Busey executives—Chief Financial Officer Jeff Jones, Chief Operating Officer Amy Randolph, Chief Risk Officer Monica Bowe and General Counsel John Powers—will remain in their current roles with the combined company. Randy Rapp, current President of CrossFirst Bank, will assume the role of President of Busey Bank while Chip Jorstad, Busey’s current President of Credit and Bank Administration, and Amy Fauss, CrossFirst’s current Chief Operating Officer, will assume the roles of Chief Credit Officer and Chief Information and Technology Officer, respectively.\n\nBoth companies support and value an engaged and empowered workforce and are committed to building an extraordinary, service-oriented banking experience. Busey has been named among _American Banker’s_ Best Banks to Work For since 2016; listed among 2023 and 2024’s America’s Best Banks by _Forbes_ ; and recognized in all states where it operates as a Best Place to Work, in addition to earning various wellness, training and development, philanthropic and other workplace awards. Similarly, CrossFirst continues to be honored with prestigious workplace awards including being recognized as a back-to-back winner of the Don Clifton Strengths-Based Culture award from Gallup® in 2023 and 2024 and a Best Place to Work by the _Kansas City Business Journal_ for the past two years.\n\n**Advisors** Raymond James & Associates, Inc. served as financial advisor and provided a fairness opinion to the Board of Directors of Busey, and Sullivan & Cromwell LLP served as legal counsel to Busey.
