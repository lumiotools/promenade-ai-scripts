The data will be presented by Dr. Chun-Jen Liu as an oral presentation on November 18, 2024, at 17:30 PT at the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) – The Liver Meeting® 2024. Barinthus Bio is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing novel immunotherapeutic candidates that guide T cells to control disease.\n\nThe HBV003 study (NCT05343481) is fully recruited with a total of 121 participants, including 69 participants who had entered the trial with HBsAg levels below 200 IU/mL. The study is evaluating different dosing regimens of VTP-300 in combination with low-dose nivolumab, an anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody. The new data showed that as of data cut off, eight participants were reported with complete HBsAg loss (defined as HBsAg levels below the lower limit of quantitation [<LLOQ, 0.05 IU/mL]) and two participants met the criteria for functional cure.\n\nUniquely, two of the eight participants with HBsAg loss, became positive for anti-hepatitis B antibodies (HBsAb) that they did not have before, including one of those who met functional cure criteria. The data from this ongoing study indicate that stronger responses may happen in participants treated with the combination of VTP-300 and a low dose of the anti-PD1 antibody nivolumab (Groups 1 and 2). \n\n“Sustained HBsAg loss has proven to be the largest hurdle in getting chronic hepatitis B patients to functional cure,” said Dr. Chun-Jen Liu, investigator on HBV003 and Director of the Hepatitis Research Center and Clinical Trial Center, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taiwan. “The data we are seeing with VTP-300 is unique because they indicate a durable loss of HBsAg in participants, including two who met the criteria for functional cure. Although the study is still ongoing, these early data may bring us a step closer to potentially allowing some patients with chronic hepatitis B to come off antiviral treatment without their chronic hepatitis B progressing.”\n\n40 participants, with HBsAg below 200 IU/mL at screening, who had reached Day 169 were assessed for nucleos(t)ide analogue (NUC) discontinuation. The data showed the following:\n\n  * 24 were eligible for NUC discontinuation.\n  * Eight achieved HBsAg loss at any time, two of whom achieved it after Day 169.\n  * Nine participants chose to discontinue NUCs. \n    * 66% (n=6/9) remained off NUC therapy, five for more than six months. \n      * Two of these six have met the criteria for functional cure.\n      * Two of these six seroconverted to HBsAb positivity.\n      * Follow up is continuing with the remaining participants to assess if they will meet functional cure criteria.\n  * Durable HBsAg declines were observed in all treatment groups, consistent with data previously presented at the European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) Congress, in June 2024.\n  * Preliminary safety data indicate that VTP-300 in combination with low-dose nivolumab was generally well tolerated with no treatment-related SAEs observed or reported as of data cut off.\n\n\n\n\"These Phase 2 data are incredibly encouraging and highlight the ability of VTP-300 to stimulate the immune response and induce sustained reductions in HBsAg to the point of meeting functional cure criteria,” said Dr. Nadege Pelletier, Chief Scientific Officer of Barinthus Bio. \"Moreover, the finding that one of the participants meeting functional cure criteria had antibodies against hepatitis B is promising as HBsAb positivity is associated with long-term control of the infection by the immune system.”\n\nFunctional cure is defined by AASLD as sustained HBsAg loss and hepatitis B virus DNA <LLOQ for 6 months off-treatment. Data cut off was September 30, 2024, for lab data and October 8, 2024, for clinical data.\n\n**About the HBV003 Trial** The HBV003 trial is designed to obtain critical information on treatment dosing regimen with participants receiving VTP-300 and low-dose (LD) nivolumab. All Groups received ChAdOx at Day 1; Groups 1 & 2 received MVA with nivolumab at Day 29; Group 2 was dosed again with MVA and nivolumab at Day 85; Group 3 received only MVA at Day 29, nivolumab at Day 36, and a conditional second MVA dose at Day 85 to evaluate anti-PD-1 inhibition timing. The conditional MVA dose was administered if participants had HBsAg ≥10 IU/mL. In 2023, the study inclusion criteria was amended from people with CHB with HBsAg ≥10 and <4,000 IU/mL to ≥10 and ≤200 IU/mL, as strongest responses were observed in participants with HBsAg ≤200 IU/ml.\n\n**About VTP-300** VTP-300 is an immunotherapeutic candidate consisting of an initial dose using the ChAdOx vector and a secondary dose(s) using the MVA vector, both encoding multiple HBsAg, including full-length surface, modified polymerase, and core antigens. VTP-300 is the first antigen-specific immunotherapy that has been shown to induce sustained reductions in HBsAg. Barinthus Bio is studying VTP-300 in combination with other agents, including siRNA and low-dose anti-PD-1 antibodies in the ongoing IM-PROVE II trial, to control the infection, and counterbalance the immune suppression and T cell exhaustion in the liver caused by chronic HBV infection.\n\n**About Barinthus Bio** Barinthus Bio is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing novel immunotherapeutic candidates designed to guide the immune system to overcome chronic infectious diseases and autoimmunity. Helping people living with serious diseases and their families is the guiding principle at the heart of Barinthus Bio.

The data indicated that Group C participants receiving nivolumab experienced increased rates of HBsAg loss (defined as HBsAg <LLOQ [0.05 IU/mL]) compared to Group A and B participants who received imdusiran and VTP-300 or placebo. The data from Groups A and B were previously presented at the European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) Congress in June 2024.\n\nGroup C enrolled a total of 22 non-cirrhotic, virally suppressed cHBV participants with HBsAg ≥100 to <5,000 IU/mL at screening who were on stable nucleos(t)ide analogue (NUC) therapy for ≥12 months. Thirteen of these participants were eligible to receive low-dose nivolumab and nine participants were not eligible, based on the trial criteria.\n\nThe preliminary data from Group C included data to Week 48 (20/22 participants) and showed the following:\n\n  * Imdusiran lead-in treatment led to a mean decline from baseline in HBsAg consistent with data from Groups A and B.\n  * Significantly greater mean declines in HBsAg levels (p <0.017) were seen in Group C participants, who received imdusiran and VTP-300 with nivolumab, at Week 48 compared with Groups A and B and Group C without nivolumab.\n  * 23% of participants (3/13) in the group receiving imdusiran, VTP-300 and low-dose nivolumab achieved HBsAg loss by Week 48.\n  * Increases in soluble immune biomarkers associated with immune checkpoint proteins, inflammation, and T-cell activation were observed in participants who had HBsAg loss at any point through Week 48.\n  * The Group C treatment regimen with nivolumab was generally well tolerated and did not result in any immune-related adverse events.\n\n\n\n“These data demonstrated the impact of the combination of an immune stimulant such as VTP-300 and a low dose of the checkpoint inhibitor nivolumab in helping participants reach HBsAg loss,” said Dr. Leon Hooftman, Chief Medical Officer of Barinthus Bio. \"While these are early data, the imdusiran, VTP-300 and low-dose nivolumab regimen is promising and is consistent with the data we are seeing from our HBV003 trial of VTP-300 plus low-dose nivolumab.”\n\n“These data continue to support our belief that lowering surface antigen is key to promoting HBV-specific immune reawakening,” commented Dr. Karen Sims, Chief Medical Officer of Arbutus Biopharma. “In this trial, imdusiran provided meaningful reductions in HBsAg prior to treatment with the immunomodulatory agents, VTP-300 and low dose nivolumab, leading to improved response rates with this combination.”\n\nThe poster from the presentation at AASLD 2024 can be accessed through the Barinthus Bio website at: https://investors.barinthusbio.com/events-presentations\n\n**IM-PROVE II Trial Details** The IM-PROVE II Phase 2a clinical trial initially enrolled 40 non-cirrhotic, virally suppressed cHBV participants that were on stable NUC therapy in Groups A and B. These participants received imdusiran (60mg every 8 weeks) for 24 weeks with on-going NUC therapy and were then randomized to receive either VTP-300 (Group A) or placebo (Group B) at Weeks 26 and 30 (and conditionally at Week 38 if they experienced a >0.5 log10 decline in HBsAg between Weeks 26 and 34).\n\nThis trial was amended to include an additional cohort (Group C) which enrolled 22 participants, 13 of which were eligible to receive imdusiran (60mg every 8 weeks) for 24 weeks with ongoing NUC therapy followed by VTP-300 at Weeks 26 and 30 plus up to two low doses of nivolumab (0.3 mg/kg), an approved PD-1 monoclonal antibody at Week 30. The remaining 9 participants received the imdusiran/NUC/VTP-300 regimen without nivolumab. Participants could receive a second dose of VTP-300 ± low-dose nivolumab at Week 38 if their HBsAg was ≥10 IU/mL at Week 34.\n\nUpon completion of the treatment period at Week 48, all participants who met certain criteria could discontinue NUC therapy and be followed for an additional 48 weeks. Those who did not meet the criteria continued on NUC therapy for an additional 24 weeks of follow-up.\n\n**About Imdusiran (AB-729)** Imdusiran is an RNA interference (RNAi) therapeutic specifically designed to reduce all HBV viral proteins and antigens including hepatitis B surface antigen, which is thought to be a key prerequisite to enable reawakening of a patient’s immune system to respond to the virus. Imdusiran targets hepatocytes using Arbutus’ novel covalently conjugated _N_ -Acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) delivery technology enabling subcutaneous delivery. Clinical data generated thus far has shown single and multiple doses of imdusiran to be generally safe and well-tolerated, while also providing meaningful reductions in hepatitis B surface antigen and hepatitis B DNA. Imdusiran is currently in multiple Phase 2a clinical trials.\n\n**About VTP-300** VTP-300 is an immunotherapeutic candidate consisting of an initial dose using the ChAdOx vector and a secondary dose(s) using the MVA vector, both encoding multiple HBsAg, including full-length surface, modified polymerase, and core antigens. VTP-300 is the first antigen-specific immunotherapy that has been shown to induce sustained reductions in HBsAg. Barinthus Bio is studying VTP-300 in combination with other agents, including siRNA and low-dose anti-PD-1 antibodies, to control the infection, and counterbalance the immune suppression and T cell exhaustion in the liver caused by chronic HBV infection.\n\n**About Arbutus** Arbutus Biopharma Corporation (Nasdaq: ABUS) is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company leveraging its extensive virology expertise to develop novel therapeutics with distinct mechanisms of action, which can potentially be combined to provide a functional cure for patients with chronic hepatitis B virus (cHBV). Arbutus believes the key to success in developing a functional cure involves suppressing HBV DNA, reducing surface antigen, and boosting HBV-specific immune responses. Arbutus’ pipeline of internally developed, proprietary compounds includes an RNAi therapeutic, imdusiran (AB-729), and an oral PD-L1 inhibitor, AB-101. Imdusiran has generated meaningful clinical data demonstrating an impact on both surface antigen reduction and reawakening of the HBV-specific immune response. Imdusiran is currently in two Phase 2a combination clinical trials. AB-101 is currently being evaluated in a Phase 1a/1b clinical trial.

Barinthus Bio is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing novel immunotherapeutic candidates that guide T cells to control disease.\n\n“Dr. Pelletier’s strong vision and leadership have resulted in a robust preclinical pipeline of promising leads for targeting autoimmune and other inflammatory diseases. She has played a pivotal role in the new company structure and across all R&D activities,” said Bill Enright, Chief Executive Officer of Barinthus Bio. “We’re very grateful for Dr. Pelletier’s contributions to our growing pipeline and expect a smooth transition with the appointment of Dr. Lynn. As co-inventor of the SNAP-TI technology, he is a natural successor into the CSO role.”\n\nDr. Pelletier will remain with the Company until the transition of responsibilities to Dr. Lynn is complete.\n\n“This is an incredibly exciting time for Barinthus Bio. We have achieved functional cures with VTP-300 in patients with chronic hepatitis B, and VTP-1000, our first product candidate developed using the SNAP-TI technology, recently entered the clinic in a Phase 1 trial for individuals with celiac disease,” said Dr. Lynn. “Dr. Pelletier has put Barinthus in a strong position with a compelling pipeline of assets, including our first program in the autoimmune disease space, and I look forward to building on this momentum while also exploring new opportunities to build value.”\n\nDr. Lynn is a seasoned biotech innovator and executive with over 15 years of experience leading immunotherapeutic R&D from discovery through early development. Prior to joining the Company, Dr. Lynn led Avidea Technologies, Inc. as CEO and Founder from its launch at Johns Hopkins FastForward in 2017 through to its acquisition by Barinthus Bio in 2021. Dr. Lynn holds a M.D. from the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine (US), as well as a D.Phil. from the University of Oxford.\n\n**About Barinthus Bio** Barinthus Biotherapeutics (Nasdaq: BRNS) is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing novel immunotherapeutic candidates designed to guide the immune system to overcome chronic infectious diseases and autoimmunity.
