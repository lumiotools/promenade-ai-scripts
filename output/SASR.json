(Nasdaq-SASR), the parent company of Sandy Spring Bank, reported net income of $16.2 million ($0.36 per diluted common share) for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to net income of $22.8 million ($0.51 per diluted common share) for the second quarter of 2024 and $20.7 million ($0.46 per diluted common share) for the third quarter of 2023.\n\nCurrent quarter's core earnings were $17.9 million ($0.40 per diluted common share), compared to $24.4 million ($0.54 per diluted common share) for the quarter ended June 30, 2024 and $27.8 million ($0.62 per diluted common share) for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. Core earnings exclude the after-tax impact of amortization of intangibles, investment securities gains or losses and other non-recurring or extraordinary items. The current quarter's decline in net income and core earnings as compared to the linked quarter was driven by higher provision for credit losses combined with higher non-interest expense, partially offset by higher net interest income. The total provision for credit losses was $6.3 million for the third quarter of 2024 compared to $1.0 million for the previous quarter and $2.4 million for the third quarter of 2023.\n\n“We have a solid capital position and are seeing ongoing success with our core deposit strategies and our wealth management lines of business,” said Daniel J. Schrider, Chair, President & CEO of Sandy Spring Bank. “Our wealth teams - Sandy Spring Trust, and our subsidiaries, West Financial and RPJ - have an expanding number of referrals from current clients and work closely with business owners from early growth through maturity. The success of our wealth teams' approach is reflected in our strong fee income results.”\n\n**Third Quarter****Highlights**\n\n  * Total assets at September 30, 2024 increased by 3% to $14.4 billion compared to $14.0 billion at June 30, 2024.\n  * Total loans remained level at $11.5 billion as of September 30, 2024 compared to June 30, 2024. During the current quarter, AD&C and commercial business loans and lines increased by $71.3 million and $19.4 million, respectively, while the commercial investor real estate segment declined by $64.9 million. Total residential mortgage and consumer loan portfolios remained relatively unchanged during this period.\n  * Deposits increased by $397.5 million or 4% to $11.7 billion at September 30, 2024 compared to $11.3 billion at June 30, 2024, as interest-bearing deposits increased $425.8 million, while noninterest-bearing deposits declined $28.3 million. Strong growth in the interest-bearing deposit categories was mainly experienced within money market, time deposits and savings accounts, which grew by $185.2 million, $151.5 million, and $66.1 million, respectively, compared to the linked quarter. The decline in noninterest-bearing deposit categories was driven by lower balances in personal and small business checking accounts. Total deposits, excluding brokered deposits, increased by $351.7 million or 3% quarter-over-quarter and represented 94% of total deposits as of September 30, 2024.\n  * The ratio of non-performing loans to total loans was 1.09% at September 30, 2024 compared to 0.81% at June 30, 2024 and 0.46% at September 30, 2023. The current quarter's increase in non-performing loans was mainly related to a single AD&C loan that was placed on non-accrual status during the current period. Net charge-offs for the current quarter totaled $0.7 million.\n  * Net interest income for the third quarter of 2024 grew $1.1 million or 1% compared to the previous quarter and decreased by $3.7 million or 4% compared to the third quarter of 2023. Compared to the previous quarter, interest income increased by $5.0 million, while interest expense increased by $3.9 million.\n  * The net interest margin was 2.44% for the third quarter of 2024 compared to 2.46% for the second quarter of 2024 and 2.55% for the third quarter of 2023. During the current quarter, the net interest margin was negatively impacted by a reversal of previously accrued uncollected interest income on a single large AD&C loan placed on a non-accrual status. Compared to the linked quarter, the rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities increased seven basis points, while the yield on interest-earning assets increased three basis points.\n  * Provision for credit losses directly attributable to the funded loan portfolio was $6.3 million for the current quarter compared to $3.0 million in the previous quarter and $3.2 million in the prior year quarter. The current quarter's provision expense is mainly attributable to higher individual reserves on collateral-dependent loans, primarily related to a single AD&C loan due to the borrower-specific circumstances, partially offset by lower qualitative adjustments due to the reduction in commercial investor real estate loans. In addition, during the current quarter, the provision for unfunded commitments was insignificant compared to a credit of $1.9 million from the previous quarter.\n  * Non-interest income for the third quarter of 2024 increased by 1% or $0.1 million compared to the linked quarter and grew by 13% or $2.3 million compared to the prior year quarter. The quarter-over-quarter increase was mainly driven by higher wealth management income and other income, generated by higher credit-related fees, which was fully offset by lower income from bank owned life insurance due to a receipt of one-time mortality proceeds during the prior quarter.\n  * Non-interest expense for the third quarter of 2024 increased by $4.8 million compared to the second quarter of 2024 and $0.5 million compared to the prior year quarter. The quarterly increase in non-interest expense was primarily due to higher salaries and benefits along with an increase in professional fees and services.\n  * Return on average assets (“ROA”) for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 was 0.46% and return on average tangible common equity (“ROTCE”) was 5.88% compared to 0.66% and 8.27%, respectively, for the second quarter of 2024 and 0.58% and 7.42%, respectively, for the third quarter of 2023. On a non-GAAP basis, the current quarter's core ROA was 0.50% and core ROTCE was 5.88% compared to 0.70% and 8.27%, respectively, for the previous quarter and 0.78% and 9.51%, respectively, for the third quarter of 2023.\n  * The GAAP efficiency ratio was 72.12% for the third quarter of 2024, compared to 68.19% for the second quarter of 2024 and 70.72% for the third quarter of 2023. The non-GAAP efficiency ratio was 69.06% for the third quarter of 2024 compared to 65.31% for the second quarter of 2024 and 60.91% for the prior year quarter. The increase in non-GAAP efficiency ratio (reflecting a decrease in efficiency) in the current quarter compared to the previous quarter was the result of higher non-interest expense in the current quarter.\n\n\n\n**Balance Sheet and Credit Quality**\n\nTotal assets were $14.4 billion at September 30, 2024, as compared to $14.0 billion at June 30, 2024. At September 30, 2024, total loans remained stable at $11.5 billion compared to the previous quarter. During this period, the growth in AD&C and commercial business loans and lines of $71.3 million or 6% and $19.4 million or 1%, respectively, were mostly offset by the decline in commercial investor real estate loans of $64.9 million or 1%. Total residential mortgage and consumer loan portfolios remained relatively unchanged.\n\nDeposits increased $397.5 million or 4% to $11.7 billion at September 30, 2024 compared to $11.3 billion at June 30, 2024. During this period, noninterest-bearing deposits decreased $28.3 million or 1%, while interest-bearing deposits increased $425.8 million or 5%. The slight decline in noninterest-bearing deposit categories was driven by decreases in personal and small business checking accounts, partially offset by an increase in commercial checking accounts. Growth in interest-bearing deposits was seen across all product categories, but most notably in money market and time deposit accounts which grew $185.2 million or 7% and $151.5 million or 6% during the current quarter, respectively. Total deposits, excluding brokered deposits, increased by $351.7 million or 3% quarter-over-quarter and remained at 94% of the total deposits as of September 30, 2024 compared to June 30, 2024, reflecting continued strength and stability of the core deposit base. Total uninsured deposits at September 30, 2024 were approximately 37% of total deposits.\n\nTotal borrowings decreased $54.1 million or 6% at September 30, 2024 as compared to the previous quarter, primarily driven by a $50.0 million pay down of FHLB advances. At September 30, 2024, available unused sources of liquidity, which consist of available FHLB borrowings, fed funds, funds through the Federal Reserve Bank's discount window, as well as excess cash and unpledged investment securities, totaled $6.3 billion or 146% of uninsured deposits.\n\nThe tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio declined slightly to 8.83% at September 30, 2024, compared to 8.85% at June 30, 2024.\n\nAt September 30, 2024, the Company had a total risk-based capital ratio of 15.53%, a common equity tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 11.27%, a tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 11.27%, and a tier 1 leverage ratio of 9.59%. These risk-based capital ratios compare to a total risk-based capital ratio of 15.49%, a common equity tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 11.28%, a tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 11.28%, and a tier 1 leverage ratio of 9.70% at June 30, 2024. All of these ratios remain well in excess of the mandated minimum regulatory requirements.\n\nNon-performing loans include non-accrual loans and accruing loans 90 days or more past due. At September 30, 2024, non-performing loans totaled $125.3 million, compared to $93.0 million at June 30, 2024 and $51.8 million at September 30, 2023. The non-performing loans to total loans ratio was 1.09% compared to 0.81% on a linked quarter basis. These levels of non-performing loans compare to 0.46% at September 30, 2023. The current quarter's increase in non-performing loans was mainly related to a single AD&C loan with the total outstanding principal balance of $28.0 million, which was placed on a non-accrual status during the current period. Total net charge-offs for the current quarter amounted to $0.7 million compared to $0.2 million for the second quarter of 2024 and $0.1 million for the third quarter of 2023.\n\nAt September 30, 2024, the allowance for credit losses was $131.4 million or 1.14% of outstanding loans and 105% of non-performing loans, compared to $125.9 million or 1.10% of outstanding loans and 135% of non-performing loans at the end of the previous quarter and $123.4 million or 1.09% of outstanding loans and 238% of non-performing loans at the end of the third quarter of 2023. The increase in the allowance for the current quarter compared to the previous quarter mainly reflects higher individual reserves on collateral-dependent non-accrual loans, primarily driven by the aforementioned AD&C lending relationship, partially offset by lower qualitative adjustments as a result of declines in commercial investor real estate loans.\n\n**Income Statement Review**\n\n_Quarterly Results_\n\nNet income was $16.2 million ($0.36 per diluted common share) for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to $22.8 million ($0.51 per diluted common share) for the three months ended June 30, 2024 and $20.7 million ($0.46 per diluted common share) for the prior year quarter. The current quarter's core earnings were $17.9 million ($0.40 per diluted common share), compared to $24.4 million ($0.54 per diluted common share) for the previous quarter and $27.8 million ($0.62 per diluted common share) for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. The decreases in the current quarter's net income and core earnings compared to the previous quarter were driven primarily by higher provision for credit losses and non-interest expense.\n\nNet interest income for the third quarter of 2024 increased $1.1 million or 1% compared to the previous quarter and declined $3.7 million or 4% compared to the third quarter of 2023. During the current quarter, interest income increased $5.0 million, while interest expense increased $3.9 million. The rising interest rate environment was primarily responsible for a $7.7 million year-over-year increase in interest income. This growth in interest income was more than offset by the $11.4 million year-over-year growth in interest expense as funding costs have also risen in response to the rising rate environment and significant competition for deposits.\n\nThe net interest margin was 2.44% for the third quarter of 2024 compared to 2.46% for the second quarter of 2024 and 2.55% for the third quarter of 2023. The decrease in the net interest margin during the current quarter was a result of a seven basis point increase in the rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities, while the yield earned on interest-earning assets rose three basis points. The current quarter's net interest margin was negatively impacted by approximately three basis points due to the reversal of previously accrued uncollected interest income on a single large AD&C loan placed on non-accrual status during the period. As compared to the prior year quarter, the yield on interest-earning assets increased 23 basis points while the rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities rose 39 basis points, resulting in net interest margin compression of 11 basis points. The rate and yield increases year-over-year were driven by the higher interest rate environment, competition for deposits in the market, and customer movement of excess funds out of noninterest-bearing accounts into higher yielding products.\n\nThe total provision for credit losses was $6.3 million for the third quarter of 2024 compared to $1.0 million for the previous quarter and $2.4 million for the third quarter of 2023. The provision for credit losses directly attributable to the funded loan portfolio was $6.3 million for the current quarter compared to $3.0 million for the second quarter of 2024 and $3.2 million for the third quarter of 2023. The current quarter's provision is mainly a reflection of higher individual reserves on collateral-dependent non-accrual loans, primarily associated with the provision on a single AD&C lending relationship based on the current fair value of the collateral, partially offset by lower qualitative adjustments driven by an overall reduction in commercial investor real estate loan portfolio. In addition, during the current quarter, the reserve for unfunded commitments remained relatively stable at $1.5 million.\n\nNon-interest income for the third quarter of 2024 increased by 1% or $0.1 million compared to the linked quarter and grew by 13% or $2.3 million compared to the prior year quarter. The current quarter's increase in non-interest income as compared to the previous quarter was mainly driven by the $0.4 million increase in other income, generated by credit-related fees, and $0.3 million increase in wealth management income, due to the $352.1 million or 6% growth in assets under management quarter-over-quarter and the overall favorable market performance, offset by $0.5 million decrease in BOLI income, due to the receipt of one-time death proceeds in the prior quarter.\n\nNon-interest expense for the third quarter of 2024 increased $4.8 million or 7% compared to the second quarter of 2024 and $0.5 million or 1% compared to the third quarter of 2023. The quarter-over-quarter increase is predominantly attributable to the $3.2 million increase in salaries and benefits, due to the increase in employee incentive compensation coupled with the $1.6 million increase in professional fees and services, mostly due to a one-time contract negotiation fee. The prior year quarter included $8.2 million of pension settlement expense related to the termination of the Company's pension plan. Excluding this item, non-interest expense for the third quarter of 2024 increased $8.6 million or 13% compared to the third quarter of 2023.\n\nFor the third quarter of 2024, the GAAP efficiency ratio was 72.12% compared to 68.19% for the second quarter of 2024 and 70.72% for the third quarter of 2023. The GAAP efficiency ratio rose from the prior year quarter primarily as a result of the 1% increase in GAAP non-interest expense coupled with the 1% decline in GAAP revenue. The non-GAAP efficiency ratio was 69.06% for the current quarter as compared to 65.31% for the second quarter of 2024 and 60.91% for the third quarter of 2023. The increase in the non-GAAP efficiency ratio (reflecting a decrease in efficiency) from the third quarter of the prior year to the current year quarter was primarily the result of the 12% increase in adjusted non-interest expense.\n\nROA for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 was 0.46% and ROTCE was 5.88% compared to 0.66% and 8.27%, respectively, for the second quarter of 2024 and 0.58% and 7.42%, respectively, for the third quarter of 2023. On a non-GAAP basis, the current quarter's core ROA was 0.50% and core ROTCE was 5.88% compared to 0.70% and 8.27% for the second quarter of 2024 and 0.78% and 9.51%, respectively, for the third quarter of 2023.\n\n_Year-to-Date Results_\n\nThe Company recorded net income of $59.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to net income of $96.7 million for the same period in the prior year. Core earnings were $64.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to $107.2 million for the same period in the prior year. Year-to-date net income and core earnings declined as a result of lower net interest income in combination with higher provision for credit losses, which was partially offset by higher non-interest income.\n\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net interest income decreased $31.8 million compared to the prior year as a result of the $61.1 million increase in interest expense, partially offset by the $29.3 million increase in interest income. The increase in interest expense was driven by the interest expense on deposits, primarily associated with savings and time deposit accounts. The net interest margin declined to 2.44% for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 2.75% for the prior year, primarily as a result of higher funding costs due to the elevated interest rate environment and market competition for deposits during the period.\n\nThe provision for credit losses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was $9.7 million as compared to a credit of $14.1 million for 2023. The provision for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to an increase in individual reserves on collateral-dependent non-accrual loans, as well as adjustments applied to specific industries within the commercial real estate segment during the first quarter of 2024. The prior year's credit to provision was mainly attributable to the improving regional forecasted unemployment rate observed during the first half of 2023, and the declining probability of economic recession.\n\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, non-interest income increased 14% to $57.7 million compared to $50.5 million for 2023. During the current year, wealth management income increased $3.7 million or 14%, as assets under management increased $1.0 billion or 19% year-over-year. In addition, BOLI mortality-related income and service charges on deposit accounts increased $1.3 million and $1.1 million, respectively.\n\nNon-interest expense increased to $209.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $207.9 million for 2023. The drivers of the increase in non-interest expense were the $4.0 million increase in professional fees and services, $2.7 increase in amortization of intangible assets, $1.8 million increase in FDIC expense, and $1.2 million increase in outside data services. These year-over-year increases were offset by the $9.2 million decrease in compensation and benefits, as the prior year period included $8.2 million pension termination expense and $1.9 million of severance related expenses associated with staffing adjustments.\n\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the GAAP efficiency ratio was 69.98% compared to 64.29% for the same period in 2023. The non-GAAP efficiency ratio for the current year was 67.04% compared to 59.42% for the prior year. The growth in the current year’s GAAP and non-GAAP efficiency ratios compared to the prior year, indicating a decline in efficiency, was the result of the declines in GAAP and non-GAAP revenues combined with the growth in GAAP and non-GAAP non-interest expenses.\n\n**Explanation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures**\n\nThis news release contains financial information and performance measures determined by methods other than in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”). The Company’s management believes that the supplemental non-GAAP information provides a better comparison of period-to-period operating performance. Additionally, the Company believes this information is utilized by regulators and market analysts to evaluate a company’s financial condition and, therefore, such information is useful to investors. Non-GAAP measures used in this release consist of the following:\n\n  * Tangible common equity and related measures are non-GAAP measures that exclude the impact of goodwill and other intangible assets.\n  * The non-GAAP efficiency ratio excludes amortization of intangible assets, investment securities gains/(losses), severance expense, contingent payment expense, and includes tax-equivalent income.\n  * Core earnings and the related measures of core earnings per diluted common share, core return on average assets and core return on average tangible common equity reflect net income exclusive of amortization of intangible assets, investment securities gains/(losses) and other non-recurring or extraordinary items, on a net of tax basis.\n  * Pre-tax pre-provision net income excludes income tax expense and the provision (credit) for credit losses.\n\n\n\nThese disclosures should not be viewed as a substitute for financial results in accordance with GAAP, nor are they necessarily comparable to non-GAAP performance measures that may be presented by other companies. Please refer to the non-GAAP Reconciliation tables included with this release for a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure.\n\n**Conference Call Cancelled**\n\nAs a result of today’s announcement that the Company has entered into a merger agreement with Atlantic Union Bankshares Corporation, the Company has cancelled its conference call scheduled for 2:00 p.m. ET today to discuss the Company’s results for the third quarter of 2024.\n\n**About Sandy Spring Bancorp, Inc.**\n\nSandy Spring Bancorp, Inc., headquartered in Olney, Maryland, is the holding company for Sandy Spring Bank, a premier community bank in the Greater Washington, D.C. region.

(Nasdaq-SASR), the parent company of Sandy Spring Bank, reported net income of $16.2 million ($0.36 per diluted common share) for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to net income of $22.8 million ($0.51 per diluted common share) for the second quarter of 2024 and $20.7 million ($0.46 per diluted common share) for the third quarter of 2023.\n\nCurrent quarter's core earnings were $17.9 million ($0.40 per diluted common share), compared to $24.4 million ($0.54 per diluted common share) for the quarter ended June 30, 2024 and $27.8 million ($0.62 per diluted common share) for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. Core earnings exclude the after-tax impact of amortization of intangibles, investment securities gains or losses and other non-recurring or extraordinary items. The current quarter's decline in net income and core earnings as compared to the linked quarter was driven by higher provision for credit losses combined with higher non-interest expense, partially offset by higher net interest income. The total provision for credit losses was $6.3 million for the third quarter of 2024 compared to $1.0 million for the previous quarter and $2.4 million for the third quarter of 2023.\n\n“We have a solid capital position and are seeing ongoing success with our core deposit strategies and our wealth management lines of business,” said Daniel J. Schrider, Chair, President & CEO of Sandy Spring Bank. “Our wealth teams - Sandy Spring Trust, and our subsidiaries, West Financial and RPJ - have an expanding number of referrals from current clients and work closely with business owners from early growth through maturity. The success of our wealth teams' approach is reflected in our strong fee income results.”\n\n**Third Quarter****Highlights**\n\n  * Total assets at September 30, 2024 increased by 3% to $14.4 billion compared to $14.0 billion at June 30, 2024.\n  * Total loans remained level at $11.5 billion as of September 30, 2024 compared to June 30, 2024. During the current quarter, AD&C and commercial business loans and lines increased by $71.3 million and $19.4 million, respectively, while the commercial investor real estate segment declined by $64.9 million. Total residential mortgage and consumer loan portfolios remained relatively unchanged during this period.\n  * Deposits increased by $397.5 million or 4% to $11.7 billion at September 30, 2024 compared to $11.3 billion at June 30, 2024, as interest-bearing deposits increased $425.8 million, while noninterest-bearing deposits declined $28.3 million. Strong growth in the interest-bearing deposit categories was mainly experienced within money market, time deposits and savings accounts, which grew by $185.2 million, $151.5 million, and $66.1 million, respectively, compared to the linked quarter. The decline in noninterest-bearing deposit categories was driven by lower balances in personal and small business checking accounts. Total deposits, excluding brokered deposits, increased by $351.7 million or 3% quarter-over-quarter and represented 94% of total deposits as of September 30, 2024.\n  * The ratio of non-performing loans to total loans was 1.09% at September 30, 2024 compared to 0.81% at June 30, 2024 and 0.46% at September 30, 2023. The current quarter's increase in non-performing loans was mainly related to a single AD&C loan that was placed on non-accrual status during the current period. Net charge-offs for the current quarter totaled $0.7 million.\n  * Net interest income for the third quarter of 2024 grew $1.1 million or 1% compared to the previous quarter and decreased by $3.7 million or 4% compared to the third quarter of 2023. Compared to the previous quarter, interest income increased by $5.0 million, while interest expense increased by $3.9 million.\n  * The net interest margin was 2.44% for the third quarter of 2024 compared to 2.46% for the second quarter of 2024 and 2.55% for the third quarter of 2023. During the current quarter, the net interest margin was negatively impacted by a reversal of previously accrued uncollected interest income on a single large AD&C loan placed on a non-accrual status. Compared to the linked quarter, the rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities increased seven basis points, while the yield on interest-earning assets increased three basis points.\n  * Provision for credit losses directly attributable to the funded loan portfolio was $6.3 million for the current quarter compared to $3.0 million in the previous quarter and $3.2 million in the prior year quarter. The current quarter's provision expense is mainly attributable to higher individual reserves on collateral-dependent loans, primarily related to a single AD&C loan due to the borrower-specific circumstances, partially offset by lower qualitative adjustments due to the reduction in commercial investor real estate loans. In addition, during the current quarter, the provision for unfunded commitments was insignificant compared to a credit of $1.9 million from the previous quarter.\n  * Non-interest income for the third quarter of 2024 increased by 1% or $0.1 million compared to the linked quarter and grew by 13% or $2.3 million compared to the prior year quarter. The quarter-over-quarter increase was mainly driven by higher wealth management income and other income, generated by higher credit-related fees, which was fully offset by lower income from bank owned life insurance due to a receipt of one-time mortality proceeds during the prior quarter.\n  * Non-interest expense for the third quarter of 2024 increased by $4.8 million compared to the second quarter of 2024 and $0.5 million compared to the prior year quarter. The quarterly increase in non-interest expense was primarily due to higher salaries and benefits along with an increase in professional fees and services.\n  * Return on average assets (“ROA”) for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 was 0.46% and return on average tangible common equity (“ROTCE”) was 5.88% compared to 0.66% and 8.27%, respectively, for the second quarter of 2024 and 0.58% and 7.42%, respectively, for the third quarter of 2023. On a non-GAAP basis, the current quarter's core ROA was 0.50% and core ROTCE was 5.88% compared to 0.70% and 8.27%, respectively, for the previous quarter and 0.78% and 9.51%, respectively, for the third quarter of 2023.\n  * The GAAP efficiency ratio was 72.12% for the third quarter of 2024, compared to 68.19% for the second quarter of 2024 and 70.72% for the third quarter of 2023. The non-GAAP efficiency ratio was 69.06% for the third quarter of 2024 compared to 65.31% for the second quarter of 2024 and 60.91% for the prior year quarter. The increase in non-GAAP efficiency ratio (reflecting a decrease in efficiency) in the current quarter compared to the previous quarter was the result of higher non-interest expense in the current quarter.\n\n\n\n**Balance Sheet and Credit Quality**\n\nTotal assets were $14.4 billion at September 30, 2024, as compared to $14.0 billion at June 30, 2024. At September 30, 2024, total loans remained stable at $11.5 billion compared to the previous quarter. During this period, the growth in AD&C and commercial business loans and lines of $71.3 million or 6% and $19.4 million or 1%, respectively, were mostly offset by the decline in commercial investor real estate loans of $64.9 million or 1%. Total residential mortgage and consumer loan portfolios remained relatively unchanged.\n\nDeposits increased $397.5 million or 4% to $11.7 billion at September 30, 2024 compared to $11.3 billion at June 30, 2024. During this period, noninterest-bearing deposits decreased $28.3 million or 1%, while interest-bearing deposits increased $425.8 million or 5%. The slight decline in noninterest-bearing deposit categories was driven by decreases in personal and small business checking accounts, partially offset by an increase in commercial checking accounts. Growth in interest-bearing deposits was seen across all product categories, but most notably in money market and time deposit accounts which grew $185.2 million or 7% and $151.5 million or 6% during the current quarter, respectively. Total deposits, excluding brokered deposits, increased by $351.7 million or 3% quarter-over-quarter and remained at 94% of the total deposits as of September 30, 2024 compared to June 30, 2024, reflecting continued strength and stability of the core deposit base. Total uninsured deposits at September 30, 2024 were approximately 37% of total deposits.\n\nTotal borrowings decreased $54.1 million or 6% at September 30, 2024 as compared to the previous quarter, primarily driven by a $50.0 million pay down of FHLB advances. At September 30, 2024, available unused sources of liquidity, which consist of available FHLB borrowings, fed funds, funds through the Federal Reserve Bank's discount window, as well as excess cash and unpledged investment securities, totaled $6.3 billion or 146% of uninsured deposits.\n\nThe tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio declined slightly to 8.83% at September 30, 2024, compared to 8.85% at June 30, 2024.\n\nAt September 30, 2024, the Company had a total risk-based capital ratio of 15.53%, a common equity tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 11.27%, a tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 11.27%, and a tier 1 leverage ratio of 9.59%. These risk-based capital ratios compare to a total risk-based capital ratio of 15.49%, a common equity tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 11.28%, a tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 11.28%, and a tier 1 leverage ratio of 9.70% at June 30, 2024. All of these ratios remain well in excess of the mandated minimum regulatory requirements.\n\nNon-performing loans include non-accrual loans and accruing loans 90 days or more past due. At September 30, 2024, non-performing loans totaled $125.3 million, compared to $93.0 million at June 30, 2024 and $51.8 million at September 30, 2023. The non-performing loans to total loans ratio was 1.09% compared to 0.81% on a linked quarter basis. These levels of non-performing loans compare to 0.46% at September 30, 2023. The current quarter's increase in non-performing loans was mainly related to a single AD&C loan with the total outstanding principal balance of $28.0 million, which was placed on a non-accrual status during the current period. Total net charge-offs for the current quarter amounted to $0.7 million compared to $0.2 million for the second quarter of 2024 and $0.1 million for the third quarter of 2023.\n\nAt September 30, 2024, the allowance for credit losses was $131.4 million or 1.14% of outstanding loans and 105% of non-performing loans, compared to $125.9 million or 1.10% of outstanding loans and 135% of non-performing loans at the end of the previous quarter and $123.4 million or 1.09% of outstanding loans and 238% of non-performing loans at the end of the third quarter of 2023. The increase in the allowance for the current quarter compared to the previous quarter mainly reflects higher individual reserves on collateral-dependent non-accrual loans, primarily driven by the aforementioned AD&C lending relationship, partially offset by lower qualitative adjustments as a result of declines in commercial investor real estate loans.\n\n**Income Statement Review**\n\n_Quarterly Results_\n\nNet income was $16.2 million ($0.36 per diluted common share) for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to $22.8 million ($0.51 per diluted common share) for the three months ended June 30, 2024 and $20.7 million ($0.46 per diluted common share) for the prior year quarter. The current quarter's core earnings were $17.9 million ($0.40 per diluted common share), compared to $24.4 million ($0.54 per diluted common share) for the previous quarter and $27.8 million ($0.62 per diluted common share) for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. The decreases in the current quarter's net income and core earnings compared to the previous quarter were driven primarily by higher provision for credit losses and non-interest expense.\n\nNet interest income for the third quarter of 2024 increased $1.1 million or 1% compared to the previous quarter and declined $3.7 million or 4% compared to the third quarter of 2023. During the current quarter, interest income increased $5.0 million, while interest expense increased $3.9 million. The rising interest rate environment was primarily responsible for a $7.7 million year-over-year increase in interest income. This growth in interest income was more than offset by the $11.4 million year-over-year growth in interest expense as funding costs have also risen in response to the rising rate environment and significant competition for deposits.\n\nThe net interest margin was 2.44% for the third quarter of 2024 compared to 2.46% for the second quarter of 2024 and 2.55% for the third quarter of 2023. The decrease in the net interest margin during the current quarter was a result of a seven basis point increase in the rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities, while the yield earned on interest-earning assets rose three basis points. The current quarter's net interest margin was negatively impacted by approximately three basis points due to the reversal of previously accrued uncollected interest income on a single large AD&C loan placed on non-accrual status during the period. As compared to the prior year quarter, the yield on interest-earning assets increased 23 basis points while the rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities rose 39 basis points, resulting in net interest margin compression of 11 basis points. The rate and yield increases year-over-year were driven by the higher interest rate environment, competition for deposits in the market, and customer movement of excess funds out of noninterest-bearing accounts into higher yielding products.\n\nThe total provision for credit losses was $6.3 million for the third quarter of 2024 compared to $1.0 million for the previous quarter and $2.4 million for the third quarter of 2023. The provision for credit losses directly attributable to the funded loan portfolio was $6.3 million for the current quarter compared to $3.0 million for the second quarter of 2024 and $3.2 million for the third quarter of 2023. The current quarter's provision is mainly a reflection of higher individual reserves on collateral-dependent non-accrual loans, primarily associated with the provision on a single AD&C lending relationship based on the current fair value of the collateral, partially offset by lower qualitative adjustments driven by an overall reduction in commercial investor real estate loan portfolio. In addition, during the current quarter, the reserve for unfunded commitments remained relatively stable at $1.5 million.\n\nNon-interest income for the third quarter of 2024 increased by 1% or $0.1 million compared to the linked quarter and grew by 13% or $2.3 million compared to the prior year quarter. The current quarter's increase in non-interest income as compared to the previous quarter was mainly driven by the $0.4 million increase in other income, generated by credit-related fees, and $0.3 million increase in wealth management income, due to the $352.1 million or 6% growth in assets under management quarter-over-quarter and the overall favorable market performance, offset by $0.5 million decrease in BOLI income, due to the receipt of one-time death proceeds in the prior quarter.\n\nNon-interest expense for the third quarter of 2024 increased $4.8 million or 7% compared to the second quarter of 2024 and $0.5 million or 1% compared to the third quarter of 2023. The quarter-over-quarter increase is predominantly attributable to the $3.2 million increase in salaries and benefits, due to the increase in employee incentive compensation coupled with the $1.6 million increase in professional fees and services, mostly due to a one-time contract negotiation fee. The prior year quarter included $8.2 million of pension settlement expense related to the termination of the Company's pension plan. Excluding this item, non-interest expense for the third quarter of 2024 increased $8.6 million or 13% compared to the third quarter of 2023.\n\nFor the third quarter of 2024, the GAAP efficiency ratio was 72.12% compared to 68.19% for the second quarter of 2024 and 70.72% for the third quarter of 2023. The GAAP efficiency ratio rose from the prior year quarter primarily as a result of the 1% increase in GAAP non-interest expense coupled with the 1% decline in GAAP revenue. The non-GAAP efficiency ratio was 69.06% for the current quarter as compared to 65.31% for the second quarter of 2024 and 60.91% for the third quarter of 2023. The increase in the non-GAAP efficiency ratio (reflecting a decrease in efficiency) from the third quarter of the prior year to the current year quarter was primarily the result of the 12% increase in adjusted non-interest expense.\n\nROA for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 was 0.46% and ROTCE was 5.88% compared to 0.66% and 8.27%, respectively, for the second quarter of 2024 and 0.58% and 7.42%, respectively, for the third quarter of 2023. On a non-GAAP basis, the current quarter's core ROA was 0.50% and core ROTCE was 5.88% compared to 0.70% and 8.27% for the second quarter of 2024 and 0.78% and 9.51%, respectively, for the third quarter of 2023.\n\n_Year-to-Date Results_\n\nThe Company recorded net income of $59.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to net income of $96.7 million for the same period in the prior year. Core earnings were $64.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to $107.2 million for the same period in the prior year. Year-to-date net income and core earnings declined as a result of lower net interest income in combination with higher provision for credit losses, which was partially offset by higher non-interest income.\n\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net interest income decreased $31.8 million compared to the prior year as a result of the $61.1 million increase in interest expense, partially offset by the $29.3 million increase in interest income. The increase in interest expense was driven by the interest expense on deposits, primarily associated with savings and time deposit accounts. The net interest margin declined to 2.44% for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 2.75% for the prior year, primarily as a result of higher funding costs due to the elevated interest rate environment and market competition for deposits during the period.\n\nThe provision for credit losses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was $9.7 million as compared to a credit of $14.1 million for 2023. The provision for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to an increase in individual reserves on collateral-dependent non-accrual loans, as well as adjustments applied to specific industries within the commercial real estate segment during the first quarter of 2024. The prior year's credit to provision was mainly attributable to the improving regional forecasted unemployment rate observed during the first half of 2023, and the declining probability of economic recession.\n\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, non-interest income increased 14% to $57.7 million compared to $50.5 million for 2023. During the current year, wealth management income increased $3.7 million or 14%, as assets under management increased $1.0 billion or 19% year-over-year. In addition, BOLI mortality-related income and service charges on deposit accounts increased $1.3 million and $1.1 million, respectively.\n\nNon-interest expense increased to $209.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $207.9 million for 2023. The drivers of the increase in non-interest expense were the $4.0 million increase in professional fees and services, $2.7 increase in amortization of intangible assets, $1.8 million increase in FDIC expense, and $1.2 million increase in outside data services. These year-over-year increases were offset by the $9.2 million decrease in compensation and benefits, as the prior year period included $8.2 million pension termination expense and $1.9 million of severance related expenses associated with staffing adjustments.\n\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the GAAP efficiency ratio was 69.98% compared to 64.29% for the same period in 2023. The non-GAAP efficiency ratio for the current year was 67.04% compared to 59.42% for the prior year. The growth in the current year’s GAAP and non-GAAP efficiency ratios compared to the prior year, indicating a decline in efficiency, was the result of the declines in GAAP and non-GAAP revenues combined with the growth in GAAP and non-GAAP non-interest expenses.\n\n**Explanation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures**\n\nThis news release contains financial information and performance measures determined by methods other than in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”). The Company’s management believes that the supplemental non-GAAP information provides a better comparison of period-to-period operating performance.

June 30, 2024, the balance sheet is liability sensitive, so net interest income is projected to increase in a falling rate environment and decrease in a rising rate environment.\n▪ The modest decrease in net interest income at risk during the current year is a result of a higher proportion of variable rate and soon to be repricing assets and liabilities on the\nbalance sheet compared to year end, in the form of more floating rate loans and more high yield savings accounts.\n▪ The slight decrease in EVE at risk is a reflection of a higher proportion of variable rate and soon to be repricing assets and liabilities.\n16\nNon-interest Income\nStronger market conditions and client acquisition drive higher wealth management fees\nRevenue Composition\nBank Card\nRevenue Service\nOther

135% of non-performing loans at June 30, 2024\n▪ The increase in the provision during the current quarter was a product of higher individual reserves on collateral-dependent loans along with overall growth of the loan portfolio,\npartially offset by lower qualitative adjustments due to reduction of the commercial investor real estate segment. In addition, during the current quarter, the reserve for unfunded\ncommitments decreased by $1.9 million as a result of higher utilization rates on lines of credit.\n▪ U z J 2024 M ’\n20\n( $ th o u s a n d s )\nIn v e s to r R e a l E s ta te\nO w n e r - O c c u p ie d R e a l E\nC o m m e r c ia l A D & C\nC o m m e r c ia l B u s in e s s\nT o ta l C o m m e r c ia l\nR e s id e n tia l M o r tg a g e\nR e s id e n tia l C o n s tr u c tio n\nC o n s u m e r\nT o ta l R e s id e n tia l a n d C o\nA llo w a n c e fo r C r e d it L o s\ns ta te\nn s u m\ns e s\ne r\n2 Q 2\n$ 6 1 ,0\n9 ,2\n1 0 ,2\n2 7 ,9\n1 0 8 ,4\n9 ,1\n8\n1 ,8\n1 1 ,8\n$ 1 2 0 ,2\n0\n8\n3\n0\n1\n3\n6\n5\n4\n5\n8\n2\n7\n0\n0\n4\n1\n1\n0\n5\n6\n7\n3 3 Q 2\n$ 6 3 ,1\n8 ,9\n9 ,1\n3 0 ,7\n1 1 1 ,9\n8 ,4\n6\n2 ,2\n1 1 ,3\n$ 1 2 3 ,3\n0\n9\n6\n0\n2\n7\n9\n7\n1\n8\n6\n2\n2\n1\n0\n0\n3\n9\n2\n6\n7\n0\n3 4 Q 2\n$ 6 1 ,4\n7 ,5\n8 ,2\n3 1 ,9\n1 0 9 ,1\n8 ,8\n7\n2 ,0\n1 1 ,6\n$ 1 2 0 ,8\n0\n3\n3\n8\n3\n9\n9\n2\n5\n7\n6\n2\n9\n6\n7\n2\n4\n0\n9\n2\n1\n5\n3 1 Q 2\n$ 6 4 ,2\n6 ,9\n1 0 ,8\n2 9 ,0\n1 1 1 ,0\n9 ,0\n4\n2 ,4\n1 2 ,0\n$ 1 2 3 ,0\n0\n9\n0\n4\n3\n8\n9\n2\n9\n0\n9\n2\n9\n7\n5\n7\n8\n1\n3\n4\n8\n6\n4 2 Q 2\n$ 6 3 ,8\n6 ,8\n1 2 ,4\n3 0 ,2\n1 1 3 ,4\n9 ,4\n3\n2 ,6\n1 2 ,4\n$ 1 2 5 ,8\n0\n9\n7\n3\n0\n1\n8\n6\n0\n5\n6\n2\n8\n7\n6\n0\n1\n8\n2\n2\n2\n3\n4\nStrong Credit Culture and Performance\nIncrease this quarter in non-performing loans related to several loans within the owner-occupied commercial real estate segment\nNon-performing Assets / Total Assets Ann.

Sandy\nSpring Bancorp’s management believes that the supplemental non-GAAP information provides a better comparison of period-to-period operating performance. Additionally, Sandy Spring Bancorp believes this\ninformation is utilized by regulators and market analysts to evaluate a company’s financial condition and, therefore, such information is useful to investors. Non-GAAP measures used in this presentation consist of\nthe following:\n• efficiency ratio\n• tangible common equity\n• core earnings\nEfficiency Ratio. Management views the GAAP efficiency ratio as an important financial measure of expense performance and cost management. The ratio expresses the level of non-interest expenses as a\npercentage of total revenue (net interest income plus total non-interest income). Lower ratios indicate improved productivity. In general, the efficiency ratio is non-interest expenses as a percentage of net interest\nincome plus non-interest income. Noninterest expenses used in the calculation of the non-GAAP efficiency ratio excludes intangible asset amortization and non-recurring or extraordinary items. Non-interest income\nis adjusted to exclude securities gains and losses and nonrecurring or extraordinary items, and net interest income is adjusted to include tax-equivalent income. The measure is different from the GAAP efficiency\nratio, which also is presented in this document. The GAAP measure is calculated using non-interest expense and income amounts as shown on the face of the Consolidated Statements of Income. The GAAP and\nnon-GAAP efficiency ratios are reconciled and provided in the following table.\nTangible Common Equity. Tangible equity, tangible assets and tangible book value per share are non-GAAP financial measures calculated using GAAP amounts. Tangible common equity and tangible assets\nexclude the balances of goodwill and other intangible assets from stockholder’s equity and total assets, respectively. Management believes that this non-GAAP financial measure provides information to investors\nthat may be useful in understanding our financial condition. Because not all companies use the same calculation of tangible equity and tangible assets, this presentation may not be comparable to other similarly titled\nmeasures calculated by other companies.\nCore Earnings. Core earnings is a non-GAAP financial measure calculated using GAAP amounts. Core earnings reflect net income for the period exclusive of merger, acquisition and disposal expense, amortization\nof intangible assets, and other nonrecurring or extraordinary items, in each case net of tax. Management believes that this non-GAAP financial measure provides helpful information to investors in understanding the\nCompany’s core operating earnings and provides a better comparison of period-to-period operating performance of the Company.\n30\nReconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures - QTD\n(Dollars in thousands) 2Q 2023 3Q 2023 4Q 2023 1Q 2024 2Q 2024\nPre-tax pre-provision income (Non-GAAP) .\nPre-tax pre-provision income: $ 24,745 $ 20,746 $ 26,100 $ 20,372 $ 22,807\nNet income\nPlus/(less) non-GAAP adjustments:\nIncome taxes 8,711 6,890 8,459 6,944 7,941\nProvision/(credit) for credit losses 5,055 2,365 (3,445) 2,388 1,020\nPre-tax pre-provision net income $ 38,511 $ 30,001 $ 31,114 $ 29,704 $ 31,768\nEfficiency ratio -GAAP basis .\nNon-interest expenses $ 69,136 $ 72,471 $ 67,142 $ 68,006 $ 68,104\nNet interest income plus non-interest income 107,647 102,472 98,256 97,710 99,872\nEfficiency ratio -GAAP basis 64.22 % 70.72 % 68.33 % 69.60 % 68.19 %\nEfficiency ratio -Non-GAAP basis\nNon-interest expenses $ 69,136 $ 72,471 $ 67,142 $ 68,006 $ 68,104\nLess non-GAAP adjustments:\nAmortization of intangible assets 1,269 1,245 1,403 2,069 2,135\nSeverance expense 1,939 — — — —\nPension settlement expense — 8,157 — — —\nNon-interest expenses - as adjusted $ 65,928 $ 63,069 $ 65,739 $ 65,937 $ 65,969\nNet interest income plus non-interest income $ 107,647 $ 102,472 $ 98,256 $ 97,710 $ 99,872\nPlus non-GAAP adjustment:\nTax-equivalent income 1,006 1,068 1,113 1,099 1,139\nLess non-GAAP adjustments:\nInvestment securities gains/(losses) — — — — —\nNet interest income plus non-interest income -as adjusted $ 108,653 $ 103,540 $ 99,369 $ 98,809 $ 101,011\nEfficiency ratio -Non-GAAP basis 60.68 % 60.91 % 66.16 % 66.73 % 65.31 %\n31\nTangible Common Equity-QTD\n(Dollars in thousands except per share data) 2Q 2023 3Q 2023 4Q 2023 1Q 2024 2Q 2024\nTangible common equity ratio:\nTotal stockholders' equity $ 1,539,032 $ 1,537,914 $ 1,588,142 $ 1,589,364 $ 1,599,004\nGoodwill (363,436) (363,436) (363,436) (363,436) (363,436)\nOther intangible assets, net (17,280) (16,035) (28,301) (29,864) (30,087)\nTangible common equity $ 1,158,316 $ 1,158,443 $ 1,196,405 $ 1,196,064 $ 1,205,481\nTotal assets $ 13,994,545 $ 14,135,085 $ 14,028,172 $ 13,888,133 $ 14,008,343\nGoodwill (363,436) (363,436) (363,436) (363,436) (363,436)\nOther intangible assets, net (17,280) (16,035) (28,301) (29,864) (30,087)\nTangible assets $ 13,613,829 $ 13,755,614 $ 13,636,435 $ 13,494,833 $ 13,614,820\nCommon shares outstanding 44,862,369 44,895,158 44,913,561 44,940,147 45,109,671\nTangible common equity ratio 8.51 % 8.42 % 8.77 % 8.86 % 8.85 %\nBook value per common share $ 34.31 $ 34.26 $ 35.36 $ 35.37 $ 35.45\nTangible book value per common share $ 25.82 $ 25.80 $ 26.64 $ 26.61 $ 26.72\n32\nCore Earnings - QTD\n(Dollars in thousands except per share data) 2Q 2023 3Q 2023 4Q 2023 1Q 2024 2Q 2024\nCore Earnings:\nNet income(GAAP) $ 24,745 $ 20,746 $ 26,100 $ 20,372 $ 22,807\nPlus/(less) non-GAAP adjustments (net of tax):\nAmortization of intangible assets 946 932 1,047 1,544 1,593\nSeverance Expense 1,445 — — — —\nPension settlement expense — 6,088 — — —\nCore earnings (non-GAAP) $ 27,136 $ 27,766 $ 27,147 $ 21,916 $ 24,400\nCore return on average assets (non-GAAP)\nAverage assets (GAAP) $14,094,653 $14,086,342 $14,090,423 $14,061,935 $13,956,261\nReturn on average assets (GAAP) 0.70 % 0.58 % 0.73 % 0.58 % 0.66 %\nCore return on average assets (non-GAAP) 0.77 % 0.78 % 0.76 % 0.63 % 0.70 %\nWeighted average common shares outstanding -diluted (GAAP) 44,888,759 44,960,455 45,009,574 45,086,471 45,145,214\nEarning per diluted common share (GAAP) $ 0.55 $ 0.46 $ 0.58 $ 0.45 $ 0.51\nCore earnings per diluted common share (non-GAAP) $ 0.60 $ 0.62 $ 0.60 $ 0.49 $ 0.54\n33"
