Business\nOverview\nWe are a commercial-stage pharmaceutical company pioneering novel cancer therapies and dedicated to the discovery,\ndevelopment and commercialization of first-in-class drugs directed against nuclear export for the treatment of cancer and other\ndiseases. Our scientific expertise is based upon an understanding of the regulation of intracellular communication between the nucleus\nand the cytoplasm. We have discovered and are developing and commercializing novel, small molecule Selective Inhibitor of Nuclear\nExport (“SINE”) compounds that inhibit the nuclear export protein exportin 1 (“XPO1”). These SINE compounds represent a new\nclass of drug candidates with a novel mechanism of action that have the potential to treat a variety of diseases with high unmet\nmedical need. Our lead asset, XPOVIO® (selinexor), was the first oral XPO1 inhibitor to receive marketing approval, receiving its\ninitial U.S. approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) in July 2019, and is currently approved and marketed in\nthe U.S. for the following indications:\n• In combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone for the treatment of adult patients with multiple myeloma who have\nreceived at least one prior therapy. Approval in this indication was based on the results from the BOSTON (Bortezomib,\nSelinexor and Dexamethasone) study (the “BOSTON Study”);\n• In combination with dexamethasone for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma\n(“RRMM”) who have received at least four prior therapies and whose disease is refractory to at least two proteasome\ninhibitors (“PIs”), at least two immunomodulatory agents (“IMiDs”), and an anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody (“mAb”).\nWe refer to myeloma that is refractory to these five agents as penta-refractory. Approval in this indication was based on\nthe results from the STORM (Selinexor Treatment of Refractory Myeloma) study (the “STORM Study”); and\n• For the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (“DLBCL”), not otherwise\nspecified, including DLBCL arising from follicular lymphoma, after at least two lines of systemic therapy. This\nindication was approved under accelerated approval based on response rate and was based on the results from the\nSADAL (Selinexor Against Diffuse Aggressive Lymphoma) study (the “SADAL Study”). Continued approval for this\nindication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial.\nThe commercialization of XPOVIO in the U.S. is currently supported by sales representatives, nurse liaisons, and a market\naccess team, as well as KaryForward™, an extensive patient and healthcare provider support program. Our commercial efforts are also\nsupplemented by patient support initiatives coordinated by our dedicated network of participating specialty pharmacy providers. We\nplan to continue to educate physicians, other healthcare providers and patients about XPOVIO’s clinical profile and unique\nmechanism of action as we continue to expand XPOVIO use.\nThe commercialization of XPOVIO and NEXPOVIO® (selinexor) (the brand name for selinexor in Europe and the United\nKingdom (“UK”)) outside of the U.S. is managed by our partners in their respective territories, as described under “Collaborations”\nbelow. XPOVIO/NEXPOVIO has received regulatory approval in various indications in over 40 countries outside the U.S. and is\ncommercially available in a growing number of countries as our partners continue to secure reimbursement approvals.\nOur primary focus is on marketing XPOVIO in its currently approved indications as well as developing and seeking the\nregulatory approval of selinexor as an oral agent targeting multiple high unmet need cancer indications, including our core programs\nin endometrial cancer, multiple myeloma, and myelofibrosis (“MF”). We plan to continue to conduct clinical trials and to seek\nadditional approvals for the use of selinexor as a single agent or in combination with other oncology therapies to expand the patient\npopulations that are eligible for treatment with selinexor. In January 2024, we announced that further clinical development of our\neltanexor program is on hold in an effort to focus our resources on our prioritized late-stage programs.\nOur Strategy\nAt Karyopharm we are passionate about our mission to positively impact patient lives and defeat cancer. With our first-in-class\nSINE technology, our foundation is in our science. Our vision is to be a leading innovator that develops and commercializes\ntransformative medicines for patients and society. There are four key pillars that we believe will drive our underlying value and\nprovide significant market opportunities for us.\n• Maximize the Commercial Value of XPOVIO in Multiple Myeloma. We are building upon our existing U.S. multiple\nmyeloma foundation as we continue to expand the breadth and depth of XPOVIO’s use with earlier line patients. We\nexpect to focus on growing sales in our approved U.S. indications by establishing XPOVIO as a novel effective modality\n5\nthat can become a standard of care in the second to fourth-line treatment setting following treatment with anti-CD38\ntherapy. With our global partners, we plan to maximize the global opportunity to bring XPOVIO to patients worldwide.\n• Focus on our Prioritized Clinical Pipeline. Our science enables us to potentially make a big difference in the lives of\npatients and we are focused on three priority clinical programs: multiple myeloma, endometrial cancer, and MF. Our\nclinical pipeline has been consciously and strategically focused to target cancers with high unmet need and a high\nprobability of success based on the potential to provide meaningful clinical benefit to patients, potential regulatory\napproval, and supportive data. We will also continue to expand our understanding of the role nuclear transport plays in\nthe underlying biology of cancer through focused signal seeking activities to identify future opportunities in other\noncology indications for our SINE technology that may provide support for additional clinical investigation.\n• Provide Strong Leadership. We believe we have the right people in place and a strong leadership team with the ability\nto help position us to achieve scientific, clinical and commercial goals and to execute on our key corporate objectives.\nWe strive to be a top-talent destination for those who desire to make a difference in patients’ lives.\n• Maintain a Well-capitalized Business to Execute our Core Objectives. We are focused on maintaining a well-\ncapitalized business that will enable the advancement of our clinical development opportunities.\nOur Programs to Treat Cancer\nOverview\nCancer cells develop when there is dysregulation of genes that regulate critical cellular behaviors, such as cell growth and\nsurvival. The abnormal control over gene function is most often due to damage to DNA. Proteins called tumor suppressor proteins can\nmonitor genes encoded in DNA for damage, and if damage is detected, the tumor suppressor proteins will direct the cell to attempt to\nrepair it, or if the DNA damage is too severe, the tumor suppressor proteins will direct the cell to die in a process called apoptosis. In\nthis way tumor suppressor proteins can prevent healthy cells that acquire DNA damage from turning into cancer cells, and thus cancer\ncells need to functionally inactivate tumor suppressor proteins in order to survive.\nMany tumor suppressor proteins can only function properly when they are located inside of a cell’s nucleus. Proteins, however,\nare not made inside the nucleus but rather are made outside of the nucleus in an area called the cytoplasm. A membrane, called the\nnuclear membrane, separates the nucleus from the cytoplasm. Larger nuclear proteins, including many tumor suppressor proteins,\nmust be transported from the cytoplasm into the nucleus to perform their functions in keeping a cell healthy. Similarly, these proteins\ncan also be exported back into the cytoplasm. Proteins move from the nucleus to the cytoplasm through a protein complex embedded\nin the nuclear membrane called the nuclear pore. The nuclear pore works like a gate through which large molecules, including many\nproteins and ribonucleic acids, enter and exit the nucleus. When molecules enter the nucleus from the cytoplasm, the process is called\nimport, and when molecules exit from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, the process is called export. The import and export of most\nproteins and other large molecules between the nucleus and cytoplasm require specific carrier proteins to chaperone their cargo\nmolecules through the nuclear pore complex. Carrier proteins, which mediate the import of macromolecules into the nucleus, are\ncalled importins, and those which mediate the export of macromolecules out of the nucleus are called exportins. Therefore, the\nprocesses of import and export are carried out separately and are typically regulated independently.\nOne way that cancers functionally inactivate tumor suppressor proteins is via overproduction of a specific chaperone protein\ncalled XPO1. XPO1 is one of eight exportins that have been identified in human cells, and it exports over 220 proteins referred to as\nits “cargo proteins.” In particular, XPO1 appears to be the sole exporter for many critical tumor suppressor proteins that function in\nthe cell nucleus, including p53, p73, p21, p27, APC, FOXO, pRB and survivin. In addition to exporting tumor suppressor proteins out\nof the nucleus, XPO1 mediates the nuclear export of a protein called eukaryotic initiation factor 4E, which itself binds to the\nmessenger ribonucleic acids (“mRNAs”) that encode many growth-regulating proteins, including c-myc, bcl-2, bcl-6 and cyclin D.\nXPO1 carries these growth-promoting mRNAs from the nucleus into the cytoplasm where they are translated into proteins that\npromote cancer cell growth. XPO1 also exports the anti-inflammatory (and anti-tumor) protein IκB, which inhibits a protein called\nNF-κB. NF-κB is found in the nucleus of most cancer cells and plays a role in cancer metastasis and chemotherapy resistance, as well\nas in many inflammatory and autoimmune diseases.\nIn certain cancer cells, XPO1 levels are reported to be elevated when compared to their healthy cell counterparts. Therefore,\nthese elevated levels of XPO1 in cancer cells mediate the rapid export of tumor suppressor proteins as well as IκB and eIF4E out of\nthe nucleus and can lead to reduced monitoring for DNA damage, the normal triggering of apoptosis and increased inflammation\nactivity. Higher levels of XPO1 expression in cancer cells has also been correlated with resistance to chemotherapy and poor\nprognosis in patients.\n6\nMechanism of Action of Our SINE Compounds - Inhibition of XPO1\nSelinexor and eltanexor are novel therapies that are oral SINE compounds specifically designed to force nuclear accumulation\nof multiple tumor suppressor proteins that function in the nucleus. Selinexor and eltanexor also force nuclear accumulation of growth\npromoting mRNAs by similarly preventing their export, which prevents the translation of these mRNAs into proteins and thereby\nlowers expression of the growth promoting proteins that these mRNAs encode. The forced nuclear retention of these proteins can\ncounteract a multitude of the cancer-promoting pathways that allow cancer cells with gene dysregulation to continue to grow and\ndivide in an unrestrained fashion. Because normal cells have little or no DNA damage to cause gene dysregulation, accumulation of\ntumor suppressor proteins in their nucleus generally does not lead to apoptosis. The figure below depicts the process by which our\nSINE compounds inhibit the XPO1-mediated nuclear export of tumor suppressor proteins and oncoprotein mRNAs.\nWe believe that the novel mechanism of action, oral administration and low levels of major organ toxicities observed to date in\npatients treated with our SINE compounds, along with encouraging efficacy data, support the potential for their broad use across many\ncancer types, including both hematological and solid tumor malignancies. Unlike many other targeted therapeutic approaches that only\nwork for a specific set of cancers or in a specific subgroup of patients, we believe that by restoring tumor suppressor proteins to the\nnucleus where they can access a cell’s DNA, our SINE compounds may provide therapeutic benefits across a broad range of cancer\ntypes and can potentially benefit a wider range of patients. Additionally, and as supported by their unique mechanism of action, and\npreclinical, clinical and post-approval data, we believe that our SINE compounds have shown additive or synergistic benefit with\napproved and experimental therapies in treating cancer patients and, therefore, have the potential to serve as a backbone therapy across\nmultiple hematological and solid tumor malignancies as part of a variety of combination therapies.\nOur Pipeline and Key Clinical Trials\nOral selinexor is being evaluated in multiple early, mid and late-stage clinical trials in patients with hematological and solid\ntumor malignancies, including both in the first line and in the relapsed and/or refractory setting. In general, relapsed disease refers to\ndisease that progresses following the expiration of a specified period of time after discontinuation of therapy and refractory disease\nrefers to disease that progresses while the patient is on therapy or within a specified period of time after discontinuation of therapy.\nKey clinical trials of selinexor and eltanexor are summarized in the chart below. In addition to these studies, there are multiple\nongoing investigator-sponsored clinical trials being conducted in a variety of hematological and solid tumor malignancies, post-\nmarketing requirements, and potential signal seeking studies to further expand our development program in the future.\n7\nOUR SELINEXOR PROGRAM\nWe are currently evaluating selinexor in certain hematological and solid tumor malignancies, including multiple myeloma,\nendometrial cancer, MF and DLBCL.\nMultiple Myeloma\nOverview\nMultiple myeloma is a hematological malignancy characterized by the accumulation of monoclonal plasma cells in the bone\nmarrow, the presence of monoclonal immunoglobulin, also known as M protein, in the serum or urine, bone destruction, kidney\ndisease and immunodeficiency. Multiple myeloma is the second most common blood cancer in the world and there is currently no\ncure. The American Cancer Society (the “ACS”) estimates that nearly 36,000 new cases of multiple myeloma will be diagnosed in the\nU.S. in 2024. Myeloma occurs most commonly in people over age 65 and the risk of developing multiple myeloma increases with age.\nThe treatment of multiple myeloma has improved over the last 20 years due to the use of high-dose chemotherapy and\nautologous stem cell transplantation, which is restricted to healthier, often younger patients. Treatment decisions are based on\nphysician and patient choice rather than clear treatment guidelines, with the current standard of care being to switch drug classes once\na regimen stops working. In addition to our XPO1 inhibitor, a number of non-chemotherapy drugs such as PIs, IMiDs, mAbs,\nbispecific antibodies, and CAR-T therapy, have also emerged as treatment options within the last two decades. The introduction of\nthese non-chemotherapeutic novel agents has led to a significant increase in the survival of patients with multiple myeloma. However,\ndespite the wide variety of newly approved or experimental therapies that are being used to treat patients with relapsed and/or\nrefractory disease either alone or in combination, nearly all patients will eventually succumb to their disease. With nearly 12,500\ndeaths from multiple myeloma in the U.S. alone estimated for 2024 according to the ACS, we believe that there remains a need for\ntherapies for patients whose disease has relapsed after, or is refractory to, available therapy or for whom current therapy is not\nsuitable.\nXPOVIO is currently approved to treat multiple myeloma in adult patients who have received at least one prior therapy based on\ndata from the BOSTON Study and in adult patients with penta-refractory multiple myeloma based on data from the STORM Study.\nIn September 2023, the National Comprehensive Cancer Network Clinical Practice Guidelines (the “NCCN Guidelines”)\nelevated XPOVIO in combination with Velcade® (bortezomib) and dexamethasone (“XVd”) to a preferred and category 1 regimen for\nlenalidomide- refractory patients with RRMM who have received one-to-three prior lines of therapy in its Clinical Practice Guidelines\nin Oncology. The NCCN Guidelines are a comprehensive set of guidelines detailing the sequential management decisions and\ninterventions that currently apply to 97% of cancers affecting patients in the U.S. and are intended to ensure that all patients receive\npreventive, diagnostic, treatment and supportive services that will most likely lead to optimal outcomes.\n8\nThe BOSTON Study\nThe December 2020 FDA approval of XPOVIO in combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone for the treatment of adult\npatients with multiple myeloma who have received at least one prior therapy was based on the results of the BOSTON Study, a multi-\ncenter, Phase 3, randomized study conducted at over 150 clinical sites internationally. The BOSTON Study evaluated 402 adult\npatients with RRMM who had received one to three prior lines of therapy. The study was designed to compare the efficacy, safety and\ncertain health-related quality of life parameters of once-weekly oral selinexor in combination with once-weekly administration of\nVelcade® plus low-dose dexamethasone (the “XVd Arm”) versus twice-weekly administration of Velcade® plus dexamethasone (the\n“Vd Arm”). The primary endpoint of the study was progression-free survival (“PFS”) and key secondary endpoints included overall\nresponse rate (“ORR”) and the rate of peripheral neuropathy (“PN”), among others. Additionally, the BOSTON Study allowed for\npatients on the Vd Arm to crossover to the XVd Arm following objective (quantitative) progression of disease verified by an\nIndependent Review Committee (“IRC”).\nDespite the study having a high proportion of patients with high-risk cytogenetics (approximately 50%), the median PFS in the\nXVd Arm was 13.9 months compared to 9.5 months in the Vd Arm, representing a 4.4 month (47%) increase in median PFS (hazard\nratio (“HR”) of 0.70; p=0.0075). The XVd Arm also demonstrated a significantly greater ORR compared to the Vd Arm (76.4% vs.\n62.3%, p=0.0012).\nFurther, XVd therapy demonstrated a significantly higher rate of deep responses, defined as ≥ Very Good Partial Response\n(“VGPRs”) compared to Vd therapy (44.6% vs. 32.4%) as well as a longer median duration of response (“DOR”) (20.3 months vs.\n12.9 months). Additionally, 17% of patients on the XVd arm achieved a Complete Response (“CR”) or a Stringent Complete\nResponse (“sCR”) as compared to 10% of patients receiving Vd therapy. All responses were confirmed by an IRC. Rates of PN were\nsignificantly lower for patients receiving XVd therapy compared to those receiving Vd therapy (32% vs. 47%). In addition, PN rates ≥\ngrade 2 were also significantly lower in the XVd Arm compared to the Vd Arm (21% vs. 34%).\nThe most common adverse reactions (≥20%) in patients who received XVd were fatigue (59%), nausea (50%), decreased\nappetite (35%), diarrhea (32%), peripheral neuropathy (32%), upper respiratory tract infection (29%), decreased weight (26%),\ncataract (22%) and vomiting (21%). Grade 3-4 laboratory abnormalities (≥10%) were thrombocytopenia, lymphopenia,\nhypophosphatemia, anemia, hyponatremia and neutropenia. In the BOSTON Study, fatal adverse reactions occurred in 6% of patients\nwithin 30 days of last treatment. Serious adverse reactions occurred in 52% of patients who received XVd. Treatment discontinuation\nrate due to adverse reactions was 19%.\nIn June 2023, we presented data from an unplanned subgroup analysis of BOSTON patients without prior PI exposure (XVd: n\n= 47; Vd: n= 48) at the 2023 European Hematology Association Hybrid Congress, which analysis demonstrated an approximate\ntripling of median PFS for XVd compared to Vd at 29.5 vs 9.7 months; HR for PFS favored XVd at 0.29 (95% Confidence Interval\n(“CI”) 0.14 - 0.63, nominal p=<0.001).\nThe STORM Study\nThe July 2019 FDA approval of XPOVIO in combination with dexamethasone for the treatment of adult patients with RRMM\nwho have received at least four prior therapies and whose disease is refractory to at least two PIs, at least two IMiDs, and an anti-\nCD38 mAb was based on the results of the STORM Study. This indication was approved under accelerated approval. As the\nBOSTON Study served as the confirmatory trial for accelerated approval for the STORM Study, the BOSTON supplemental New\nDrug Application (“sNDA”) approval in December 2020 fulfilled the requirement of an accelerated approval.\nThe STORM Study was a global, multi-center, single-arm Phase 2b clinical trial evaluating oral selinexor in combination with\nstandard, low-dose dexamethasone (“Xd”) in patients with heavily pretreated, RRMM. These heavily pretreated patients had a median\nof seven prior therapeutic regimens, including a median of 10 unique anti-myeloma agents. Specifically, the myeloma patients who\nwere eligible for the study had prior treatment with the two PIs, Velcade® and Kyprolis® (carfilzomib), the two IMiDs, Revlimid®\n(lenalidomide) and Pomalyst®(pomalidomide), and the anti-CD38 mAb Darzalex® (daratumumab), as well as alkylating agents, and\ntheir disease was refractory to glucocorticoids, at least one PI, at least one IMiD, Darzalex®, and their most recent therapy. In all\npatients, this myeloma was considered “triple-class refractory.”\nThe FDA’s accelerated approval of XPOVIO was based upon the efficacy and safety in a pre-specified subgroup analysis of the\n83 patients in the STORM Study with documented penta-refractory myeloma, as the benefit-risk ratio appeared to be greater in this\nmore heavily pre-treated population than in the overall trial population. In addition to multiple-refractory disease, patients in the\nSTORM Study had rapidly progressing myeloma, with a median 22% increase in disease burden in the 12 days from screening to\ninitial therapy. The ORR in this patient population was 25.3%.\n9\nFor the STORM Study’s primary endpoint, selinexor achieved an ORR of 26%, including two (2%) sCRs, six (5%) VGPRs, and\n24 (20%) partial responses (“PRs”) and the trial therefore met its primary endpoint. Both patients who had relapsed after CAR-T\ntherapy achieved PRs. Minimal response per International Myeloma Working Group criteria was observed in 16 (13%) patients and\n48 (39%) patients had stable disease. Median time to PR or better was 4.1 weeks. The clinical benefit rate, meaning a minimal\nresponse or better, was 39%. All responses were adjudicated by an IRC consisting of four independent experts in the treatment of\nmultiple myeloma.\nMedian DOR was 4.4 months. PFS was 3.7 months and overall survival (“OS”) was 8.6 months. In the 39% of patients who\nachieved a minimal response or better, median OS was 15.6 months, compared to a median OS of 1.7 months in patients whose\ndisease progressed or where response was not evaluable.\nThe most common adverse reactions (≥20%) in patients who received Xd were thrombocytopenia (74%), fatigue (73%), nausea\n(72%), anemia (59%), decreased appetite (53%), decreased weight (47%), diarrhea (44%), vomiting (41%), hyponatremia (39%),\nneutropenia (34%), leukopenia (28%), constipation (25%), dyspnea (24%) and upper respiratory tract infection (21%). In the STORM\nStudy, fatal adverse reactions occurred in 9% of patients. Serious adverse reactions occurred in 58% of patients. Treatment\ndiscontinuation rate due to adverse reactions was 27%.\nThe XPORT-MM-031/EMN29 Study\nThe EMN29 study is an ongoing randomized global Phase 3 study sponsored by the European Myeloma Network evaluating\nselinexor in combination with pomalidomide and dexamethasone (“SPd”) versus elotuzumab, pomalidomide, and dexamethasone\n(“EloPd”) in patients with RRMM (the “EMN29 Study”; NCT05028348). The EMN29 Study is expected to enroll up to 222 patients\nwho will be randomized to either SPd or EloPd and is designed to evaluate a 40 mg once weekly dose of selinexor compared to\nstandard dosing of elotuzumab in combination with pomalidomide and dexamethasone in RRMM as the immediate next line of\ntherapy after treatment with anti-CD38 antibodies. Patients enrolled in the EMN29 Study have received one to four prior lines of\ntherapy, including a PI and lenalidomide, and have had an anti-CD38 mAb in their most recent prior line of therapy. The primary\nendpoint of the EMN29 Study is PFS, with ORR, OS and DOR, among others, as secondary endpoints.\nThe determination to initiate the EMN29 Study was based on data from an all-oral arm of the Phase 1b/2 STOMP Study\n(NCT02343042) and the Phase 2 Study XPORT-MM-028 (NCT04414475) in which selinexor was evaluated in combination with\npomalidomide and low-dose dexamethasone in patients with RRMM who received at least two prior lines of therapy, including a PI\nand an IMiD. The decision to specify the patient population in the EMN29 Study as RRMM with progression of disease immediately\nafter a line of therapy which contained anti-CD38 mAb treatment was based on these same studies (NCT02343042 and\nNCT04414475) in which the subgroup of patients exposed to prior anti-CD38 therapy achieved a median PFS of 8.7 months (95% CI\n7.6, not estimable). This median PFS compares favorably to that seen with the next line of treatment in anti-CD38 exposed patients of\n4.6 months and anti-CD38 refractory patients of 3.4 months.\nThe STOMP Study: Arm 12 (selinexor in combination with mezigdomide and dexamethasone)\nIn October 2023, we entered into a clinical trial collaboration and supply agreement with Bristol-Myers Squibb Company\n(“BMS”) to evaluate mezigdomide, BMS’ proprietary investigational cereblon E3 ligase modulator (CELMoD™) agent, in\ncombination with selinexor in patients with RRMM progressing after T-cell immunotherapies. This Phase 1b/2 study will evaluate\nmezigdomide in combination with selinexor doses of either 40 mg or 60 mg once weekly plus dexamethasone in patients who have\nprior exposure to IMiDs, PIs, and anti-CD38 mAb treatment. All patients must have received at least two prior lines of therapy, and\neither have progressed after or are not eligible to receive CAR-T or bispecific antibody treatment. The primary endpoints of this trial\nare to assess the ORR and the clinical benefit rate. Key secondary endpoints include PFS, OS and DOR. In addition, the trial will\nevaluate dynamic changes in T-cell populations and activity as patients undergo treatment. Under the terms of the agreement with\nBMS, we will sponsor the study as a new arm of the STOMP Study and BMS will supply the study’s clinical drug mezigdomide.\nEndometrial Cancer\nOverview\nEndometrial cancer occurs when cells in the endometrium, which is the inner lining of uterus, begin to grow out of control and\ninvade surrounding tissues. In the U.S., endometrial cancer is the most common gynecological cancer with both incidence and\nmortality rates continuing to rise. The ACS estimates that there will be approximately 61,000 new cases of endometrial cancer\ndiagnosed in 2024 in the U.S. Approximately 16,000 women are expected to be diagnosed with advanced or metastatic endometrial\ncancer each year in the U.S. with approximately 50% of those patients having TP53 wild-type endometrial cancer. Endometrial cancer\naffects mainly post-menopausal women and the average age of women diagnosed with endometrial cancer is 60 years. Endometrial\ncancer is often detected at an early stage because it frequently produces abnormal vaginal bleeding. Standard of care treatments for\n10\npatients with endometrial cancer are based on the stage of the disease at diagnosis and the grade of the tumor, and include surgery,\nradiation therapy, chemotherapy, hormone therapy and targeted therapy. Surgery is the first treatment for almost all women with\nendometrial cancer, followed by chemotherapy and/or adjuvant radiation therapy for cases of advanced or high grade endometrial\ncancer. For many patients who respond to adjuvant therapies, the NCCN Guidelines recommend a “watch and wait” approach until the\ndisease relapses. Maintenance therapies are designed to prolong the response period and prevent relapse. There are currently no\nspecific targeted FDA approved therapies post-chemotherapy specifically indicated for patients with TP53 wild-type endometrial\ncancer. Recently, there has been an increased focus on using molecular classification of endometrial cancers to select the most\nappropriate therapies for patients. TP53 wild-type status could represent a potentially unique but fundamental biomarker in\nendometrial cancer. TP53 wild-type endometrial cancer co-occurs with both proficient mismatch repair (“pMMR”) and deficient\nmismatch repair (“dMMR”) subsets. In 2023, dostarlimab-gxly, a new treatment option post-chemotherapy was approved by the FDA\nfor patients with dMMR advanced or recurrent endometrial cancer, which represents approximately 20% of the total advanced or\nrecurrent endometrial cancer patient population, and advanced the treatment options for this subgroup. However, a large unmet need\ncontinues to exist for patients with pMMR and TP53 wild-type endometrial cancer, which represent between approximately 40% to\n55% of advanced and recurrent endometrial cancer patients.\nClinical correlative and non-clinical mechanism of action studies have shown that inhibition of XPO1 by selinexor leads to the\nnuclear accumulation and activation of p53, a well-established tumor suppressor protein encoded by the TP53 gene.\nThe EC-042 Study\nIn the fourth quarter of 2022, we initiated a global, Phase 3, randomized, double-blind study evaluating selinexor as a\nmaintenance therapy following systemic therapy in patients with TP53 wild-type advanced or recurrent endometrial cancer (the “EC-\n042 Study”; NCT05611931). The EC-042 Study is expected to enroll approximately 220 patients whose tumors are TP53 wild-type\nand who will be randomized in a 1:1 manner to receive either a 60 mg, once-weekly, administration of oral selinexor or placebo until\ndisease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or withdrawal of consent. The primary endpoint of the study is PFS, as assessed by an\ninvestigator and OS as the key secondary endpoint. Further, in connection with the EC-042 Study, we entered into a global\ncollaboration with Foundation Medicine, Inc. to develop FoundationOne®CDx, a tissue-based next generation sequencing test to\nidentify and enroll patients whose tumors are TP53 wild-type.\nThe SIENDO Study\nOur evaluation of selinexor to treat patients with TP53 wild-type advanced or recurrent endometrial cancer is supported by data\nfrom an exploratory subgroup analysis from our SIENDO Study, a multicenter, randomized, double-blinded Phase 3 study evaluating\nthe efficacy and safety of oral selinexor versus placebo as a front-line maintenance therapy in patients with advanced or recurrent\nendometrial cancer following at least one prior platinum-based combination chemotherapy treatment (the “SIENDO Study”;\nNCT03555422). Participants in the SIENDO Study with advanced or recurrent disease who had a PR or CR after at least 12 weeks of\nstandard of care taxane-platinum combination chemotherapy were randomized in a 2:1 manner to receive either maintenance therapy\nof 80 mg of selinexor or placebo taken once per week, until disease progression. The primary endpoint in the SIENDO Study is PFS\nfrom time of randomization until death or disease progression as assessed by an investigator, with the goal of the study demonstrating\na HR of 0.6.\nIn the first quarter of 2022, we presented top-line data from the SIENDO Study, including exploratory subgroup analyses.\nSelinexor-treated patients had a median PFS of 5.7 months compared to 3.8 months for patients on placebo, representing an\nimprovement of 50%, (eCRF HR of 0.70 (CI: 0.4993-0.9957), p=0.0486; IRT HR of 0.76 (CI: 0.5428-1.0759), p=0.1266) in the full\ntrial population, while patients with TP53 wild-type advanced or recurrent endometrial cancer treated with selinexor had a median\nPFS of 13.7 months compared to 3.7 months for patients on placebo. We believe that selinexor was well tolerated in the SIENDO\nStudy with no new safety signals identified, and a discontinuation rate of 10.5% due to adverse events (“AEs”). The most common\ntreatment-emergent AEs (“TEAEs”) in the SIENDO Study of any grade were: nausea (84%), vomiting (52%), constipation (37%) and\nthrombocytopenia (37%). The most common grade 3 TEAEs were nausea (10%), neutropenia (9%), thrombocytopenia (7%) and\nasthenia (6%).\nIn November 2023, we presented updated long-term safety and efficacy data from the pre-specified exploratory subgroup\nanalysis from our SIENDO Study in patients with advanced or recurrent TP53 wild-type endometrial cancer at the International\nGynecological Cancer Society Annual Global Meeting. In the exploratory subgroup analysis, 113 patients with TP53 wild-type\nendometrial cancer received selinexor (n=77) or placebo (n=36) as maintenance therapy. As of the September 1, 2023 data cut-off\ndate, selinexor-treated patients had a median PFS of 27.4 months compared to 5.2 months for patients on placebo. For the TP53 wild-\ntype population, updated data showed a HR of 0.41 (95% CI: 0.25-0.69). For patients with TP53 wild-type and pMMR endometrial\ncancer, the data showed a HR 0.32 (95% CI: 0.16-0.64) with PFS not reached after median follow-up of 31.6 months. For patients\nwith TP53 wild-type and dMMR endometrial cancer, the data showed a HR of 0.45 (95% CI: 0.16-1.27). No new safety signals were\n11\nidentified as of the September 1, 2023 data cut-off date. The most common TEAEs with selinexor treatment were nausea (90%),\nvomiting (60%), thrombocytopenia (42%) and diarrhea (42%), the majority of which were grades 1-2. The rate of nausea in the\nplacebo patients was 34%, vomiting 11%, and diarrhea 37%. The most common reported grade 3-4 TEAEs included neutropenia\n(18%), nausea (12%), and thrombocytopenia (10%). TEAEs leading to discontinuations in the selinexor group were reported in 16%\nof patients.\nMyelofibrosis\nOverview\nMF is a rare blood cancer in which excessive scar tissue (fibrosis) forms in the bone marrow and impairs its ability to produce\nnormal blood cells and can cause scarring in bone marrow, leading to severe anemia, low platelet counts, and abnormal white blood\ncell production. In addition, blood cell production may move to the spleen (causing spleen enlargement) or to other areas of the body.\nIt is estimated that there are approximately 5,000 new cases of MF each year in the U.S. and approximately 20,000 patients living with\nMF in the U.S. Although MF can occur at any age, it is more common in older patients, with a median age at diagnosis of\napproximately 65 years. During the course of the disease, MF patients could experience abdominal discomfort from increasing spleen\nand liver size, itching, night sweats, abnormal bleeding, fever, bone or joint pain and involuntary weight loss. The underlying cause of\nprimary MF has not yet been determined; however, it is associated with DNA changes in certain genes.\nThere is currently no drug therapy that can cure MF. Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (“HSCT”) is currently\nthe only treatment for MF that can provide a clinical cure; patients who are not good candidates for HSCT are treated with a JAK2\ninhibitor (“JAKi”), such as ruxolitinib, fedratinib, pacritinib or momelotinib to reduce spleen volume and improve symptoms. Not all\npatients respond adequately to a JAKi, and some patients cannot tolerate treatment or develop rapid progression on this treatment. As\nthere is currently no effective treatment for patients who are resistant to JAKi, we believe there is a high unmet need for a treatment\nwith a different mechanism of action to overcome resistance and provide improvement in primary disease management.\nIn May 2022, the FDA granted selinexor Orphan Drug Designation for the treatment of MF, and in October 2022, the European\nCommission (“EC”) granted Orphan Medicinal Product Designation for selinexor for the treatment of MF. In addition, in July 2023,\nwe received Fast Track Designation from the FDA for selinexor for the treatment of patients with MF, including primary MF, post-\nessential thrombocythemia MF, and post-polycythemia vera MF.\nThe XPORT-MF-034 Study\nIn August 2022, enrollment was completed in a Phase 1 open-label, multicenter study of selinexor to evaluate the safety,\neffectiveness and recommended dose for selinexor in combination with ruxolitinib in treatment-naïve patients with MF (the “MF-034\nStudy”; NCT04562389). In the Phase 1 dose escalation portion of the MF-034 Study, we evaluated selinexor at both the 40 mg and 60\nmg doses in combination with ruxolitinib in treatment-naïve patients with MF.\nThroughout 2023, we reported evolving data from the MF-034 Study, most recently in December 2023, when we presented\nupdated data on the Phase 1 portion of the MF-034 Study at the 65th American Society of Hematology 2023 Annual Meeting and\nExposition. The data presented were based on results as of August 1, 2023 from 24 patients who had been assigned to either a 40 mg\nor 60 mg once weekly dose of selinexor, in combination with ruxolitinib 15/20 mg BID (twice daily). At week 24, 92% of efficacy\nevaluable patients (11 out of 12) demonstrated spleen volume reduction (“SVR”) of at least 35% from baseline (“SVR35”) and 78% of\nthe evaluable patients for symptom response (7 out of 9) achieved total symptom score reduction of ≥50% (“TSS50”). At week 24,\n79% of intent-to-treat (“ITT”) patients (11 out of 14) achieved SVR35 and 58% of the ITT patients (7 out of 12) achieved\nTSS50. Patients receiving a 60 mg dose of selinexor in the MF-034 Study (14 out of 24) and who achieved SVR35 and TSS50 at week\n24 continued to remain in radiographic response as of the August 1, 2023 data cut-off date, representing a median duration of 32\nweeks and 51 weeks for SVR35 and TSS50 durability, respectively. The safety data as of the August 1, 2023 data-cutoff was\nconsistent with prior data from the MF-034 Study. The most common TEAEs for patients who received the 60 mg dose of selinexor\nwere nausea (79%), anemia (64%), thrombocytopenia (64%) and fatigue (57%), the majority of which were grades 1-2. The most\ncommon reported grade 3-4 TEAEs for patients who received the 60 mg dose of selinexor were anemia (43%) and thrombocytopenia\n(29%). There were two treatment-related discontinuations, one due to thrombocytopenia and one due to peripheral neuropathy.\nBased on the efficacy and safety data from the Phase 1 portion of the MF-034 Study supporting a 60 mg dose of selinexor as the\nrecommended dose in combination with ruxolitinib, we initiated a pivotal Phase 3 portion of the MF-034 Study in mid-2023 to\nevaluate the efficacy and safety of once-weekly selinexor in combination with ruxolitinib in JAKi-naive MF patients. The Phase 3\nportion of the MF-034 Study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study which is expected to enroll 306 JAKi-naive\npatients with intermediate or high-risk MF. Patients are randomized 2:1 to 60 mg of selinexor plus ruxolitinib or ruxolitinib plus\nplacebo. The ruxolitinib dose is determined by the investigators based on the patients’ baseline platelet count per the drug’s\n12\nprescribing information. The co-primary endpoints are SVR35 and TSS50 at week 24, with a key secondary endpoint of anemia\nresponse at week 24.\nThe XPORT-MF-044 Study\nWe are planning to initiate a Phase 2 study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of selinexor as a monotherapy in patients with\nJAKi-naïve MF and moderate thrombocytopenia (the “MF-044 Study”; NCT05980806). The MF-044 Study is currently designed to\nenroll 58 patients who will receive either 60 mg or 40 mg of selinexor as a monotherapy. The expected primary endpoint is SVR35 at\nweek 24 with key secondary endpoints of TSS50 at week 24, anemia response and pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic. Optional add-\non JAKi in addition to selinexor, including ruxolitinib, momelotinib and pacritinib, may be initiated for patients whose SVR does not\nmeet key benchmarks at weeks 12 and 24 compared to baseline.\nThe ESSENTIAL Study\nOur evaluation of selinexor to treat MF is supported by data from the ongoing Phase 2 ESSENTIAL study, an investigator-\nsponsored open-label, prospective study evaluating single-agent selinexor at a dose of 80 mg, 60 mg or 40 mg once weekly in adult\npatients with primary or secondary MF with resistance or intolerance to JAKi therapy (the “ESSENTIAL Study”; NCT03627403).\nThe primary endpoint of the ESSENTIAL Study is to assess the efficacy of selinexor on SVR. As of November 2021, the data cutoff,\nselinexor was administered to 12 patients. Median duration of prior JAKi therapy was 22 months (range 0.5 to 96 months), and 92%\n(11 of 12) patients had MF refractory to ruxolitinib. the median duration of treatment was 11 months (range 2.8 to 28.8 months). Of\nthe ten patients who were on treatment for at least 24 weeks, four (40%) patients achieved SVR of ≥35% and six (60%) patients\nachieved SVR of ≥25%. Of the five patients who were transfusion dependent at screening, two (40%) achieved transfusion\nindependence. Of the three patients with hemoglobin <10g/dL at screening, improvement in hemoglobin level of >2g/dl was observed\nin two (67%) patients. Reduction in marrow reticulin fibrosis from MF grade 3 to MF grade 1 was observed in a patient who had an\nassessment at week 72 demonstrating disease modification potential with longer treatment. While median OS was not yet reached, the\ntwo-year survival probability was assessed to be 91.7%. This compares favorably with a historical survival of 13 to 14 months in this\npopulation. The most common grade ≥3 TEAEs were anemia (33%) and fatigue (33%). These were manageable with treatment\ninterruption and dose reduction, except in one patient who discontinued treatment.\nDiffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma\nOverview\nDLBCL is the most common type of Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, a cancer that starts in cells called lymphocytes, which are part\nof the body’s immune system. Lymphocytes are found in the lymph nodes and other lymphoid tissues, such as the spleen and bone\nmarrow, as well as in the blood. According to the Lymphoma Research Foundation, over 18,000 people are diagnosed with DLBCL\nannually in the U.S. Although DLBCL can occur at any age, the median age at diagnosis is approximately 66 years of age.\nApproximately two-thirds of all newly diagnosed patients are cured using front-line chemotherapy (typically “R-CHOP”). Poor\noutcomes for patients who failed a R-CHOP regimen prompted efforts to discover new treatment approaches for DLBCL, both up-\nfront and at the time of relapse. Despite the availability of CAR-T therapy, many patients with relapsed or refractory DLBCL are not\nmedically stable enough to undergo this type of treatment. In addition, various other targets have been studied in the treatment of\nDLBCL but may also not be well tolerated in heavily pretreated patients.\nThe SADAL Study\nIn June 2020, the FDA approved XPOVIO under accelerated approval as a single-agent oral treatment of adult patients with\nrelapsed or refractory DLBCL, not otherwise specified, including DLBCL arising from follicular lymphoma, after at least two lines of\nsystemic therapy. This approval was based on the results of the SADAL Study, an open-label Phase 2b clinical trial evaluating single-\nagent oral selinexor (60 mg, twice weekly) in patients that had relapsed or refractory DLBCL after at least two prior multi-agent\ntherapies and who were ineligible for transplantation, including high dose chemotherapy with stem cell rescue. In this population,\nselinexor demonstrated an ORR of 29%, including a CR rate of 13%. Responses were seen in all subgroups evaluated regardless of\nage, gender, prior therapy, DLBCL subtype or prior stem cell transplant therapy. Patient responses were durable with a median DOR\nof 9.3 months (23.0 months for patients who achieved a CR). Importantly, responses were associated with longer survival,\nunderscoring the potential of oral XPO1 inhibition as an oral, non-chemotherapeutic option for patients with relapsed or refractory\nDLBCL. Part 2 of the study is ongoing to evaluate alternate dosing (40 mg, twice weekly; 60 mg twice weekly for cycles 1 and 2; and\n60 mg weekly for subsequent cycles).\nThe most common adverse reactions (≥20%) in patients who received selinexor were fatigue (63%), nausea (57%), diarrhea\n(37%), decreased appetite (37%), decreased weight (30%), constipation (29%), vomiting (28%), and pyrexia (22%). Grade 3-4\nlaboratory abnormalities (≥15%) are thrombocytopenia, lymphopenia, neutropenia, anemia, and hyponatremia. In the SADAL Study,\n13\nfatal adverse reactions occurred in 3.7% of patients within 30 days of last treatment. Serious adverse reactions occurred in 46% of\npatients who received selinexor. Treatment discontinuation rate due to adverse reactions was 17%.\nThe XPORT-DLBCL-030 Study\nThe XPORT-DLBCL-030 study, which will serve as the confirmatory study to the accelerated approval of XPOVIO in DLBCL\ngranted by the FDA in June 2020, is a Phase 2/3 multi-center, randomized study evaluating the combination of selinexor and\nrituximab, gemcitabine and dexamethasone (“R-GDP”) in patients with relapsed or refractory DLBCL (the “XPORT-DLBCL-030\nStudy”; NCT04442022). The Phase 2 portion of the study is evaluating efficacy, safety and tolerability of R-GDP plus either selinexor\n40 mg or 60 mg. The Phase 3 portion of the study is currently designed to evaluate the selected dose (as identified in the Phase 2\nstudy) of selinexor or matching placebo given with the standard combination immunochemotherapy R-GDP to patients with at least\none prior therapy and who are not intended for stem cell transplant and CAR-T cell therapy. The primary endpoint of the Phase 3\nportion of the XPORT-DLBCL-030 Study would be PFS. The study is currently in the Phase 2 portion of the evaluation.\nOUR ELTANEXOR PROGRAM\nMyelodysplastic Neoplasms\nOverview\nMDS are a group of hematologic malignancies whereby the bone marrow does not make enough healthy blood cells (white\nblood cells, red blood cells, and platelets). Hypomethylating agents (“HMAs”) are the current standard of care for patients newly\ndiagnosed with high-risk MDS. There is currently no other class of therapy approved for relapsed or refractory MDS patients; the\ncurrent standard of care is participation in a clinical trial or best supportive care, such as transfusions and symptomatic treatment for\ncytopenias. Our product candidate, eltanexor, is a novel, oral SINE compound that, like selinexor, selectively blocks the nuclear\nexport protein XPO1. Based on the data described below, we have observed single-agent clinical activity of eltanexor to treat patients\nwith HMA-refractory MDS.\nIn January 2022, the FDA granted Orphan Drug Designation for eltanexor for the treatment of MDS. In addition, in July 2022,\nthe FDA granted Fast Track designation for eltanexor as monotherapy for the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory\nintermediate, high-, or very high-risk MDS and the EC adopted the Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products opinion to designate\neltanexor as an orphan medicinal product for the treatment of MDS in the EU.\nThe KCP-8602-801 Study\nIn September 2021, we initiated a Phase 2 expansion study of an ongoing open-label Phase 1/2 study investigating eltanexor as a\nsingle-agent or in combination with approved and investigational agents in patients with several types of hematologic and solid tumor\ncancers (the “KCP-8602-801 Study”; NCT02649790). The KCP-8602-801 Study is designed to evaluate eltanexor monotherapy in 83\npatients with HMA-refractory, intermediate or high-risk MDS. The primary endpoint for this Phase 2 expansion study is ORR with\nPFS and OS, among others, as secondary endpoints. In May 2023, we announced interim data from the Phase 2 portion of the KCP-\n8602-801 Study at the 17th International Congress of Myelodysplastic Syndromes. As of the February 8, 2023 data cut-off date, 30\npatients had been treated with 10 mg of oral eltanexor on Days 1-5 of each week. Eltanexor demonstrated a 27% ORR in the ITT\npopulation and a 31% ORR in the efficacy evaluable population, with ORR consisting of marrow CR and hematologic improvement\nonly. No PRs or CRs were observed. Median overall survival was 8.7 months in both populations. Transfusion independence rate for\nred blood cells and/or platelets was 29%. Eltanexor was generally well-tolerated and manageable. The most common AEs were\nasthenia (47%), diarrhea (43%), and nausea (33%), the majority of which were grades 1-2. The most common grade ≥3 TEAEs were\nneutropenia (30%), thrombocytopenia (26.7%), and asthenia (16.7%).\nIn January 2024, we announced that further clinical development of our eltanexor program is on hold in an effort to focus our\nresources on our prioritized late-stage programs.\nOTHER PIPELINE PROGRAMS\nIn addition to selinexor, we also may advance other novel drug candidates, such as KPT-9274. KPT-9274 is our first-in-class\ndual inhibitor of p21-activated kinase 4 (“PAK4”) and nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (“NAMPT”). Co-inhibition of PAK4\nand NAMPT may lead to synergistic anti-tumor effects through energy depletion, inhibition of DNA repair, cell cycle arrest,\ninhibition of proliferation, and ultimately apoptosis. Normal cells are more resistant to inhibition by KPT-9274 due in part to their\nrelative genomic stability and lower metabolic rates. Hematologic and solid tumor cells that have become dependent on both PAK4\nand NAMPT pathways may be susceptible to single-agent cytotoxicity of KPT-9274.\n14\nKPT-9274 has shown broad evidence of anti-cancer activity against hematological and solid tumor malignant cells while\nshowing minimal toxicity to normal cells in vitro. In mouse xenograft studies, oral KPT-9274 has shown evidence of anti-cancer\nactivity and tolerability. To our knowledge, we are the only company with an allosteric PAK4 modulator and/or NAMPT specific\ninhibitor currently in clinical development. We are evaluating development opportunities for KPT-9274.\nCollaboration, License and Other Strategic Agreements\nWe have formed, and intend to continue to form, strategic alliances to develop and commercialize our products and product\ncandidates. We enter into collaborations when there is a strategic advantage to us and when we believe the financial terms of the\ncollaboration are favorable for meeting our short- and long-term strategic objectives. Currently, we maintain complete commercial\nrights to our products and product candidates in the U.S. and Japan and have entered into the following key agreements:\nMenarini\nIn December 2021, we entered into a license agreement with the Menarini Group (“Menarini”), an Italian pharmaceutical\ncompany (the “Original Menarini Agreement”). Pursuant to the Original Menarini Agreement, we granted Menarini a non-exclusive\nlicense to develop, and an exclusive license to commercialize, products containing selinexor (the “Product”) for all human oncology\nindications in the European Economic Area, UK, Switzerland, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova,\nRussia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Ukraine, Turkey, Mexico, all Central America countries and all South America\ncountries (collectively, the “Menarini Territory”). In March 2023, the Original Menarini Agreement was amended (the “Amended\nMenarini Agreement”) to expand the Menarini Territory to include all countries in the continent of Africa and Saudi Arabia, United\nArab Emirates, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Bahrain, Lebanon, Jordan, Iraq and Yemen (together with the Menarini Territory, the\n“Expanded Menarini Territory”). In addition, we granted to Menarini a non-exclusive license to package and label the Product in or\noutside of the Expanded Menarini Territory for all human oncology indications solely to enable Menarini to commercialize the\nProduct within the Expanded Menarini Territory.\nWe received an upfront cash payment of $75.0 million in December 2021 and $3.5 million in April 2023 upon execution of the\nAmended Menarini Agreement. In addition, we are entitled to receive additional milestone payments from Menarini if certain\ndevelopment and sales performance milestones are achieved in the future. We are also eligible to receive tiered royalties ranging from\nthe mid-teens to mid-twenties based on future net sales of the Product in the Expanded Menarini Territory. The payments owed by\nMenarini to us are subject to reduction in specified circumstances. Menarini will reimburse us for 25% of all expenses we incur for the\ndevelopment of the Product during 2022 through 2025, provided that such reimbursements shall not exceed $15.0 million per calendar\nyear.\nAntengene\nIn May 2020, we entered into an amendment of our May 2018 license agreement with Antengene Therapeutics Limited\n(“Antengene”) (the “Original Antengene Agreement”, and, as amended, the “Amended Antengene Agreement”). Antengene is a\ncorporation organized and existing under the laws of Hong Kong, and a subsidiary of Antengene Corporation Co. Ltd., a corporation\norganized and existing under the laws of the People’s Republic of China. Under the terms of the Amended Antengene Agreement,\nAntengene has the exclusive rights to develop and commercialize, at its own cost, selinexor, eltanexor, KPT-9274, each for the\ndiagnosis, treatment and/or prevention of all human oncology indications, and verdinexor for the diagnosis, treatment and/or\nprevention of certain human non-oncology indications in mainland China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Macau, South Korea, Brunei,\nCambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, Vietnam, Australia and New Zealand (the\n“Antengene Territory”).\nUnder the terms of the Original Antengene Agreement, we received an upfront cash payment in 2018 of $11.7 million. In June\n2020, we received an additional $11.7 million upfront payment upon execution of the Amended Antengene Agreement. In addition,\nwe are entitled to receive additional milestone payments from Antengene if certain other regulatory and commercialization goals are\nachieved in the future. We are also eligible to receive tiered double-digit royalties based on future net sales of selinexor and eltanexor,\nand tiered single- to double-digit royalties based on future net sales of verdinexor and KPT-9274 in the Antengene Territory.\nFORUS\nIn December 2020, we entered into an exclusive distribution agreement for the commercialization of XPOVIO in Canada with\nFORUS Therapeutics Inc. (“FORUS”), a Canadian biopharmaceutical company. Under the terms of the agreement, we received an\nupfront payment of $5.0 million in December 2020 and are eligible to receive additional payments if certain prespecified regulatory\nand commercial milestones are achieved by FORUS. We are also eligible to receive double-digit royalties on future net sales of\nXPOVIO in Canada. FORUS received the exclusive rights to commercialize XPOVIO in Canada and is responsible for all regulatory\n15\nfilings and obligations required for registering XPOVIO. We have retained the exclusive production rights and will supply finished\nproduct to FORUS for commercial use in Canada.\nPromedico\nIn February 2020, we entered into an exclusive distribution agreement with Promedico Ltd. (“Promedico”) for the\ncommercialization of XPOVIO in Israel, the West Bank, Gaza Strip and the territories under control of the Palestinian Authority (the\n“Promedico Territory”). We will receive certain prespecified payments and are eligible to receive additional payments if certain\nregulatory and commercial milestones are achieved by Promedico. We are also eligible to receive double-digit royalties on future net\nsales in the Promedico Territory. Promedico received the exclusive rights to commercialize XPOVIO in the Promedico Territory and\nis responsible for all regulatory filings and obligations required for registering XPOVIO. We have retained exclusive production rights\nand will supply finished product for commercial use in the Promedico Territory.\nOther\nIn addition to the above agreements, we have other collaborations related to the development or commercialization of our\nproducts and product candidates, such as the Cooperative Research and Development Agreement with the National Cancer Institute’s\nCancer Therapy Evaluation Program and a clinical trial collaboration and supply agreement with BMS, as discussed above, to\ncollaborate with us on studies to investigate the safety and effectiveness of selinexor in various oncology indications; the European\nMyeloma Network, with which we have a collaboration, as discussed above; and arrangements with academic and private non-\nacademic institutions, which conduct investigator-sponsored clinical trials in a variety of hematological and solid tumor malignancies.\nIn July 2021, we entered into a license agreement with Libo Pharma Corp. (“Libo”) under which we granted to Libo an\nexclusive license to manufacture, develop and commercialize IL-12 products in certain countries in Asia, Africa and Oceania. In\nDecember 2023, we amended the license agreement to include global development and commercialization rights for all indications\nexcept for acute radiation syndrome. We received an upfront payment from Libo and are also entitled to receive certain milestone\npayments upon completion of technology transfer as well as development and regulatory milestones and single-digit royalties on\nfuture net sales of KPT-1200.\nIn addition, in February 2024 we reacquired KPT-350 and other assets, which we had sold to Biogen Inc. (“Biogen”) in January\n2018 under an asset purchase agreement that was subsequently terminated by Biogen in June 2022. KPT-350 is a clinical stage SINE\ncompound under evaluation for neurological indications, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. We intend to evaluate KPT-350 for\ndevelopment internally or through a third-party collaborator or licensor.\nIntellectual Property\nOur commercial success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary or intellectual property protection for\nour products and product candidates, our core technologies, and other know-how, to operate without infringing on the proprietary\nrights of others and to prevent others from infringing our proprietary or intellectual property rights. Our policy is to seek to protect our\nproprietary and intellectual property position by, among other methods, filing patent applications in the U.S. and in foreign\njurisdictions related to our proprietary technology and products and product candidates. We also rely on trade secrets, know-how and\ncontinuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our proprietary and intellectual property position.\nWe file patent applications directed to the composition of matter and methods of use and manufacture for our products and\nproduct candidates. As of February 23, 2024, we were the sole owner of 47 patents in the U.S. and we had 13 pending patent\napplications in the U.S., two pending international applications filed under the Patent Cooperation Treaty (“PCT”), 162 granted\npatents and 98 pending patent applications in foreign jurisdictions. The PCT is an international patent law treaty that provides a\nunified procedure for filing a single initial patent application to seek patent protection for an invention simultaneously in each of the\nmember states. Although a PCT application is not itself examined and cannot issue as a patent, it allows the applicant to seek\nprotection in any of the member states through national-phase applications.\nThe intellectual property portfolios for our key products and product candidates as of February 23, 2024 are summarized below.\n• Selinexor (KPT-330): Our selinexor patent portfolio covers: the composition of matter of selinexor; various\npolymorphic forms of selinexor, including the polymorph used in selinexor’s commercial drug substance; various\nmethods of use of selinexor; as well as methods of making selinexor. There are two U.S. patents covering selinexor’s\ncomposition of matter. One of the patents will expire in July 2032 and the other will expire in July 2033 in view of\nPatent Term Extension awarded by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (“USPTO”). The U.S. patents covering the\npolymorph used in selinexor’s commercial drug substance will expire in August 2035. Any other patents that may issue\n16\nin the U.S. as part of our selinexor patent portfolio will expire no earlier than July 2032. Any patents that may issue in\nforeign jurisdictions will likewise expire no earlier than 2032.\n• Supplementary Protection Certificates: We have filed applications for Supplementary Protection Certificates\n(“SPCs”) based on European Patent No. 2,736,887 directed to the composition of matter and use of selinexor. Some\napplications have granted and others are pending.\n• Eltanexor (KPT-8602): Our eltanexor patent portfolio covers both the composition of matter and methods of making\nand using eltanexor, and consists of three issued U.S. patents, four pending non-provisional U.S. patent applications, 29\nissued foreign patents, 15 pending foreign patent applications and one pending PCT application. The PCT application\nprovides the opportunity for seeking protection in all PCT member states. Any patents that may issue in the U.S. as part\nof our eltanexor patent portfolio will expire no earlier than 2034, not including any terminal disclaimer, patent term\nadjustment due to administrative delays by the USPTO or patent term extension under the Hatch-Waxman Act. Any\npatents issued in foreign jurisdictions will likewise expire no earlier than 2034.\n• PAK4/NAMPT Inhibitors: Our PAK4/NAMPT inhibitors patent portfolio covers both the composition of matter and\nmethods of use of the PAK4/NAMPT inhibitors described therein, such as KPT-9274, and consists of five patent\nfamilies with seven issued U.S. patents, 25 issued foreign patents, one pending U.S. non-provisional patent application,\nand three pending foreign patent applications in total. Any patents that may issue in the U.S. based on the pending U.S.\nnon-provisional application will expire in 2034, absent any terminal disclaimer, patent term adjustment due to\nadministrative delays by the USPTO or patent term extension under the Hatch-Waxman Act. Any patents that may issue\nbased on the pending foreign patent applications will likewise expire in 2034. Foreign patent applications covering the\ncomposition of matter and methods of use of KPT-9274 have been filed in 22 countries/regions.\n• Biomarkers for XPO1 Inhibitors: Our patent portfolio also covers biomarkers related to treatment with XPO1\ninhibitors, such as selinexor, and consists of one pending non-provisional U.S. patent application, one pending PCT\napplication and six pending foreign patent applications. Any patents that may issue in the U.S. based on the pending U.S.\nnon-provisional application will expire in 2040, absent any terminal disclaimer, patent term adjustment due to\nadministrative delays by the USPTO or patent term extension under the Hatch-Waxman Act. Any patents issued in\nforeign jurisdictions will likewise expire in 2040. If non-provisional patent applications claiming the benefit of the\npending U.S. provisional patent application referenced above are filed in 2024, any patents that may issue from such\napplications will expire no earlier than 2044, not including any terminal disclaimer, patent term adjustment due to\nadministrative delays by the USPTO or patent term extension under the Hatch-Waxman Act. Any patents issued in\nforeign jurisdictions will likewise expire in 2044.\nIn addition to the patent portfolios covering our key products and product candidates, as of February 23, 2024, our patent\nportfolio also includes 17 patents and 25 granted foreign patents and pending patent applications in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions\nrelating to other XPO1 inhibitors and their use in targeted therapeutics and combination therapies for XPO1 inhibitors.\nIn the U.S., we have trademark registrations for our name, our logo in color, and a combination of the two, XPOVIO, PORE for\nour online portal, and KARYFORWARD and our KARYFORWARD logo for our financial aid and charitable services. We also have\npending applications in the U.S. to register KARYOPHARM alone, and our logo in greyscale, for pharmaceuticals. Outside of the\nU.S., XPOVIO is registered or pending in 46 additional jurisdictions, and is registered in Katakana in Japan, Hangul in South Korea,\nand Chinese characters in Taiwan. KARYOPHARM, the greyscale logo, KARYOPHARM THERAPEUTICS with the color logo, and\nthe KARYFORWARD logo are each registered or pending in four jurisdictions outside of the U.S. We also have registrations or\napplications for eight additional possible product names in numerous foreign jurisdictions.\nThe term of individual patents depends upon the legal term for patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In most\ncountries, including the U.S., the patent term is 20 years from the earliest filing date of a non-provisional patent application. In the\nU.S., a patent’s term may be lengthened by patent term adjustment, which compensates a patentee for administrative delays by the\nUSPTO in examining and granting a patent, or may be shortened if a patent is terminally disclaimed over an earlier filed patent. The\nterm of a patent that covers a drug may also be eligible for patent term extension when FDA approval is granted, provided statutory\nand regulatory requirements are met. See “Government Regulation - Patent Term Restoration and Extension” below for additional\ninformation on such extensions. We have filed applications for patent term extension in the U.S., Korea, Taiwan, Australia and China\nbased on the granted patent in each jurisdiction directed to the composition of matter of selinexor. In the U.S., Korea and Taiwan we\nhave been awarded 342 days, 150 days and 5 years, respectively, of patent term extension. In Australia, the term of the patent has been\nextended from July 26, 2032 to March 8, 2037 and in China we are awaiting a determination from the relevant authority. There is no\nassurance that we will benefit from any patent term extension. In the future, if and when our product candidates receive approval by\nthe FDA or foreign regulatory authorities, we expect to apply for patent term extensions on issued patents covering those drugs,\ndepending upon the length of the clinical trials for each product candidate and other factors. There can be no assurance that any of our\n17\npending patent applications will issue or that we will benefit from any patent term extension or favorable adjustment to the term of any\nof our patents.\nAs with other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, our ability to maintain and solidify our proprietary and intellectual\nproperty position for our products and product candidates and technologies will depend on our success in obtaining effective patent\nclaims and enforcing those claims if granted. However, patent applications that we may file or license from third parties may not result\nin the issuance of patents. We also cannot predict the breadth of claims that may be allowed or enforced in our patents. Our issued\npatents and any issued patents that we may receive in the future may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented. For example, we\ncannot be certain of the priority of inventions covered by pending third-party patent applications. If third parties prepare and file\npatent applications that also claim technology or therapeutics to which we have rights, we may have to participate in interference\nproceedings to determine priority of invention, which could result in substantial costs to us, even if the eventual outcome is favorable\nto us. In addition, because of the extensive time required for clinical development and regulatory review of a product candidate we\nmay develop, it is possible that, before any of our product candidates can be commercialized, any related patent may expire or remain\nin force for only a short period following commercialization, thereby reducing any advantage of any such patent.\nIn addition to patents, we rely upon unpatented trade secrets and know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop\nand maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect our proprietary information, in part, using confidentiality agreements with\nour collaborators, scientific advisors, employees and consultants, and invention assignment agreements with our employees. We also\nhave agreements with selected consultants, scientific advisors and collaborators requiring assignment of inventions. The\nconfidentiality agreements are designed to protect our proprietary information and, in the case of agreements or clauses requiring\ninvention assignment, to grant us ownership of technologies that are developed through our relationship with a third party.\nWith respect to our proprietary drug discovery and optimization platform, we consider trade secrets and know-how to be our\nprimary intellectual property. Trade secrets and know-how can be difficult to protect. We anticipate that with respect to this\ntechnology platform, these trade secrets and know-how may over time be disseminated within the industry through independent\ndevelopment, the publication of journal articles describing the methodology, and the movement of personnel skilled in the art from\nacademic to industry scientific positions.\nCompetition\nThe biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a\nstrong emphasis on proprietary products. While we believe that our technology, knowledge, experience and scientific resources\nprovide us with certain competitive advantages, we face competition from many different sources, including major pharmaceutical,\nspecialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions and governmental agencies and public and private\nresearch institutions. Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing therapies\nand new therapies that may become available in the future.\nThere are numerous companies developing or marketing treatments for cancer, including many major pharmaceutical and\nbiotechnology companies. We are aware of several other XPO1 inhibitors in clinical development world-wide. For example, in June\n2020, Menarini acquired Stemline Therapeutics, Inc., including its oral XPO1 inhibitor, felezonexor. Menarini has completed a Phase\n1 dose-escalation trial to evaluate felezonexor in patients with advanced solid tumors. Additionally, in August 2022, Shanghai Junshi\nBiosciences Co., Ltd announced FDA approval of its investigational new drug application (“IND”) for JS110, an XPO1 inhibitor in\ndevelopment in solid tumors, and has commenced a Phase 1/2 study in multiple myeloma.\nMany of the companies against which we or our collaborators currently compete or which we may compete with in the future\nhave significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing,\nconducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals, marketing approved products and achieving ex-U.S. positive\ncoverage/reimbursement decisions than we or our collaborators do. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology\nindustries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Smaller or early-stage\ncompanies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established\ncompanies. These competitors also compete with us or our collaborators in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific, commercial\nand management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring\ntechnologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs.\nThe key competitive factors affecting the success of any approved oncology drug product, including our products and product\ncandidates, if approved, are likely to be their actual or perceived efficacy, safety, tolerability, convenience and price, the availability of\nalternative cancer therapies and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payors. Our commercial\nopportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products, or commercialize existing\n18\nproducts in new indications, and those products are or are perceived to be safer, more effective, more convenient, less expensive or\nmore tolerable than any products that we have or may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for\ntheir products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market\nposition before we are able to enter the market.\nIn addition, our ability to compete may be affected in many cases by insurers or other third-party payors seeking to encourage\nthe use of generic drugs. Generic drugs for the treatment of cancer are on the market and additional products are expected to become\navailable on a generic basis over the coming years. If we obtain marketing approval for our product candidates or for XPOVIO in\nother indications, we expect that they will be priced at a significant premium over generic versions of older chemotherapy agents and\nother cancer therapies.\nThe most common methods of treating patients with cancer are surgery, radiation and drug therapy. There are numerous\navailable drug therapies marketed for cancer. In many cases, these drugs are administered in combination to enhance efficacy. While\nour products and product candidates may compete with many existing drugs and other therapies, to the extent they are ultimately used\nin combination with or as an adjunct to these therapies, our product candidates will be complimentary with them. Some of the\ncurrently approved drug therapies are branded and subject to patent protection, and others are available on a generic basis. Many of\nthese approved products are well-established therapies and are widely accepted by physicians, patients and third-party payors.\nIn addition to currently marketed therapies, there are also a number of products in late-stage clinical development to treat\ncancer. These products in development may provide efficacy, safety, tolerability, convenience and other benefits that are not provided\nby currently marketed therapies. As a result, they may represent significant competition for any of our products or product candidates\nfor which we obtain marketing approval.\nXPOVIO competes with and, if approved, our core product candidates may compete with, currently marketed products and/or\ninvestigational therapies as discussed below.\nMultiple Myeloma\nMany therapies are approved for use in patients with multiple myeloma in the U.S., Europe and other parts of the world.\nAlthough XPOVIO is the only XPO1 inhibitor that has received marketing approval, we compete with multiple other treatment types\nin our approved indication. The primary competitors of XPOVIO in multiple myeloma include those that currently treat patients\nranging from newly diagnosed patients to those with RRMM and are indicated for use either as single agent and/or as combination\ntherapies. The current standard of care for the treatment of RRMM includes IMiDs (e.g., thalidomide, lenalidomide, pomalidomide),\nPIs (e.g., bortezomib, carfilzomib and ixazomib), monoclonal antibodies (e.g., daratumamab, isatuximab, elotuzumab), B-cell\nmaturation antigens including CAR-Ts (e.g., idecabtagene vicleucel, ciltacabtagene autoleucel) and bispecific antibodies. New\nclasses/types of therapies are being introduced to the market each year. For example, TECVAYLI™ (teclistamab-cqyv), the first\nbispecific T-Cell engager, was approved by the FDA in October 2022, followed by approvals of two more bispecifics, ELREXFIO™\n(elranatamab-bcmm) and TALVEY™ (talquetamab-tgvs) in August 2023. Other T-cell engaging therapies, bispecifics with different\ntargets, and immunomodulators are in clinical development and may be introduced into the multiple myeloma market in 2024 and\nbeyond. In addition, future label expansions into earlier lines of existing therapies, including at least two CAR-T therapies, are\nanticipated in 2024 and beyond.\nEndometrial Cancer\nSurgery is the first treatment for almost all women with endometrial cancer, followed by chemotherapy and/or adjuvant\nradiation therapy for cases of advanced or high grade endometrial cancer. Upon disease progression, various chemotherapy agents and\ntargeted drugs are commonly used. Multiple products with differing mechanisms of action are being evaluated in clinical trials,\nincluding checkpoint inhibitors (e.g., pembrolizumab, and durvalumab), PARP inhibitors, and tyrosine kinase inhibitors (e.g.,\nlenvatinib). Until the mid-2023 approval of Jemperli® (dostarlimab) for the treatment of dMMR advanced or recurrent endometrial\ncancer, there were no products approved as a maintenance therapy. For patients with pMMR advanced or recurrent endometrial\ncancer, there are no approved checkpoint inhibitors and the primary treatment option remains chemotherapy followed by “watch and\nwait”. In addition, for advanced endometrial cancer, pembrolizumab is approved as a single agent or in combination with lenvatinib in\na subgroup of patients with recurrent disease.\nOther anti-cancer agents are in late-stage development for the treatment of patients with endometrial cancer, some of which\ncould receive approval earlier than selinexor, including products for the use of “maintenance” therapy following initial treatment, as in\nour ongoing EC-042 Study, and/or in recurrent disease. These potential products include immune checkpoints inhibitors, kinase\ninhibitors, and PARP inhibitors.\n19\nMyelofibrosis\nThe current standard of care for patients with MF who are not candidates for allogeneic HSCT, which is currently the only\ntreatment for MF that can provide a clinical cure, is to treat the patients with JAKi’s, the only currently approved drug therapy for\ntreatment for MF to reduce spleen volume and improve symptoms. There are only four JAKi’s currently approved, including\nruxolitinib, fedratinib, pacritinib and momelotinib.\nIn addition, there are a number of product candidates in late-stage development, some of which could receive approval earlier\nthan selinexor (e.g., pelabresib and navitoclax). Ongoing clinical trials, such as those involving imetelstat, bomedemstat, navtemadlin,\nsiremadlin, and zilurgisertib are studying the treatment of MF either with JAKi therapy, non-JAKi therapy or a combination of JAKi\nand drug treatment.\nMDS\nIf approved for the treatment of HMA refractory, intermediate or high-risk MDS, eltanexor will compete with the following\ncurrently marketed HMAs or HMA combinations: azacytidine, decitabine, decitabine/cedazuridine and ivosidenib, an IDH1 inhibitor.\nIn addition, there are a number of product candidates that plan to file for approval in the next few years in combination with an HMA,\nprimarily azacytidine, in frontline MDS; evorpacept (ALX18), an anti-CD47 fusion protein; lemzoparlimab, another anti-CD47 mAb;\nvenetoclax, a BCL2 inhibitor; tamibarotene, a RARA agonist; as well as sabatolimab, an anti-TIM-mAb.\nDLBCL\nThe initial therapy for DLBCL typically consists of multi-agent cytotoxic drugs in combination with the mAb rituximab (or a\nrituximab biosimilar). In patients with DLBCL who are not elderly and who have good organ function, high dose chemotherapy with\nstem cell transplantation is often used at first relapse. Over the past five years, a number of therapeutic interventions have been\napproved in the U.S., Europe and other parts of the world for the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory DLBCL who have\nreceived at least two prior therapies and/or are not eligible for ASCT/HSCT. In addition, certain currently approved therapeutic\ninterventions are also being evaluated in late-stage development in earlier lines of therapy for the treatment of patients with DLBCL,\nsuch as CD19-directed CAR-T therapies (e.g., axicabtagene ciloleucel), CD79b-directed antibody-drug conjugates (e.g., polatuzumab\nvedotin-piiq) and CD19-directed cytolytic antibody (e.g., tafasitamab-cxix and loncastuximab ), and anti-CD20/CD3 bispecifics (e.g.,\nglofitamab, and epcoritamab, odronextomab).\nOther agents are listed in the NCCN Guidelines and/or the European Society for Medical Oncology guidelines for use after one\nto two prior therapies, although they have not been formally approved by the FDA for treatment of DLBCL, including: lenalidomide,\nibrutinib, and generic multiagent chemotherapy, including gemcitabine, oxaliplatin, and bendamustine.\nIn addition, a number of anti-cancer agents are in mid to late-stage development for the treatment of patients with DLBCL,\nincluding bispecific antibodies (e.g., mosunetuzumab), antibody drug conjugates (e.g., brentuximab vedotin), small molecules (e.g.,\nenzastaurin, acalabrutinib, and zanubrutinib) and monoclonal antibodies (e.g., zilovertamab).\nSales and Marketing\nFollowing the July 2019 U.S. commercial launch of XPOVIO in multiple myeloma and subsequent FDA approvals in 2020 in\nboth earlier stage multiple myeloma and DLBCL, our commercial team has focused its efforts on educating health care providers on\nthe efficacy and safety profile of XPOVIO with the goal of enabling cancer patients access to this important treatment. We are\ncommercializing XPOVIO in the U.S. with our own focused, customer-facing teams, including sales specialists, reimbursement and\naccess support specialists, and nurse liaisons, each typically with years of experience in hematology/oncology. We have\napproximately 60 field-based employees in the U.S. who call on academic and community-based healthcare professionals who treat\nmultiple myeloma and DLBCL, as well as our reimbursement team. We believe that the current size of our sales force is appropriate at\nthis time to effectively reach our target audience in the specialty markets in which we currently operate. Continued growth of our\ncurrent marketed products and the launch of any future products may require further expansion of our field force and support\norganization within and outside of the U.S. For the foreseeable future, we intend to develop and commercialize XPOVIO and our\nproduct candidates alone in the U.S. and expect to rely on partners to develop and commercialize our products in territories outside of\nthe U.S. In executing our strategy, our goal is to retain oversight over the global development and commercialization of our products\nby playing an active role in their commercialization or finding partners who share our vision, values, and culture.\nOur sales force is supported by an experienced sales leadership team and professionals in marketing, reimbursement and market\naccess, market research and analytics, commercial operations, finance and human resources. Our sales and marketing organization\nuses a variety of pharmaceutical marketing strategies to promote XPOVIO, including sales calls, peer-to-peer education, non-personal\n20\npromotional, and digital content. We employ third-party vendors, such as advertising agencies, market research firms and suppliers of\nmarketing and other sales support-related services, to assist with our commercial activities.\nOur patient support program, KaryForward®, is dedicated to providing assistance and resources to our patients with multiple\nmyeloma and DLBCL and their caregivers throughout their XPOVIO treatment. KaryForward® offers support in navigating insurance\ncoverage issues and processes and enabling continuation of our patients’ ability to access XPOVIO in the case of delays or\ninterruptions in the insurance process. We also offer a copay card, which offers eligible commercial patients who have insurance to\nreceive their prescription for as little as $5.00 per prescription. Further, the KaryForward® program assists eligible patients who do not\nhave insurance or lack coverage to be able to access XPOVIO treatment through our Patient Assistance Program. Under our\nKaryForward® program, patients are assigned a dedicated nurse case manager, who serves as a point of contact to help patients and\ntheir caregivers navigate the treatment process, including by explaining prescription instructions, providing psychosocial support and\nadditional nonclinical education regarding XPOVIO, highlighting expectations when taking XPOVIO and providing referrals for\nadditional third-party support, such as transportation assistance.\nManufacturing\nWe do not own or operate, and have no plans to establish, any manufacturing facilities for our products or product candidates.\nWe currently rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third-party contract manufacturers to manufacture our products and product\ncandidates for our commercial and clinical use.\nThe clinical and commercial supplies of the drug product for XPOVIO are currently manufactured pursuant to a combination of\nlong-term supply agreements and as-needed purchase order agreements with our third-party manufacturers.\nSelinexor is a small molecule drug and is manufactured in reliable and reproducible synthetic processes from readily available\nstarting materials. The chemistry and formulation processes of selinexor have been developed to meet our large-scale manufacturing\nneeds and do not require unusual equipment in the manufacturing process. We generally maintain sufficient inventory levels\nthroughout our supply chain to exceed our two-year forecasts for XPOVIO in order to minimize the risks of supply disruption.\nTo support the commercialization and development of our products and product candidates, we have developed a fully\nintegrated manufacturing support system, including scientific oversight, quality assurance, quality control, regulatory affairs and\ninventory control policies and procedures. These support systems are intended to enable us to maintain high standards of quality for\nour products. We intend to continue to outsource the manufacture and distribution of our products for the foreseeable future, and we\nbelieve this manufacturing strategy will enable us to direct more of our financial resources to the commercialization and development\nof our products and product candidates.\nGovernment Regulation\nGovernment authorities in the U.S., at the federal, state and local level, and in other countries and jurisdictions, including the\nEU, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, packaging,\nstorage, recordkeeping, labeling, advertising, promotion, distribution, marketing, post-approval monitoring and reporting, and import\nand export of pharmaceutical products. The processes for obtaining regulatory approvals in the U.S. and in foreign countries and\njurisdictions, along with subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations and other regulatory authorities, require the\nexpenditure of substantial time and financial resources. The regulatory requirements applicable to drug product development, approval\nand marketing are subject to change, and regulations and administrative guidance often are revised or reinterpreted by the agencies in\nways that may have a significant impact on our business.\nReview and Approval of Drugs in the U.S.\nIn the U.S., the FDA regulates drug products under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the “FDCA”) and implementing\nregulations. The failure to comply with applicable requirements under the FDCA and other applicable laws at any time during the\nproduct development process, approval process or after approval may subject a sponsor to a variety of administrative or judicial\nsanctions, including refusal by the FDA to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, imposition of a clinical hold,\nissuance of warning letters and other types of letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or\ndistribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement of profits, or civil or criminal investigations\nand penalties brought by the FDA and the Department of Justice or other governmental entities.\n21\nThe FDA must approve our product candidates for therapeutic indications before they may be marketed in the U.S. A sponsor\nseeking approval to market and distribute a new drug in the U.S. generally must satisfactorily complete each of the following steps\nbefore the product candidate will be approved by the FDA:\n• completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies in compliance with the FDA’s good\nlaboratory practice (“GLP”) regulations, as applicable;\n• design of a clinical protocol and submission to the FDA of an IND, which must take effect before human clinical trials\nmay begin;\n• approval by an independent institutional review board (“IRB”) representing each clinical site before each clinical trial may\nbe initiated;\n• performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with good clinical practices (“GCP”) to\nestablish the safety and effectiveness of the proposed drug product for each indication;\n• preparation and submission to the FDA of a marketing application;\n• review of the product by an FDA advisory committee, where appropriate or if applicable;\n• satisfactory completion of one or more FDA inspections of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product, or\ncomponents thereof, are produced to assess compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices (“cGMP”)\nrequirements and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the product’s identity,\nstrength, quality and purity;\n• satisfactory completion of FDA audits of clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GCPs and the integrity of the\nclinical data;\n• payment of user fees and securing FDA approval of the New Drug Application (“NDA”); and\n• compliance with any post-approval requirements, including Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies (“REMS”) and\npost-approval studies required by the FDA.\nPreclinical Studies\nPreclinical studies include laboratory evaluation of the purity and stability of the manufactured drug substance or active\npharmaceutical ingredient and the formulated drug or drug product, as well as in vitro and animal studies to assess the safety and\nactivity of the drug for initial testing in humans and to establish a rationale for therapeutic use. These studies are typically referred to\nas IND-enabling studies. The conduct of the preclinical tests and formulation of the compounds for testing must comply with federal\nregulations and requirements, including GLP regulations and standards and the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Animal Welfare Act,\nif applicable. The results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data\nor literature and plans for clinical trials, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND and are typically referred to\nas IND-enabling studies.\nSome long-term preclinical testing, such as animal tests of reproductive AEs and carcinogenicity, may continue after the IND is\nsubmitted and may be required to be included in a marketing application. With passage of the FDA’s Modernization Act 2.0 in\nDecember 2022, Congress eliminated provisions in both the FDCA and the Public Health Service Act (“PHSA”) that required animal\ntesting in support of an NDA or a biologics license application (“BLA”). While animal testing may still be conducted, the FDA was\nauthorized to rely on alternative non-clinical tests, including cell-based assays, microphysiological systems, or bioprinted or computer\nmodels.\nIn addition, sponsors usually must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the\ninvestigational product and finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP\nrequirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the candidate product and,\namong other things, the manufacturer must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final product.\nAdditionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the\ncandidate product does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.\nThe IND and IRB Processes\nAn IND is an exemption from the FDCA that allows an unapproved product candidate to be shipped in interstate commerce for\nuse in an investigational clinical trial and a request for FDA authorization to administer such investigational product to humans. An\nIND must be secured prior to interstate shipment and administration of any product candidate that is not the subject of an approved\n22\nNDA or BLA. In support of a request for an IND, a sponsor must submit a protocol for each clinical trial and any subsequent protocol\namendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Beyond reviewing an IND to assure the safety and rights of patients,\nthe FDA’s review also focuses on the quality of the investigation and whether it will be adequate to permit an evaluation of the drug’s\neffectiveness and safety and of the biological product’s safety, purity and potency. An IND automatically becomes effective 30 days\nafter receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions related to one or more proposed clinical trials\nand places the trial on a clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the\nclinical trial may proceed. As a result, submission of an IND may not result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to commence.\nFollowing commencement of a clinical trial under an IND, the FDA may also place a clinical hold or partial clinical hold on that\ntrial. A clinical hold is an order issued by the FDA to the sponsor to delay a proposed clinical investigation or to suspend an ongoing\ninvestigation. A partial clinical hold is a delay or suspension of only part of the clinical work requested under the IND. For example, a\npartial clinical hold might state that a specific protocol or part of a protocol may not proceed, while other parts of a protocol or other\nprotocols may do so. No more than 30 days after the imposition of a clinical hold or partial clinical hold, the FDA will provide the\nsponsor with a written explanation of the basis for the hold. Following the issuance of a clinical hold or partial clinical hold, a clinical\ninvestigation may only resume once the FDA has notified the sponsor that the investigation may proceed. The FDA will base that\ndetermination on information provided by the sponsor correcting the deficiencies previously cited or otherwise satisfying the FDA that\nthe investigation can proceed or recommence. Occasionally, clinical holds are imposed due to manufacturing issues that may present\nsafety issues for the clinical study subjects.\nOnce an IND application takes effect, the sponsor of the IND may amend the application as needed to ensure that the clinical\ninvestigations are conducted according to protocols included in the IND. The FDA has indicated that sponsors are expected to submit\namendments for new protocols or changes to existing protocols before implementation of the respective changes. New studies may\nbegin, however, when the sponsor has submitted the change to the FDA for its review and the new protocol or changes to the existing\nprotocol have been approved by the IRB with the responsibility for review and approval of the studies. In addition to the foregoing\nIND requirements, an IRB representing each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any\nclinical trial before it commences at that institution, and the IRB must conduct a continuing review and reapprove the study at least\nannually. The IRB must review and approve, among other things, the study protocol and informed consent information to be provided\nto study subjects. An IRB must operate in compliance with FDA regulations. An IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical\ntrial at its institution, or an institution it represents, if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s\nrequirements or if the product candidate has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.\nAdditionally, some trials are overseen by a Data and Safety Monitoring Board, an independent group of qualified experts\norganized by the trial sponsor. This group provides authorization for whether or not a trial may move forward at designated check\npoints based on access that only the group maintains to available data from the study. Suspension or termination of development\nduring any phase of clinical trials can occur if it is determined that the participants or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable\nhealth risk. Other reasons for suspension or termination may be made by us based on evolving business objectives and/or competitive\nclimate.\nClinical Studies Outside the U.S. in Support of FDA Approval\nIn connection with our clinical development program, we may have trial sites outside the U.S. When a foreign clinical study is\nconducted under an IND, all IND requirements must be met unless waived. When a foreign clinical study is not conducted under an\nIND, the sponsor must ensure that the study complies with certain regulatory requirements of the FDA in order to use the study as\nsupport for an IND or application for marketing approval. Specifically, the studies must be conducted in accordance with GCP,\nincluding undergoing review and receiving approval by an independent ethics committee and seeking and receiving informed consent\nfrom subjects. GCP requirements encompass both ethical and data integrity standards for clinical studies. The FDA’s regulations are\nintended to help ensure the protection of human subjects enrolled in non-IND foreign clinical studies, as well as the quality and\nintegrity of the resulting data. They further help ensure that non-IND foreign studies are conducted in a manner comparable to that\nrequired for IND studies.\nThe acceptance by the FDA of study data from clinical trials conducted outside the U.S. in support of U.S. approval may be\nsubject to certain conditions or may not be accepted at all. In cases where data from foreign clinical trials are intended to serve as the\nsole basis for marketing approval in the U.S., the FDA will generally not approve the application on the basis of foreign data alone\nunless (i) the data are applicable to the U.S. population and U.S. medical practice; (ii) the trials were performed by clinical\ninvestigators of recognized competence and pursuant to GCP regulations; and (iii) the data may be considered valid without the need\nfor an on-site inspection by the FDA, or if the FDA considers such inspection to be necessary, the FDA is able to validate the data\nthrough an on-site inspection or other appropriate means.\n23\nIn addition, even where the foreign study data are not intended to serve as the sole basis for approval, the FDA will not accept\nthe data as support for an application for marketing approval unless the study is well-designed and well-conducted in accordance with\nGCP requirements and the FDA is able to validate the data from the study through an onsite inspection if deemed necessary. Many\nforeign regulatory authorities have similar approval requirements. In addition, such foreign trials are subject to the applicable local\nlaws of the foreign jurisdictions where the trials are conducted.\nReporting Clinical Trial Results\nUnder the PHSA, sponsors of clinical trials of certain FDA-regulated products, including prescription drugs and biologics, are\nrequired to register and disclose certain clinical trial information on a public registry (clinicaltrials.gov) maintained by the U.S.\nNational Institutes of Health (the “NIH”). In particular, information related to the product, patient population, phase of investigation,\nstudy sites and investigators and other aspects of the clinical trial is made public as part of the registration of the clinical trial.\nAlthough sponsors are also obligated to disclose the results of their clinical trials after completion, disclosure of the results can be\ndelayed in some cases for up to two years after the date of completion of the trial. The NIH’s Final Rule on registration and reporting\nrequirements for clinical trials became effective in 2017.\nThe PHSA grants the Secretary of Health and Human Services the authority to issue a notice of noncompliance to a responsible\nparty for failure to submit clinical trial information as required. The responsible party, however, is allowed 30 days to correct the\nnoncompliance and submit the required information. With the issuance of pre-notices for voluntary corrective action and several\nnotices of non-compliance during the past two years, the FDA has signaled the government’s willingness to begin enforcing these\nrequirements against non-compliant clinical trial sponsors. While these notices of non-compliance did not result in civil monetary\npenalties, the failure to submit clinical trial information to clinicaltrials.gov is a prohibited act under the FDCA with violations subject\nto potential civil monetary penalties of up to $10,000 for each day the violation continues. Violations may also result in injunctions\nand/or criminal prosecution or disqualification from federal grants.\nExpanded Access to an Investigational Drug for Treatment Use\nExpanded access, sometimes called “compassionate use,” is the use of IND products outside of clinical trials to treat patients\nwith serious or immediately life-threatening diseases or conditions when there are no comparable or satisfactory alternative treatment\noptions. The rules and regulations related to expanded access are intended to improve access to investigational drugs for patients who\nmay benefit from investigational therapies. FDA regulations allow access to investigational drugs under an IND by the company or the\ntreating physician for treatment purposes on a case-by-case basis for: individual patients (single-patient IND applications for treatment\nin emergency settings and non-emergency settings); intermediate-size patient populations; and larger populations for use of the drug\nunder a treatment protocol or treatment IND Application.\nThere is no obligation for a sponsor to make its investigational products available for expanded access; however, as required by\namendments to the FDCA included in the 21st Century Cures Act (the “Cures Act”), passed in 2016, if a sponsor has a policy\nregarding how it responds to expanded access requests with respect to product candidates in development to treat serious diseases or\nconditions, it must make that policy publicly available. Sponsors are required to make such policies publicly available upon the earlier\nof initiation of a Phase 2 or Phase 3 study for a covered investigational product; or 15 days after the investigational product receives\ndesignation from the FDA as a breakthrough therapy, fast track product, or regenerative medicine advanced therapy.\nIn addition, in May 2018, the Right to Try Act was signed into law. The law, among other things, provides a federal framework\nfor certain patients to access certain IND products that have completed a Phase I clinical trial and that are undergoing investigation for\nFDA approval. Under certain circumstances, eligible patients can seek treatment without enrolling in clinical trials and without\nobtaining FDA permission under the FDA expanded access program. There is no obligation for a drug manufacturer to make its drug\nproducts available to eligible patients as a result of the Right to Try Act, but the manufacturer must develop an internal policy and\nrespond to patient requests according to that policy.\nHuman Clinical Trials in Support of an NDA\nClinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product to human subjects under the supervision of qualified\ninvestigators in accordance with GCP requirements, which include, among other things, the requirement that all research subjects\nprovide their informed consent in writing before their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under written\nstudy protocols detailing, among other things, the inclusion and exclusion criteria, the objectives of the study, the parameters to be\nused in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol, and any subsequent material amendment to the\nprotocol, must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND, and progress reports detailing the status of the clinical trials must be\nsubmitted to the FDA annually.\n24\nHuman clinical trials are typically conducted in four sequential phases, which may overlap or be combined:\nPhase 1: The drug is initially introduced into a small number of healthy human subjects or patients with the target disease\n(e.g., cancer) or condition and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion and,\nif possible, to gain an early indication of its effectiveness and to determine optimal dosage.\nPhase 2: The drug is administered to a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to\npreliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and\noptimal dosage.\nPhase 3: The drug is administered to an expanded patient population, generally at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites,\nin well-controlled clinical trials to generate enough data to statistically evaluate the efficacy and safety of the product\nfor approval, to establish the overall risk-benefit profile of the product, and to provide adequate information for the\nlabeling of the product. These clinical trials are commonly referred to as “pivotal” studies, which denotes a study that\npresents the data that the FDA or other relevant regulatory agency will use to determine whether or not to approve a\ndrug.\nPhase 4: Post-approval studies may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These studies are used to gain additional\nexperience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication.\nA clinical trial may combine the elements of more than one phase and the FDA often requires more than one Phase 3 trial to\nsupport marketing approval of a product candidate. A company’s designation of a clinical trial as being of a particular phase is not\nnecessarily indicative that the study will be sufficient to satisfy the FDA requirements of that phase because this determination cannot\nbe made until the protocol and data have been submitted to and reviewed by the FDA. Moreover, as noted above, a pivotal trial is a\nclinical trial that is believed to satisfy FDA requirements for the evaluation of a product candidate’s safety and effectiveness such that\nit can be used, alone or with other pivotal or non-pivotal trials, to support regulatory approval. Generally, pivotal trials are Phase 3\ntrials, but they may be Phase 2 trials if they are adequate and well-controlled studies to establish the evidence needed for regulatory\napproval.\nIn March 2022, the FDA released final guidance entitled “Expansion Cohorts: Use in First-In-Human Clinical Trials to Expedite\nDevelopment of Oncology Drugs and Biologics,” which outlines how developers can utilize an adaptive trial design commonly\nreferred to as a seamless trial design in early stages of oncology biological product development (e.g., the first-in-human clinical trial)\nto compress the traditional three phases of trials into one continuous trial called an expansion cohort trial. Information to support the\ndesign of individual expansion cohorts are included in IND applications and assessed by the FDA. Expansion cohort trials can\npotentially bring efficiency to biological product development and reduce developmental costs and time.\nIn December 2022, with the passage of the Food and Drug Omnibus Reform Act (“FDORA”), Congress required sponsors to\ndevelop and submit a diversity action plan for each Phase 3 clinical trial or any other “pivotal study” of a new drug or biological\nproduct. These plans are meant to encourage the enrollment of more diverse patient populations in late-stage clinical trials of FDA-\nregulated products. Specifically, actions plans must include the sponsor’s goals for enrollment, the underlying rationale for those\ngoals, and an explanation of how the sponsor intends to meet them. In addition to these requirements, the legislation directs the FDA\nto issue new guidance on diversity action plans.\nIn June 2023, the FDA issued draft guidance with updated recommendations for GCPs aimed at modernizing the design and\nconduct of clinical trials. The updates are intended to help pave the way for more efficient clinical trials to facilitate the development\nof medical products. The draft guidance is adopted from the International Council for Harmonisation’s recently updated E6(R3) draft\nguideline that was developed to enable the incorporation of rapidly developing technological and methodological innovations into the\nclinical trial enterprise. In addition, the FDA issued draft guidance outlining recommendations for the implementation of decentralized\nclinical trials.\nInteractions with FDA During the Clinical Development Program\nFollowing the clearance of an IND and the commencement of clinical trials, the sponsor will continue to have interactions with\nthe FDA. An annual report on the progress of the study must be submitted to the FDA and more frequently if serious AEs occur. In\naddition, IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA for any of the following: serious and unexpected suspected adverse\nreactions; findings from other studies or animal or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk in humans exposed to the product; and\nany clinically important increase in the occurrence of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or\n25\ninvestigator brochure. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, or at\nall. The FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP and the integrity of the clinical data\nsubmitted.\nIn addition, sponsors are given opportunities to meet with the FDA at certain points in the clinical development program.\nSpecifically, sponsors may meet with the FDA prior to the submission of an IND (Pre-IND meeting), at the end of Phase 1 clinical\ntrial (EOP1 meeting), at the end of Phase 2 clinical trial (EOP2 meeting) and before an NDA or BLA is submitted (Pre-NDA or Pre-\nBLA meeting). Meetings at other times may also be requested. There are five types of meetings that occur between sponsors and the\nFDA. Type A meetings are those that are necessary for an otherwise stalled product development program to proceed or to address an\nimportant safety issue. Type B meetings include pre-IND and pre-NDA/pre-BLA meetings, as well as end of phase meetings such as\nEOP2 meetings. A Type C meeting is any meeting other than a Type A or Type B meeting regarding the development and review of a\nproduct, including, for example, meetings to facilitate early consultations on the use of a biomarker as a new surrogate endpoint that\nhas never been previously used as the primary basis for product approval in the proposed context of use. A Type D meeting is focused\non a narrow set of issues and does not require input from more than three disciplines or divisions. Finally, INTERACT meetings are\nintended for novel products and development programs that present unique challenges in the early development of an investigational\nproduct.\nThese meetings provide an opportunity for the sponsor to share information about the data gathered to date with the FDA and\nfor the FDA to provide advice on the next phase of development. For example, at an EOP2, a sponsor may discuss its Phase 2 clinical\nresults and present its plans for the pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial(s) that it believes will support the approval of the new product. Such\nmeetings may be conducted in person, via teleconference/videoconference or written response only with minutes reflecting the\nquestions that the sponsor posed to the FDA and the agency’s responses. The FDA has indicated that its responses, as conveyed in\nmeeting minutes and advice letters, only constitute mere recommendations and/or advice made to a sponsor and, as such, sponsors are\nnot bound by such recommendations and/or advice. Nonetheless, from a practical perspective, a sponsor’s failure to follow the FDA’s\nrecommendations for design of a clinical program may put the program at significant risk of failure. In September 2023, the FDA\nissued draft guidance outlining the terms of such meetings in more detail.\nFDA approval of companion diagnostics\nIn August 2014, the FDA issued final guidance clarifying the requirements that apply to the approval of therapeutic products\nand in vitro companion diagnostics. According to the guidance, for novel drugs, a companion diagnostic device and its corresponding\ntherapeutic should be approved or cleared contemporaneously by the FDA for the use indicated in the therapeutic product’s labeling.\nApproval or clearance of the companion diagnostic device will ensure that the device has been adequately evaluated and has adequate\nperformance characteristics in the intended population. In July 2016, the FDA issued a draft guidance intended to assist sponsors of\nthe drug therapeutic and in vitro companion diagnostic device on issues related to co-development of the products.\nThe 2014 guidance also explains that a companion diagnostic device used to make treatment decisions in clinical trials of a\nbiologic product candidate generally will be considered an investigational device, unless it is employed for an intended use for which\nthe device is already approved or cleared. If used to make critical treatment decisions, such as patient selection, the diagnostic device\ngenerally will be considered a significant risk device under the FDA’s Investigational Device Exemption (“IDE”) regulations. Thus,\nthe sponsor of the diagnostic device will be required to comply with the IDE regulations. According to the guidance, if a diagnostic\ndevice and a product are to be studied together to support their respective approvals, both products can be studied in the same\ninvestigational study, if the study meets both the requirements of the IDE regulations and the IND regulations. The guidance provides\nthat depending on the details of the study plan and subjects, a sponsor may seek to submit an IND alone, or both an IND and an IDE.\nIn April 2020, the FDA issued additional guidance that describes considerations for the development and labeling of companion\ndiagnostic devices to support the indicated uses of multiple drug or biological oncology products, when appropriate. This guidance\nbuilds upon existing policy regarding the labeling of companion diagnostics. In its 2014 guidance, the FDA stated that if evidence is\nsufficient to conclude that the companion diagnostic is appropriate for use with a specific group of therapeutic products, the\ncompanion diagnostic’s intended use or indications for use should name the specific group of therapeutic products, rather than specific\nproducts. The 2020 guidance expands on the policy statement in the 2014 guidance by recommending that companion diagnostic\ndevelopers consider a number of factors when determining whether their test could be developed, or the labeling for approved\ncompanion diagnostics could be revised through a supplement, to support a broader labeling claim such as use with a specific group of\noncology therapeutic products (rather than listing an individual therapeutic product(s)).\nUnder the FDCA, in vitro diagnostics, including companion diagnostics, are regulated as medical devices. In the U.S., the\nFDCA and its implementing regulations, and other federal and state statutes and regulations govern, among other things, medical\ndevice design and development, preclinical and clinical testing, premarket clearance or approval, registration and listing,\nmanufacturing, labeling, storage, advertising and promotion, sales and distribution, export and import and post-market surveillance.\n26\nUnless an exemption applies, diagnostic tests require pre-notification marketing clearance or approval from the FDA prior to\ncommercial distribution.\nThe FDA previously has required in vitro companion diagnostics intended to select the patients who will respond to the product\ncandidate to obtain pre-market approval (“PMA”) simultaneously with approval of the therapeutic product candidate. The PMA\nprocess, including the gathering of clinical and preclinical data and the submission to and review by the FDA, can take several years\nor longer. It involves a rigorous premarket review during which the sponsor must prepare and provide the FDA with reasonable\nassurance of the device’s safety and effectiveness and information about the device and its components regarding, among other things,\ndevice design, manufacturing and labeling. PMA applications are subject to an application fee. For federal fiscal year 2024, the\nstandard fee is $483,560 and the small business fee is $120,890.\nAfter a device is placed on the market, it remains subject to significant regulatory requirements. Medical devices may be\nmarketed only for the uses and indications for which they are cleared or approved. Device manufacturers must also establish\nregistration and device listings with the FDA. A medical device manufacturer’s manufacturing processes and those of its suppliers are\nrequired to comply with the applicable portions of the Quality System Regulation, which covers the methods and documentation of the\ndesign, testing, production, processes, controls, quality assurance, labeling, packaging, and shipping of medical devices. Domestic\nfacility records and manufacturing processes are subject to periodic unscheduled inspections by the FDA. The FDA also may inspect\nforeign facilities that export products to the U.S.\nManufacturing and Other Regulatory Requirements\nConcurrently with clinical trials, sponsors usually complete additional animal safety studies, develop additional information\nabout the chemistry and physical characteristics of the product candidate and finalize a process for manufacturing commercial\nquantities of the product candidate in accordance with cGMP requirements. Specifically, the FDA’s regulations require that\npharmaceutical products be manufactured in specific approved facilities and in accordance with cGMPs. The cGMP regulations\ninclude requirements relating to organization of personnel, buildings and facilities, equipment, control of components and product\ncontainers and closures, production and process controls, packaging and labeling controls, holding and distribution, laboratory\ncontrols, records and reports and returned or salvaged products. Manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and\ndistribution of approved pharmaceuticals are required to register their establishments with the FDA and some state agencies, and they\nare subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA for compliance with cGMPs and other requirements.\nInspections must follow a “risk-based schedule” that may result in certain establishments being inspected more frequently.\nManufacturers may also have to provide, on request, electronic or physical records regarding their establishments. Delaying, denying,\nlimiting, or refusing inspection by the FDA may lead to a product being deemed to be adulterated. Changes to the manufacturing\nprocess, specifications or container closure system for an approved product are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval\nbefore being implemented. The FDA’s regulations also require, among other things, the investigation and correction of any deviations\nfrom cGMP and the imposition of reporting and documentation requirements upon the sponsor and any third-party manufacturers\ninvolved in producing the approved product. The PREVENT Pandemics Act, which was enacted in December 2022, clarifies that\nforeign drug manufacturing establishments are subject to registration and listing requirements even if a drug undergoes further\nmanufacture, preparation, propagation, compounding, or processing at a separate establishment outside the U.S. prior to being\nimported or offered for import into the U.S.\nPediatric Studies\nUnder the Pediatric Research Equity Act (the “PREA”) applications and certain types of supplements to applications must\ncontain data that are adequate to assess the safety and effectiveness of the product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric\nsubpopulations, and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective.\nThe sponsor must submit an initial Pediatric Study Plan (“PSP”) within 60 days of an end-of-phase 2 meeting or as may be agreed\nbetween the sponsor and the FDA. Those plans must contain an outline of the proposed pediatric study or studies the sponsor plans to\nconduct, including study objectives and design, age groups, relevant endpoints and statistical approach, or a justification for not\nincluding such detailed information, and any request for a deferral of pediatric assessments or a full or partial waiver of the\nrequirement to provide data from pediatric studies along with supporting information. The sponsor and the FDA must reach agreement\non a final plan. A sponsor can submit amendments to an agreed-upon initial PSP at any time if changes to the pediatric plan need to be\nconsidered based on data collected from nonclinical studies, early phase clinical trials, and/or other clinical development programs.\nThe statute also directs the FDA, in consultation with the National Cancer Institute, members of the internal committee established\nunder section 505C of the FDCA and the Pediatric Subcommittee of the Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee, to establish, publish,\nand regularly update a list of molecular targets considered, on the basis of data the FDA determines to be adequate, to be substantially\nrelevant to the growth or progression of a pediatric cancer, and that may trigger PREA requirements.\n27\nThe FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the sponsor, grant deferrals for submission of some or all pediatric data\nuntil after approval of the product for use in adults, or full or partial waivers from the pediatric data requirements. A deferral may be\ngranted for several reasons, including a finding that the product or therapeutic candidate is ready for approval for use in adults before\npediatric trials are complete or that additional safety or effectiveness data needs to be collected before the pediatric trials begin. The\nFDA is required to send a PREA Non-Compliance letter to sponsors who have failed to submit their pediatric assessments required\nunder the PREA, have failed to seek or obtain a deferral or deferral extension or have failed to request approval for a required\npediatric formulation.\nUnless otherwise required by regulation, the pediatric data requirements do not apply to products with orphan designation\nintended for a non-cancer indication, although the FDA has recently taken steps to limit what it considers abuse of this statutory\nexemption in PREA by announcing that it does not intend to grant any additional Orphan Drug Designations for rare pediatric\nsubpopulations of what is otherwise a common disease. Further, Section 505B of the FDCA, as amended by FDARA, requires that\nany original NDA or BLA submitted on or after August 18, 2020, for a new active ingredient, must contain reports on the molecularly\ntargeted pediatric cancer investigation, unless the requirement is waived or deferred, if the drug that is the subject of the application is:\n(i) intended for the treatment of an adult cancer, and (ii) directed at a molecular target that the Secretary of HHS determines to be\nsubstantially relevant to the growth or progression of a pediatric cancer in accordance with FDA guidance. The FDA maintains a list\nof diseases that are exempt from PREA requirements due to low prevalence of disease in the pediatric population.\nFast Track, Breakthrough Therapy, Priority Review and Regenerative Advanced Therapy Designations\nThe FDA is authorized to designate certain products for expedited development and review if they are intended to address an\nunmet medical need in the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition. These programs are referred to as Fast Track\ndesignation, Breakthrough Therapy designation, Priority Review designation and Regenerative Advanced Therapy designation. None\nof these expedited programs change the standards for approval but they may help expedite the development or approval process of\nproduct candidates.\nSpecifically, the FDA may grant a product Fast Track designation if it is intended, whether alone or in combination with one or\nmore other products, for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and it demonstrates the potential to address\nunmet medical needs for such a disease or condition. For fast track products, sponsors may have greater interactions with the FDA and\nthe FDA may initiate review of sections of a fast track product’s application before the application is complete. This rolling review\nmay be available if the FDA determines, after preliminary evaluation of clinical data submitted by the sponsor, that a fast track\nproduct may be effective. The sponsor must also provide, and the FDA must approve, a schedule for the submission of the remaining\ninformation and the sponsor must pay applicable user fees. However, the FDA’s time period goal for reviewing a fast track application\ndoes not begin until the last section of the application is submitted. In addition, the Fast Track designation may be withdrawn by the\nFDA if the FDA believes that the designation is no longer supported by data emerging in the clinical trial process.\nSecond, a product may be designated as a breakthrough therapy if it is intended, either alone or in combination with one or more\nother products, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product\nmay demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial\ntreatment effects observed early in clinical development. The FDA may take certain actions with respect to breakthrough therapies,\nincluding holding meetings with the sponsor throughout the development process; providing timely advice to the product sponsor\nregarding development and approval; involving more senior staff in the review process; assigning a cross-disciplinary project lead for\nthe review team; and taking other steps to design the clinical trials in an efficient manner.\nThird, the FDA may designate a product for priority review if it is a product that treats a serious condition and, if approved,\nwould provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness. The FDA determines, on a case-by-case basis, whether the\nproposed product represents a significant improvement when compared with other available therapies. Significant improvement may\nbe illustrated by evidence of increased effectiveness in the treatment of a condition, elimination or substantial reduction of a treatment-\nlimiting product reaction, documented enhancement of patient compliance that may lead to improvement in serious outcomes, and\nevidence of safety and effectiveness in a new subpopulation. A priority designation is intended to direct overall attention and resources\nto the evaluation of such applications, and to shorten the FDA’s goal for taking action on a marketing application from ten months to\nsix months.\nFinally, with passage of the Cures Act in December 2016, Congress authorized the FDA to accelerate review and approval of\nproducts designated as regenerative advanced therapies. A product is eligible for this designation if it is a regenerative medicine\ntherapy (as defined in the Cures Act) that is intended to treat, modify, reverse or cure a serious or life-threatening disease or condition\nand preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug has the potential to address unmet medical needs for such disease or\ncondition. The benefits of a regenerative advanced therapy designation include early interactions with FDA to expedite development\n28\nand review, benefits available to breakthrough therapies, potential eligibility for priority review and accelerated approval based on\nsurrogate or intermediate endpoints.\nAccelerated Approval Pathway\nThe FDA may grant accelerated approval to a drug for a serious or life-threatening condition that provides meaningful\ntherapeutic advantage to patients over existing treatments based upon a determination that the drug has an effect on a surrogate\nendpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit. The FDA may also grant accelerated approval for such a condition when\nthe product has an effect on an intermediate clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than an effect on irreversible morbidity or\nmortality (“IMM”) and that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on IMM or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity,\nrarity or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. Drugs granted accelerated approval must\nmeet the same statutory standards for safety and effectiveness as those granted traditional approval.\nFor the purposes of accelerated approval, a surrogate endpoint is a marker, such as a laboratory measurement, radiographic\nimage, physical sign or other measure that is thought to predict clinical benefit, but is not itself a measure of clinical benefit. Surrogate\nendpoints can often be measured more easily or more rapidly than clinical endpoints. An intermediate clinical endpoint is a\nmeasurement of a therapeutic effect that is considered reasonably likely to predict the clinical benefit of a drug, such as an effect on\nIMM. The FDA has limited experience with accelerated approvals based on intermediate clinical endpoints, but has indicated that\nsuch endpoints generally may support accelerated approval where the therapeutic effect measured by the endpoint is not itself a\nclinical benefit and basis for traditional approval, if there is a basis for concluding that the therapeutic effect is reasonably likely to\npredict the ultimate clinical benefit of a drug.\nThe accelerated approval pathway is most often used in settings in which the course of a disease is long and an extended period\nof time is required to measure the intended clinical benefit of a drug, even if the effect on the surrogate or intermediate clinical\nendpoint occurs rapidly. Thus, accelerated approval has been used extensively in the development and approval of drugs for treatment\nof a variety of cancers in which the goal of therapy is generally to improve survival or decrease morbidity and the duration of the\ntypical disease course requires lengthy and sometimes large trials to demonstrate a clinical or survival benefit.\nThe accelerated approval pathway is usually contingent on a sponsor’s agreement to conduct, in a diligent manner, an additional\npost-approval confirmatory study(ies) to verify and describe the drug’s clinical benefit or, in certain cases where the clinical endpoint\ntakes longer to mature, the completion of the study. As a result, a drug candidate approved on this basis is subject to rigorous post-\nmarketing compliance requirements, including the completion of Phase 4 or post-approval clinical trials to confirm the effect on the\nclinical endpoint. Failure to conduct required post-approval studies, or confirm a clinical benefit during post-marketing studies, would\nallow the FDA to withdraw the drug from the market on an expedited basis. All promotional materials for drug candidates approved\nunder accelerated regulations are subject to prior review by the FDA.\nWith passage of the FDORA, in December 2022, Congress modified certain provisions governing accelerated approval of drug\nand biologic products. Specifically, the new legislation authorized FDA to: require a sponsor to have its confirmatory clinical trial\nunderway before accelerated approval is awarded, require a sponsor of a product granted accelerated approval to submit progress\nreports on its post-approval studies to FDA every six months (until the study is completed), and use expedited procedures to withdraw\naccelerated approval of an NDA or BLA after the confirmatory trial fails to verify the product’s clinical benefit. Further, the FDORA\nrequires the agency to publish on its website “the rationale for why a post-approval study is not appropriate or necessary” whenever it\ndecides not to require such a study upon granting accelerated approval.\nIn March 2023, the FDA issued draft guidance that outlines its current thinking and approach to accelerated approval. The\nagency indicated that the accelerated approval pathway is commonly used for approval of oncology drugs due to the serious and life-\nthreatening nature of cancer. Although single-arm trials have been commonly used to support accelerated approval, a randomized\ncontrolled trial is the preferred approach as it provides a more robust efficacy and safety assessment and allows for direct comparisons\nto an available therapy. To that end, the FDA outlined considerations for designing, conducting, and analyzing data for trials intended\nto support accelerated approvals of oncology therapeutics. While this guidance is currently only in draft form and will ultimately not\nbe legally binding even when finalized, sponsors typically observe the FDA’s guidance closely to ensure that their investigational\nproducts qualify for accelerated approval.\nAcceptance and Review of NDAs\nAssuming successful completion of the required clinical testing, the results of the preclinical studies and clinical trials, along\nwith information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacturing, controls, safety updates, patent information, abuse information\nand proposed labeling, are submitted to the FDA as part of an application requesting approval to market the product candidate for one\nor more indications. Data may come from company-sponsored clinical trials intended to test the safety and effectiveness of a product’s\n29\nuse or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated by investigators. To support marketing approval, the data\nsubmitted must be sufficient in quality and quantity to establish the safety and effectiveness of a drug product.\nThe fee required for the submission and review of an application under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (the “PDUFA”), is\nsubstantial (for example, for federal fiscal year 2024 this application fee is $4,048,695) and the sponsor of an approved application is\nalso subject to an annual program fee, currently set at $416,734 per eligible prescription product. These fees are typically adjusted\nannually, and exemptions and waivers may be available under certain circumstances, such as where a waiver is necessary to protect\nthe public health, where the fee would present a significant barrier to innovation, or where the sponsor is a small business submitting\nits first human therapeutic application for review. The standard review time for an initial NDA or BLA is 12 months and it is ten\nmonths for a supplemental application.\nSpecifically, the FDA conducts a preliminary review of all applications within 60 days of receipt and must inform the sponsor at\nthat time or before whether an application is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. In pertinent part, the FDA’s\nregulations state that an application “shall not be considered as filed until all pertinent information and data have been received” by\nthe FDA. In the event that FDA determines that an application does not satisfy this standard, it will issue a Refuse to File (“RTF”)\ndetermination to the sponsor. Typically, a RTF will be based on administrative incompleteness, such as clear omission of information\nor sections of required information; scientific incompleteness, such as omission of critical data, information or analyses needed to\nevaluate safety and effectiveness or provide adequate directions for use; or inadequate content, presentation, or organization of\ninformation such that substantive and meaningful review is precluded. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept\nan application for filing. In this event, the application must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted\napplication is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing.\nAfter the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review of the application. The FDA reviews\nthe application to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe and effective for its intended use, whether it\nhas an acceptable purity profile and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP. Under the goals and\npolicies agreed to by the FDA under PDUFA, the FDA has ten months from the filing date in which to complete its initial review of a\nstandard application that is a new molecular entity, and six months from the filing date for an application with “priority review.” The\nreview process may be extended by the FDA for three additional months to consider new information or in the case of a clarification\nprovided by the sponsor to address an outstanding deficiency identified by the FDA following the original submission. Despite these\nreview goals, it is not uncommon for FDA review of an application to extend beyond the PDUFA goal date.\nIn connection with its review of an application, the FDA will typically submit information requests to the sponsor and set\ndeadlines for responses thereto. The FDA will also conduct a pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facilities for the new\nproduct to determine whether the manufacturing processes and facilities comply with cGMPs. The FDA will not approve the product\nunless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and are adequate to\nassure consistent production of the product within required specifications. The FDA also may inspect the sponsor and one or more\nclinical trial sites to assure compliance with IND and GCP requirements and the integrity of the clinical data submitted to the FDA. To\nensure cGMP and GCP compliance by its employees and third-party contractors, a sponsor may incur significant expenditure of time,\nmoney and effort in the areas of training, record keeping, production and quality control.\nAdditionally, the FDA may refer an application, including applications for novel product candidates which present difficult\nquestions of safety or efficacy, to an advisory committee for review, evaluation and recommendation as to whether the application\nshould be approved and under what conditions. Typically, an advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including\nclinicians and other scientific experts that reviews, evaluates and provides a recommendation as to whether the application should be\napproved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it considers such\nrecommendations when making final decisions on approval. Data from clinical trials are not always conclusive, and the FDA or its\nadvisory committee may interpret data differently than the sponsor interprets the same data. The FDA may also re-analyze the clinical\ntrial data, which could result in extensive discussions between the FDA and the sponsor during the review process.\nThe FDA also may require submission of a REMS if it determines that a REMS is necessary to ensure that the benefits of the\nproduct outweigh its risks and to assure the safe use of the product. The REMS could include medication guides, physician\ncommunication plans, assessment plans and/or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries or\nother risk minimization tools. The FDA determines the requirement for a REMS, as well as the specific REMS provisions, on a case-\nby-case basis. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the application must submit a proposed REMS and the FDA\nwill not approve the application without a REMS.\n30\nDecisions on NDAs\nThe FDA reviews a sponsor to determine, among other things, whether the product is safe and whether it is effective for its\nintended use(s), with the latter determination being made on the basis of substantial evidence. The term “substantial evidence” is\ndefined under the FDCA as “evidence consisting of adequate and well-controlled investigations, including clinical investigations, by\nexperts qualified by scientific training and experience to evaluate the effectiveness of the product involved, on the basis of which it\ncould fairly and responsibly be concluded by such experts that the product will have the effect it purports or is represented to have\nunder the conditions of use prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the labeling or proposed labeling thereof.”\nThe FDA has interpreted this evidentiary standard to require at least two adequate and well-controlled clinical investigations to\nestablish effectiveness of a new product. Under certain circumstances, however, the FDA has indicated that a single trial with certain\ncharacteristics and additional information may satisfy this standard. This approach was subsequently endorsed by Congress in 1998\nwith legislation providing, in pertinent part, that “If [FDA] determines, based on relevant science, that data from one adequate and\nwell-controlled clinical investigation and confirmatory evidence (obtained prior to or after such investigation) are sufficient to\nestablish effectiveness, the FDA may consider such data and evidence to constitute substantial evidence.” This modification to the law\nrecognized the potential for the FDA to find that one adequate and well controlled clinical investigation with confirmatory evidence,\nincluding supportive data outside of a controlled trial, is sufficient to establish effectiveness. In December 2019, the FDA issued draft\nguidance further explaining the studies that are needed to establish substantial evidence of effectiveness. Although the FDA has not\nyet finalized that guidance, it did issue additional draft guidance in September 2023 that outlines considerations for relying on\nconfirmatory evidence in lieu of a second clinical study.\nAfter evaluating the application and all related information, including the advisory committee recommendations, if any, and\ninspection reports of manufacturing facilities and clinical trial sites, the FDA will issue either a Complete Response Letter (“CRL”) or\nan approval letter. To reach this determination, the FDA must determine that the drug is effective and that its expected benefits\noutweigh its potential risks to patients. This “benefit-risk” assessment is informed by the extensive body of evidence about the\nproduct’s safety and effectiveness in the NDA. This assessment is also informed by other factors, including: the severity of the\nunderlying condition and how well patients’ medical needs are addressed by currently available therapies; uncertainty about how the\npremarket clinical trial evidence will extrapolate to real-world use of the product in the post-market setting; and whether risk\nmanagement tools are necessary to manage specific risks. In connection with this assessment, the FDA review team will assemble all\nindividual reviews and other documents into an “action package,” which becomes the record for FDA review. The review team then\nissues a recommendation, and a senior FDA official makes a decision.\nA CRL indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete, and the application will not be approved in its present\nform. A CRL generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing or information in\norder for the FDA to reconsider the application. The CRL may require additional clinical or other data, additional pivotal Phase 3\nclinical trial(s) and/or other significant and time- consuming requirements related to clinical trials, preclinical studies or\nmanufacturing. If a CRL is issued, the sponsor will have one year to respond to the deficiencies identified by the FDA, at which time\nthe FDA can deem the application withdrawn or, in its discretion, grant the sponsor an additional six-month extension to respond. The\nFDA has committed to reviewing resubmissions in response to an issued CRL in either two or six months depending on the type of\ninformation included. Even with the submission of this additional information, however, the FDA ultimately may decide that the\napplication does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. The FDA has taken the position that a CRL is not final agency action\nmaking the determination subject to judicial review.\nAn approval letter, on the other hand, authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific prescribing information for\nspecific indications. That is, the approval will be limited to the conditions of use (e.g., patient population, indication) described in the\nFDA-approved labeling. Further, depending on the specific risk(s) to be addressed, the FDA may require that contraindications,\nwarnings or precautions be included in the product labeling, require that post-approval trials, including Phase 4 clinical trials, be\nconducted to further assess a product’s safety after approval, require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after\ncommercialization or impose other conditions, including distribution and use restrictions or other risk management mechanisms under\na REMS which can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. The FDA may prevent or limit further\nmarketing of a product based on the results of post-marketing trials or surveillance programs. After approval, some types of changes to\nthe approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims, are subject to further\ntesting requirements and FDA review and approval.\nUnder the Ensuring Innovation Act, which was signed into law in April 2021, the FDA must publish action packages\nsummarizing its decisions to approve new drugs within 30 days of approval of such products. To date, CRLs are not publicly available\ndocuments.\n31\nPost-Approval Requirements\nDrugs manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA,\nincluding, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution,\nadvertising and promotion and reporting of adverse experiences with the product. After approval, most changes to the approved\nproduct, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims, are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are\ncontinuing, annual user fee requirements for any marketed products and the establishments at which such products are manufactured,\nas well as new application fees for supplemental applications with clinical data.\nIn addition, drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to\nregister their establishments with the FDA and state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and\nthese state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and often\nrequire prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations\nfrom cGMP and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon the sponsor and any third-party manufacturers that the\nsponsor may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and\nquality control to maintain cGMP compliance.\nOnce an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is\nnot maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a\nproduct, including AEs of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory\nrequirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or\nclinical trials to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential\nconsequences include, among other things:\n• restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or\nproduct recalls;\n• fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials;\n• refusal of the FDA to approve pending NDAs or supplements to approved NDAs, or suspension or revocation of product\nlicense approvals;\n• product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or\n• injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.\nThe FDA strictly regulates the marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of prescription drug products placed on the\nmarket. This regulation includes, among other things, standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, communications\nregarding unapproved uses, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities, and promotional activities involving the Internet\nand social media. Promotional claims about a drug’s safety or effectiveness are prohibited before the drug is approved. After approval,\na drug product generally may not be promoted for uses that are not approved by the FDA, as reflected in the product’s prescribing\ninformation. In September 2021, the FDA published final regulations which describe the types of evidence that the agency will\nconsider in determining the intended use of a drug or biologic.\nIt may be permissible, under very specific, narrow conditions, for a manufacturer to engage in nonpromotional, non-misleading\ncommunication regarding off-label information, such as distributing scientific or medical journal information. Moreover, with passage\nof the Pre-Approval Information Exchange Act in December 2022, sponsors of products that have not been approved may proactively\ncommunicate to payors certain information about products in development to help expedite patient access upon product approval.\nPreviously, such communications were permitted under FDA guidance but the new legislation explicitly provides protection to\nsponsors who convey certain information about products in development to payors, including unapproved uses of approved products.\nIn addition, in October 2023, the FDA published draft guidance outlining the agency’s non-binding policies governing the distribution\nof scientific information on unapproved uses to healthcare providers. This draft guidance calls for such communications to be truthful,\nnon-misleading, factual, and unbiased and include all information necessary for healthcare providers to interpret the strengths and\nweaknesses and validity and utility of the information about the unapproved use.\nIf a company is found to have promoted off-label uses, it may become subject to adverse public relations and administrative and\njudicial enforcement by the FDA, the Department of Justice, or the Office of the Inspector General of the Department of Health and\nHuman Services (“HHS”), as well as state authorities. This could subject a company to a range of penalties that could have a\nsignificant commercial impact, including civil and criminal fines and agreements that materially restrict the manner in which a\ncompany promotes or distributes drug products. The federal government has levied large civil and criminal fines against companies\n32\nfor alleged improper promotion, and has also requested that companies enter into consent decrees or permanent injunctions under\nwhich specified promotional conduct is changed or curtailed.\nIn addition, the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical products is subject to a variety of federal and state laws. The\nPrescription Drug Marketing Act (the “PDMA”) was the first federal law to set minimum standards for the registration and regulation\nof drug distributors by the states and to regulate the distribution of drug samples. Both the PDMA and state laws limit the distribution\nof prescription pharmaceutical product samples and impose requirements to ensure accountability in distribution. In November 2013,\nthe federal Drug Supply Chain Security Act (the “DSCSA”) became effective in the U.S., mandating an industry-wide, electronic,\ninteroperable system to trace prescription drugs through the pharmaceutical distribution supply chain with a ten-year phase-in process.\nManufacturers were required by November 2023 to have such systems and processes in place however, in August 2023, the FDA set\na one-year period ending in November 2024 in which it would exercise its enforcement discretion with respect to these requirements.\nSection 505(b)(2) NDAs\nNDAs for most new drug products are based on two full clinical studies which must contain substantial evidence of the safety\nand effectiveness of the proposed new product. These applications are submitted under Section 505(b)(1) of the FDCA. The FDA is,\nhowever, authorized to approve an alternative type of NDA under Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA. This type of application allows the\nsponsor to rely, in part, on the FDA’s previous findings of safety and effectiveness for a similar product, or published literature.\nSpecifically, Section 505(b)(2) applies to NDAs for a drug for which the investigations made to show whether or not the drug is safe\nfor use and effective in use and relied upon by the sponsor for approval of the application “were not conducted by or for the sponsor\nand for which the sponsor has not obtained a right of reference or use from the person by or for whom the investigations were\nconducted.”\nSection 505(b)(2) authorizes the FDA to approve an NDA based on safety and effectiveness data that were not developed by the\nsponsor. NDAs filed under Section 505(b)(2) may provide an alternate and potentially more expeditious pathway to FDA approval for\nnew or improved formulations or new uses of previously approved products. If the Section 505(b)(2) sponsor can establish that\nreliance on the FDA’s previous approval is scientifically appropriate, the sponsor may eliminate the need to conduct certain preclinical\nor clinical studies of the new product. The FDA may also require companies to perform additional studies or measurements to support\nthe change from the approved product. The FDA may then approve the new drug candidate for all or some of the label indications for\nwhich the referenced product has been approved, as well as for any new indication sought by the Section 505(b)(2) sponsor.\nGeneric Drugs and Regulatory Exclusivity\nIn 1984, with passage of the Hatch-Waxman Amendments to the FDCA, Congress authorized the FDA to approve generic drugs\nthat are the same as drugs previously approved by the FDA under the NDA provisions of the statute. To obtain approval of a generic\ndrug, a sponsor must submit an abbreviated new drug application (“ANDA”) to the agency. In support of such applications, a generic\nmanufacturer may rely on the preclinical and clinical testing previously conducted for a drug product previously approved under an\nNDA, known as the reference-listed drug (“RLD”).\nSpecifically, in order for an ANDA to be approved, the FDA must find that the generic version is identical to the RLD with\nrespect to the active ingredients, the route of administration, the dosage form, and the strength of the drug. At the same time, the FDA\nmust also determine that the generic drug is “bioequivalent” to the innovator drug. Under the statute, a generic drug is bioequivalent to\na RLD if “the rate and extent of absorption of the drug do not show a significant difference from the rate and extent of absorption of\nthe listed drug...”\nUpon approval of an ANDA, the FDA indicates whether the generic product is “therapeutically equivalent” to the RLD in its\npublication Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, also referred to as the Orange Book. Clinicians and\npharmacists consider a therapeutic equivalent generic drug to be fully substitutable for the RLD. In addition, by operation of certain\nstate laws and numerous health insurance programs, the FDA’s designation of therapeutic equivalence often results in substitution of\nthe generic drug without the knowledge or consent of either the prescribing clinicians or patient.\nUnder the Hatch-Waxman Act, the FDA may not approve an ANDA or 505(b)(2) application until any applicable period of non-\npatent exclusivity for the RLD has expired. The FDCA provides a period of five years of non-patent data exclusivity for a new drug\ncontaining a new chemical entity (“NCE”). For the purposes of this provision, the FDA has consistently taken the position that an\nNCE is a drug that contains no active moiety that has previously been approved by the FDA in any other NDA. This interpretation was\nconfirmed with enactment of the Ensuring Innovation Act in April 2021. An active moiety is the molecule or ion responsible for the\nphysiological or pharmacological action of the drug substance. In cases where such NCE exclusivity has been granted, a generic or\nfollow-on drug application may not be filed with the FDA until the expiration of five years unless the submission is accompanied by a\nParagraph IV certification, in which case the sponsor may submit its application four years following the original product approval.\n33\nThe FDCA also provides for a period of three years of exclusivity if the NDA includes reports of one or more new clinical\ninvestigations, other than bioavailability or bioequivalence studies, that were conducted by or for the sponsor and are essential to the\napproval of the application. This three-year exclusivity period often protects changes to a previously approved drug product, such as a\nnew dosage form, route of administration, combination or indication. Three-year exclusivity would be available for a drug product that\ncontains a previously approved active moiety, provided the statutory requirement for a new clinical investigation is satisfied. Unlike\nfive-year NCE exclusivity, an award of three-year exclusivity does not block the FDA from accepting ANDAs seeking approval for\ngeneric versions of the drug as of the date of approval of the original drug product. The FDA typically makes decisions about awards\nof data exclusivity shortly before a product is approved.\nThe FDA must establish a priority review track for certain generic drugs, requiring the FDA to review a drug application within\neight months for a drug that has three or fewer approved drugs listed in the Orange Book and is no longer protected by any patent or\nregulatory exclusivities, or is on the FDA’s drug shortage list. The new legislation also authorizes the FDA to expedite review of\ncompetitor generic therapies or drugs with inadequate generic competition, including holding meetings with or providing advice to the\ndrug sponsor prior to submission of the application.\nHatch-Waxman Patent Certification and the 30-Month Stay\nAs part of the submission of an NDA or certain supplemental applications, NDA sponsors are required to list with the FDA each\npatent with claims that cover the sponsor’s product or an approved method of using the product. Upon approval of a new drug, each of\nthe patents listed in the application for the drug is then published in the Orange Book. The FDA’s regulations governing patient\nlistings were largely codified into law with enactment of the Orange Book Modernization Act in January 2021. When an ANDA\nsponsor files its application with the FDA, the sponsor is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the reference\nproduct in the Orange Book, except for patents covering methods of use for which the ANDA sponsor is not seeking approval. To the\nextent that the Section 505(b)(2) sponsor is relying on studies conducted for an already approved product, the sponsor is required to\ncertify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the approved product in the Orange Book to the same extent that an ANDA\nsponsor would.\nSpecifically, the sponsor must certify with respect to each patent that:\n• the required patent information has not been filed;\n• the listed patent has expired;\n• the listed patent has not expired, but will expire on a particular date and approval is sought after patent expiration; or\n• the listed patent is invalid, unenforceable or will not be infringed by the new product.\nA certification that the new product will not infringe the already approved product’s listed patents or that such patents are\ninvalid or unenforceable is called a Paragraph IV certification. If the sponsor does not challenge the listed patents or indicates that it is\nnot seeking approval of a patented method of use, the ANDA application will not be approved until all the listed patents claiming the\nreferenced product have expired (other than method of use patents involving indications for which the ANDA sponsor is not seeking\napproval).\nIf the ANDA sponsor has provided a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the sponsor must also send notice of the Paragraph\nIV certification to the NDA and patent holders once the ANDA has been accepted for filing by the FDA. The NDA and patent holders\nmay then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the notice of the Paragraph IV certification. The filing of a patent\ninfringement lawsuit within 45 days after the receipt of a Paragraph IV certification automatically prevents the FDA from approving\nthe ANDA until the earlier of 30 months after the receipt of the Paragraph IV notice, expiration of the patent, or a decision in the\ninfringement case that is favorable to the ANDA sponsor.\nTo the extent that the Section 505(b)(2) sponsor is relying on studies conducted for an already approved product, the sponsor is\nrequired to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the approved product in the Orange Book to the same extent that an\nANDA sponsor would. As a result, approval of a Section 505(b)(2) NDA can be stalled until all the listed patents claiming the\nreferenced product have expired, until any non-patent exclusivity, such as exclusivity for obtaining approval of an NCE, listed in the\nOrange Book for the referenced product has expired, and, in the case of a Paragraph IV certification and subsequent patent\ninfringement suit, until the earlier of 30 months, settlement of the lawsuit or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the\nSection 505(b)(2) sponsor.\n34\nOrphan Drug Designation and Exclusivity\nOrphan Drug Designation in the U.S. is designed to encourage sponsors to develop products intended for treatment of rare\ndiseases or conditions. In the U.S., a rare disease or condition is statutorily defined as a condition that affects fewer than 200,000\nindividuals in the U.S. or that affects more than 200,000 individuals in the U.S. and for which there is no reasonable expectation that\nthe cost of developing and making available the product for the disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product in the\nU.S.\nOrphan Drug Designation qualifies a company for tax credits and potentially market exclusivity for seven years following the\ndate of the product’s approval if granted by the FDA. An application for designation as an orphan product can be made any time prior\nto the filing of an application for approval to market the product. A product becomes an orphan when it receives Orphan Drug\nDesignation from the Office of Orphan Products Development at the FDA based on acceptable confidential requests. The product\nmust then go through the review and approval process like any other product.\nA sponsor may request Orphan Drug Designation of a previously unapproved product or new orphan indication for an already\nmarketed product. In addition, a sponsor of a product that is otherwise the same product as an already approved orphan drug may seek\nand obtain Orphan Drug Designation for the subsequent product for the same rare disease or condition if it can present a plausible\nhypothesis that its product may be clinically superior to the first approved product. More than one sponsor may receive Orphan Drug\nDesignation for the same product for the same rare disease or condition, but each sponsor seeking Orphan Drug Designation must file\na complete request for designation.\nIf a product with orphan designation receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such\ndesignation or for a select indication or use within the rare disease or condition for which it was designated, the product generally will\nreceive orphan drug exclusivity. Orphan drug exclusivity means that the FDA may not approve another sponsor’s marketing\napplication for the same product for the same disease or condition for seven years, except in certain limited circumstances. If a product\ndesignated as an orphan drug ultimately receives marketing approval for an indication broader than what was designated in its orphan\ndrug application, it may not be entitled to exclusivity.\nThe period of market exclusivity begins on the date that the marketing application is approved by the FDA and applies only to\nthe disease or condition for which the product has been designated. Orphan drug exclusivity will not bar approval of another product\nunder certain circumstances, including if the company with orphan drug exclusivity is not able to meet market demand or the\nsubsequent product is shown to be clinically superior to the approved product on the basis of greater efficacy or safety, or providing a\nmajor contribution to patient care. This is the case despite an earlier court opinion holding that the Orphan Drug Act unambiguously\nrequired the FDA to recognize orphan drug exclusivity regardless of a showing of clinical superiority. Under Omnibus legislation\nsigned by former President Trump in December 2020, the requirement for a product to show clinical superiority applies to drug\nproducts that received Orphan Drug Designation before enactment of amendments to the FDCA in 2017 but have not yet been\napproved by FDA.\nIn September 2021, the Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit held that, for the purpose of determining the scope of market\nexclusivity, the term “same disease or condition” in the statute means the designated “rare disease or condition” and could not be\ninterpreted by the FDA to mean the “indication or use.” Thus, the court concluded, orphan drug exclusivity applies to the entire\ndesignated disease or condition rather than the “indication or use.” It is unclear how this court decision will be addressed by the FDA\nand Congress. Although there have been legislative proposals to overrule this decision, they have not been enacted into law. On\nJanuary 23, 2023, the FDA announced that, in matters beyond the scope of that court order, the FDA will continue to apply its existing\nregulations tying orphan-drug exclusivity to the uses or indications for which the orphan drug was approved.\nPediatric Exclusivity\nPediatric exclusivity is a type of non-patent marketing exclusivity in the U.S. and, if granted, provides for the attachment of an\nadditional six months of exclusivity. For drug products, the six-month exclusivity may be attached to the term of any existing patent or\nregulatory exclusivity, including the orphan exclusivity and regulatory exclusivities available under the Hatch-Waxman provisions of\nthe FDCA. For biologic products, the six-month period may be attached to any existing regulatory exclusivities but not to any patent\nterms. The conditions for pediatric exclusivity include the FDA’s determination that information relating to the use of a new product\nin the pediatric population may produce health benefits in that population, the FDA making a written request for pediatric clinical\ntrials, and the sponsor agreeing to perform, and reporting on, the requested clinical trials within the statutory timeframe. This six-\nmonth exclusivity may be granted if an NDA sponsor submits pediatric data that fairly respond to a written request from the FDA for\nsuch data. The data do not need to show the product to be effective in the pediatric population studied; rather, if the clinical trial is\ndeemed to fairly respond to the FDA’s request, the additional protection is granted. If reports of requested pediatric studies are\nsubmitted to and accepted by the FDA within the statutory time limits, whatever statutory or regulatory periods of exclusivity or\n35\npatents that cover the product are extended by six months. Although this is not a patent term extension, it effectively extends the\nregulatory period during which the FDA cannot approve another application.\nPatent Term Restoration and Extension\nA patent claiming a new drug product may be eligible for a limited patent term extension under the Hatch-Waxman Act, which\npermits a patent restoration of up to five years for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review. The\nrestoration period granted is typically one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of an NDA, plus\nthe time between the submission date of an NDA and the ultimate approval date. Patent term restoration cannot be used to extend the\nremaining term of a patent past a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. Only one patent applicable to an approved drug\nproduct is eligible for the extension, and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent in\nquestion. A patent that covers multiple drugs for which approval is sought can only be extended in connection with one of the\napprovals. The USPTO reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration in consultation with the\nFDA.\nHealthcare Compliance\nIn the U.S., biopharmaceutical manufacturers and their products are subject to extensive regulation at the federal and state level,\nsuch as laws intended to prevent fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry. Healthcare providers and third-party payors play a\nprimary role in the recommendation and prescription of pharmaceutical products that are granted marketing approval. Arrangements\nwith providers, consultants, third-party payors, and customers are subject to broadly applicable fraud and abuse, anti-kickback, false\nclaims laws, reporting of payments to healthcare providers and patient privacy laws and regulations and other healthcare laws and\nregulations that may constrain our business and/or financial arrangements. Restrictions under applicable federal and state healthcare\nlaws and regulations, including certain laws and regulations applicable only if we have marketed products, include the following:\n• federal false claims, false statements and civil monetary penalties laws prohibiting, among other things, any person from\nknowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment of government funds or knowingly making, or\ncausing to be made, a false statement to get a false claim paid;\n• federal healthcare program anti-kickback law, which prohibits, among other things, persons from offering, soliciting,\nreceiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce either the referral of an individual for, or the\npurchasing or ordering of, a good or service for which payment may be made under federal healthcare programs such as\nMedicare and Medicaid;\n• the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”), which, in addition to privacy\nprotections applicable to healthcare providers and other entities, prohibits executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare\nbenefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters;\n• federal laws that require pharmaceutical manufacturers to report certain calculated product prices to the government or\nprovide certain discounts or rebates to government authorities or private entities, often as a condition of reimbursement\nunder government healthcare programs;\n• federal Open Payments (or federal “sunshine” law), which requires pharmaceutical and medical device companies to\nmonitor and report certain financial interactions with certain healthcare providers to the Center for Medicare & Medicaid\nServices (the “CMS”), within the HHS for re-disclosure to the public, as well as ownership and investment interests held\nby physicians and their immediate family members;\n• federal consumer protection and unfair competition laws, which broadly regulate marketplace activities and activities that\npotentially harm consumers;\n• analogous state laws and regulations, including: state anti-kickback and false claims laws; state laws requiring\npharmaceutical companies to comply with specific compliance standards, restrict financial interactions between\npharmaceutical companies and healthcare providers or require pharmaceutical companies to report information related to\npayments to health care providers or marketing expenditures; and state laws governing privacy, security and breaches of\nhealth information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not\npreempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts; and\n• laws and regulations prohibiting bribery and corruption such as the FCPA, which, among other things, prohibits U.S.\ncompanies and their employees and agents from authorizing, promising, offering, or providing, directly or indirectly,\ncorrupt or improper payments or anything else of value to foreign government officials, employees of public international\norganizations or foreign government-owned or affiliated entities, candidates for foreign public office, and foreign political\nparties or officials thereof.\n36\nViolations of these laws are punishable by criminal and/or civil sanctions, including, in some instances, exclusion from\nparticipation in federal and state health care programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid. Ensuring compliance is time consuming and\ncostly. Similar healthcare laws and regulations exist in the EU and other jurisdictions, including reporting requirements detailing\ninteractions with and payments to healthcare providers and laws governing the privacy and security of personal information.\nHealthcare Reform\nA primary trend in the U.S. healthcare industry and elsewhere is cost containment. There have been a number of federal and\nstate proposals during the last few years regarding the pricing of drug and biologic products, limiting coverage and reimbursement for\nmedical products and other changes to the healthcare system in the U.S.\nIn March 2010, the U.S. Congress enacted the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and\nEducation Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, the “PPACA”), which, among other things, includes changes to the coverage and\npayment for pharmaceutical products under government healthcare programs. Other legislative changes have been proposed and\nadopted since the PPACA was enacted. In August 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, created measures for\nspending reductions by Congress. A Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, tasked with recommending a targeted deficit\nreduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, was unable to reach required goals, thereby triggering the\nlegislation’s automatic reduction to several government programs. These changes included aggregate reductions to Medicare\npayments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect in April 2013 and will remain in effect through 2031.\nUnder current legislation, the actual reductions in Medicare payments may vary up to 4%. The Consolidated Appropriations\nAct, which was signed into law by President Biden in December 2022, made several changes to sequestration of the Medicare\nprogram. Section 1001 of the Consolidated Appropriations Act delays the 4% Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010 sequester for two\nyears, through the end of calendar year 2024. Triggered by enactment of the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, the 4% cut to the\nMedicare program would have taken effect in January 2023. The Consolidated Appropriations Act’s health care offset title includes\nSection 4163, which extends the 2% Budget Control Act of 2011 Medicare sequester for six months into fiscal year 2032 and lowers\nthe payment reduction percentages in fiscal years 2030 and 2031.\nSince enactment of the PPACA, there have been, and continue to be, numerous legal challenges and Congressional actions to\nrepeal and replace provisions of the law. For example, with enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the “TCJA”), which was\nsigned by former President Trump in December 2017, Congress repealed the “individual mandate.” The repeal of this provision,\nwhich requires most Americans to carry a minimal level of health insurance, became effective in 2019. In December 2018, a U.S.\nDistrict Court judge in the Northern District of Texas ruled that the individual mandate portion of the PPACA is an essential and\ninseverable feature of the PPACA, and therefore because the mandate was repealed as part of the TCJA, the remaining provisions of\nthe PPACA are invalid as well. In June 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed this action after finding that the plaintiffs did not\nhave standing to challenge the constitutionality of the PPACA. Litigation and legislation over the PPACA are likely to continue, with\nunpredictable and uncertain results.\nThe Trump Administration also took executive actions to undermine or delay implementation of the PPACA, including\ndirecting federal agencies with authorities and responsibilities under the PPACA to waive, defer, grant exemptions from, or delay the\nimplementation of any provision of the PPACA that would impose a fiscal or regulatory burden on states, individuals, healthcare\nproviders, health insurers, or manufacturers of pharmaceuticals or medical devices. In January 2021, however, President Biden\nrescinded those orders and issued a new executive order that directs federal agencies to reconsider rules and other policies that limit\naccess to healthcare, and consider actions that will protect and strengthen that access. Under this order, federal agencies are directed to\nre-examine: policies that undermine protections for people with pre-existing conditions, including complications related to COVID 19;\ndemonstrations and waivers under Medicaid and the PPACA that may reduce coverage or undermine the programs, including work\nrequirements; policies that undermine the Health Insurance Marketplace or other markets for health insurance; policies that make it\nmore difficult to enroll in Medicaid and under the PPACA; and policies that reduce affordability of coverage or financial assistance,\nincluding for dependents.\nPharmaceutical Prices\nThe prices of prescription pharmaceuticals have also been the subject of considerable discussion in the U.S. There have been\nseveral recent U.S. congressional inquiries, as well as proposed and enacted state and federal legislation designed to, among other\nthings, bring more transparency to pharmaceutical pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient\nprograms, and reduce the costs of pharmaceuticals under Medicare and Medicaid. In 2020, former President Trump issued several\nexecutive orders intended to lower the costs of prescription products and certain provisions in these orders have been incorporated into\nregulations. These regulations include an interim final rule implementing a most favored nation model for prices that would tie\nMedicare Part B payments for certain physician-administered pharmaceuticals to the lowest price paid in other economically advanced\n37\ncountries, effective January 1, 2021. That rule, however, has been subject to a nationwide preliminary injunction and, in December\n2021, CMS issued a final rule to rescind it. With issuance of this rule, CMS stated that it will explore all options to incorporate value\ninto payments for Medicare Part B pharmaceuticals and improve beneficiaries’ access to evidence-based care.\nIn addition, the HHS and the FDA published a final rule allowing states and other entities to develop a Section 804 Importation\nProgram to import certain prescription drugs from Canada into the U.S. That regulation was challenged in a lawsuit by the\nPharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (“PhRMA”) but the case was dismissed by a federal district court in February\n2023 after the court found that PhRMA did not have standing to sue the HHS. Nine states (Colorado, Florida, Maine, New Hampshire,\nNew Mexico, North Dakota, Texas, Vermont and Wisconsin) have passed laws allowing for the importation of drugs from Canada.\nCertain of these states have submitted Section 804 Importation Program proposals and are awaiting FDA approval. On January 5,\n2024, the FDA approved Florida’s plan for Canadian drug importation.\nFurther, the HHS finalized a regulation removing safe harbor protection for price reductions from pharmaceutical manufacturers\nto plan sponsors under Part D, either directly or through pharmacy benefit managers, unless the price reduction is required by law. The\nfinal rule would also eliminate the current safe harbor for Medicare drug rebates and create new safe harbors for beneficiary point-of-\nsale discounts and pharmacy benefit manager service fees. It originally was set to go into effect on January 1, 2022, but with passage\nof the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the “IRA”) has been delayed by Congress to January 1, 2032.\nIn July 2021, President Biden signed Executive Order 14063, which focuses on, among other things, the price of\npharmaceuticals. The Order directs the HHS to create a plan within 45 days to combat “excessive pricing of prescription\npharmaceuticals and enhance domestic pharmaceutical supply chains, to reduce the prices paid by the federal government for such\npharmaceuticals, and to address the recurrent problem of price gouging.” In September 2021, HHS released its plan to reduce\npharmaceutical prices. The key features of that plan are to: (a) make pharmaceutical prices more affordable and equitable for all\nconsumers and throughout the health care system by supporting pharmaceutical price negotiations with manufacturers; (b) improve\nand promote competition throughout the prescription pharmaceutical industry by supporting market changes that strengthen supply\nchains, promote biosimilars and generic drugs, and increase transparency; and (c) foster scientific innovation to promote better\nhealthcare and improve health by supporting public and private research and making sure that market incentives promote discovery of\nvaluable and accessible new treatments.\nOn August 16, 2022, the IRA was signed into law by President Biden. The new legislation has implications for Medicare Part D,\nwhich is a program available to individuals who are entitled to Medicare Part A or enrolled in Medicare Part B to give them the option\nof paying a monthly premium for outpatient prescription drug coverage. Among other things, the IRA requires manufacturers of\ncertain drugs to engage in price negotiations with Medicare (beginning in 2026), with prices that can be negotiated subject to a cap;\nimposes rebates under Medicare Part B and Medicare Part D to penalize price increases that outpace inflation; and replaces the Part D\ncoverage gap discount program with a new discounting program (beginning in 2025). The IRA permits the Secretary of the HHS to\nimplement many of these provisions through guidance, as opposed to regulation, for the initial years.\nSpecifically, with respect to price negotiations, Congress authorized Medicare to negotiate lower prices for certain costly single-\nsource drug and biologic products that do not have competing generics or biosimilars and are reimbursed under Medicare Part B and\nPart D. CMS may negotiate prices for ten high-cost drugs paid for by Medicare Part D starting in 2026, followed by 15 Part D drugs in\n2027, 15 Part B or Part D drugs in 2028, and 20 Part B or Part D drugs in 2029 and beyond. This provision applies to drug products\nthat have been approved for at least 9 years and biologics that have been licensed for 13 years, but it does not apply to drugs and\nbiologics that have been approved for a single rare disease or condition. Further, the legislation subjects drug manufacturers to civil\nmonetary penalties and a potential excise tax for failing to comply with the legislation by offering a price that is not equal to or less\nthan the negotiated “maximum fair price” under the law or for taking price increases that exceed inflation. The legislation also\nrequires manufacturers to pay rebates for drugs in Medicare Part D whose price increases exceed inflation. The new law also caps\nMedicare out-of-pocket drug costs at an estimated $4,000 a year in 2024 and, thereafter beginning in 2025, at $2,000 a year.\nOn June 6, 2023, Merck filed a lawsuit against the HHS and CMS asserting that, among other things, the IRA’s Drug Price\nNegotiation Program for Medicare constitutes an uncompensated taking in violation of the Fifth Amendment of the Constitution.\nSubsequently, a number of other parties, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, BMS, PhRMA, Astellas, Novo Nordisk, Janssen\nPharmaceuticals, Novartis, AstraZeneca and Boehringer Ingelheim, also filed lawsuits in various courts with similar constitutional\nclaims against the HHS and CMS. Litigation involving these and other provisions of the IRA will continue with unpredictable and\nuncertain results.\nAt the state level, individual states are increasingly aggressive in passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to\ncontrol pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on\ncertain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage\n38\nimportation from other countries and bulk purchasing. A number of states, for example, require drug manufacturers and other entities\nin the drug supply chain, including health carriers, pharmacy benefit managers, wholesale distributors, to disclose information about\npricing of pharmaceuticals. In addition, regional healthcare organizations and individual hospitals are increasingly using bidding\nprocedures to determine what pharmaceutical products and which suppliers will be included in their prescription pharmaceutical and\nother healthcare programs. These measures could reduce the ultimate demand for our products, once approved, or put pressure on our\nproduct pricing. We expect that additional state and federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which\ncould limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in reduced\ndemand for our product candidates or additional pricing pressures.\nFederal and State Data Privacy Laws\nThere are numerous U.S. federal and state laws and regulations related to the privacy and security of personal information. In\nparticular, regulations promulgated pursuant to HIPAA establish privacy and security standards that limit the use and disclosure of\nindividually identifiable health information, or protected health information, and require the implementation of administrative,\nphysical and technological safeguards to protect the privacy of protected health information and ensure the confidentiality, integrity\nand availability of electronic protected health information. Determining whether protected health information has been handled in\ncompliance with applicable privacy standards and our contractual obligations can be complex and may be subject to changing\ninterpretation. If a sponsor fails to comply with applicable privacy laws, including applicable HIPAA privacy and security standards, it\ncould face civil and criminal penalties. HHS enforcement activity can result in financial liability and reputational harm, and responses\nto such enforcement activity can consume significant internal resources. In addition, state attorneys general are authorized to bring\ncivil actions seeking either injunctions or damages in response to violations that threaten the privacy of state residents.\nIn addition to potential enforcement by the HHS, a sponsor is also potentially subject to privacy enforcement from the Federal\nTrade Commission (the “FTC”). The FTC has been particularly focused on the unpermitted processing of health and genetic data\nthrough its recent enforcement actions and is expanding the types of privacy violations that it interprets to be “unfair” under Section 5\nof the FTC Act, as well as the types of activities it views to trigger the Health Breach Notification Rule (which the FTC also has the\nauthority to enforce). The agency is also in the process of developing rules related to commercial surveillance and data security.\nSponsors will need to account for the FTC’s evolving rules and guidance for proper privacy and data security practices in order to\nmitigate risk for a potential enforcement action, which may be costly.\nStates are also active in creating specific rules relating to the processing of personal information. In 2018, California passed into\nlaw the California Consumer Privacy Act (the “CCPA”), which took effect on January 1, 2020 and imposed many requirements on\nbusinesses that process the personal information of California residents. Many of the CCPA’s requirements are similar to those found\nin the General Data Protection Regulation (the “GDPR”), which is further described below, including requiring businesses to provide\nnotice to data subjects regarding the information collected about them and how such information is used and shared, and providing\ndata subjects the right to request access to such personal information and, in certain cases, request the erasure of such personal\ninformation. The CCPA also affords California residents the right to opt-out of “sales” of their personal information. The CCPA\ncontains significant penalties for companies that violate its requirements.\nIn November 2020, California voters passed a ballot initiative for the California Privacy Rights Act (the “CPRA”), which went\ninto effect on January 1, 2023 and significantly expanded the CCPA to incorporate additional GDPR-like provisions including\nrequiring that the use, retention and sharing of personal information of California residents be reasonably necessary and proportionate\nto the purposes of collection or processing, granting additional protections for sensitive personal information, and requiring greater\ndisclosures related to notice to residents regarding retention of information. The CPRA also created a new enforcement agency – the\nCalifornia Privacy Protection Agency – the sole responsibility of which is to enforce the CPRA and other California privacy laws,\nwhich will further increase compliance risk.\nIn addition to California, eleven other states have passed comprehensive privacy laws similar to the CCPA and CPRA. These\nlaws are either in effect or will go into effect sometime before the end of 2026. Like the CCPA and CPRA, these laws create\nobligations related to the processing of personal information, as well as special obligations for the processing of “sensitive” data\n(which includes health data in some cases). Some of the provisions of these laws may apply to our business activities. There are also\nstates that are strongly considering or have already passed comprehensive privacy laws during the 2024 legislative sessions that will\ngo into effect in 2025 and beyond, including New Hampshire and New Jersey. Other states will be considering these laws in the\nfuture, and Congress has also been debating passing a federal privacy law. There are also states that are specifically regulating health\ninformation that may affect our business. For example, Washington state passed a health privacy law in 2023 that will regulate the\ncollection and sharing of health information, and the law also has a private right of action, which further increases the relevant\ncompliance risk. Connecticut and Nevada have also passed similar laws regulating consumer health data, and more states (such as\nVermont) are considering such legislation in 2024. These laws may impact our business activities, including our identification of\nresearch subjects, relationships with business partners and ultimately the marketing and distribution of our products.\n39\nReview and Approval of Drug Products in the European Union\nIn order to market any product outside of the U.S., a company must also comply with numerous and varying regulatory\nrequirements of other countries and jurisdictions regarding quality, safety and effectiveness and governing, among other things,\nclinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales and distribution of drug products. Whether or not a company obtains FDA\napproval for a product candidate, it must obtain approval by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries or economic\nareas, such as the 27-member EU, before it may commence clinical trials or market products in those countries or areas. As in the\nU.S., medicinal products can be marketed only if a marketing authorization from the competent regulatory agencies has been obtained.\nSimilar to the U.S., the various phases of preclinical and clinical research in the EU are subject to significant regulatory controls.\nThe EU/European Economic Area (“EEA”) applies harmonized regulatory rules for medicinal products, for the approval process\nand requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, and for the regulatory approval of medicinal products. However, pricing and\nreimbursement for medicinal products varies greatly between countries and jurisdictions and can involve additional testing for health\ntechnology assessments and additional administrative review periods. The time required to obtain approval in other countries and\njurisdictions might differ from and be longer than that required to obtain FDA approval. Regulatory approval in one country or\njurisdiction does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country or\njurisdiction may negatively impact the regulatory process in others.\nClinical Trial Approval\nOn January 31, 2022, the new Clinical Trials Regulation (EU) No 536/2014 (“CTR”) became effective in the EU and replaced\nthe prior Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC (“CTD”). The new regulation aims at simplifying and streamlining the authorization,\nconduct and transparency of clinical trials in the EU. Under the new coordinated procedure for the approval of clinical trials, the\nsponsor of a clinical trial to be conducted in more than one Member State of the EU (“EU Member State”) will only be required to\nsubmit a single application for approval. The submission has to be made through the Clinical Trials Information System (“CTIS”), a\nnew clinical trials portal overseen by the European Medicines Agency (“EMA”) and available to clinical trial sponsors, competent\nauthorities of the EU Member States and the public. All ongoing clinical trials in the EU approved under the prior CTD must be\ntransitioned to the CTIS by January 31, 2025. This date marks the end of a three-year transition period that began when the CTR\nbecame applicable in the EU on January 31, 2022. Clinical trials that were started under the CTD and subject to transition to the CTR\nwill by January 31, 2025 have to comply with the obligations of the CTR even if these are not included in the previous study protocol,\nsuch as (i) obligations of notification via CTIS; (ii) safety reporting rules; (iii) archiving requirement; and (iv) transparency\nrequirements. Failure to transition ongoing clinical trials to the CTR by January 31, 2025 can result in corrective measures under\nArticle 77 CTR, including revocation of the authorization of the clinical trial or suspension of the clinical trial as well as criminal\nsanctions and fines under national law of EU Member States.\nBeyond streamlining the process, the new CTR includes a single set of documents to be prepared and submitted for the\napplication as well as simplified reporting procedures for clinical trial sponsors, and a harmonized procedure for the assessment of\napplications for clinical trials, which is divided in two parts. Part I is assessed by the competent authorities of all EU Member States in\nwhich an application for authorization of a clinical trial has been submitted (Member States concerned). Part II is assessed separately\nby each Member State concerned. Strict deadlines have been established for the assessment of clinical trial applications. The role of\nthe relevant ethics committees in the assessment procedure will continue to be governed by the national law of the concerned EU\nMember State. However, overall related timelines are defined in the CTR.\nThe new regulation did not change the preexisting requirement that a sponsor must obtain prior approval from the competent\nnational authority of the EU Member State in which the clinical trial is to be conducted. If the clinical trial is conducted in different\nEU Member States, the competent authorities in each of these EU Member States must provide their approval for the conduct of the\nclinical trial. Furthermore, the sponsor may only start a clinical trial at a specific clinical site after the applicable ethics committee has\nissued a favorable opinion.\nParties conducting certain clinical trials must, as in the U.S., post clinical trial information in the EU at the EudraCT website:\nhttps://eudract.ema.europa.eu.\nProcedures Governing Approval of Drug Products\nTo obtain marketing authorization of a product under EU regulatory systems, a sponsor must submit an MAA either under a\ncentralized or decentralized procedure/mutual recognition procedure (“MRP”). The centralized procedure provides for the grant of a\nsingle marketing authorization by the EC that is valid for all EU member states. The centralized procedure is compulsory for specific\nproducts, including for medicines produced by certain biotechnological processes, products designated as orphan medicinal products,\nadvanced therapy products and products with a new active substance indicated for the treatment of certain diseases. For products with\n40\na new active substance indicated for the treatment of other diseases and products that are highly innovative or for which a centralized\nprocess is in the interest of patients, the centralized procedure may be optional.\nUnder the centralized procedure, the EMA’s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (“CHMP”) established at the\nEMA is responsible for conducting the initial assessment of a product. The CHMP is also responsible for several post-authorization\nand maintenance activities, such as the assessment of modifications or extensions to an existing marketing authorization. Under the\ncentralized procedure in the EU, the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of an MAA is 210 days, excluding clock stops, when\nadditional information or written or oral explanation is to be provided by the sponsor in response to questions of the CHMP.\nAccelerated evaluation might be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases, when a medicinal product is of major interest from the\npoint of view of public health and in particular from the viewpoint of therapeutic innovation. In this circumstance, the EMA ensures\nthat the opinion of the CHMP is given within 150 days.\nThe decentralized procedure or MRP is available to sponsors who wish to market a product in various EU member states where\nsuch product has not received marketing approval in any EU member states before. The decentralized procedure provides for approval\nby one or more other, or concerned, member states of an assessment of an application performed by one member state designated by\nthe sponsor, known as the reference member state (“RMS”). Under this procedure, a sponsor submits an application based on identical\ndossiers and related materials, including a draft summary of product characteristics, and draft labeling and package leaflet, to the RMS\nand concerned member states. The RMS prepares a draft assessment report and drafts of the related materials within 210 days after\nreceipt of a valid application. Within 90 days of receiving the RMS’s assessment report and related materials, each concerned member\nstate must decide whether to approve the assessment report and related materials. If a member state cannot approve the assessment\nreport and related materials on the grounds of potential serious risk to public health, the disputed points are subject to a dispute\nresolution mechanism and may eventually be referred to the EC, whose decision is binding on all member states.\nWithin this framework, manufacturers may seek approval of hybrid medicinal products under Article 10(3) of Directive\n2001/83/EC. Hybrid applications rely, in part, on information and data from a reference product and new data from appropriate\npreclinical tests and clinical trials. Such applications are necessary when the proposed product does not meet the strict definition of a\ngeneric medicinal product, or bioavailability studies cannot be used to demonstrate bioequivalence, or there are changes in the active\nsubstance(s), therapeutic indications, strength, pharmaceutical form or route of administration of the generic product compared to the\nreference medicinal product. In such cases the results of tests and trials must be consistent with the data content standards required in\nthe Annex to the Directive 2001/83/EC, as amended by Directive 2003/63/EC.\nHybrid medicinal product applications have automatic access to the centralized procedure when the reference product was\nauthorized for marketing via that procedure. Where the reference product was authorized via the decentralized procedure, a hybrid\napplication may be accepted for consideration under the centralized procedure if the sponsor shows that the medicinal product\nconstitutes a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation, or the granting of a community authorization for the medicinal\nproduct is in the interest of patients at the community level.\nApproval of companion diagnostic devices\nIn the EU, medical devices such as companion diagnostics must comply with the General Safety and Performance Requirements\n(“SPRs”) detailed in Annex I of the EU Medical Devices Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2017/745) (“MDR”), which came into force in\nMay 2021 and replaced the previously applicable EU Medical Devices Directive (Council Directive 93/42/EEC). Compliance with\nSPRs and additional requirements applicable to companion medical devices is a prerequisite to be able to affix the Conformitè\nEuropëenne mark of conformity to medical devices, without which they cannot be marketed or sold. To demonstrate compliance with\nthe SPRs, a manufacturer must undergo a conformity assessment procedure, which varies according to the type of medical device and\nits classification. The MDR is meant to establish a uniform, transparent, predictable, and sustainable regulatory framework across the\nEU for medical devices.\nSeparately, the regulatory authorities in the EU also adopted a new In Vitro Diagnostic Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2017/746)\n(“IVDR”) for In vitro diagnostic medical devices (“IVDs”). The new regulation replaces the In Vitro Diagnostic Directive (“IVDD”)\n98/79/EC. The IVDR, among other things:\n• strengthens the rules on placing devices on the market and reinforces surveillance once they are available;\n• establishes explicit provisions on manufacturers’ responsibilities for the follow-up of the quality, performance and safety\nof devices placed on the market;\n• improves the traceability of medical devices throughout the supply chain to the end-user or patient through a unique\nidentification number;\n41\n• establishes a central database to provide patients, healthcare professionals and the public with comprehensive information\non products available in the EU; and\n• strengthens rules for the assessment of certain high-risk devices, such as implants, which may have to undergo an\nadditional check by experts before they are placed on the market.\nThe IVDR became effective in May 2022. However, it became clear in 2021 that that EU Member States, health institutions and\neconomic operators were not ready to apply the IVDR as from that date. The EC therefore proposed a progressive or staggered roll-out\nof the rules of the IVDR. The current transition periods range from May 26, 2025 for high risk IVDs to May 26, 2027 for lower risk\nIVDs. Certain provisions for devices manufactured and used in health institutions, would have to apply as from May 26, 2028. These\ntransition periods only apply to so called “legacy devices”, meaning devices covered by a certificate or declaration of conformity\nissued under the previous legal framework (notably the IVDD). These legacy devices, benefit from the extended transition periods if\nthey fulfil certain conditions, notably (i) that they continue to comply with the rules in force when they were placed on the market for\nthe first time; (ii) that there are no significant changes in the design or intended purpose of the devices; (iii) that the devices do not\npresent an unacceptable risk to the health or safety of patients, users or other persons, or to other aspects of the protection of public\nhealth and (iv) that no later than May 26, 2025, the manufacturer puts in place a quality management system compliant with the\nIVDR. For devices requiring an assessment by a notified body, the manufacturer must submit an application to the notified body to\ntransfer the device to the IVDR by May 26, 2025 (class D), 2026 (class C) or 2027 (class B and A sterile IVDs).\nConditional Approval\nIn particular circumstances, EU legislation (Article 14–a Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 (as amended by Regulation (EU) 2019/5\nand Regulation (EC) No 507/2006 on Conditional Marketing Authorizations for Medicinal Products for Human Use) enables sponsors\nto obtain a conditional marketing authorization prior to obtaining the comprehensive clinical data required for an application for a full\nmarketing authorization. Such conditional approvals may be granted for product candidates (including medicines designated as orphan\nmedicinal products) if (1) the product candidate is intended for the treatment, prevention, or medical diagnosis of seriously debilitating\nor life-threatening diseases; (2) the product candidate is intended to meet unmet medical needs of patients; (3) a marketing\nauthorization may be granted prior to submission of comprehensive clinical data provided that the benefit of the immediate availability\non the market of the medicinal product concerned outweighs the risk inherent in the fact that additional data are still required; (4) the\nrisk-benefit balance of the product candidate is positive, and (5) it is likely that the sponsor will be in a position to provide the required\ncomprehensive clinical trial data.\nA conditional marketing authorization may contain specific obligations to be fulfilled by the marketing authorization holder,\nincluding obligations with respect to the completion of ongoing or new clinical studies and with respect to the collection of\npharmacovigilance data. Conditional marketing authorizations are valid for one year, and may be renewed annually, if the risk-benefit\nbalance remains positive, and after an assessment of the need for additional or modified conditions or specific obligations. The\ntimelines for the centralized procedure described above also apply with respect to the review by the CHMP of applications for a\nconditional marketing authorization, but sponsors can also request the EMA to conduct an accelerated assessment, for instance in\ncases of unmet medical needs.\nPediatric Studies\nPrior to obtaining a marketing authorization in the EU, sponsors have to demonstrate compliance with all measures included in\nan EMA-approved Pediatric Investigation Plan (“PIP”) covering all subsets of the pediatric population, unless the EMA has granted a\nproduct-specific waiver, a class waiver or a deferral for one or more of the measures included in the PIP. The respective requirements\nfor all marketing authorization procedures are set forth in Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, which is referred to as the Pediatric\nRegulation. This requirement also applies when a company wants to add a new indication, pharmaceutical form or route of\nadministration for a medicine that is already authorized. The Pediatric Committee of the EMA (the “PDCO”) may grant deferrals for\nsome medicines, allowing a company to delay development of the medicine in children until there is enough information to\ndemonstrate its effectiveness and safety in adults. The PDCO may also grant waivers when development of a medicine in children is\nnot needed or is not appropriate because (a) the product is likely to be ineffective or unsafe in part or all of the pediatric population;\n(b) the disease or condition occurs only in the adult population; or (c) the product does not represent a significant therapeutic benefit\nover existing treatments for the pediatric population. Before a MAA can be filed, or an existing marketing authorization can be\namended, the EMA determines that companies actually comply with the agreed studies and measures listed in each relevant PIP.\nPRIME Designation\nIn March 2016, the EMA launched an initiative to facilitate development of product candidates in indications, often rare, for\nwhich few or no therapies currently exist. The PRIority MEdicines (“PRIME”) scheme is intended to encourage drug development in\nareas of unmet medical need and provides accelerated assessment of products representing substantial innovation reviewed under the\n42\ncentralized procedure. Products from small- and medium-sized enterprises may qualify for earlier entry into the PRIME scheme than\nlarger companies. Many benefits accrue to sponsors of product candidates with PRIME designation, including but not limited to, early\nand proactive regulatory dialogue with the EMA, frequent discussions on clinical trial designs and other development program\nelements, and accelerated MAA assessment once a dossier has been submitted. Importantly, a dedicated Agency contact and\nrapporteur from the CHMP or Committee for Advanced Therapies are appointed early in PRIME scheme, facilitating increased\nunderstanding of the product at EMA’s Committee level. A kick-off meeting initiates these relationships and includes a team of\nmultidisciplinary experts at the EMA to provide guidance on the overall development and regulatory strategies.\nPeriods of Authorization and Renewals\nMarketing authorization is valid for five years in principle and the marketing authorization may be renewed after five years on\nthe basis of a re-evaluation of the risk-benefit balance by the EMA or by the competent authority of the authorizing member state. To\nthis end, the marketing authorization holder must provide the EMA or the competent authority with a consolidated version of the file\nwith respect to quality, safety and effectiveness, including all variations introduced since the marketing authorization was granted, at\nleast six months before the marketing authorization ceases to be valid. Once renewed, the marketing authorization is valid for an\nunlimited period, unless the EC or the competent authority decides, on justified grounds relating to pharmacovigilance, to proceed\nwith one additional five-year renewal. Any authorization which is not followed by the actual placing of the drug on the EU market (in\ncase of centralized procedure) or on the market of the authorizing member state within three years after authorization ceases to be\nvalid (the so-called sunset clause).\nRegulatory Requirements after Marketing Authorization\nAs in the U.S., both marketing authorization holders and manufacturers of medicinal products are subject to comprehensive\nregulatory oversight by the EMA and the competent authorities of the individual EU Member States both before and after grant of the\nmanufacturing and marketing authorizations. The holder of an EU marketing authorization for a medicinal product must, for example,\ncomply with EU pharmacovigilance legislation and its related regulations and guidelines which entail many requirements for\nconducting pharmacovigilance or the assessment and monitoring of the safety of medicinal products. The manufacturing process for\nmedicinal products in the EU is also highly regulated and regulators may shut down manufacturing facilities that they believe do not\ncomply with regulations. Manufacturing requires a manufacturing authorization, and the manufacturing authorization holder must\ncomply with various requirements set out in the applicable EU laws, including compliance with EU cGMP standards when\nmanufacturing medicinal products and active pharmaceutical ingredients.\nIn the EU, the advertising and promotion of approved products are subject to EU Member States’ laws governing the promotion\nof medicinal products, interactions with clinicians, misleading and comparative advertising and unfair commercial practices. In\naddition, other legislation adopted by individual EU Member States may apply to the advertising and promotion of medicinal\nproducts. These laws require that promotional materials and advertising in relation to medicinal products comply with the product’s\nSummary of Product Characteristics (“SmPC”) as approved by the competent authorities. Promotion of a medicinal product that does\nnot comply with the SmPC is considered to constitute off-label promotion, which is prohibited in the EU.\nData and Market Exclusivity\nIn the EU, NCEs qualify for eight years of data exclusivity upon marketing authorization and an additional two years of market\nexclusivity. This data exclusivity, if granted, prevents regulatory authorities in the EU from referencing the innovator’s data to assess a\ngeneric (abbreviated) application for eight years, after which generic marketing authorizations can be submitted, and the innovator’s\ndata may be referenced, but not approved for two years. The overall ten-year period will be extended to a maximum of eleven years if,\nduring the first eight years of those ten years, the marketing authorization holder obtains an authorization for one or more new\ntherapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to their authorization, are held to bring a significant clinical benefit\nin comparison with existing therapies. Even if a compound is considered to be a new chemical entity and the sponsor is able to gain\nthe prescribed period of data exclusivity, another company nevertheless could also market another version of the product if such\ncompany can complete a full MAA with a complete database of pharmaceutical test, preclinical tests and clinical trials and obtain\nmarketing approval of its product.\nOrphan Drug Designation and Exclusivity\nThe criteria for designating an orphan medicinal product in the EU are similar in principle to those in the U.S. Under Article 3\nof Regulation (EC) 141/2000, a medicinal product may be designated as orphan if (1) it is intended for the diagnosis, prevention or\ntreatment of a life- threatening or chronically debilitating condition, (2) either (a) such condition affects no more than five in 10,000\npersons in the EU when the application is made, or (b) the product, without the benefits derived from orphan status, would not\ngenerate sufficient return in the EU to justify investment and (3) there exists no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or\ntreatment of such condition authorized for marketing in the EU, or if such a method exists, the product will be of significant benefit to\n43\nthose affected by the condition. The term ‘significant benefit’ is defined in Regulation (EC) 847/2000 to mean a clinically relevant\nadvantage or a major contribution to patient care.\nOrphan medicinal products are eligible for financial incentives such as reduction of fees or fee waivers and are, upon grant of a\nmarketing authorization, entitled to ten years of market exclusivity for the approved therapeutic indication. During this ten-year\nmarket exclusivity period, the EMA or the competent authorities of the Member States of the EEA, cannot accept an application for a\nmarketing authorization for a similar medicinal product for the same indication. A similar medicinal product is defined as a medicinal\nproduct containing a similar active substance or substances as contained in an authorized orphan medicinal product, and which is\nintended for the same therapeutic indication. The application for orphan designation must be submitted before the application for\nmarketing authorization. The sponsor will receive a fee reduction for the MAA if the orphan designation has been granted, but not if\nthe designation is still pending at the time the marketing authorization is submitted. Orphan designation does not convey any\nadvantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process.\nThe ten-year market exclusivity in the EU may be reduced to six years if, at the end of the fifth year, it is established that the\nproduct no longer meets the criteria for orphan designation, for example, if the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify\nmaintenance of market exclusivity. Additionally, marketing authorization may be granted to a similar product for the same indication\nat any time if: (1) the second sponsor can establish that its product, although similar, is safer, more effective or otherwise clinically\nsuperior; (2) the sponsor consents to a second orphan medicinal product application; or (3) the sponsor cannot supply enough orphan\nmedicinal product.\nPediatric Exclusivity\nIf a sponsor obtains a marketing authorization in all EU Member States, or a marketing authorization granted in the centralized\nprocedure by the EC, and the study results for the pediatric population are included in the product information, even when negative,\nthe medicine is then eligible for an additional six-month period of qualifying patent protection through extension of the term of the\nSPC, or alternatively a one year extension of the regulatory market exclusivity from ten to eleven years, as selected by the marketing\nauthorization holder.\nPatent Term Extensions\nThe EU also provides for patent term extension through SPCs. The rules and requirements for obtaining a SPC are similar to\nthose in the U.S. An SPC may extend the term of a patent for up to five years after its originally scheduled expiration date and can\nprovide up to a maximum of fifteen years of marketing exclusivity for a drug. In certain circumstances, these periods may be extended\nfor six additional months if pediatric exclusivity is obtained. Although SPCs are available throughout the EU, sponsors must apply on\na country-by-country basis. Similar patent term extension rights exist in certain other foreign jurisdictions outside the EU.\nReimbursement and Pricing Decisions for Approved Products\nIn the EU, pricing and reimbursement schemes vary widely from country to country. Some countries provide that products may\nbe marketed only after a reimbursement price has been agreed. Some countries may require the completion of additional studies that\ncompare the cost-effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies or so-called health technology\nassessments, in order to obtain reimbursement or pricing approval. For example, EU Member States have the option to restrict the\nrange of products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal\nproducts for human use. EU Member States may approve a specific price for a product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or\nindirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the product on the market. Other EU Member States allow companies to\nfix their own prices for products, but monitor and control prescription volumes and issue guidance to physicians to limit prescriptions.\nRecently, many countries in the EU have increased the amount of discounts required on pharmaceuticals and these efforts could\ncontinue as countries attempt to manage health care expenditures, especially in light of the severe fiscal and debt crises experienced by\nmany countries in the EU. The downward pressure on health care costs in general, particularly prescription products, has become\nintense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. Political, economic and regulatory\ndevelopments may further complicate pricing negotiations, and pricing negotiations may continue after reimbursement has been\nobtained. Reference pricing used by various EU Member States, and parallel trade, i.e., arbitrage between low-priced and high-priced\nEU Member States, can further reduce prices. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement\nlimitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any products, if approved in\nthose countries.\nEU General Data Protection Regulation\nThe collection, use, disclosure, transfer, or other processing of personal data regarding individuals in the EEA, including\npersonal health data, is subject to the GDPR, which became effective on May 25, 2018. In the United Kingdom (the “UK”), the GDPR\n44\nis retained in domestic law as the UK GDPR and sits alongside an amended version of the UK Data Protection Act 2018. The GDPR\nis wide-ranging in scope and imposes numerous requirements on companies that process personal data, including requirements\nrelating to processing health and other sensitive data, obtaining consent of the individuals to whom the personal data relates, providing\ninformation to individuals regarding data processing activities, implementing safeguards to protect the security and confidentiality of\npersonal data, providing notification of data breaches, and taking certain measures when engaging third-party processors. The GDPR\nalso imposes strict rules on the transfer of personal data to countries outside the EU, including the U.S., and permits data protection\nauthorities to impose large penalties for violations of the GDPR, including potential fines of up to €20 million or 4% of annual global\nrevenues of the respective group of companies, whichever is greater. The GDPR also confers a private right of action on data subjects\nand consumer associations to lodge complaints with supervisory authorities, seek judicial remedies, and obtain compensation for\ndamages resulting from violations of the GDPR. Compliance with the GDPR is a rigorous and time-intensive process that may\nincrease the cost of doing business or require companies to change their business practices to ensure full compliance.\nBrexit and the Regulatory Framework in the United Kingdom\nThe UK’s withdrawal from the EU, commonly referred to as Brexit, took place on January 31, 2020. The EU and the UK\nreached an agreement on their new partnership in the Trade and Cooperation Agreement, which entered into force on May 1, 2021.\nThe agreement focuses primarily on free trade by ensuring no tariffs or quotas on trade in goods, including healthcare products such as\nmedicinal products. Thereafter, the EU and the UK will form two separate markets governed by two distinct regulatory and legal\nregimes. As such, the agreement seeks to minimize barriers to trade in goods while accepting that border checks will become\ninevitable as a consequence that the UK is no longer part of the single market. As of January 1, 2021, the Medicines and Healthcare\nProducts Regulatory Agency (the “MHRA”) became responsible for supervising medicines and medical devices in Great Britain,\ncomprising England, Scotland and Wales under domestic law, whereas Northern Ireland continues to be subject to EU rules under the\nNorthern Ireland Protocol, as amended by the so called Windsor Framework agreed in February 2023. The MHRA relies on the\nHuman Medicines Regulations 2012 (SI 2012/1916) (as amended) (the “HMR”) as the basis for regulating medicines. The HMR has\nincorporated into the domestic law the body of EU law instruments governing medicinal products that pre-existed prior to the UK’s\nwithdrawal from the EU.\nSince a significant proportion of the regulatory framework for pharmaceutical products in the UK covering the quality, safety,\nand efficacy of pharmaceutical products, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales, and distribution of pharmaceutical\nproducts is derived from EU directives and regulations, Brexit may have a material impact upon the regulatory regime with respect to\nthe development, manufacture, importation, approval and commercialization of our product candidates in the UK. For example, the\nUK is no longer covered by the centralized procedures for obtaining EU-wide marketing authorization from the EMA, and a separate\nmarketing authorization is required to market our product candidates in the UK. From January 1, 2024 on, a new international\nrecognition procedure (“IRP”) applies which intends to facilitate approval of pharmaceutical products in the UK. The IRP is open to\napplicants that have already received an authorization for the same product from one of the MHRA’s specified Reference Regulators\n(“RRs”). The RRs notably include EMA and regulators in the EEA member states for approvals in the EU centralized procedure and\nmutual recognition procedure as well as the FDA (for product approvals granted in the U.S.).The RR assessment must have undergone\na full and standalone review. RR assessments based on reliance or recognition cannot be used to support an IRP application. A CHMP\npositive opinion or an MRDC positive end of procedure outcome is an RR authorisation for the purposes of IRP.\nHuman Capital\nWe believe that the success of our business is fundamentally due to our greatest asset, our employees. To that end, we have\ninvested significant resources toward the attraction, retention and development of our people and the promotion of diversity in our\nworkforce. To support these goals, our human resources programs and initiatives underscore our core values (Innovation, Courage,\nAlignment and Accountability, Resiliency and Energy) and are designed to prioritize employees’ well-being, support their career\ndevelopment, offer competitive wages and benefits, and enhance our culture through efforts geared toward making the workplace\nmore enriching, engaging, and inclusive.\nTo attract, retain and reward our employees, we provide competitive total rewards aimed at supporting the financial, physical\nand emotional health of our employees and their families. We currently offer all new employees equity in our company and as\nincentive to all our employees in connection with our annual performance reviews. Our equity and cash incentive plans are designed\nto increase stockholder value and the success of our company by motivating our employees to perform to the best of their abilities and\nachieve our collective objectives. In addition, many of our employees are stockholders of our company through participation in our\nEmployee Stock Purchase Plan, which aligns the interests of our employees with our stockholders by providing stock ownership on a\ntax-deferred basis. We also provide up to a 4% match of components of employee compensation to our Section 401(k) retirement\nsavings plan.\n45\nWe strive to provide our employees with a safe and healthy work environment and believe that the overall health, safety and\nwellness of our employees is critical to our long-term success and our growth as a business. As such, we provide our employees and\ntheir families with access to a variety of innovative, flexible and convenient health and wellness programs, including benefits that\nprovide protection and security so they can have peace of mind concerning events that may require time away from work or that\nimpact their financial well-being. Our full-time employees are all eligible to participate in our health, vision, dental, life, and long-\nterm disability insurance plans. To encourage employees to keep up with routine medical care and participate in our wellness program,\nwe fund a Health Reimbursement Account for participating employees that partially covers employee deductibles and to help our\nemployees cover medical expenses pre-tax, we also offer employees a Flexible Spending Account in addition to providing a monthly\nwellness fund designed to support broad well-being activities. In addition, our employees outside of the U.S. receive competitive\ncompensation and benefits that are regularly benchmarked to ensure market norms and reflect our standards. All employees globally\nhave access to complimentary virtual fitness programs, mental and emotional health support services, as well as support programs to\nassist working parents with childcare and tutoring. This benefit also extends to eldercare, pet care, and other needs facing our diverse\nglobal team.\nWe encourage and support the growth and development of our employees and, wherever possible, seek to fill positions\ninternally, through lateral and promotional advancements and by leveraging our employee referral process. Continual learning and\ncareer development is encouraged through ongoing performance and development conversations with employees, a formal mentorship\nprogram, tuition assistance, employee and leadership training programs targeting both technical and soft skills, and customized\ncorporate training engagements and seminars where employees are encouraged to attend in connection with current and future roles.\nEmployees at all levels have an opportunity to develop and hone their skillsets, which provides a critically important growth path and\ncontinuity for our top performers.\nFurther, we strongly believe in fostering a culture of inclusiveness and employee well-being, which is key to our culture and\noverall success. We strive to bring together employees with a wide variety of backgrounds, skills and culture and encourage all our\nemployees to maintain a work environment in which our differences are respected. We have put into place relationships with many\nlocal affinity groups including the biotech industry’s largest LGBTQ professional group and Latinos in biotech to extend our reach,\nbuild relationships and foster greater cohesion among our employees.\nWe have created a women’s Employee Resource Group (“ERG”) where women and allies can connect, share experiences, and\ninspire one another. The ERG is a safe space for open dialogue, mentorship, and collaboration that all employees can benefit from. We\nhave also established key working relationships with local universities where we hire many of our interns in our annual program.\nAs of February 23, 2024, we had 325 employees. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or covered by a\ncollective bargaining agreement, nor have we experienced work stoppages. We believe that relations with our employees are good.\nCorporate Responsibility\nWe are highly committed to policies and practices focused on environmental, social, and governance (“ESG”), positively\nimpacting our social community and maintaining and cultivating good corporate governance. By focusing on ESG policies and\npractices, we believe we can affect a meaningful and positive change in our community and continue to cultivate our open and\ninclusive collaborative culture.\nSome of our 2023 initiatives included continuing support for the scientific, medical, patient, and local communities in which we\noperate, including patient education, public health, quality of healthcare, and disease awareness, sponsoring local youth programs that\nfocus on providing educational resources and career development opportunities for members of underserved communities and schools\nwith diverse populations, and supporting patient community needs in response to natural disasters through both charitable giving to\nthe community at large and specifically for those patients impacted.\nWe also enable our employees to participate in various charity events, including walks, races, and other events that impact\nchange in the communities of the patients we serve. We have recently implemented an employee volunteer time off program to\nsupport volunteer activities that enhance the communities in which we live and work while providing our employees the paid time to\nhelp those around them. This allows our employees to support causes that are meaningful to them and their families and aligns with\nour mission, goals, and vision.\nOur ESG Report, which describes our approach to ESG programs, is available on our website at\nhttps://investors.karyopharm.com/corporate-sustainability. Information in our ESG Report is not incorporated by reference into this\nForm 10-K. We look forward to continuing our commitment to giving back to our local communities in 2024 and beyond.\n46\nInformation about our Executive Officers\nThe following table lists the names, ages and positions of our executive officers as of February 23, 2024:\nName Age Position\nRichard Paulson, M.B.A 56 President and Chief Executive Officer\nSohanya Cheng, M.B.A. 41 Executive Vice President, Chief Commercial Officer\nMichael Mano, J.D. 47 Senior Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary\nMichael Mason, C.P.A., M.B.A. 49 Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and\nTreasurer\nStuart Poulton 51 Executive Vice President, Chief Development Officer\nReshma Rangwala, M.D., Ph.D 46 Executive Vice President, Chief Medical Officer\nRichard Paulson, M.B.A. Mr. Paulson has served as our President and Chief Executive Officer since May 2021 and as a member\nof our Board since February 2020.

Risk Factors.\nCareful consideration should be given to the following material risk factors, in addition to the other information set forth in this\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K and in other documents that we file with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) in\nevaluating us and our business. Investing in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. If any of the following risks and\nuncertainties actually occurs, our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely\naffected. The risks described below are not intended to be exhaustive and are not the only risks we face. New risk factors can emerge\nfrom time to time, and it is not possible to predict the impact that any factor or combination of factors may have on our business,\nprospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nReferences to XPOVIO® (selinexor) also refer to NEXPOVIO® (selinexor) when discussing its approval and commercialization\nin certain countries or territories outside of the U.S.\nRisks Related to Commercialization and Product Development\nOur business is substantially dependent on the commercial success of XPOVIO. If we, either alone or with our collaborators, are\nunable to successfully commercialize current and future indications of XPOVIO or other products or product candidates on a\ntimely basis, including achieving widespread market acceptance by physicians, patients, third-party payors and others in the\nmedical community, our business, financial condition and future profitability will be materially harmed.\nOur business and our ability to generate product revenue from the sales of drugs that treat cancer depend heavily on our and our\ncollaborators’ ability to successfully commercialize our lead drug, XPOVIO® (selinexor), on a global basis in currently approved and\nfuture indications, and the level of market adoption for, and the continued use of, our products and product candidates, if approved.\nXPOVIO is currently approved and marketed in the U.S. in multiple hematologic malignancy indications, including in combination\nwith Velcade® (bortezomib) and dexamethasone for the treatment of patients with multiple myeloma after at least one prior therapy, in\ncombination with dexamethasone for the treatment of patients with heavily pretreated multiple myeloma and as a monotherapy for the\ntreatment of patients with relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (“DLBCL”). Efforts to drive adoption within the\nmedical community and third-party payors based on the benefits of our products and product candidates require significant resources\nand may not be successful. The success of XPOVIO and any current or future product candidates, whether alone or in collaboration\nwith third parties, including achieving and maintaining an adequate level of market adoption, depends on several factors, including:\n• our ability to achieve broad adoption of XPOVIO in earlier lines of therapy or to successfully launch and achieve broad\nadoption of any future XPOVIO indications or any product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval;\n• the competitive landscape for our products, including the timing of new competing products entering the market and the\nlevel and speed at which these products achieve market acceptance;\n• actual or perceived advantages or disadvantages of our products or product candidates as compared to alternative\ntreatments, including their respective safety, tolerability and efficacy profiles, the potential convenience and ease of\nadministration, access or cost effectiveness;\n• the effectiveness of our sales, marketing, manufacturing and distribution strategies and operations;\n• the consistency of any new data we collect and analyses we conduct with prior results, whether they support a favorable\nsafety, efficacy and effectiveness profile of XPOVIO and any potential impact on our U.S. Food and Drug Administration\n(“FDA”) approvals and/or FDA package insert for XPOVIO and comparable foreign regulatory approvals and package\ninserts;\n• our ability to comply with the FDA’s and comparable foreign regulatory authorities’ post-marketing requirements and\ncommitments, including through successfully conducting, on a timely basis, additional studies that confirm clinical\nefficacy, effectiveness and safety of XPOVIO and acceptance of the same by the FDA or similar foreign regulatory\nbodies;\n• acceptance of current indications of XPOVIO and future indications of XPOVIO and other product candidates, if\napproved, by patients, the medical community and third-party payors;\n• obtaining and maintaining coverage, adequate pricing and reimbursement by third-party payors, including government\npayors, for XPOVIO and our product candidates, if approved;\n• the willingness of patients to pay out-of-pocket in the absence of third-party coverage or as co-pay amounts under third-\nparty coverage, for example; multiple myeloma foundation closures during 2023 resulted in significantly increased use of\nour Patient Assistance Program (“PAP”), which adversely impacted our 2023 revenues;\n49\n• our ability to enforce intellectual property rights in and to our products to prohibit a third-party from marketing a\ncompeting product and our ability to avoid third-party patent interference or intellectual property infringement claims;\n• current and future restrictions or limitations on our approved or future indications and patient populations or other adverse\nregulatory actions;\n• the performance of our manufacturers, license partners, distributors, providers and other business partners, over which we\nhave limited control;\n• any significant misestimations of the size of the market and market potential for any of our products or product\ncandidates;\n• establishing and maintaining commercial manufacturing capabilities or making arrangements with third-party\nmanufacturers;\n• the willingness of the target patient population to try new therapies and of physicians to prescribe these therapies, based,\nin part, on their perception of our clinical trial data and/or the actual or perceived safety, tolerability and effectiveness\nprofile;\n• maintaining an acceptable safety and tolerability profile of our approved products, including the prevalence and severity\nof any side effects;\n• the ability to offer our products for sale at competitive prices;\n• adverse publicity about our products or favorable publicity about competitive products;\n• our ability to maintain compliance with existing and new health care laws and regulations, including government pricing,\nprice reporting and other disclosure requirements related to such laws and regulations, and the potential impact of such\nlaws and regulations on physician prescribing practices and payor coverage; and\n• the ability of our sales force to meet with healthcare professionals in person.\nIf we do not achieve one or more of these factors in a timely manner, or at all, either on our own or with our collaborators, we\ncould experience significant delays or an inability to successfully commercialize XPOVIO or our product candidates, if approved,\nwhich would materially harm our business.\nWe face substantial competition, which may result in others discovering, developing or commercializing drugs before or more\nsuccessfully than we do.\nThe discovery, development and commercialization of new drugs is highly competitive, particularly in the cancer field. We and\nour collaborators face competition with respect to XPOVIO and will face competition with respect to any product candidates that we\nmay seek to discover and develop or commercialize in the future, from major pharmaceutical companies, specialty pharmaceutical\ncompanies, biotechnology companies, academic institutions and governmental agencies as well as public and private research\ninstitutions worldwide, many of which have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development,\nmanufacturing, preclinical studies, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved products than we\ndo. There are a number of major pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that currently market and sell\ndrugs and/or are pursuing the development of drugs for the treatment of cancer and the other disease indications for which we, and our\ncollaborators, are developing our product candidates. Several new novel therapeutics have recently entered, and are expected to\ncontinue to enter, the multiple myeloma treatment landscape. For example, TECVAYLI™ (teclistamab-cqyv), the first bispecific T-\nCell engager, was approved by the FDA in October 2022, followed by approvals of two more bispecifics, ELREXFIO™\n(elranatamab-bcmm) and TALVEY™ (talquetamab-tgvs) in August 2023. Other T-cell engaging therapies, bispecifics with different\ntargets, and immunomodulators are in clinical development and may be introduced into the multiple myeloma market in 2024 and\nbeyond. In addition, future label expansions into earlier lines of existing therapies, including CAR-T therapies, are anticipated in 2024\nand beyond. The approval of these anti-cancer agents, or any others which may receive regulatory approval, have had a significant\nimpact and may continue to have a significant impact on the therapeutic landscape and our product revenues. See Item 1 under the\nheading Business - Competition in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information on competition.\nWe are currently focused on developing and commercializing our products and product candidates for the treatment of cancer\nand there are a variety of available therapies marketed for cancer. In many cases, cancer drugs are administered in combination to\nenhance efficacy. Some of these drugs are branded and subject to patent protection, and others are available on a generic basis. Many\nof these approved drugs are well-established therapies and are widely accepted by physicians, patients and third-party payors. Insurers\nand other third-party payors may also encourage the use of generic drugs. Our products are priced at a significant premium over\n50\ncompetitive generic drugs, which may make it difficult for us to achieve our business strategy of using our products in combination\nwith existing therapies or replacing existing therapies with our products.\nFurther, our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize drugs that\nare or are perceived to be more effective, safer, more tolerable, more convenient and/or less costly than any of our currently approved\nproducts or product candidates or that would render our products obsolete or non-competitive. Our competitors may also obtain\nmarketing approval from the FDA or other regulatory authorities for their products more rapidly than we, or our collaborators, may\nobtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a stronger market position before we, or our collaborators,\nare able to enter the market or preventing us, or our collaborators, from entering into a particular indication at all.\nMergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries may result in even more resources being\nconcentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Smaller and other early-stage companies may also prove to be significant\ncompetitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These third parties compete with\nus in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel, establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for\nclinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or that may be necessary for, our programs.\nIf we are not able to compete effectively against current or potential competitors, our business will not grow and our financial\ncondition and operations will suffer.\nClinical development is a lengthy and expensive process, with uncertain timelines and outcomes. We or our collaborators may be\nunable to successfully enroll patients in our ongoing and planned clinical trials in a reasonable timeframe, or at all. In addition, if\nclinical trials of our product candidates fail to demonstrate safety and effectiveness to the satisfaction of regulatory authorities or\ndo not otherwise produce positive results, we, or our collaborators, may incur additional costs, fail to secure regulatory approvals,\nor be unable to commercialize such product candidates.\nOur long-term success depends in a large part on our ability to continue to successfully develop new indications of selinexor,\nour product candidates, or any new product candidates we may develop or acquire. Clinical testing is expensive, time consuming,\ndifficult to design, implement and enroll, inherently uncertain as to outcome and can fail at any stage of testing. Furthermore, the\nfailure of any product candidates to demonstrate safety and effectiveness in any clinical trial could negatively impact the perception of\nselinexor or our other product candidates and/or cause the FDA or other regulatory authorities to require additional testing before any\nof our product candidates are approved.\nWe may experience numerous unforeseen events during, or as a result of, clinical trials that could delay or prevent our or our\ncollaborators’ ability to complete such clinical trials or receive marketing approval of our product candidates, including, but not\nlimited to, the following:\n• delays or failure to reach agreement with regulatory authorities on a trial design or the receipt of feedback requiring us to\nmodify the design of our clinical trials, perform additional or unanticipated clinical trials to obtain approval or alter our\nregulatory strategy, as is the case in connection with the feedback we received from the FDA in February 2022 on our\nSIENDO Study;\n• clinical trials of our product candidates may produce negative or inconclusive results or other patient safety concerns,\nincluding undesirable side effects or other unexpected characteristics, and we may decide, or regulatory authorities may\nrequire us, to conduct additional clinical trials, suspend ongoing clinical trials or abandon drug development programs,\nincluding as a result of a finding that the participants are being exposed to unacceptable health risks;\n• enrollment in our clinical trials may be slower than we anticipate, including as a result of competition with other ongoing\nclinical trials, delays in site activation, newly approved competitive products for the same indications as our product\ncandidates or new or amended regulations; for example, in 2023, site activation for our Phase 3 clinical trial in\nendometrial cancer was delayed in the EU due to the recent adoption of the In Vitro Diagnostic Devices Regulation\n(“IVDR”), as discussed further below;\n• regulators may revise the requirements for approving our product candidates, even after providing a positive opinion on or\notherwise reviewing and providing comments to a clinical trial protocol, and/or such requirements may not be as we\nanticipate;\n• delays or failure in obtaining the necessary authorization from regulatory authorities or institutional review boards to\npermit us, our collaborators or our investigators to commence a clinical trial, conduct a clinical trial at a prospective trial\nsite, or the suspension or termination of a clinical trial once commenced;\n51\n• delays or failure to reach agreement on acceptable terms with prospective clinical trial sites or contract research\norganizations (“CROs”);\n• the number of patients required for clinical trials of our product candidates may be larger than we anticipate or\nparticipants may drop out of these clinical trials at a higher rate than we anticipate;\n• our third-party contractors, including manufacturers or CROs, may fail to comply with regulatory requirements, perform\neffectively, or meet their contractual obligations to us in a timely manner, or at all;\n• we or our investigators might be found to be non-compliant with regulatory requirements;\n• the cost of clinical trials of our product candidates may be greater than we anticipate;\n• the supply or quality of our product candidates or other materials necessary to conduct clinical trials may be insufficient or\ninadequate;\n• for any biomarker driven clinical trial, the potential regulatory requirement to utilize a companion diagnostic, for example\nthe required use of a companion diagnostic for our ongoing study evaluating selinexor in patients with TP53 wild-type\nadvanced or recurrent endometrial cancer;\n• any partners or collaborators that help us conduct clinical trials may face any of the above issues, and may conduct\nclinical trials in ways they view as advantageous to them but that are suboptimal for us; and\n• negative impacts resulting from a pandemic or other public health emergency, including impacts to healthcare systems\nand our trial sites’ ability to conduct trial.\nIf we, or our collaborators, are required to conduct additional clinical trials or other testing of our product candidates or a\ncompanion diagnostic beyond those that we currently contemplate or are unable to successfully complete clinical trials of our product\ncandidates or other testing, on a timely basis or at all, and/or if the results of these trials or tests are not positive or are only modestly\npositive or if there are safety concerns, we, or our collaborators, may:\n• be delayed in obtaining, or not obtain at all, marketing approval for the indication or product candidate;\n• obtain marketing approval in some countries and not in others;\n• obtain approval for indications or patient populations that are not as broad as intended or desired;\n• obtain approval with labeling that includes significant use or distribution restrictions or safety warnings, including boxed\nwarnings;\n• be subject to additional post-marketing testing requirements;\n• not receive royalty or milestone revenue under our collaboration agreements for several years, or at all; or\n• have the product removed from the market after obtaining marketing approval.\nFurther, we do not know whether clinical trials will begin as planned, will need to be restructured or will be completed on\nschedule, or at all. Significant clinical trial delays also could shorten any periods during which we may have the exclusive right to\ncommercialize our products, allow our competitors to bring products to market before we do or impair our ability to successfully\ncommercialize our products, which would harm our business and results of operations. In addition, many of the factors that cause, or\nlead to, clinical trial delays may ultimately lead to the denial of regulatory approval of our product candidates.\nSerious adverse or unacceptable side effects related to XPOVIO, our product candidates or future products may delay or prevent\ntheir regulatory approval, cause us or our collaborators to suspend or discontinue clinical trials, limit the commercial value of\napproved indications or result in significant negative financial consequences following any marketing approval.\nWe are currently developing selinexor for the treatment of multiple types of cancer. Its risk of failure is high. If our current or\nfuture indications of XPOVIO, any of our product candidates or future products are associated with undesirable side effects or have\ncharacteristics that are unexpected in clinical trials or following approval and/or commercialization, we may need to abandon or limit\ntheir development or limit marketing to certain uses or subpopulations in which the undesirable side effects or other characteristics are\nless prevalent, less severe or more acceptable from a risk-benefit perspective.\nAdverse events (“AEs”) in our clinical trials for selinexor to date have been generally predictable and typically manageable,\nincluding through prophylactic care or dose reductions, although some patients have experienced more serious AEs. The most\n52\ncommon drug-related AEs in our clinical trials for selinexor include fatigue, nausea, anorexia, diarrhea, peripheral neuropathy, upper\nrespiratory tract infection, vomiting, cytopenias, hyponatremia, weight loss, decreased appetite, cataract, dizziness, syncope, depressed\nlevel of consciousness, and mental status changes. These side effects were generally mild or moderate in severity. The most common\nAEs that are Grade 3 or Grade 4, meaning they are more than mild or moderate in severity, include thrombocytopenia, lymphopenia,\nhypophosphatemia, anemia, hyponatremia and neutropenia. To date, the most common AEs in the multiple myeloma patient\npopulation have been managed with supportive care and dose modifications. However, a number of patients have withdrawn from our\nclinical trials as a result of AEs and some patients across our clinical trials have experienced serious AEs deemed by us and the\nclinical investigator to be related to selinexor. Serious AEs generally refer to AEs that result in death, are life threatening, require\nhospitalization or prolonging of hospitalization, or cause a significant and permanent disruption of normal life functions, congenital\nanomalies or birth defects, or require intervention to prevent such an outcome.\nThe occurrence of AEs in either our clinical trials or following regulatory approval could result in a more restrictive label for\nany product candidates approved for marketing or could result in the delay or denial of approval to market any product candidates by\nthe FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities, which could prevent us from generating sufficient revenue from product sales\nor ultimately achieving profitability. Treatment-related side effects could also affect patient recruitment or the ability of enrolled\npatients to complete the trial, result in potential product liability claims or cause patients and/or healthcare providers to elect\nalternative courses of treatment. In addition, these side effects may not be appropriately recognized or managed by the treating\nmedical staff. Inadequate training or education of healthcare professionals to recognize or manage the potential side effects of\nXPOVIO or our product candidates, if approved, could result in increased treatment-related side effects and cause patients to\ndiscontinue treatment. Any of these occurrences may harm our business, financial condition and prospects significantly.\nResults of our trials could reveal an unacceptably high severity and prevalence of side effects. In such an event, our trials could\nbe suspended or terminated by us or the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities could order us or our collaborators to cease\nfurther development of or deny approval of our product candidates for any or all targeted indications. Many compounds that initially\nshowed promise in early-stage trials for treating cancer or other diseases have later been found to cause side effects that prevented\nfurther development of the compound. If such an event occurs after any of our or our collaborators’ product candidates are approved\nand/or commercialized, a number of potentially significant negative consequences may result, including:\n• regulatory authorities may withdraw the approval of such drug, require additional warnings on the label or impose\ndistribution or use restrictions and/or require one or more post-marketing studies;\n• patients and/or healthcare providers may elect to utilize other treatment options that have or are perceived to have more\ntolerable side effects;\n• we may be required to create a medication guide outlining the risks of such side effects for distribution to patients;\n• we could be sued and held liable for harm caused to patients; and\n• our reputation may suffer.\nFurther, we, our collaborators and our clinical trial investigators, currently determine if serious adverse or unacceptable side\neffects are drug-related. The FDA or foreign regulatory authorities may disagree with our, our collaborators’ or our clinical trial\ninvestigators’ interpretation of data from clinical trials and the conclusion by us, our collaborators or our clinical trial investigators that\na serious adverse effect or unacceptable side effect was not drug-related. The FDA or foreign regulatory authorities may require more\ninformation related to the safety of our products or product candidates, including additional preclinical or clinical data to support\napproval, which may cause us to incur additional expenses, delay or prevent the approval of one of our product candidates, and/or\ndelay or cause us to change our commercialization plans, or we may decide to abandon the development of the product candidate\naltogether.\nIn addition, if we are slow or unable to adapt to changes in existing requirements or the adoption of new requirements or\npolicies governing clinical trials, our development plans may be impacted. For example, in December 2022, with the passage of Food\nand Drug Omnibus Reform Act (“FDORA”), Congress required sponsors to develop and submit a diversity action plan for each Phase\n3 clinical trial or any other “pivotal study” of a new drug or biological product. These plans are meant to encourage the enrollment of\nmore diverse patient populations in late-stage clinical trials of FDA-regulated products. Similarly, the regulatory landscape related to\nclinical trials in the EU recently evolved. The EU Clinical Trials Regulation (“CTR”), which was adopted in April 2014 and repeals\nthe EU Clinical Trials Directive, became applicable on January 31, 2022. While the Clinical Trials Directive required a separate\nclinical trial application to be submitted in each member state, to both the competent national health authority and an independent\nethics committee, the CTR introduces a centralized process and only requires the submission of a single application to all member\nstates concerned. If we are not able to fulfill these new requirements, our ability to conduct clinical trials may be delayed or halted.\n53\nAny of these events could prevent us or our collaborators from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of the affected\nproduct candidate, if approved, or could substantially increase costs and expenses of development or commercialization, which could\ndelay or prevent us from generating sufficient revenue from the sale of our products and harm our business and results of operations.\nThe results of previous clinical trials may not be predictive of future trial results, and interim or top-line data may be subject to\nchange or qualification based on the complete analyses of data and, therefore, may not be predictive of the final results of a trial.\nClinical failure can occur at any stage of the clinical development process and, therefore, the outcome of preclinical studies and\nearly-stage clinical trials may not be predictive of the success of later stage clinical trials. Finalization and cleaning of data from our\nclinical trials may change the conclusions drawn from uncleaned data provided by our clinical trial investigators. Further, there can be\nsignificant variability in safety and/or efficacy results between different trials of the same product candidate due to numerous factors,\nincluding changes in trial protocols, differences in size and type of the patient populations, starting dose, adherence to the dosing\nregimen and other trial protocols and the dropout rate among clinical trial participants. We do not know whether any Phase 2, Phase 3\nor other clinical trials we may conduct will demonstrate consistent or adequate efficacy and safety data sufficient to obtain regulatory\napproval to market our product candidates, if approved. Moreover, preclinical and clinical data are often susceptible to varying\ninterpretations and analyses, and many companies have suffered significant setbacks in late-stage clinical trials after achieving\npositive results in earlier development, and we could face similar setbacks.\nWe may publicly disclose preliminary, interim or top-line data from our clinical trials. These interim updates are based on a\npreliminary analysis of then-available data, and the results and related findings and conclusions are subject to change as further patient\ndata become available and following a more comprehensive review of the data related to the particular study or trial. For example, on\nFebruary 8, 2022, we announced positive top-line data results for the SIENDO Study. On February 25, 2022, we discussed these data\nwith the FDA in a pre-sNDA meeting. We and the FDA meeting participants had differing views on the statistical significance of the\nstudy and the overall clinical benefit for the whole study population. For this study or any other study for which we report preliminary,\ninterim or top-line data, we make assumptions, estimations, calculations and conclusions as part of our analyses of data. We may not\nhave received or had the opportunity to fully and carefully evaluate all data or perform all analyses or our conclusions may differ from\nthose of the FDA or other regulatory authorities. Consequently, the interpretation of preliminary, interim or top-line data results that\nwe report may differ from future interpretations of the same studies once additional data have been received and fully evaluated or\nbased on differing views from regulatory agencies, such as in the SIENDO Study. Preliminary, interim or top-line data also remain\nsubject to audit and verification procedures that may result in the final data being materially different from the preliminary data we\npreviously published. As a result, these early data points should be viewed with caution until the final data are available. Adverse\ndifferences between previous preliminary or interim data and future interim or final data could significantly harm our business.\nIn addition, the information we choose to publicly disclose regarding a particular study or clinical trial is typically selected from\na more extensive amount of available information. Furthermore, we may report interim analyses of only certain endpoints rather than\nall endpoints. Investors may not agree with what we determine is the material or otherwise appropriate information to include in our\ndisclosure, and any information we determine not to disclose may ultimately be deemed significant with respect to future decisions,\nconclusions, views, activities or otherwise regarding a particular product, product candidate or our business.\nIf the interim or top-line data that we report differ from future or more comprehensive data, or if others, including regulatory\nauthorities, disagree with the conclusions reached, our ability to obtain approval for and commercialize our product candidates, our\nbusiness, operating results, prospects, or financial condition may be harmed.\nWe may not be successful in our efforts to identify or discover additional potential product candidates, or our decisions to prioritize\nthe development of certain product candidates over others may later prove wrong.\nPart of our strategy involves identifying and developing product candidates to build a pipeline of product candidates. Our drug\ndiscovery efforts may not be successful in identifying compounds that are useful in treating cancer or other diseases. Our research\nprograms may initially show promise in identifying potential product candidates, yet fail to yield product candidates for clinical\ndevelopment for a number of reasons, including:\n• the research methodology used may not be successful in identifying potential product candidates;\n• potential product candidates may, on further study, be shown to have harmful side effects or other characteristics that\nindicate that they are unlikely to be drugs that will receive marketing approval and/or achieve market acceptance; or\n• potential product candidates may not be effective in treating their targeted diseases.\n54\nWe are currently advancing multiple clinical development studies of selinexor, which may create a strain on our limited human\nand financial resources. As a result, we may not be able to provide sufficient resources to any single product candidate to permit the\nsuccessful development and commercialization of such product candidate, which could result in material harm to our business.\nFurther, because we have limited financial and managerial resources, we focus on research programs and product candidates that we\nidentify for specific indications. As a result, we may forego or delay pursuit of opportunities with other product candidates or for other\nindications that later prove to have greater commercial potential. For example, in January 2024, we announced that further clinical\ndevelopment of our eltanexor program is on hold in an effort to focus our resources on our prioritized late-stage programs. Our\nresource allocation decisions may cause us to fail to capitalize on viable commercial products or profitable market opportunities. Our\nspending on current and future research and development programs and product candidates for specific indications may not yield any\nadditional commercially-viable products. If we do not accurately evaluate the commercial potential or target market for a particular\nproduct candidate, we may relinquish valuable rights to that product candidate through collaboration, licensing or other royalty\narrangements in cases in which it would have been more advantageous for us to retain sole development and commercialization rights\nto such product candidate.\nIf we are unable to maintain or expand our sales, marketing and distribution capabilities, we may not be successful in\ncommercializing XPOVIO or any of our products or product candidates, if approved, that we may acquire or develop.\nWe have built a commercial infrastructure in the U.S. for XPOVIO, our first commercial product, in hematological\nmalignancies and our company did not previously have any prior experience in the sales, marketing or distribution of pharmaceutical\ndrugs. If XPOVIO or any of our product candidates is approved for additional indications beyond hematological malignancies, such as\nsolid tumors, we may need to evolve our sales, marketing and distribution capabilities and we may not be able to do so successfully or\non a timely basis. In the future, we may choose to expand our sales, marketing and distribution infrastructure to market or co-promote\none or more of our product candidates, if and when they are approved, or enter into additional collaborations with respect to the sale,\nmarketing and distribution of our product candidates. We are working with existing and potential partners to establish the commercial\ninfrastructure to support the sale of selinexor outside of the U.S. For example, we entered into a license agreement with the Menarini\nGroup (“Menarini”) in December 2021, and as amended in March 2023, to, among other things, develop and commercialize\nNEXPOVIO® (selinexor) for all human oncology indications in Europe (including the United Kingdom (“UK”)), Latin America,\ncertain Middle East and Africa regions and other key countries. For additional risks associated with commercializing our products\noutside of the U.S., please see the risk factor entitled “We depend on collaborations with third parties for certain aspects of the\ndevelopment, marketing and/or commercialization of XPOVIO and/or our product candidates. If those collaborations are not\nsuccessful, or if we are not able to maintain our existing collaborations or establish additional collaborations, we may have to alter\nour development and commercialization plans and may not be able to capitalize on the market potential of XPOVIO or our product\ncandidates” below.\nThere are risks involved with establishing and maintaining our own sales, marketing and distribution capabilities. For example,\nrecruiting and training a sales force is expensive and time-consuming and could delay any commercial launch of a product candidate\nor negatively impact ongoing commercialization efforts for our approved products. Further, we may underestimate the size of the sales\nforce required for a successful product launch and we may need to expand our sales force earlier and at a higher cost than we\nanticipated. If the commercial launch of any of our product candidates is delayed or does not occur for any reason, including if we do\nnot receive marketing approval in the timeframe we expect, we may have prematurely or unnecessarily incurred commercialization\nexpenses. This may be costly, and our investment would be lost if we cannot retain or reposition our sales and marketing personnel.\nFactors that may inhibit our efforts to successfully commercialize XPOVIO or any product candidates, if approved, on our own\ninclude:\n• existing or new competitors taking share from XPOVIO or any other future product or preventing XPOVIO or any other\nfuture product from gaining share in its approved indications;\n• our inability to recruit, train and retain adequate numbers of effective sales, market access, market analytics, operations\nand marketing personnel;\n• the inability of sales personnel to obtain access to physicians or persuade adequate numbers of physicians to prescribe\ncurrent or future products;\n• the lack of complementary drugs, which may put us at a competitive disadvantage relative to companies with more\nextensive drug lines;\n• unforeseen costs and expenses associated with creating an independent sales, marketing and distribution organization;\n• our inability to obtain sufficient coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors and governmental agencies; and\n55\n• our ability to supply sufficient inventory of our products for commercial sale.\nEven if we, or our collaborators, are able to effectively commercialize XPOVIO or any approved products that we may develop or\nacquire, the products may not receive coverage or may become subject to unfavorable pricing regulations, third-party\nreimbursement practices or healthcare reform initiatives, all of which would harm our business.\nThe legislation and regulations that govern marketing approvals, pricing and reimbursement for new drug products vary widely\nfrom country to country. As a result, we or our collaborators might obtain marketing approval for a drug in a particular country, but\nthen be subject to price regulations that delay the commercial launch of the product, possibly for lengthy time periods, and negatively\nimpact the revenues we, or our collaborators, are able to generate from product sales in that country. In the U.S., approval and\nreimbursement decisions are not linked directly, but there is increasing scrutiny from the Congress, regulatory authorities, payers,\npatients and pathway organizations of the pricing of pharmaceutical products. Adverse pricing limitations may also hinder our ability\nto recoup our investment in one or more product candidates, even if our product candidates obtain marketing approval.\nOur, and our collaborators’, ability to successfully commercialize XPOVIO and any other products that we may develop or\nacquire will depend, in part, on the extent to which reimbursement for these products is available from government health\nadministration authorities, private health insurers and other organizations. Government authorities and third-party payors, such as\nprivate health insurers and health maintenance organizations, decide which medications they will pay for and establish reimbursement\nlevels. Obtaining and maintaining adequate reimbursement for XPOVIO and any of our product candidates, if approved, may be\ndifficult. Moreover, the process for determining whether a third-party payor will provide coverage for a product may be separate from\nthe process for setting the price of a product or for establishing the reimbursement rate that such a payor will pay for the product.\nFurther, one payor’s determination to provide coverage for a product does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage and\nreimbursement for our products. Even with payer coverage, patients may be unwilling or unable to pay the copay required and may\nchoose not to take XPOVIO.\nA primary trend in the healthcare industry in the U.S. and elsewhere is cost containment. Government authorities and third-party\npayors have attempted to control costs by limiting coverage and the amount of reimbursement for particular medications. Increasingly,\nthird-party payors are requiring that drug companies provide them with predetermined discounts from list prices and are challenging\nthe prices charged for medical products. Third-party payors may also seek, with respect to an approved product, additional clinical\nevidence that goes beyond the data required to obtain marketing approval. They may require such evidence to demonstrate clinical\nbenefits and value in specific patient populations or they may call for costly pharmaceutical studies to justify coverage and\nreimbursement or the level of reimbursement relative to other therapies before covering our products. Accordingly, we cannot be sure\nthat reimbursement will be or will continue to be available for XPOVIO and any product that we, or our collaborators, commercialize\nand, if reimbursement is available, we cannot be sure as to the level of reimbursement and whether it will be adequate. Coverage and\nreimbursement may impact the demand for or the price of XPOVIO or any product candidate for which we, or our collaborators,\nobtain marketing approval. If reimbursement is not available or is available only at limited levels, we, or our collaborators, may not be\nable to successfully commercialize XPOVIO or any other approved products.\nThere may be significant delays in obtaining reimbursement for newly-approved drugs, and coverage may be more limited than\nthe indications for which the drug is approved by the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities. Moreover, eligibility for\nreimbursement does not imply that any drug will be paid for in all cases or at a rate that covers our costs, including research,\ndevelopment, manufacture, sale and distribution. Interim reimbursement levels for new drugs, if applicable, may also not be sufficient\nto cover our costs and may not be made permanent. Reimbursement rates may vary according to the use of the drug and the clinical\nsetting in which it is used, may be based on reimbursement levels already set for lower cost drugs and may be incorporated into\nexisting payments for other services. Net prices for drugs may be reduced by mandatory discounts or rebates required by government\nhealthcare programs or private payors and by any future relaxation of laws that presently restrict imports of drugs from countries\nwhere they may be sold at lower prices than in the U.S. Third-party payors often rely upon Medicare coverage policy and payment\nlimitations in setting their own reimbursement policies. Our inability to promptly obtain coverage and profitable payment rates from\nboth government-funded and private payors for any approved drugs that we develop could have a material adverse effect on our\noperating results, our ability to raise capital needed to commercialize our products and our overall financial condition.\nProduct liability lawsuits against us could divert our resources, cause us to incur substantial liabilities and limit commercialization\nof XPOVIO or any other products that we may develop or acquire.\nWe face an inherent risk of product liability exposure related to our commercialization of XPOVIO and the testing of our\nproduct candidates in human clinical trials as the administration of our products to humans may expose us to liability claims, whether\nor not our products are actually at fault for causing any harm or injury. As XPOVIO is used over longer periods of time by a wider\ngroup of patients taking numerous other medicines or by patients with additional underlying conditions, the likelihood of adverse drug\n56\nreactions or unintended side effects, including death, may increase. For example, we may be sued if any drug we develop allegedly\ncauses injury or is found to be otherwise unsuitable during clinical testing, manufacturing, marketing or sale. Any such product\nliability claims may include allegations of defects in manufacturing, defects in design, a failure to warn of dangers inherent in the\nproduct, negligence, strict liability or a breach of warranties. Claims could also be asserted under state consumer protection acts. If we\ncannot successfully defend ourselves against claims that our products or product candidates caused injuries, we will incur substantial\nliabilities or be required to limit commercialization of our products. Regardless of merit or eventual outcome, liability claims may\nresult in:\n• decreased demand for XPOVIO and any other products that we may develop or acquire;\n• injury to our reputation and significant negative media attention;\n• withdrawal of clinical trial participants;\n• initiation of investigations by regulators;\n• product recalls, withdrawals or labeling, marketing or promotional restrictions;\n• significant costs to defend the related litigation;\n• substantial monetary awards to trial participants or patients;\n• loss of revenue;\n• reduced resources of our management to pursue our business strategy; and\n• the inability to successfully commercialize XPOVIO and any other products that we may develop or acquire.\nWe currently hold clinical trial and general product liability insurance coverage, but that coverage may not be adequate to cover\nany and all liabilities that we may incur. Insurance coverage is increasingly expensive. We may not be able to maintain insurance\ncoverage at a reasonable cost or in an amount adequate to satisfy any liability that may arise.\nThe business that we or our collaborators conduct outside of the U.S. may be adversely affected by international risks and\nuncertainties.\nAlthough our operations are primarily based in the U.S., we and our collaborators conduct business outside of the U.S. and\nexpect to continue to do so in the future. For instance, many of the sites at which our clinical trials are being conducted are located\noutside of the U.S. In addition, we and our collaborators are seeking and continue to plan to seek approvals to sell our and their\nproducts in foreign countries. Any business that we, or our collaborators, conduct outside of the U.S. is subject to additional risks that\nmay materially adversely affect our or their ability to conduct business in international markets, including:\n• potentially reduced protection of our intellectual property rights;\n• the potential for so-called parallel importing, which is what happens when a local seller, faced with high or higher local\nprices, opts to import goods from a foreign market (with low or lower prices) rather than buying them locally;\n• unexpected changes in tariffs, trade barriers or regulatory requirements;\n• economic weakness, including the uncertainty associated with worldwide economic conditions as a result of inflation,\nsustained high interest rates, natural disasters and military conflicts, including the conflict between Russia and Ukraine,\nthe war between Israel and Hamas, the Palestinian group that controls the Gaza Strip, volatility in currency exchange\nrates, pandemics or other public health emergencies, or political instability in particular foreign economies and markets;\n• workforce uncertainty in countries where labor unrest is more common than in the U.S.;\n• production shortages resulting from any events affecting a product candidate and/or finished drug product supply or\nmanufacturing capabilities abroad;\n• business interruptions resulting from geo-political actions, including war and terrorism, such as the ongoing conflict\nbetween Russia and Ukraine, the war between Israel and Hamas, pandemics or other public health emergencies, climate\nchange or natural disasters, including earthquakes, hurricanes, typhoons, floods and fires; and\n• failure to comply with Office of Foreign Asset Control rules and regulations and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act\n(“FCPA”).\n57\nRisks Related to Regulatory Matters\nEven if we, or our collaborators, complete the necessary preclinical studies and clinical trials for our product candidates, the\nregulatory approval process is expensive, time-consuming and uncertain and we or they may not receive approvals for the\ncommercialization of some or all of our or their product candidates in a timely manner, or at all.\nOur long-term success and ability to sustain and grow revenue depends on our and our collaborators’ ability to continue to\nsuccessfully develop our product candidates and obtain regulatory approval to market our or their products both in and outside of the\nU.S. In order to market and sell our products in the EU and many other jurisdictions, we and our collaborators must obtain separate\nmarketing approvals and comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements. The FDA and comparable foreign regulatory\nauthorities, whose laws and regulations may differ from country to country, impose substantial requirements on the development of\nproduct candidates to become eligible for marketing approval and have substantial discretion in the process and may refuse to accept\nany application or may decide that the data are insufficient for approval and require additional preclinical studies, clinical trials or\nother studies and testing. The time required to obtain approval outside of the U.S. may differ substantially from that required to obtain\nFDA approval. For example, in many countries outside of the U.S., it is required that the drug be approved for reimbursement before\nthe drug can be approved for sale in that country. Approval by the FDA does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other\ncountries or jurisdictions, and approval by one regulatory authority outside of the U.S. does not ensure approval by regulatory\nauthorities in other countries or jurisdictions or by the FDA. However, a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one\ncountry may have a negative effect on the regulatory process in other countries. For additional risks related to conducting business\noutside of the U.S., please see the risk factor above entitled “The business that we or our collaborators conduct outside of the U.S.\nmay be adversely affected by international risks and uncertainties.”\nIn addition, the FDA and foreign regulatory authorities retain broad discretion in evaluating the results of our clinical trials and\nin determining whether the results demonstrate that selinexor or any other product candidate is safe and effective. If we are required to\nconduct additional clinical trials of selinexor or other product candidates prior to approval of additional indications, in earlier lines of\ntherapy or in combination with other drugs, including additional earlier phase clinical trials that may be required prior to commencing\nany later phase clinical trials, or additional clinical trials following completion of our current and planned later phase clinical trials, we\nmay need substantial additional funds, and there is no assurance that the results of any such additional clinical trials will be sufficient\nfor approval.\nThe process of obtaining marketing approvals, both in the U.S. and abroad, is lengthy, expensive and uncertain. It may take\nmany years, if approval is obtained at all, and can vary substantially based upon a variety of factors, including the type, complexity\nand novelty of the product candidates involved. Securing marketing approval requires the submission of extensive preclinical and\nclinical data and supporting information, including manufacturing information, to regulatory authorities for each therapeutic indication\nto establish the product candidate’s safety and effectiveness. Changes in marketing approval policies during the development period,\nchanges in or the enactment of additional statutes or regulations, or changes in regulatory review for each submitted product\napplication, may cause delays in the approval or rejection of an application.\nThe FDA or other regulatory authorities may determine that (i) our product candidates are not safe and effective, only\nmoderately effective or have undesirable or unintended side effects, toxicities or other characteristics that preclude our obtaining\nmarketing approval or prevent or limit commercial use; (ii) the dose used in a clinical trial has not been optimized and require us to\nconduct additional dose optimization studies; or (iii) the comparator arm in a trial is no longer the appropriate comparator due to the\nevolution of the competitive landscape or subsequent data of the comparator product, even if the FDA or other regulatory authority\nhad previously approved the trial design, and we may be required to amend the trial or we may not receive approval of the indication.\nFor example, the FDA’s Oncology Center of Excellence has a number of projects to advance the development and regulation of\nmedical products for patients with cancer, such as Project Optimus to reform the dose optimization and dose selection paradigm in\noncology drug development to emphasize selection of an optimal dose. These projects may require sponsors to spend additional time\nand resources either pre- or post-approval, and our ability to complete existing trials or initiate new trials may be delayed.\nFurther, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act (“PREA”), an NDA or supplement to an NDA for certain drugs must contain\ndata to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration\nfor each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective, unless the sponsor receives a deferral or waiver from the\nFDA. A deferral may be granted for several reasons, including a finding that the product or therapeutic candidate is ready for approval\nfor use in adults before pediatric trials are complete or that additional safety or effectiveness data needs to be collected before the\npediatric trials begin. The law requires the FDA to send a PREA Non-Compliance letter to sponsors who have failed to submit their\npediatric assessments required under PREA, have failed to seek or obtain a deferral or deferral extension or have failed to request\napproval for a required pediatric formulation. It further requires the FDA to publicly post the PREA Non-Compliance letter and\nsponsor’s response. The applicable legislation in the EU also requires sponsors to either conduct clinical trials in a pediatric population\nin accordance with a Pediatric Investigation Plan approved by the Pediatric Committee of the European Medicines Agency (“EMA”)\nor to obtain a waiver or deferral from the conduct of these studies by this Committee. For any of our product candidates for which we\n58\nor our collaborators are seeking regulatory approval in the U.S. or the EU, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to obtain a waiver\nor alternatively complete any required studies and other requirements in a timely manner, or at all, which could result in an issuance\nand publication of a PREA Non-Compliance letter and associated reputational harm, our product candidate being considered\nmisbranded and subject to relevant enforcement action, invalidation of the marketing application, and/or financial penalties. Our\ncollaborators are also subject to similar requirements outside of the U.S. and the EU and thus the attendant risks and uncertainties.\nFinally, our ability to develop and market new drug products may be threatened by ongoing litigation challenging the FDA’s\napproval of mifepristone. Specifically, on April 7, 2023, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas invalidated the\napproval by the FDA of mifepristone, a drug product which was originally approved in 2000 and whose distribution is governed by\nvarious measures adopted under a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (“REMS”). In reaching that decision, the district court\nmade a number of findings that numerous representatives of the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry believe will chill the\ndevelopment, approval and distribution of new drug products in the U.S. Among other determinations, the district court substituted its\nscientific judgement for that of the FDA and it held that FDA must provide a special justification for any differences between an\napproved drug’s labeling and the conditions that existed in the drug’s clinical trials. Further, the district court read the jurisdictional\nrequirements governing litigation in federal court so as to potentially allow virtually any party to bring a lawsuit against the FDA in\nconnection with its decision to approve an NDA or establish requirements under a REMS.\nOn April 13, 2023, the district court decision was stayed, in part, by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. Thereafter,\non April 21, 2023, the U.S. Supreme Court entered a stay pending disposition of the appeal of the district court decision in the Court\nof Appeals for the Fifth Circuit or the Supreme Court. The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit held oral arguments in the case on\nMay 17, 2023 and, on August 16, 2023, issued its decision. The Court of Appeals declined to order the removal of mifepristone from\nthe market, finding that a challenge to the FDA’s initial approval in 2000 is barred by the statute of limitations. However, the Court of\nAppeals did hold that changes allowing for expanded access of mifepristone that the FDA authorized in 2016 and 2021 were arbitrary\nand capricious in violation of federal law. On September 8, 2023, the Department of Justice (the “DOJ”) and a manufacturer of\nmifepristone asked the U.S. Supreme Court to review the Court of Appeals’ decision. On December 12, 2023, the Supreme Court\nannounced that it will review the Court of Appeals’ decision. Depending on the outcome of this litigation and the regulatory\nuncertainty it has engendered, our ability to develop new drug product candidates and to maintain approval of existing drug products\nand measures adopted under a REMS is at risk and our efforts to develop and market new drug products could be delayed, undermined\nor subject to protracted litigation.\nThe approval of our and our collaborators’ current or future product candidates for commercial sale could be delayed, limited or\ndenied or we or they may be required to conduct additional studies for a number of reasons, including, but not limited to, the\nfollowing:\n• regulatory authorities may determine that our or our collaborators’ product candidates do not demonstrate safety and\neffectiveness in accordance with regulatory agency standards based on a number of considerations, including AEs that are\nreported during clinical trials;\n• regulatory authorities could analyze and/or interpret data from clinical trials and preclinical testing in different ways than\nwe, or our collaborators, interpret them and determine that our data is insufficient for approval;\n• regulatory authorities may require more information, including additional preclinical or clinical data or trials, to support\napproval, as in the case of our new trial for selinexor in endometrial cancer following discussions with the FDA in early\n2022 on our SIENDO Study;\n• regulatory authorities could determine that our manufacturing processes are not properly designed, are not conducted in\naccordance with federal or other laws or otherwise not properly managed, and we may be unable to obtain regulatory\napproval for a commercially viable manufacturing process for our product candidates in a timely manner, or at all;\n• the supply or quality of our or our collaborators’ product candidates for our clinical trials may be insufficient, inadequate\nor delayed;\n• the size of the patient population required to establish the efficacy of our or our collaborators’ product candidates to the\nsatisfaction of regulatory agencies may be larger than we or they anticipated;\n• our failure or the failure of clinical investigational sites and the records kept at the respective locations, including clinical\ntrial data, to be in compliance with the FDA’s current good clinical practices regulations (“GCP”) or comparable\nregulations outside of the U.S., including the failure to pass inspections of our corporate site or our clinical trial sites;\n• regulatory authorities may change their approval policies or adopt new regulations;\n59\n• regulatory authorities may not be able to undertake reviews, applicable inspections or approval processes in a timely\nmanner;\n• the results of our earlier clinical trials may not be representative of our future, larger trials;\n• regulatory authorities may not agree with our or our collaborators’ regulatory approval strategies or components of our or\ntheir regulatory filings, such as the design or implementation of the relevant clinical trials; or\n• a product may not be approved for the indications that we, or our collaborators, request or may be limited or subject to\nrestrictions or post-approval commitments that render the approved drug not commercially viable.\nFinally, we or our collaborators could face heightened risks with respect to seeking marketing approval in the UK as a result of\nthe withdrawal of the UK from the EU, commonly referred to as Brexit. The UK is no longer part of the European Single Market and\nEU Customs Union. As of January 1, 2021, the MHRA became responsible for supervising medicines and medical devices in Great\nBritain, comprising England, Scotland and Wales under domestic law, whereas Northern Ireland will continue to be subject to EU\nrules under the Northern Ireland Protocol. The MHRA will rely on the Human Medicines Regulations 2012 (SI 2012/1916) (as\namended) (“HMR”) as the basis for regulating medicines. The HMR has incorporated into the domestic law of the body of EU law\ninstruments governing medicinal products that pre-existed prior to the UK’s withdrawal from the EU. Any delay in obtaining, or an\ninability to obtain, any marketing approvals, as a result of Brexit or otherwise, may force us or our collaborators to restrict or delay\nefforts to seek regulatory approval in the UK for our or their product candidates, which could significantly and materially harm our\nbusiness.\nSince a significant proportion of the regulatory framework for pharmaceutical products in the UK covering the quality, safety,\nand efficacy of pharmaceutical products, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales, and distribution of pharmaceutical\nproducts is derived from EU directives and regulations, Brexit may have a material impact upon the regulatory regime with respect to\nthe development, manufacture, importation, approval and commercialization of our product candidates in the UK. For example, the\nUK is no longer covered by the centralized procedures for obtaining EU-wide marketing authorization from the EMA, and a separate\nmarketing authorization will be required to market our product candidates in the UK. Until December 31, 2023, it was possible for the\nMHRA to rely on a decision taken by the European Commission (“EC”) on the approval of a new marketing authorization via the\ncentralized procedure. From January 1, 2024 on, a new international recognition procedure (“IRP”) applies, which intends to facilitate\napproval of pharmaceutical products in the UK. The IRP is open to applicants that have already received an authorization for the same\nproduct from one of the MHRA’s specified Reference Regulators (“RRs”). The RRs notably include EMA and regulators in the\nEU/European Economic Area (“EEA”) member states for approvals in the EU centralized procedure and mutual recognition procedure\nas well as the FDA (for product approvals granted in the U.S.). However, the concrete functioning of the IRP is currently unclear. Any\ndelay in obtaining, or an inability to obtain, any marketing approvals, as a result of Brexit or otherwise, may force us or our\ncollaborators to restrict or delay efforts to seek regulatory approval in the UK for our product candidates, which could significantly\nand materially harm our business.\nWe, or our collaborators, may not be able to file for marketing approvals and may not receive necessary approvals to\ncommercialize our or their products in any market. Any failure, delay or setback in obtaining regulatory approval for our or our\ncollaborators’ product candidates could materially adversely affect our or our collaborators’ ability to generate revenue from a\nparticular product candidate, which could result in significant harm to our financial position and adversely impact our stock price.\nWe, or our collaborators, may seek approval from the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities to use accelerated\ndevelopment pathways for our product candidates. If we, or our collaborators, are not able to use such pathways, we, or they, may\nbe required to conduct additional clinical trials beyond those that are contemplated, which would increase the expense of\nobtaining, and delay the receipt of, necessary marketing approvals, if we, or they, receive them at all. In addition, even if an\naccelerated approval pathway is available to us, or our collaborators, it may not lead to expedited approval of our product\ncandidates, or approval at all.\nUnder the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”) and implementing regulations, the FDA may grant accelerated\napproval to a product candidate to treat a serious or life-threatening condition that provides meaningful therapeutic benefit over\navailable therapies, upon a determination that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint or intermediate clinical endpoint that is\nreasonably likely to predict clinical benefit. The FDA considers a clinical benefit to be a positive therapeutic effect that is clinically\nmeaningful in the context of a given disease, such as irreversible morbidity or mortality. For the purposes of accelerated approval, a\nsurrogate endpoint is a marker, such as a laboratory measurement, radiographic image, physical sign, or other measure that is thought\nto predict clinical benefit, but is not itself a measure of clinical benefit. An intermediate clinical endpoint is a clinical endpoint that can\nbe measured earlier than an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible\nmorbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit measurement of a therapeutic effect that is considered reasonably likely to predict the\nclinical benefit of a drug. The accelerated approval pathway may be used in cases in which the advantage of a new drug over available\n60\ntherapy may not be a direct therapeutic advantage, but is a clinically important improvement from a patient and public health\nperspective. Similar risks to those described above are also applicable to any application that we, or our collaborators, have submitted\nor may submit in other jurisdictions outside of the U.S. Prior to seeking such accelerated approval, we, or our collaborators, will\ncontinue to seek feedback from the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory agencies and otherwise evaluate our, or their, ability to seek\nand receive such accelerated approval.\nThere can be no assurance that the FDA or foreign regulatory agencies will agree with our, or our collaborators’, surrogate\nendpoints or intermediate clinical endpoints in any of our, or their, clinical trials, or that we, or our collaborators, will decide to pursue\nor submit any additional New Drug Applications (“NDA”) for accelerated approval or any other form of expedited development,\nreview or approval. Similarly, there can be no assurance that, after feedback from the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory agencies,\nwe, or our collaborators, will continue to pursue or apply for accelerated approval or any other form of expedited development, review\nor approval. Furthermore, for any submission of an application for accelerated approval or application under another expedited\nregulatory designation, there can be no assurance that such submission or application will be accepted for filing or that any expedited\ndevelopment, review or approval will be granted on a timely basis, or at all.\nFinally, there can be no assurance that we will satisfy all FDA requirements, including new provisions, that govern accelerated\napproval. For example, with passage of the FDORA in December 2022, Congress modified certain provisions governing accelerated\napproval of drug and biologic products. Specifically, the new legislation authorized the FDA to (i) require a sponsor to have its\nconfirmatory clinical trial underway before accelerated approval is awarded; (ii) require a sponsor of a product granted accelerated\napproval to submit progress reports on its post-approval studies to FDA every six months until the study is completed; and (iii) use\nexpedited procedures to withdraw accelerated approval of an NDA or a Biologic License Application after the confirmatory trial fails\nto verify the product’s clinical benefit. Further, FDORA requires the agency to publish on its website “the rationale for why a post-\napproval study is not appropriate or necessary” whenever it decides not to require such a study upon granting accelerated approval.\nWe will need to fully comply with these and other requirements in connection with the development and approval of any product\ncandidate that qualifies for accelerated approval.\nIn March 2023, the FDA issued draft guidance that outlines its current thinking and approach to accelerated approval. The FDA\nindicated that the accelerated approval pathway is commonly used for approval of oncology drugs due to the serious and life-\nthreatening nature of cancer. Although single-arm trials have been commonly used to support accelerated approval, a randomized\ncontrolled trial is the preferred approach as it provides a more robust efficacy and safety assessment and allows for direct comparisons\nto an available therapy. To that end, the FDA outlined considerations for designing, conducting, and analyzing data for trials intended\nto support accelerated approvals of oncology therapeutics. While this guidance is currently only in draft form and will ultimately not\nbe legally binding even when finalized, we will need to observe the FDA’s guidance closely to ensure that our products qualify for\naccelerated approval.\nAccordingly, a failure to obtain and maintain accelerated approval or any other form of expedited development, review or\napproval for our product candidates, or withdrawal of a product candidate, would result in a longer time period until\ncommercialization of such product candidate, could increase the cost of development of such product candidate and could harm our\ncompetitive position in the marketplace.\nXPOVIO and any of our product candidates for which we, or our collaborators, obtain marketing approval in the future are\nsubject to post-marketing regulatory requirements, including following accelerated or conditional approvals of our product\ncandidates, and could be subject to post-marketing restrictions or withdrawal from the market, and we, and our collaborators, may\nbe subject to substantial penalties if we, or they, fail to comply with regulatory requirements or if we, or they, experience\nunanticipated problems with our products following approval.\nOnce marketing approval has been granted, an approved product and its manufacturer and marketer are subject to ongoing\nreview and extensive regulation. XPOVIO and any of our product candidates for which we, or our collaborators, obtain marketing\napproval in the future, as well as the manufacturing processes, post-approval studies and measures, labeling, advertising and\npromotional activities for such drug, among other things, will be subject to continual requirements of and review by the FDA and\nother U.S. and foreign regulatory authorities. These requirements include submissions of safety and other post-marketing information\nand reports, registration and listing requirements, requirements relating to manufacturing, quality control, quality assurance and\ncorresponding maintenance of records and documents, and requirements regarding the distribution of samples to physicians and\nrecordkeeping. For example, as a condition of the XPOVIO approval by the FDA for the multiple myeloma and DLBCL indications,\nwe are required to complete certain post-marketing commitments. Even if marketing approval of a product candidate is granted, the\napproval may be subject to limitations on the indicated uses for which the drug may be marketed or to the conditions of approval,\nincluding the requirement to implement a REMS, which could include requirements for a restricted distribution system.\n61\nThe FDA also imposes requirements for costly post-marketing studies or clinical trials to maintain approval of any products that\nreceived accelerated or conditional approval. For drugs approved under the FDA’s Accelerated Approval Program, the FDA typically\nrequires post-marketing confirmatory trials to evaluate the anticipated effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical\nbenefit. These confirmatory trials must be completed with due diligence. For example, in June 2020, the FDA approved XPOVIO to\ntreat DLBCL under the FDA’s accelerated approval regulations and as a condition of the accelerated approval for this indication we\nare required to comply with a number of post-approval requirements. We may not be able to successfully and timely complete these\npost-approval requirements or any other post-marketing confirmatory study as required to maintain approval or achieve full approval\nof our products. If required post-approval studies fail to verify the clinical benefits of our products or confirm that the surrogate\nmarker used for accelerated approval of our products showed an adequate correlation with clinical outcomes, if a sufficient number of\nparticipants cannot be enrolled, or if we fail to perform the required post-approval studies with due diligence or on a timely basis, the\nFDA has the authority to withdraw approval of the drug following a hearing conducted under the FDA’s regulations, which could\nhave a material adverse impact on our business. We cannot be certain of the results of the confirmatory clinical studies for the DLBCL\nindication or any other future conditional approval we receive or what action the FDA may take if the results of those studies are not\nas expected based on clinical data that FDA has already reviewed.\nSimilar risks to those described above are also applicable to any application that we, or our collaborators, have submitted or may\nsubmit in other jurisdictions outside of the U.S., including applications submitted to the EMA to support approval of selinexor to treat\nheavily pretreated multiple myeloma, relapsed or refractory DLBCL, or any other cancer indication. For medicinal products where the\nbenefit of immediate availability outweighs the risk of less comprehensive data than normally required, based on the scope and criteria\ndefined in legislation and guidelines, it is possible to obtain a conditional marketing authorization in the EU with a 12-month validity\nperiod and annual renewal pursuant to Regulation No 507/2006. These are granted only if the EMA’s Committee for Medicinal\nProducts for Human Use (“CHMP”) finds that all four of the following requirements are met: (i) the benefit-risk balance of the\nproduct is positive; (ii) it is likely that the sponsor will be able to provide comprehensive data; (iii) unmet medical needs will be\nfulfilled; and (iv) the benefit to public health of the medicinal product’s immediate availability on the market outweighs the risks due\nto the need for further data.\nOnce a conditional marketing authorization has been granted, the marketing authorization holder must fulfil specific obligations\nwithin defined timelines. These obligations could include completing ongoing or new studies or collecting additional data to confirm\nthe medicine’s benefit-risk balance remains positive. For example, the July 2022 marketing authorization from the EC for\nNEXPOVIO to treat adult patients with multiple myeloma after at least one prior therapy satisfied the conditional approval obligation\nfor NEXPOVIO for patients with multiple myeloma who have received at least four prior therapies and whose disease is refractory to\nat least two proteasome inhibitors, two immunomodulatory agents, and an anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody, and who have\ndemonstrated disease progression on the last therapy. Conditional marketing authorization is valid for a period of one year and can be\nrenewed/prolonged if the conditions set out in the conditional marketing authorization are met. Further, as discussed above, under\nFDORA, modifications to regulations governing accelerated approval require a sponsor to have the confirmatory clinical trial\nunderway before accelerated approval is awarded as well as other requirements following accelerated approval. If we, or our\ncollaborators, are not able to fulfill the specific obligations set out in any conditional marketing authorization requirements, the\nconditional marketing authorization may not be prolonged and we, or our collaborators, will no longer be able to market the product\nfor the indication receiving conditional approval.\nThe FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities may also impose requirements for costly surveillance to monitor the\nsafety or efficacy of an approved drug. The FDA and other U.S. or foreign agencies, including the DOJ, closely regulate and monitor\nthe post-approval marketing and promotion of drugs to ensure that they are manufactured, marketed and distributed only for the\napproved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling. The FDA imposes stringent restrictions on\nmanufacturers’ communications regarding off-label use, and if we, or our collaborators communicate about any of our product\ncandidates for which we, or they, receive marketing approval in a way that regulators assert goes beyond their approved indications,\nwe, or they, may be subject to warnings or enforcement action for off-label marketing. Alleged violations of the FDCA or other\nstatutes, including the False Claims Act (the “FCA”), relating to the promotion and advertising of prescription drugs may lead to\ninvestigations or allegations of violations of federal and state health care fraud and abuse laws and state consumer protection laws.\nWe will need to carefully navigate the FDA’s various regulations, guidance and policies, along with recently enacted legislation,\nto ensure compliance with restrictions governing promotion of our products. In September 2021, the FDA published final regulations\nwhich describe the types of evidence that the agency will consider in determining the intended use of a drug or biologic. Moreover,\nwith passage of the Pre-Approval Information Exchange Act in December 2022, sponsors of products that have not been approved\nmay proactively communicate to payors certain information about products in development to help expedite patient access upon\nproduct approval. In addition, in October 2023, the FDA published draft guidance outlining the agency’s non-binding policies\ngoverning the distribution of scientific information on unapproved uses to healthcare providers. This draft guidance calls for such\ncommunications to be truthful, non-misleading, factual, and unbiased and include all information necessary for healthcare providers to\ninterpret the strengths and weaknesses and validity and utility of the information about the unapproved use.\n62\nIn addition, manufacturers of approved products and those manufacturers’ facilities are required to comply with extensive\nrequirements by the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities, including ensuring that quality control and manufacturing\nprocedures conform to current Good Manufacturing Practice (“cGMP”), which include requirements relating to quality control and\nquality assurance as well as the corresponding maintenance of records and documentation and reporting requirements. We, our\ncontract manufacturers, our collaborators and their contract manufacturers could be subject to periodic unannounced inspections by\nthe FDA or foreign regulatory authorities to monitor and ensure compliance with cGMPs or other regulations.\nPost-approval discovery of previously unknown problems with our products, including AEs of unanticipated severity or\nfrequency, or relating to our manufacturing processes, data integrity issues with regulatory filings, or failure to comply with regulatory\nrequirements, may yield various results, including:\n• litigation involving patients taking our drug;\n• restrictions on our manufacturers or manufacturing processes;\n• restrictions on the labeling or marketing of our products;\n• restrictions on the distribution or use of our products;\n• requirements to conduct post-marketing studies or clinical trials;\n• warning letters or untitled letters;\n• withdrawal, recall or seizure of our products from the market;\n• refusal to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications that we submit;\n• fines, restitution or disgorgement of profits or revenues;\n• suspension or withdrawal of marketing approvals;\n• damage to relationships with our current or potential collaborators;\n• unfavorable press coverage and damage to our reputation;\n• refusal to permit the import or export of our products; or\n• injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.\nSimilar restrictions apply to the approval of our products in the EU. The holder of the marketing authorization is required to\ncomply with a range of requirements applicable to the manufacturing, marketing, promotion and sale of medicinal products. These\ninclude:\n• compliance with the EU’s stringent pharmacovigilance or safety reporting rules, which can impose post-authorization\nstudies and additional monitoring obligations;\n• the manufacturing of authorized medicinal products, for which a separate manufacturer’s license is mandatory, must also\nbe conducted in strict compliance with the applicable EU laws, regulations and guidance, including Directive 2001/83/EC,\nDirective 2003/94/EC, Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 and the EC Guidelines for Good Manufacturing Practice. These\nrequirements include compliance with EU cGMP standards when manufacturing medicinal products and active\npharmaceutical ingredients, including the manufacture of active pharmaceutical ingredients outside of the EU with the\nintention to import the active pharmaceutical ingredients into the EU; and\n• the marketing and promotion of authorized drugs, including industry-sponsored continuing medical education and\nadvertising directed toward the prescribers of drugs and/or the general public, are strictly regulated in the EU notably\nunder Directive 2001/83/EC, as amended, and are also subject to EU Member State laws. Direct-to-consumer advertising\nof prescription medicines is prohibited across the EU.\nFinally, we or our collaborators are also subject to other regulations in various jurisdictions, including the\nDrug Supply Chain Security Act (the “DSCSA”) in the U.S., the Falsified Medicines Directive in the EU and similar laws and\nregulations in other countries that require us or them to develop electronic systems to serialize, track, trace and authenticate units of\nour products through the supply chain and distribution system. Compliance with these regulations may result in increased expenses for\nus or our collaborators or impose greater administrative burdens on our or their organizations, and any failure on our or our\ncollaborators’ part to meet these requirements could result in fines or other penalties or reputational harm.\n63\nAccordingly, in connection with our currently approved products and assuming we, or our collaborators, receive marketing\napproval for one or more of our product candidates, we, and our collaborators, and our and their contract manufacturers will continue\nto expend time, money and effort in all areas of regulatory compliance, including manufacturing, production, product surveillance and\nquality control. If we, and our collaborators, are not able to comply with post-approval regulatory requirements, our or our\ncollaborators’ ability to market any future products could be limited, which could adversely affect our ability to achieve or sustain\nprofitability. Further, the cost of compliance with post-approval regulations may have a negative effect on our operating results and\nfinancial condition.\nIf we, or our collaborators, are required by the FDA, EMA or comparable regulatory authority to obtain clearance or approval of a\ncompanion diagnostic test in connection with approval of any of our product candidates or a group of therapeutic products, and we\nor they do not obtain or there are delays in obtaining clearance or approval of a diagnostic test, we may not be able to\ncommercialize the product candidate and our ability to generate revenue may be materially impaired.\nIn connection with our ongoing development of a registration-enabling study of selinexor in patients whose endometrial cancer\nis TP53 wild-type, we are utilizing a companion diagnostic. To be successful in developing and commercializing product candidates in\ncombination with companion diagnostics, we or our collaborators will need to address a number of scientific, technical, regulatory and\nlogistical challenges. According to FDA guidance, if the FDA determines that a companion diagnostic device is essential to ensuring\nthe safety and effectiveness of a novel therapeutic product or new indication, the FDA generally will not approve the therapeutic\nproduct or new therapeutic product indication if the companion diagnostic is not also approved or cleared. In certain circumstances\n(for example, when a therapeutic product is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening condition for which no satisfactory available\ntherapy exists or when the labelling of an approved product needs to be revised to address a serious safety issue), however, the FDA\nmay approve a therapeutic product without the prior or contemporaneous marketing authorization of a companion diagnostic. In this\ncase, approval of a companion diagnostic may be a post-marketing requirement or commitment.\nIf the FDA requires clearance or approval of a companion diagnostic for any of our product candidates, whether before,\nconcurrently with approval, or post-approval of the product candidate, we, and/or our collaborators, may encounter difficulties in\ndeveloping and obtaining clearance or approval for these companion diagnostics. The process of obtaining or creating such diagnostic\nis time consuming and costly. The FDA previously has required in vitro companion diagnostics intended to select the patients who\nwill respond to a product candidate to obtain pre-market approval (“PMA”), simultaneously with approval of the therapeutic\ncandidate.\nThe PMA process, including the gathering of preclinical and clinical data and the submission and review by the FDA, can take\nseveral years or longer. It involves a rigorous pre-market review during which the sponsor must prepare and provide the FDA with\nreasonable assurance of the device’s safety and effectiveness and information about the device and its components regarding, among\nother things, device design, manufacturing, and labeling. After a device is placed on the market, it remains subject to significant\nregulatory requirements, including requirements governing development, testing, manufacturing, distribution, marketing, promotion,\nlabeling, import, export, record-keeping, and adverse event reporting. Similar risks to those described above are also applicable to any\ncompanion diagnostic that we, or our collaborators, utilize in our clinical trials in connection with approval of a product candidate\noutside of the U.S. For example, in the EU, until May 25, 2022, in vitro diagnostic medical devices were regulated by Directive\n98/79/EC (the “IVDD”), which has been repealed and replaced by Regulation (EU) No 2017/746 (the “IVDR”). The regulation of\ncompanion diagnostics is now subject to further requirements set forth in the IVDR. Companion diagnostics will have to undergo a\nconformity assessment by a notified body. Before it can issue an EU certificate, the notified body must seek a scientific opinion from\nthe EMA on the suitability of the companion diagnostic to the medicinal product concerned if the medicinal product falls exclusively\nwithin the scope of the centralized procedure for the authorization of medicines, or the medicinal product is already authorized\nthrough the centralized procedure, or a marketing authorization application for the medicinal product has been submitted through the\ncentralized procedure. As part of the process to obtain a CE-mark for the FMI FoundationOne®CDx for the purpose of determining\nTP53 wild-type status for use of selinexor in the maintenance treatment of TP53 wild-type endometrial cancer patients, a performance\nstudy is required which leverages our global, Phase 3 study evaluating selinexor as a maintenance therapy following systemic therapy\nin patients with TP53 wild-type advanced or recurrent endometrial cancer (the “EC-042 Study”) (e.g., using the unapproved\nFoundationOne®CDx IVD to screen for TP53 wild-type patients in the EC-042 Study and using the data generated to validate the CDx\nitself). As the regulations are relatively new, the industry is gaining experience in the compilation of these submissions while the\nnational Competent Authorities and the respective Ethics Committees are also gaining expertise in assessing these applications. As a\nresult, the assessment deadlines of these performance study submissions and amendments are often not met. These new regulations\nhave and could continue to negatively impact the pace of enrollment in our clinical trials. For example, in 2023, site activation for our\nPhase 3 clinical trial in endometrial cancer was delayed in the EU due to the new IVDR regulations. Consequently, the ability to use\nthe FoundationOne®CDx in vitro diagnostic medical devices to screen patients for TP53 status in the EC-042 Study has been (and\ncontinues to be) delayed in various countries in the EU.\n64\nWe may rely on third parties for the design, development and manufacture of companion diagnostic tests for our product\ncandidates, such as in the case of our ongoing Phase 3 study evaluating selinexor in patients with TP53 wild-type advanced or\nrecurrent endometrial cancer. If we enter into such collaborative agreements, we will be dependent on the sustained cooperation and\neffort of our future collaborators in developing and obtaining clearance or approval for these companion diagnostics. It may be\nnecessary to resolve issues such as selectivity/specificity, analytical validation, reproducibility, or clinical validation of companion\ndiagnostics during the development and regulatory clearance or approval processes. Moreover, even if data from preclinical studies\nand early clinical trials appear to support development of a companion diagnostic for a product candidate, data generated in later\nclinical trials may fail to support the analytical and clinical validation of the companion diagnostic. We and our future collaborators\nmay encounter difficulties in developing, obtaining regulatory clearance or approval for, manufacturing and commercializing\ncompanion diagnostics similar to those we face with respect to our product candidates themselves, including issues with achieving\nregulatory clearance or approval, production of sufficient quantities at commercial scale and with appropriate quality standards, and in\ngaining market acceptance.\nIf we are unable to successfully develop companion diagnostics for our product candidates, or experience delays in doing so, the\ndevelopment of our product candidates may be adversely affected, our product candidates may not obtain marketing approval, and we\nmay not realize the full commercial potential of any of our product candidates that obtain marketing approval. As a result, our\nbusiness, results of operations and financial condition could be materially harmed. In addition, a diagnostic company with whom we\ncontract may decide to discontinue selling or manufacturing the companion diagnostic test that we anticipate using in connection with\ndevelopment and commercialization of product candidates or our relationship with such diagnostic company may otherwise terminate.\nWe may not be able to enter into arrangements with another diagnostic company to obtain supplies of an alternative diagnostic test for\nuse in connection with the development and commercialization of our product candidates or do so on commercially reasonable terms,\nwhich could adversely affect and/or delay the co-development or commercialization of our companion diagnostic and therapeutic\nproduct candidates.\nWe or our collaborators may seek certain designations for our product candidates in or outside of the U.S., including\nBreakthrough Therapy, Fast Track and Priority Review designations, and PRIME Designation in the EU, but we, or they, might\nnot receive such designations, and even if we, or they, do, such designations may not lead to a faster development or regulatory\nreview or approval process.\nWe may seek certain designations for one or more of our product candidates that could expedite review and approval by the\nFDA. A Breakthrough Therapy product is defined as a product that is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other\nproducts, to treat a serious condition, and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product may demonstrate substantial\nimprovement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed\nearly in clinical development. For products that have been designated as breakthrough therapies, interaction and communication\nbetween the FDA and the sponsor of the trial can help to identify the most efficient path for clinical development while minimizing\nthe number of patients placed in ineffective control regimens.\nThe FDA may also designate a product for Fast Track review if it is intended, whether alone or in combination with one or more\nother products, for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and it demonstrates the potential to address\nunmet medical needs for such a disease or condition. For Fast Track products, sponsors may have greater interactions with the FDA\nand the FDA may initiate review of sections of a Fast Track product’s application before the application is complete. This rolling\nreview may be available if the FDA determines, after preliminary evaluation of clinical data submitted by the sponsor, that a Fast\nTrack product may be effective.\nWe may also seek a Priority Review designation for one or more of our product candidates. If the FDA determines that a\nproduct candidate offers major advances in treatment or provides a treatment where no adequate therapy exists, the FDA may\ndesignate the product candidate for priority review. A Priority Review designation means that the goal for the FDA to review an\napplication is six months, rather than the standard review period of ten months.\nThese designations are within the discretion of the FDA. Accordingly, even if we believe that one of our product candidates\nmeets the criteria for these designations, the FDA may disagree and instead determine not to make such designation. Further, even if\nwe receive a designation, such as the recent receipt of Fast Track designation for selinexor to treat myelofibrosis, the receipt of such\ndesignation for a product candidate may not result in a faster development or regulatory review or approval process compared to\nproducts considered for approval under conventional FDA procedures and does not assure ultimate approval by the FDA. In addition,\neven if one or more of our product candidates qualifies for these designations, the FDA may later decide that the product candidates\nno longer meet the conditions for qualification and rescind the designation or decide that the time period for FDA review or approval\nwill not be shortened.\n65\nIn the EU, we or our collaborators may seek PRIME designation for some of our product candidates in the future. PRIME is a\nvoluntary program aimed at enhancing the EMA’s role to reinforce scientific and regulatory support in order to optimize development\nand enable accelerated assessment of new medicines that are of major public health interest with the potential to address unmet\nmedical needs. The program focuses on medicines that target conditions for which there exists no satisfactory method of treatment in\nthe EU or even if such a method exists, it may offer a major therapeutic advantage over existing treatments. PRIME is limited to\nmedicines under development and not authorized in the EU and the sponsor intends to apply for an initial MAA through the\ncentralized procedure. To be accepted for PRIME, a product candidate must meet the eligibility criteria with respect to its major public\nhealth interest and therapeutic innovation based on information that is capable of substantiating the claims. The benefits of a PRIME\ndesignation include the appointment of a CHMP rapporteur to provide continued support and help to build knowledge ahead of a\nMAA, early dialogue and scientific advice at key development milestones, and the potential to qualify products for accelerated review,\nmeaning reduction in the review time for an opinion on approvability to be issued earlier in the application process. PRIME enables a\nsponsor to request parallel EMA scientific advice and health technology assessment advice to facilitate timely market access. Even if\nwe or our collaborators receive PRIME designation for any of our product candidates, the designation may not result in a materially\nfaster development process, review or approval compared to conventional EMA procedures. Further, obtaining PRIME designation\ndoes not assure or increase the likelihood of the EMA’s grant of a marketing authorization.\nWe, or our collaborators, may not be able to obtain orphan drug exclusivity for any product candidates we, or they, may develop,\nand even if we do, that exclusivity may not prevent the FDA or the EMA from approving other competing products.\nUnder the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may designate a product as an orphan drug if it is a drug or biologic intended to treat a\nrare disease or condition. A similar regulatory scheme governs approval of orphan products by the EMA in the EU. Generally, if a\nproduct candidate with an Orphan Drug Designation subsequently receives the first marketing approval for the indication for which it\nhas such designation, the product is entitled to a period of marketing exclusivity, which precludes the FDA or the EMA, as applicable,\nfrom approving another marketing application for the same product for the same therapeutic indication for that time period. The\napplicable period is seven years in the U.S. and ten years in the EU. The exclusivity period in the EU can be reduced to six years if a\nproduct no longer meets the criteria for Orphan Drug Designation, in particular if the product is sufficiently profitable so that market\nexclusivity is no longer justified.\nIn order for the FDA to grant orphan drug exclusivity to one of our products, the agency must find that the product is indicated\nfor the treatment of a condition or disease with a patient population of fewer than 200,000 individuals annually in the U.S. The FDA\nmay conclude that the condition or disease for which we seek orphan drug exclusivity does not meet this standard. Even if we obtain\norphan drug exclusivity for a product, such as the recent receipt of orphan drug exclusivity for selinexor for the treatment of\nmyelofibrosis, that exclusivity may not effectively protect the product from competition because different products can be approved\nfor the same condition. In addition, even after an orphan drug is approved, the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities,\nsuch as the EMA, can subsequently approve the same product for the same condition if the FDA or such other authorities conclude\nthat the later product is clinically superior in that it is shown to be safer, more effective or makes a major contribution to patient care.\nOrphan drug exclusivity may also be lost if the FDA or EMA determines that the request for designation was materially defective or if\nthe manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient quantity of the product to meet the needs of the patients with the rare disease or\ncondition.\nIn 2017, the Congress passed the FDA Reauthorization Act of 2017 (the “FDARA”). The FDARA, among other things, codified\nthe FDA’s pre-existing regulatory interpretation, to require that a drug sponsor demonstrate the clinical superiority of an orphan drug\nthat is otherwise the same as a previously approved drug for the same rare disease in order to receive orphan drug exclusivity. Under\nomnibus legislation signed by former President Trump in December 2020, the requirement for a product to show clinical superiority\napplies to drugs and biologics that received Orphan Drug Designation before the enactment of the FDARA in 2017, but have not yet\nbeen approved or licensed by the FDA.\nThe FDA and Congress may further reevaluate the Orphan Drug Act and its regulations and policies. This may be particularly\ntrue in light of a decision from the Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit in September 2021 finding that, for the purpose of\ndetermining the scope of exclusivity, the term “same disease or condition” means the designated “rare disease or condition” and could\nnot be interpreted by the FDA to mean the “indication or use.” Although there have been legislative proposals to overrule this\ndecision, they have not been enacted into law. On January 23, 2023, the FDA announced that, in matters beyond the scope of that\ncourt order, the FDA will continue to apply its existing regulations tying orphan-drug exclusivity to the uses or indications for which\nthe orphan drug was approved.\nWe do not know if, when, or how the FDA may change the orphan drug regulations and policies in the future or whether\nCongress will take legislative action, and it is uncertain how any changes might affect our business. Depending on what changes the\nFDA or Congress may make to orphan drug regulations and policies, our business could be adversely impacted.\n66\nInadequate funding for the FDA, the SEC and other government agencies, including from government shut downs, or other\ndisruptions to these agencies’ operations, could hinder their ability to hire and retain key leadership and other personnel, prevent\nnew products and services from being developed or commercialized in a timely manner or otherwise prevent those agencies from\nperforming normal business functions on which the operation of our business may rely, which could negatively impact our\nbusiness.\nThe ability of the FDA to review and approve new products can be affected by a variety of factors, including government budget\nand funding levels, ability to hire and retain key personnel and accept the payment of user fees, and statutory, regulatory and policy\nchanges. Average review times at the agency have fluctuated in recent years as a result. Disruptions at the FDA and other agencies\nmay also slow the time necessary for new product candidates to be reviewed and/or approved by necessary government agencies,\nwhich would adversely affect our business. In addition, government funding of the SEC and other government agencies on which our\noperations may rely, including those that fund research and development activities, is subject to the political process, which is\ninherently fluid and unpredictable.\nDisruptions at the FDA and other agencies may also slow the time necessary for new product candidates to be reviewed and/or\napproved by necessary government agencies, which would adversely affect our business. For example, over the last several years the\nU.S. government has shut down several times and certain regulatory agencies, such as the FDA and the SEC, have had to furlough\ncritical employees and stop critical activities. If a prolonged government shutdown occurs, it could significantly impact the ability of\nthe FDA to timely review and process our regulatory submissions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nFurther, future government shutdowns could impact our ability to access the public markets and obtain necessary capital in order to\nproperly capitalize and continue our operations.\nCurrent and future legislation may increase the difficulty and cost for us, or any collaborators, to obtain marketing approval and\ncommercialize our or their product candidates, if approved, and affect the prices we, or they, may obtain.\nIn the U.S. and some foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes\nregarding the healthcare system that could, among other things, prevent or delay marketing approval of our or our collaborators’\nproduct candidates, restrict or regulate post-approval activities and affect our ability, or the ability of any collaborators, to profitably\nsell or commercialize XPOVIO or any product candidate for which we, or they, obtain marketing approval. We expect that current\nlaws, as well as other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future, may result in more rigorous coverage criteria and\nin additional downward pressure on the price that we, or any collaborators, may receive for any approved products. If reimbursement\nof our products is unavailable or limited in scope, our business could be materially harmed.\nIn March 2010, President Obama signed into law the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health\nCare and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act (collectively the “PPACA”). In addition, other legislative changes have been\nproposed and adopted since the PPACA was enacted. In August 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, created\nmeasures for spending reductions by Congress. A Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, tasked with recommending a targeted\ndeficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, was unable to reach required goals, thereby triggering the\nlegislation’s automatic reduction to several government programs. These changes included aggregate reductions to Medicare\npayments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect in April 2013 and will remain in effect through 2031. The\nAmerican Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several providers and increased the statute\nof limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. Further, with the passage of\nthe Inflation Reduction Act (the “IRA”) in August 2022, Congress extended the expansion of PPACA premium tax credits through\n2025.\nThese and other laws may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding and otherwise affect the\nprices we may obtain for any of our products or product candidates for which we may obtain regulatory approval or the frequency\nwith which any such product is prescribed or used. For example, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, which was signed into law by\nPresident Biden in December 2022, made several changes to sequestration of the Medicare program. Section 1001 of the Act delays\nthe 4% Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010 sequester for two years, through the end of calendar year 2024. Triggered by enactment\nof the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, the 4% cut to the Medicare program would have taken effect in January 2023. The Act’s\nhealth care offset title includes Section 4163, which extends the 2% Budget Control Act of 2011 Medicare sequester for six months\ninto fiscal year 2032 and lowers the payment reduction percentages in fiscal years 2030 and 2031.\nSince enactment of the PPACA, there have been, and continue to be, numerous legal challenges and Congressional actions to\nrepeal and replace provisions of the law. For example, with the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the “TCJA”),\nCongress repealed the “individual mandate.” The repeal of this provision, which requires most Americans to carry a minimal level of\nhealth insurance, became effective in 2019. Further, in December 2018, a U.S. District Court judge in the Northern District of Texas\nruled that the individual mandate portion of the PPACA is an essential and inseverable feature of the PPACA, and therefore because\n67\nthe mandate was repealed as part of the TCJA, the remaining provisions of the PPACA are invalid as well. In June 2021, the U.S.\nSupreme Court dismissed this action after finding that the plaintiffs do not have standing to challenge the constitutionality of the\nPPACA. Litigation and legislation over the PPACA are likely to continue, with unpredictable and uncertain results.\nThe Trump Administration also took executive actions to undermine or delay implementation of the PPACA, including\ndirecting federal agencies with authorities and responsibilities under the PPACA to waive, defer, grant exemptions from, or delay the\nimplementation of any provision of the PPACA that would impose a fiscal or regulatory burden on states, individuals, healthcare\nproviders, health insurers, or manufacturers of pharmaceuticals or medical devices. In January 2021, however, President Biden issued\na new Executive Order which directs federal agencies to reconsider rules and other policies that limit Americans’ access to health\ncare, and consider actions that will protect and strengthen that access. Under this Executive Order, federal agencies are directed to re-\nexamine: policies that undermine protections for people with pre-existing conditions, including complications related to COVID-19;\ndemonstrations and waivers under Medicaid and the PPACA that may reduce coverage or undermine the programs, including work\nrequirements; policies that undermine the health insurance marketplace or other markets for health insurance; policies that make it\nmore difficult to enroll in Medicaid and the PPACA; and policies that reduce affordability of coverage or financial assistance,\nincluding for dependents.\nWe expect that these healthcare reforms, as well as other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future, may\nresult in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding, more rigorous coverage criteria and new payment\nmethodologies that govern XPOVIO or any other approved product and/or the level of reimbursement physicians receive for\nadministering XPOVIO or any other approved product we, or our collaborators, might bring to market. Reductions in reimbursement\nlevels may negatively impact the prices we receive or the frequency with which our products are prescribed or administered. Any\nreduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private\npayors. Accordingly, such reforms, if enacted, could have an adverse effect on anticipated revenue from XPOVIO or from product\ncandidates for which we may obtain marketing approval and may affect our overall financial condition and ability to develop or\ncommercialize product candidates.\nThe prices of prescription pharmaceuticals in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions are subject to considerable legislative and\nexecutive actions and could impact the prices we obtain for our products, if and when licensed.\nThe prices of prescription pharmaceuticals have also been the subject of considerable discussion in the U.S. There have been\nseveral recent U.S. congressional inquiries, as well as proposed and enacted state and federal legislation designed to, among other\nthings, bring more transparency to pharmaceutical pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient\nprograms, and reduce the costs of pharmaceuticals under Medicare and Medicaid. In 2020, former President Trump issued several\nexecutive orders intended to lower the costs of prescription products and certain provisions in these orders have been incorporated into\nregulations. These regulations include an interim final rule implementing a most favored nation model for prices that would tie\nMedicare Part B payments for certain physician-administered pharmaceuticals to the lowest price paid in other economically advanced\ncountries, effective January 1, 2021. That rule, however, has been subject to a nationwide preliminary injunction and, on December\n29, 2021, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”) issued a final rule to rescind it. With issuance of this rule, CMS\nstated that it will explore all options to incorporate value into payments for Medicare Part B pharmaceuticals and improve\nbeneficiaries’ access to evidence-based care.\nIn addition, in October 2020, the Department of Health and Human Services (the “HHS”) and the FDA published a final rule\nallowing states and other entities to develop a Section 804 Importation Program to import certain prescription drugs from Canada into\nthe U.S. That regulation was challenged in a lawsuit by the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (“PhRMA”) but\nthe case was dismissed by a federal district court in February 2023 after the court found that PhRMA did not have standing to sue the\nHHS. Nine states (Colorado, Florida, Maine, New Hampshire, New Mexico, North Dakota, Texas, Vermont and Wisconsin) have\npassed laws allowing for the importation of drugs from Canada. Certain of these states have submitted Section 804 Importation\nProgram proposals and are awaiting FDA approval. On January 5, 2023, the FDA approved Florida’s plan for Canadian drug\nimportation.\nFurther, in November 2020, the HHS finalized a regulation removing safe harbor protection for price reductions from\npharmaceutical manufacturers. The final rule would also eliminate the current safe harbor for Medicare drug rebates and create new\nsafe harbors for beneficiary point-of-sale discounts and pharmacy benefit manager service fees. It originally was set to go into effect\non January 1, 2022, but with passage of the IRA has been delayed by Congress to January 1, 2032.\nIn July 2021, President Biden signed Executive Order 14063, which focuses on, among other things, the price of\npharmaceuticals. The Order directs the HHS to create a plan within 45 days to combat “excessive pricing of prescription\npharmaceuticals and enhance domestic pharmaceutical supply chains, to reduce the prices paid by the federal government for such\n68\npharmaceuticals, and to address the recurrent problem of price gouging.” In September 2021, the HHS released its plan to reduce\npharmaceutical prices. The key features of that plan are to: (a) make pharmaceutical prices more affordable and equitable for all\nconsumers and throughout the health care system by supporting pharmaceutical price negotiations with manufacturers; (b) improve\nand promote competition throughout the prescription pharmaceutical industry by supporting market changes that strengthen supply\nchains, promote biosimilars and generic drugs, and increase transparency; and (c) foster scientific innovation to promote better\nhealthcare and improve health by supporting public and private research and making sure that market incentives promote discovery of\nvaluable and accessible new treatments.\nOn August 16, 2022, the IRA was signed into law by President Biden. The new legislation has implications for Medicare Part D,\nwhich is a program available to individuals who are entitled to Medicare Part A or enrolled in Medicare Part B to give them the option\nof paying a monthly premium for outpatient prescription drug coverage. Among other things, the IRA requires manufacturers of\ncertain drugs to engage in price negotiations with Medicare (beginning in 2026), with prices that can be negotiated subject to a cap;\nimposes rebates under Medicare Part B and Medicare Part D to penalize price increases that outpace inflation (first due in 2023); and\nreplaces the Part D coverage gap discount program with a new discounting program (beginning in 2025). The IRA permits the\nSecretary of the HHS to implement many of these provisions through guidance, as opposed to regulation, for the initial years.\nSpecifically, with respect to price negotiations, Congress authorized Medicare to negotiate lower prices for certain costly single-\nsource drug and biologic products that do not have competing generics or biosimilars and are reimbursed under Medicare Part B and\nPart D. CMS may negotiate prices for ten high-cost drugs paid for by Medicare Part D starting in 2026, followed by 15 Part D drugs in\n2027, 15 Part B or Part D drugs in 2028, and 20 Part B or Part D drugs in 2029 and beyond. This provision applies to drug products\nthat have been approved for at least nine years and biologics that have been licensed for 13 years, but it does not apply to drugs and\nbiologics that have been approved for a single rare disease or condition. Further, the legislation subjects drug manufacturers to civil\nmonetary penalties and a potential excise tax for failing to comply with the legislation by offering a price that is not equal to or less\nthan the negotiated “maximum fair price” under the law or for taking price increases that exceed inflation. The legislation also\nrequires manufacturers to pay rebates for drugs in Medicare Part D whose price increases exceed inflation. The new law also caps\nMedicare out-of-pocket drug costs at an estimated $4,000 a year in 2024 and, thereafter beginning in 2025, at $2,000 a year.\nOn June 6, 2023, Merck & Co. filed a lawsuit against the HHS and CMS asserting that, among other things, the IRA’s Drug\nPrice Negotiation Program for Medicare constitutes an uncompensated taking in violation of the Fifth Amendment of the Constitution.\nSubsequently, a number of other parties, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce (the “Chamber”), Bristol Myers Squibb Company,\nthe PhRMA, Astellas, Novo Nordisk, Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Novartis, AstraZeneca and Boehringer Ingelheim, also filed lawsuits\nin various courts with similar constitutional claims against the HHS and CMS. We expect that litigation involving these and other\nprovisions of the IRA will continue, with unpredictable and uncertain results. Accordingly, while it is currently unclear how the IRA\nwill be effectuated, we cannot predict with certainty what impact any federal or state health reforms will have on us, but such changes\ncould impose new or more stringent regulatory requirements on our activities or result in reduced reimbursement for our products, any\nof which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nAt the state level, individual states are increasingly aggressive in passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to\ncontrol pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on\ncertain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage\nimportation from other countries and bulk purchasing. In addition, regional healthcare organizations and individual hospitals are\nincreasingly using bidding procedures to determine what pharmaceutical products and which suppliers will be included in their\nprescription drug and other healthcare programs. These measures could reduce the ultimate demand for our products, once approved,\nor put pressure on our product pricing. We expect that additional state and federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the\nfuture, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which\ncould result in reduced demand for our product candidates or additional pricing pressures.\nFinally, outside of the U.S., in some nations, including those of the EU, the pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to\ngovernmental control and access. In these countries, pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can take considerable time\nafter the receipt of marketing approval for a product. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval in some countries, we, or our\ncollaborators, may be required to conduct a clinical trial that compares the cost-effectiveness of our product to other available\ntherapies.\nThese measures, as well as others adopted in the future, may result in additional downward pressure on the price that we receive\nfor XPOVIO or any other approved product we or our collaborators might bring to market. Accordingly, such reforms, if enacted,\ncould have an adverse effect on anticipated revenue from XPOVIO or from product candidates that we, or our collaborators, may\nsuccessfully develop and for which we, or they, may obtain marketing approval and may affect our overall financial condition and\nability to develop or commercialize product candidates.\n69\nOur relationships with healthcare providers, physicians and third-party payers will be subject to applicable anti-kickback, fraud\nand abuse, and other healthcare laws and regulations, which could expose us to criminal sanctions, civil penalties, contractual\ndamages, reputational harm and diminished profits and future earnings.\nHealthcare professionals, including but not limited to physicians, nurses, medical directors, hospitals, pharmacies, pharmacy\nbenefit managers, group purchasing organizations, wholesalers, insurers, and all individuals employed by such entities (collectively,\n“HCPs”), may influence the recommendation and prescription of our approved products. Our arrangements with HCPs and others who\nhave the ability to influence the recommendation and prescription of our products may expose us to broadly applicable fraud and\nabuse and other healthcare laws and regulations that may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through\nwhich we market, sell and distribute our medicines for which we obtain marketing approval. Restrictions under applicable federal and\nstate healthcare laws and regulations include the following:\n• the federal healthcare anti-kickback statute prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting,\noffering, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward either the\nreferral of an individual for, or the purchase, order, or recommendation of, any good or service, for which payment may\nbe made under federal and state healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid;\n• the FCA imposes criminal and civil penalties, including civil whistleblower or qui tam actions, against individuals or\nentities for knowingly presenting or causing to be presented, to the federal government, claims for payment or approval\nfrom Medicare, Medicaid or other government payers that are false or fraudulent or making a false statement to avoid,\ndecrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government, with potential liability including mandatory\ntreble damages and significant per-claim penalties;\n• the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”), as further amended by the Health\nInformation Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, which imposes certain requirements, including mandatory\ncontractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health\ninformation without appropriate authorization by entities subject to the rule, such as health plans, healthcare\nclearinghouses and healthcare providers;\n• the federal false statements statute, which prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a\nmaterial fact or making any materially false statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare\nbenefits, items or services;\n• the federal transparency requirements under the federal Physician Payment Sunshine Act, which requires manufacturers of\ndrugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies to report to the HHS, information related to payments and other transfers of\nvalue to physicians, other healthcare providers and teaching hospitals and ownership and investment interests held by\nphysicians and their immediate family members and applicable group purchasing organizations; and\n• analogous state laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, which may apply to sales or\nmarketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third-party\npayers, including private insurers, and certain state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the\npharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the\nfederal government in addition to requiring drug manufacturers to report information related to payments to physicians\nand other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures.\nBecause of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of the statutory exceptions and safe harbors available, it is possible that\nsome of our business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. If our operations are found to be in\nviolation of any of the laws described above or any other government regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties,\nincluding civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, such as\nMedicare and Medicaid, imprisonment and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our\nbusiness, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nEfforts to ensure that our business arrangements with third parties will comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations\nwill involve substantial costs. It is possible that governmental authorities will conclude that our business practices may not comply\nwith current or future statutes, regulations or case law involving applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations. If\nour operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other governmental regulations that may apply to us, we may be\nsubject to significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, exclusion from government funded healthcare\nprograms, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. If any of the physicians or other\nproviders or entities with whom we expect to do business are found to be not in compliance with applicable laws, they may be subject\nto criminal, civil or administrative sanctions, including exclusions from government funded healthcare programs. Liabilities they incur\n70\npursuant to these laws could result in significant costs or an interruption in operations, which could have a material adverse effect on\nour business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nOur reporting and payment obligations under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and other governmental drug pricing programs\nare complex and may involve subjective decisions. Any failure to comply with those obligations could subject us to penalties and\nsanctions.\nAs a condition of reimbursement by various federal and state health insurance programs, we are required to calculate and report\ncertain pricing information to federal and state agencies. The regulations governing the calculations, price reporting and payment\nobligations are complex and subject to interpretation by various government and regulatory agencies, as well as the courts. Reasonable\nassumptions have been made where there is lack of regulations or clear guidance and such assumptions involve subjective decisions\nand estimates. We are required to report any revisions to our calculation, price reporting and payment obligations previously reported\nor paid. Such revisions could affect our liability to federal and state payers and also adversely impact our reported financial results of\noperations in the period of such restatement. Further, a number of states have either implemented or are considering implementation of\ndrug price transparency legislation that may prevent or limit our ability to take price increases at certain rates or frequencies.\nRequirements under such laws include advance notice of planned price increases, reporting price increase amounts and factors\nconsidered in taking such increases, wholesale acquisition cost information disclosure to prescribers, purchasers, and state agencies,\nand new product notice and reporting. Such legislation could limit the price or payment for certain drugs, and a number of states are\nauthorized to impose civil monetary penalties or pursue other enforcement mechanisms against manufacturers for the untimely,\ninaccurate, or incomplete reporting of drug pricing information or for otherwise failing to comply with drug price transparency\nrequirements. If we are found to have violated state law requirements, we may become subject to significant penalties or other\nenforcement mechanisms, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nUncertainty exists as new laws, regulations, judicial decisions, or new interpretations of existing laws, or regulations related to\nour calculations, price reporting or payments obligations increases the chances of a legal challenge, restatement or investigation. If we\nbecome subject to investigations, restatements, or other inquiries concerning our compliance with price reporting laws and regulations,\nwe could be required to pay or be subject to additional reimbursements, penalties, sanctions or fines, which could have a material\nadverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, it is possible that future healthcare reform\nmeasures could be adopted, which could result in increased pressure on pricing and reimbursement of our products and thus have an\nadverse impact on our financial position or business operations.\nFurther, state Medicaid programs may be slow to invoice pharmaceutical companies for calculated rebates resulting in a lag\nbetween the time a sale is recorded and the time the rebate is paid. This results in us having to carry a liability on our consolidated\nbalance sheets for the estimate of rebate claims expected for Medicaid patients. If actual claims are higher than current estimates, our\nfinancial position and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nIn addition to retroactive rebates and the potential for 340B Program refunds, if we are found to have knowingly submitted any\nfalse price information related to the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program to CMS, we may be liable for civil monetary penalties. Such\nfailure could also be grounds for CMS to terminate our Medicaid drug rebate agreement, pursuant to which we participate in the\nMedicaid program. In the event that CMS terminates our rebate agreement, federal payments may not be available under government\nprograms, including Medicaid or Medicare Part B, for our covered outpatient drugs.\nAdditionally, if we overcharge the government in connection with the Federal Supply Schedule pricing program or Tricare\nRetail Pharmacy Program, whether due to a misstated Federal Ceiling Price or otherwise, we are required to refund the difference to\nthe government. Failure to make necessary disclosures and/or to identify contract overcharges can result in allegations against us\nunder the FCA and other laws and regulations. Unexpected refunds to the government, and responding to a government investigation\nor enforcement action, would be expensive and time-consuming, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial\ncondition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nOur collaborators are also subject to similar requirements outside of the U.S. and thus the attendant risks and uncertainties. If\nour collaborators suffer material and adverse effects from such risks and uncertainties, our rights and benefits for our licensed products\ncould be negatively impacted, which could have a material and adverse impact on our revenues.\n71\nWe are subject to stringent privacy laws, information security laws, regulations, policies and contractual obligations related to data\nprivacy and security and changes in such laws, regulations, policies and contractual obligations, and failure to comply with such\nrequirements could subject us to significant fines and penalties, which may have a material adverse effect on our business,\nfinancial condition or results of operations.\nWe are subject to data privacy and protection laws and regulations that apply to the collection, transmission, storage and use of\npersonally-identifying information, which among other things, impose certain requirements relating to the privacy, security and\ntransmission of personal information, including comprehensive regulatory systems in the U.S., EU, UK and other countries in which\nwe may conduct business. The legislative and regulatory landscape for privacy and data protection continues to evolve in jurisdictions\nworldwide, and there has been an increasing focus on privacy and data protection issues with the potential to affect our business.\nFailure to comply with any of these laws and regulations could result in enforcement action against us, including fines, imprisonment\nof company officials and public censure, claims for damages by affected individuals, damage to our reputation and loss of goodwill,\nany of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects.\nThere are numerous U.S. federal and state laws and regulations related to the privacy and security of personal information. In\nparticular, regulations promulgated pursuant to HIPAA establish privacy and security standards that limit the use and disclosure of\nindividually identifiable health information, or protected health information, and require the implementation of administrative,\nphysical and technological safeguards to protect the privacy of protected health information and ensure the confidentiality, integrity\nand availability of electronic protected health information. Determining whether protected health information has been handled in\ncompliance with applicable privacy standards and our contractual obligations can be complex and may be subject to changing\ninterpretation.\nIf we fail to comply with applicable privacy laws, including applicable HIPAA privacy and security standards, we could face\ncivil and criminal penalties. HHS enforcement activity can result in financial liability and reputational harm, and responses to such\nenforcement activity can consume significant internal resources. In addition, state attorneys general are authorized to bring civil\nactions seeking either injunctions or damages in response to violations that threaten the privacy of state residents. We cannot be sure\nhow these regulations will be interpreted, enforced or applied to our operations. In addition to the risks associated with enforcement\nactivities and potential contractual liabilities, our ongoing efforts to comply with evolving laws and regulations at the federal and state\nlevel may be costly and require ongoing modifications to our policies, procedures and systems.\nIn addition to potential enforcement by the HHS, we could also be potentially subject to privacy enforcement from the Federal\nTrade Commission (the “FTC”). The FTC has been particularly focused on the unpermitted processing of health and genetic data\nthrough its recent enforcement actions and is expanding the types of privacy violations that it interprets to be “unfair” under Section 5\nof the FTC Act, as well as the types of activities it views to trigger the Health Breach Notification Rule (which the FTC also has the\nauthority to enforce). The agency is also in the process of developing rules related to commercial surveillance and data security. We\nwill need to account for the FTC’s evolving rules and guidance for proper privacy and data security practices in order to mitigate risk\nfor a potential enforcement action, which may be costly.\nStates are also active in creating specific rules relating to the processing of personal information. In 2018, California passed into\nlaw the California Consumer Privacy Act (the “CCPA”), which took effect on January 1, 2020 and imposed many requirements on\nbusinesses that process the personal information of California residents. Many of the CCPA’s requirements are similar to those found\nin the European General Data Protection Regulation (the “GDPR”), which is further described below, including requiring businesses\nto provide notice to data subjects regarding the information collected about them and how such information is used and shared, and\nproviding data subjects the right to request access to such personal information and, in certain cases, request the erasure of such\npersonal information. The CCPA also affords California residents the right to opt-out of “sales” of their personal information. The\nCCPA contains significant penalties for companies that violate its requirements.\nIn November 2020, California voters passed a ballot initiative for the California Privacy Rights Act (the “CPRA”), which went\ninto effect on January 1, 2023 and significantly expanded the CCPA to incorporate additional GDPR-like provisions including\nrequiring that the use, retention and sharing of personal information of California residents be reasonably necessary and proportionate\nto the purposes of collection or processing, granting additional protections for sensitive personal information, and requiring greater\ndisclosures related to notice to residents regarding retention of information. The CPRA also created a new enforcement agency – the\nCalifornia Privacy Protection Agency – the sole responsibility of which is to enforce the CPRA and other California privacy laws,\nwhich will further increase compliance risk. The provisions in the CPRA may apply to some of our business activities.\nIn addition to California, eleven other states have passed comprehensive privacy laws similar to the CCPA and CPRA. These\nlaws are either in effect or will go into effect sometime before the end of 2026. Like the CCPA and CPRA, these laws create\nobligations related to the processing of personal information, as well as special obligations for the processing of “sensitive” data,\nwhich includes health data in some cases. Some of the provisions of these laws may apply to our business activities. There are also\n72\nstates that are strongly considering or have already passed comprehensive privacy laws during the 2024 legislative sessions that will\ngo into effect in 2025 and beyond, including New Hampshire and New Jersey. Other states will be considering these laws in the\nfuture, and Congress has also been debating passing a federal privacy law. There are also states that are specifically regulating health\ninformation that may affect our business. For example, Washington state passed a health privacy law in 2023 that will regulate the\ncollection and sharing of health information, and the law also has a private right of action, which further increases the relevant\ncompliance risk. Connecticut and Nevada have also passed similar laws regulating consumer health data, and more states (such as\nVermont) are considering such legislation in 2024. These laws may impact our business activities, including our identification of\nresearch subjects, relationships with business partners and ultimately the marketing and distribution of our products.\nSimilar to the laws in the U.S., there are significant privacy and data security laws that apply in Europe and other countries. The\ncollection, use, disclosure, transfer, or other processing of personal data, including personal health data, regarding individuals who are\nlocated in the European Economic Area (“EEA”), and the processing of personal data that takes place in the EEA, is regulated by the\nGDPR, which went into effect in May 2018 and which imposes obligations on companies that operate in our industry with respect to\nthe processing of personal data and the cross-border transfer of such data. The GDPR imposes onerous accountability obligations\nrequiring data controllers and processors to maintain a record of their data processing and policies. If our or our partners’ or service\nproviders’ privacy or data security measures fail to comply with the GDPR requirements, we may be subject to litigation, regulatory\ninvestigations, enforcement notices requiring us to change the way we use personal data and/or fines of up to 20 million Euros or up to\n4% of the total worldwide annual turnover of the group of companies of the preceding financial year, whichever is higher, as well as\ncompensation claims by affected individuals, negative publicity, reputational harm and a potential loss of business and goodwill.\nThe GDPR places restrictions on the cross-border transfer of personal data from the EU to countries that have not been found by\nthe EC to offer adequate data protection legislation. There are ongoing concerns about the ability of companies to transfer personal\ndata from the EU to other countries. In July 2020, the Court of Justice of the EU (the “CJEU”) invalidated the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield,\none of the mechanisms used to legitimize the transfer of personal data from the EEA to the U.S. The CJEU decision also drew into\nquestion the long-term viability of an alternative means of data transfer, the standard contractual clauses, for international transfers of\npersonal data from the EEA. This CJEU decision resulted in increased scrutiny on data transfers and increased our costs of compliance\nwith data privacy legislation as well as our costs of negotiating appropriate privacy and security agreements with our vendors and\nbusiness partners.\nIn October 2022, President Biden signed an executive order to implement the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework, which serves\nas a replacement to the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield. The EC adopted the adequacy decision on July 10, 2023. The adequacy decision\npermits U.S. companies who self-certify to the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework to rely on it as a valid data transfer mechanism for\ndata transfers from the EU to the U.S. However, some privacy advocacy groups have already suggested that they will be challenging\nthe EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework. If these challenges are successful, they may not only impact the EU-U.S. Data Privacy\nFramework, but also further limit the viability of the standard contractual clauses and other data transfer mechanisms. The uncertainty\naround this issue has the potential to impact our business. Following the withdrawal of the UK from the EU, the UK Data Protection\nAct 2018 applies to the processing of personal data that takes place in the UK and includes parallel obligations to those set forth by\nGDPR. In relation to data transfers, both the UK and the EU have determined, through separate “adequacy” decisions, that data\ntransfers between the two jurisdictions are in compliance with the UK Data Protection Act and the GDPR, respectively. The UK and\nthe U.S. have also agreed to a U.S.-UK “Data Bridge”, which functions similarly to the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework and\nprovides an additional legal mechanism for companies to transfer data from the UK to the U.S. In addition to the UK, Switzerland is\nalso in the process of approving an adequacy decision in relation to the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (which would function\nsimilarly to the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework and the U.S.-UK Data Bridge in relation to data transfers from Switzerland to the\nU.S.). Any changes or updates to these developments have the potential to impact our business.\nBeyond GDPR, there are privacy and data security laws in a growing number of countries around the world. While many\nloosely follow GDPR as a model, other laws contain different or conflicting provisions. These laws will impact our ability to conduct\nour business activities, including both our clinical trials and the sale and distribution of commercial products, through increased\ncompliance costs, costs associated with contracting and potential enforcement actions.\nWhile we continue to address the implications of the recent changes to data privacy regulations, data privacy remains an\nevolving landscape at both the domestic and international level, with new regulations coming into effect and continued legal\nchallenges, and our efforts to comply with the evolving data protection rules may be unsuccessful. It is possible that these laws may be\ninterpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our practices. We must devote significant resources to understanding and\ncomplying with this changing landscape. Failure to comply with laws regarding data protection would expose us to risk of\nenforcement actions taken by data protection authorities in the EEA and elsewhere and carries with it the potential for significant\npenalties if we are found to be non-compliant. Similarly, failure to comply with federal and state laws in the U.S. regarding privacy\nand security of personal information could expose us to penalties under such laws. Any such failure to comply with data protection\nand privacy laws could result in government-imposed fines or orders requiring that we change our practices, claims for damages or\n73\nother liabilities, regulatory investigations and enforcement action, litigation and significant costs for remediation, any of which could\nadversely affect our business. Even if we are not determined to have violated these laws, government investigations into these issues\ntypically require the expenditure of significant resources and generate negative publicity, which could harm our business, financial\ncondition, results of operations or prospects.\nOur employees, independent contractors, consultants, collaborators and vendors may engage in misconduct or other improper\nactivities, including non-compliance with regulatory standards and/or requirements and insider trading, which could cause\nsignificant liability for us and harm our reputation.\nWe are exposed to the risk of fraud or other misconduct by our employees, independent contractors, consultants, collaborators\nand vendors. Misconduct by these partners could include intentional, reckless and/or negligent conduct or unauthorized activities that\nviolate FDA regulations or similar regulations of comparable foreign regulatory authorities; provide inaccurate information to the\nFDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities; fail to comply with manufacturing standards, federal and state healthcare fraud and\nabuse laws and regulations and similar laws and regulations established and enforced by comparable foreign regulatory authorities;\nfail to comply with state drug pricing transparency filing requirements; fail to report financial information or data accurately; or fail to\ndisclose unauthorized activities to us. Employee misconduct could also involve the improper use of information obtained in the course\nof clinical trials, which could result in regulatory sanctions and serious harm to our reputation. This could include violations of\nHIPAA, other U.S. federal and state laws, and requirements of foreign jurisdictions, including the GDPR. We are also exposed to risks\nin connection with any insider trading violations by employees or others affiliated with us. It is not always possible to identify and\ndeter employee or third-party misconduct, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent these activities may not be effective in\ncontrolling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from significant penalties, governmental investigations or other\nactions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to be in compliance with such laws, standards, regulations, guidance or codes of conduct.\nIf any such actions are instituted against us, and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions\ncould have a significant impact on our business and results of operations, including the imposition of significant fines or other\nsanctions.\nIf we fail to comply with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, we could become subject to fines or penalties or\nincur costs that could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe are subject to numerous environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including those governing laboratory\nprocedures and the handling, use, storage, treatment and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes. Our operations involve the use of\nhazardous and flammable materials, including chemicals and biological and radioactive materials. Our operations and the operations\nof our third-party vendors also produce hazardous waste products. We generally contract with third parties for the disposal of these\nmaterials and wastes. We cannot eliminate the risk of contamination or injury from these materials. In the event of contamination or\ninjury resulting from our use of hazardous materials, we could be held liable for any resulting damages, and any liability could exceed\nour resources. We also could incur significant costs associated with civil or criminal fines and penalties.\nAlthough we maintain workers’ compensation insurance to cover us for costs and expenses we may incur due to injuries to our\nemployees resulting from the use of hazardous materials, this insurance may not provide adequate coverage against potential\nliabilities. We do not maintain insurance for environmental liability or toxic tort claims that may be asserted against us in connection\nwith our storage or disposal of biological, hazardous or radioactive materials.\nIn addition, we may incur substantial costs in order to comply with current or future environmental, health and safety laws and\nregulations. These current or future laws and regulations may impair our research, development or commercialization efforts. Failure\nto comply with these laws and regulations also may result in substantial fines, penalties or other sanctions.\nLaws and regulations governing international operations we may have in the future may preclude us from developing,\nmanufacturing and selling certain products outside of the U.S. and require us to develop and implement costly compliance\nprograms.\nWe are subject to numerous laws and regulations in each jurisdiction outside of the U.S. in which we operate. The creation,\nimplementation and maintenance of international business practices compliance programs is costly and such programs are difficult to\nenforce, particularly where reliance on third parties is required.\nThe FCPA prohibits any U.S. individual or business from paying, offering, authorizing payment or offering of anything of\nvalue, directly or indirectly, to any foreign official, political party or candidate for the purpose of influencing any act or decision of the\nforeign entity in order to assist the individual or business in obtaining or retaining business. The FCPA also obligates companies\nwhose securities are listed in the U.S. to comply with certain accounting provisions requiring us to maintain books and records that\n74\naccurately and fairly reflect all transactions of the corporation, including international subsidiaries, and to devise and maintain an\nadequate system of internal accounting controls. The FCPA is enforced by the DOJ and the SEC.\nCompliance with the FCPA is expensive and difficult, particularly in countries in which corruption is a recognized problem. In\naddition, the FCPA presents particular challenges in the pharmaceutical industry, because, in many countries, hospitals, clinics,\nuniversities and similar institutions are operated by the government, and doctors and other healthcare professionals are considered\nforeign officials. Certain payments to healthcare professionals in connection with clinical trials, regulatory approvals, sales and\nmarketing, and other work have been deemed to be improper payments to government officials and have led to FCPA enforcement\nactions. Because the FCPA applies to indirect payments, the use of third parties and other collaborators can increase potential FCPA\nrisk, as we could be held liable for the acts of third parties that do not comply with the FCPA’s requirements.\nThe failure to comply with laws governing international business practices may result in substantial penalties, including\nsuspension or debarment from government contracting. Violation of the FCPA can result in significant civil and criminal penalties.\nIndictment alone under the FCPA can lead to suspension of the right to do business with the U.S. government until the pending claims\nare resolved. Conviction of a violation of the FCPA can result in long-term disqualification as a government contractor. The\ntermination of a government contract or relationship as a result of our failure to satisfy any of our obligations under laws governing\ninternational business practices would have a negative impact on our operations and harm our reputation and ability to procure\ngovernment contracts. The SEC also may suspend or bar issuers from trading securities on U.S. exchanges for violations of the\nFCPA’s accounting provisions.\nLike the FCPA, the UK Bribery Act and other anti-corruption laws throughout the world similarly prohibit offers and payments\nmade to obtain improper business advantages, including offers or payments to healthcare professionals and other government and non-\ngovernment officials. These other anti-corruption laws also can result in substantial financial penalties and other collateral\nconsequences.\nVarious laws, regulations and executive orders also restrict the use and dissemination outside of the U.S., or the sharing with\ncertain non-U.S. nationals, of information classified for national security purposes, as well as certain products and technical data\nrelating to those products. Our expansion outside of the U.S., has required, and will continue to require, us to dedicate additional\nresources to comply with these laws, and these laws may preclude us from developing, manufacturing, or selling certain drugs and\nproduct candidates outside of the U.S., which could limit our growth potential and increase our development costs.\nWith the passage of the CREATES Act, we are exposed to possible litigation and damages by competitors who may claim that we\nare not providing sufficient quantities of our approved products on commercially reasonable, market-based terms for testing in\nsupport of their ANDAs and 505(b)(2) applications.\nIn December 2019, former President Trump signed legislation intended to facilitate the development of generic and biosimilar\nproducts. The bill, previously known as the CREATES Act, authorizes sponsors of abbreviated new drug applications (“ANDAs”) and\n505(b)(2) applications to file lawsuits against companies holding NDAs that decline to provide sufficient quantities of an approved\nreference drug on commercially reasonable, market-based terms. Drug products on the FDA’s drug shortage list are exempt from these\nnew provisions unless the product has been on the list for more than six continuous months or the FDA determines that the supply of\nthe product will help alleviate or prevent a shortage.\nTo bring an action under the statute, an ANDA or 505(b)(2) sponsor must take certain steps to request the reference product,\nwhich, in the case of products covered by a REMS with elements to assure safe use, include obtaining authorization from the FDA for\nthe acquisition of the reference product. If the sponsor does bring an action for failure to provide a reference product, there are certain\naffirmative defenses available to the NDA holder, which must be shown by a preponderance of evidence. If the sponsor prevails in\nlitigation, it is entitled to a court order directing the NDA holder to provide, without delay, sufficient quantities of the applicable\nproduct on commercially reasonable, market-based terms, plus reasonable attorney fees and costs.\nAdditionally, the new statutory provisions authorize a federal court to award the product developer an amount “sufficient to\ndeter” the NDA holder from refusing to provide sufficient product quantities on commercially reasonable, market-based terms if the\ncourt finds, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the NDA holder did not have a legitimate business justification to delay\nproviding the product or failed to comply with the court’s order. For the purposes of the statute, the term “commercially reasonable,\nmarket-based terms” is defined as (1) the nondiscriminatory price at or below the most recent wholesale acquisition cost for the\nproduct, (2) a delivery schedule that meets the statutorily defined timetable, and (3) no additional conditions on the sale.\nAlthough we intend to comply fully with the terms of these statutory provisions, we are still exposed to potential litigation and\ndamages by competitors who may claim that we are not providing sufficient quantities of our approved products on commercially\n75\nreasonable, market-based terms for testing in support of ANDAs and 505(b)(2) applications. Such litigation would subject us to\nadditional litigation costs, damages and reputational harm, which could lead to lower revenues. The CREATES Act may enable\ngeneric competition with XPOVIO and any of our product candidates, if approved, which could impact our ability to maximize\nproduct revenue. In September 2022, the FDA issued draft guidance outlining certain of the provisions under this statute.\nWe are subject to governmental export and import controls that could impair our or our collaborators’ ability to compete in\ninternational markets due to licensing requirements and subject us or them to liability if we or they are not in compliance with\napplicable laws.\nOur products are subject to export control and import laws and regulations, including the U.S. Export Administration\nRegulations, U.S. Customs regulations, and various economic and trade sanctions regulations administered by the U.S. Treasury\nDepartment’s Office of Foreign Assets Controls. Exports of our products outside of the U.S. must be made in compliance with these\nlaws and regulations. If we or our collaborators fail to comply with these laws and regulations, we or they and certain of our or their\nemployees could be subject to substantial civil or criminal penalties, including the possible loss of export or import privileges; fines,\nwhich may be imposed on us or our collaborators and the respective responsible employees or managers; and, in extreme cases, the\nincarceration of responsible employees or managers.\nIn addition, changes in our products or changes in applicable export or import laws and regulations may create delays in the\nintroduction, provision, or sale of our products in international markets, prevent customers from using our products or, in some cases,\nprevent the export or import of our products to certain countries, governments or persons altogether. Any limitation on our ability to\nexport, provide, or sell our products could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Financial Position and Capital Requirements\nWe have incurred significant losses since inception, expect to continue to incur significant losses, and may never achieve or\nmaintain profitability.\nSince inception, we have incurred significant operating losses. Our net loss was $143.1 million for the year ended December 31,\n2023. As of December 31, 2023, we had an accumulated deficit of $1.5 billion. Although we received our first FDA-approval for\nXPOVIO in July 2019, we may never attain profitability or positive cash flows from operations. We have historically financed our\noperations principally through product sales, private placements of our common stock, proceeds from our initial public offering and\nfollow-on offerings of common stock, proceeds from the issuance of convertible debt, proceeds from a revenue interest financing\nagreement, proceeds from sales of common stock under our “at the market offering” program and cash generated from our business\ndevelopment activities. Substantially all of our operating losses have resulted from costs incurred in connection with our research and\ndevelopment programs, the pursuit of regulatory approvals within and outside of the U.S., and the commercialization of XPOVIO. We\nexpect to continue to incur significant expenses and operating losses as we continue to commercialize XPOVIO in the U.S. and\nengage in activities to prepare for the potential approval and commercialization of additional indications for selinexor as well as any\nother product candidates we develop or acquire. The net losses we incur may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter.\nWhile we began to generate revenue from the sales of XPOVIO in July 2019 and have received revenue from our license\narrangements, such as the partnership we have with Antengene Therapeutics Limited (“Antengene”) for our programs across most of\nthe Asia-Pacific region, and with Menarini for our programs in Europe, Latin America, certain Middle East and Africa regions and\nother key countries, there can be no assurance as to the amount or timing of future product or license and other revenues, and we may\nnot achieve profitability for several years, if at all. Our ability to become and remain profitable depends significantly on our success in\nmany areas, including:\n• effectively commercializing XPOVIO or any future products either on our own or with a collaborator, including by\nmaintaining a full commercial organization required to market, sell and distribute our products, and achieving an adequate\nlevel of market acceptance;\n• the impact of current or future competing products on product sales of XPOVIO or any of our future products;\n• obtaining sufficient pricing, coverage and reimbursement, including government pricing and reimbursement policies or a\nchange in the mix of our business effecting rebates related to 340B Programs, Medicare and Medicaid, for XPOVIO and\nany of our other approved products from private and government payers and the impact of any pricing changes, any of\nwhich can impact our gross-to-net provision related to product sales, which was $32.1 million for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023;\n• initiating and successfully completing clinical trials required to file for, obtain and maintain marketing approval for our\nproduct candidates;\n76\n• obtaining and maintaining regulatory approvals, either by us or our collaborators, and the timing of such approvals;\n• manufacturing at commercial scale;\n• establishing and managing any collaborations for the development, marketing and/or commercialization of our products\nand product candidates, including the level of success of our collaborators’ efforts and the timing and amount of any\nmilestone or royalty payments we may receive;\n• obtaining, maintaining and protecting our intellectual property rights;\n• the willingness of patients to pay out-of-pocket in the absence of third-party coverage or as co-pay amounts under third-\nparty coverage; for example, multiple myeloma foundation closures during 2023 resulted in significantly increased use of\nour PAP, which adversely impacted our 2023 revenues; and\n• navigating the negative impacts to healthcare systems, the ability of our clinical trial sites to conduct current or future\ntrials and the regulatory review process as the result of pandemics or other public health emergencies.\nWe anticipate that our operating expenses will continue to be significant and increase as we continue to:\n• commercialize XPOVIO in the U.S., including maintaining our commercial infrastructure;\n• obtain and/or maintain regulatory approval for XPOVIO and our product candidates, including completing any required\npost-marketing requirements to the satisfaction of the FDA or other regulatory agencies;\n• expand our research and development programs, identify additional product candidates and initiate and conduct clinical\ntrials, including clinical trials required by the FDA or other regulatory agencies in addition to those that have been or are\ncurrently expected to be conducted;\n• maintain, expand and protect our intellectual property portfolio;\n• manufacture XPOVIO and our product candidates; and\n• acquire or in-license other products, product candidates or technologies.\nBecause of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with pharmaceutical product development and commercialization,\nwe are unable to accurately predict the timing or amount of our revenue and expenses or when, or if, we will be able to achieve\nprofitability. We cannot be certain that our revenue from sales of XPOVIO alone, in the currently approved indications, will be\nsufficient for us to become profitable for several years, if at all. We may never generate revenues that are significant or large enough\nto achieve profitability. Even if we do achieve profitability, we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or\nannual basis. Our failure to become and remain profitable would decrease the value of our company and could impair our ability to\nraise capital, maintain our research and development and commercialization efforts, expand our business and/or continue our\noperations. A decline in the value of our company could also cause our stockholders to lose all or part of their investment.\nWe will need additional funding to achieve our business objectives. If we are unable to raise capital when needed or on acceptable\nterms, we would be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate our research and development programs and/or commercialization efforts.\nDiscovering, developing and commercializing products involve time-consuming, expensive and uncertain processes that take\nyears to complete. We have used substantial funds to develop XPOVIO and expect our operating expenses to continue to increase as\nwe continue to commercialize XPOVIO or any future approved product, conduct further research and development of our product\ncandidates, seek marketing approval and prepare for commercialization of selinexor in additional indications or for our other product\ncandidates, if approved, to the extent that such functions are not the responsibility of a collaborator. Furthermore, we will continue to\nincur additional costs associated with operating as a public company, hiring additional personnel and expanding our geographical\nreach. Although currently XPOVIO is commercially available in three indications, we do not anticipate that our revenue from product\nsales of XPOVIO or any funds we may receive from our collaborators will be sufficient for us to become profitable for several years,\nif at all. Accordingly, we will need to continue to rely on additional financing to achieve our business objectives.\nAs of December 31, 2023, we believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and investments will enable us to fund our current\noperating and capital expenditure plans for at least twelve months from the date of issuance of the financial statements contained in\nthis Annual Report on Form 10-K. The amount and timing of our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including,\nbut not limited to:\n77\n• the scope, progress, results, timing and costs of our current and planned development efforts and regulatory review of our\nproduct candidates;\n• the amount and timing of revenues from sales of XPOVIO, or any product candidate that we develop or acquire;\n• the cost of, and our ability to expand and maintain, the commercial infrastructure required to support the\ncommercialization of XPOVIO and any other product for which we receive marketing approval, including medical affairs,\nmanufacturing, marketing and distribution functions;\n• our ability to establish and maintain collaboration, partnership, licensing, marketing, distribution or other arrangements on\nfavorable terms and the level and timing of success of these arrangements;\n• the extent to which we acquire or in-license other products, product candidates and technologies; and\n• the costs and timing of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications, maintaining and enforcing our intellectual\nproperty rights and defending intellectual property-related claims.\nIn addition, the terms of any financing may adversely affect the holdings or the rights of our stockholders. If we raise additional\nfunds by issuing equity securities, dilution to our existing stockholders will result. In addition, as a condition to providing additional\nfunding to us, future investors may demand, and may be granted, rights superior to those of existing stockholders. Moreover, any debt\nfinancing, if available, may involve restrictive covenants that could limit our flexibility in conducting future business activities and, in\nthe event of insolvency, would be paid before holders of equity securities received any distribution of corporate assets. Our ability to\nsatisfy and meet any future debt service obligations will depend upon our future performance, which will be subject to financial,\nbusiness and other factors affecting our operations, many of which are beyond our control.\nEven if we believe we have sufficient funds for our current or future operating plans, we may seek additional capital due to\nfavorable market conditions or strategic considerations. Any future fundraising efforts could divert our management’s attention away\nfrom their day-to-day activities. Further, adequate additional financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. In\naddition, raising funds in the current economic environment may present additional challenges. For example, any sustained disruption\nin the capital markets from adverse macroeconomic conditions, such as the disruption and uncertainty caused by inflation, sustained\nhigh interest rates and slower economic growth or recession, could negatively impact our ability to raise capital and we cannot predict\nthe extent or duration of such macro-economic disruptions. Moreover, there has been recent turmoil in the global banking system,\nwhich could result in a situation where we lose our deposits, or access to our deposits, and are unable to obtain financing from other\nsources. If adequate funds are not available to us on a timely basis or on attractive terms, we may be required to delay, reduce or\neliminate our research and development programs or any current or future commercialization efforts for one or more of our products\nor product candidates, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and prospects.\nOur Revenue Interest Agreement with HCR, as amended, contains various covenants and other provisions, which, if violated,\ncould result in the acceleration of payments due under such agreement or the foreclosure on the pledged collateral, including all\nof our present and future assets relating to selinexor.\nIn September 2019, we entered into the Revenue Interest Financing Agreement (the “Revenue Interest Agreement”) with\nHealthCare Royalty Partners III, L.P. and HealthCare Royalty Partners IV, L.P. (“HCR”) and which was amended in June 2021 and\nAugust 2023 (the “Amended Revenue Interest Agreement”). Pursuant to the Amended Revenue Interest Agreement, we are required\nto comply with various covenants relating to the conduct of our business and the commercialization of XPOVIO, including obligations\nto use commercially reasonable efforts to commercialize our products. In addition, the Amended Revenue Interest Agreement limits\nour ability to incur or prepay indebtedness, create or incur liens, pay dividends on or repurchase outstanding shares of our capital stock\nor dispose of assets. The Amended Revenue Interest Agreement also includes customary events of default upon the occurrence of\nenumerated events, including non-payment of revenue interests, failure to perform certain covenants and the occurrence of insolvency\nproceedings, specified judgments, specified cross-defaults or specified revocations, or withdrawals or cancellations of regulatory\napproval for XPOVIO. Upon the occurrence of an event of default and in the event of a change of control, HCR may accelerate\npayments due under the Amended Revenue Interest Agreement up to $263.3 million, less the aggregate of all of the payments\npreviously paid to HCR. Upon the occurrence of specified material adverse events or the material breach of specified representations\nand warranties, which will not be considered events of default, HCR may elect to terminate the Amended Revenue Interest Agreement\nand require us to make payments necessary for HCR to receive $135.0 million, less the aggregate of all of the payments made to date,\nplus a specified annual rate of return. In the event that we are unable to make such payment, HCR may be able to foreclose on the\ncollateral that was pledged to HCR, which consists of all of our present and future assets relating to selinexor. Any such foreclosure\nremedy would significantly and adversely affect us and could result in us losing our interest in such assets, which would have an\nadverse material impact on our business.\n78\nOur indebtedness could limit cash flow available for our operations, expose us to risks that could adversely affect our business,\nfinancial condition and results of operations and impair our ability to satisfy our obligations under the Convertible Senior Notes\ndue 2025 (the “Notes”).\nWe incurred $172.5 million of indebtedness as a result of the sale of the Notes, $75.0 million as a result of the initial closing\npursuant to the Revenue Interest Agreement and $60.0 million following the closing of the Amended Revenue Interest Agreement. We\nmay also incur additional indebtedness to meet future financing needs. Our indebtedness could have significant negative consequences\nfor our security holders and our business, results of operations and financial condition by, among other things:\n• increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions;\n• limiting our ability to obtain additional financing;\n• requiring the dedication of a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to service our indebtedness, which\nwould reduce the amount of cash available for other purposes;\n• limiting our flexibility to plan for, or react to, changes in our business;\n• diluting the interests of our existing stockholders as a result of issuing shares of our common stock upon conversion of the\nNotes; and\n• placing us at a possible competitive disadvantage with competitors that are less leveraged than us or have better access to\ncapital.\nOur ability to pay the principal of or interest on the Notes or to make cash payments in connection with any conversion of the\nNotes depends on our future performance, which is subject, in part, to economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our\ncontrol. Our business may not generate cash flow from operations in the future sufficient to service the Notes or other future\nindebtedness and make necessary capital expenditures.\nWe may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to settle conversions of the Notes in cash, to repurchase the Notes for cash\nupon a fundamental change, to pay the redemption price for any Notes we redeem or to refinance the Notes, and any future debt\nwe incur may contain limitations on our ability to pay cash upon conversion or repurchase of the Notes.\nHolders may require us to repurchase their Notes following a fundamental change at a cash repurchase price generally equal to\nthe principal amount of the Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest. In addition, upon conversion, unless we elect to\ndeliver solely shares of our common stock to settle conversions (other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional share), we\nmust satisfy the conversion in cash. If we do not have enough available cash at the time we are required to repurchase the Notes, pay\ncash amounts due upon conversion or redemption of the Notes or refinance the Notes, we may be required to adopt one or more\nalternatives, such as selling assets, restructuring indebtedness or obtaining additional debt financing or equity capital on terms that\nmay be onerous or highly dilutive. Our ability to refinance the Notes or other future indebtedness will depend on the capital markets,\nour financial condition at such time and our obligations under any other existing indebtedness in effect at such time. We may not be\nable to engage in any of these activities on desirable terms, or at all, which could result in a default on our debt obligations, including\nthe Notes. In addition, our ability to repurchase the Notes, to pay cash upon conversion or redemption of the Notes or to refinance the\nNotes may be limited by law, regulatory authority or agreements governing any future indebtedness that we may incur. Our failure to\nrepurchase the Notes at a time when the repurchase is required by the indenture governing the Notes (the “Indenture”) or to pay cash\nupon conversion of the Notes as required by the Indenture would constitute a default under the Indenture. A default under the\nIndenture or the fundamental change itself could also lead to a default under agreements governing our future indebtedness, if any.\nMoreover, the occurrence of a fundamental change under the Indenture could constitute an event of default under any such\nagreements. If the repayment of the related indebtedness were to be accelerated after any applicable notice or grace periods, we may\nnot have sufficient funds to repay the indebtedness and repurchase the Notes or to pay cash upon conversion of the Notes.\nThe conditional conversion feature of the Notes, if triggered, may adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.\nIn the event the conditional conversion feature of the Notes is triggered, holders of Notes will be entitled to convert the Notes at\nany time during specified periods at their option. If one or more holders elect to convert their Notes, unless we elect to satisfy our\nconversion obligation by delivering solely shares of our common stock (other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional\nshare), we would be required to settle a portion or all of our conversion obligation in cash, which could adversely affect our liquidity.\nIn addition, even if holders do not elect to convert their Notes, we could be required under applicable accounting rules to reclassify all\nor a portion of the outstanding principal amount of the Notes as a current rather than long-term liability, which would result in a\nmaterial reduction of our net working capital.\n79\nThe accounting method for convertible debt securities that may be settled in cash, such as the Notes, could have a material effect\non our reported financial results.\nThe Notes may be settled in cash or shares, or a combination of cash and shares. Under the if-converted method, the maximum\npotential dilutive impact of the conversion of the Notes is assumed when calculating diluted earnings per share during periods of net\nincome. This could result in a material impact to diluted earnings per share. Diluted earnings per share is not impacted by the Notes\nduring periods of net loss.\nRaising additional capital may cause dilution to our stockholders, restrict our operations or require us to relinquish rights to our\nproduct candidates.\nUntil such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial revenues from the sale of our products, we expect to finance our cash\nneeds through a combination of equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations, strategic alliances and/or licensing arrangements. We\ndo not have any committed external source of funds. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or\nconvertible debt securities, the ownership interests of stockholders will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include\nliquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of common stockholders. Debt financing, if available, may involve\nagreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making\ncapital expenditures or declaring dividends. For example, during the term of the Amended Revenue Interest Agreement, we cannot\nmake any voluntary or optional cash payment or prepayment on our existing convertible debt and cannot enter into any new debt\nwithout the consent of HCR.\nIf we raise additional funds through further collaborations, strategic alliances or licensing arrangements with third parties, we\nmay have to relinquish valuable rights to our future revenue streams, research programs or product candidates or to grant licenses on\nterms that may not be favorable to us. If we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings when needed, we\nmay be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our research and drug development or current or future commercialization efforts\nor grant rights to develop and market product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves.\nUnstable market and economic conditions may have serious adverse consequences on our business, financial condition and stock\nprice.\nGlobal credit and financial markets have experienced extreme disruptions over the past several years. Such disruptions have\nresulted, and could in the future result, in diminished liquidity and credit availability, declines in consumer confidence, declines in\neconomic growth, increases in unemployment rates and uncertainty about economic stability. Our general business strategy may be\ncompromised by economic downturns, a volatile business environment and unpredictable and unstable market conditions, such as the\ncurrent global situation resulting, in part, from the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine, the war between Israel and Hamas,\ninflation, failures and instability in U.S. and international banking systems, sustained high interest rates and slower economic growth\nor recession. If the equity and credit markets deteriorate, it may make any necessary equity or debt financing more difficult to secure,\nmore costly or more dilutive. Failure to secure any necessary financing in a timely manner and on favorable terms could harm our\ngrowth strategy, financial performance and stock price and could require us to delay or abandon plans with respect to our business,\nincluding clinical development plans. Further, recent developments in the banking industry could adversely affect our business. If the\nfinancial institutions with which we do business enter receivership or become insolvent in the future, there is no guarantee that the\nDepartment of the Treasury, the Federal Reserve and the FDIC will intercede to provide us and other depositors with access to\nbalances in excess of the $250,000 FDIC insurance limit, that we would be able to access our existing cash, cash equivalents and\ninvestments, that we would be able to maintain any required letters of credit or other credit support arrangements, or that we would be\nable to adequately fund our business for a prolonged period of time or at all, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our\nbusiness, financial condition and results of operations. We cannot predict the impact that the high market volatility and instability of\nthe banking sector more broadly could have on economic activity and our business in particular. In addition, there is a risk that one or\nmore of our current service providers, manufacturers or other third parties with which we conduct business may not survive difficult\neconomic times, including the current global situation resulting, in part, from the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine, the\nwar between Israel and Hamas, the instability of the banking sector, and the uncertainty associated with current worldwide economic\nconditions, which could directly affect our ability to attain our operating goals on schedule and on budget.\n80\nRisks Related to Our Dependence on Third Parties\nWe depend on collaborations with third parties for certain aspects of the development, marketing and/or commercialization of\nXPOVIO and/or our product candidates. If those collaborations are not successful, or if we are not able to maintain our existing\ncollaborations or establish additional collaborations, we may have to alter our development and commercialization plans and may\nnot be able to capitalize on the market potential of XPOVIO or our product candidates, if approved.\nOur drug development programs and the commercialization of our products and product candidates, if approved, require local\nexpertise and substantial additional cash to fund expenses. We expect to maintain our existing collaborations and collaborate with\nadditional pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for certain aspects of the development, marketing and/or commercialization\nof our products and product candidates. For example, we are parties to license arrangements with Antengene and Menarini and\ndistribution agreements with Promedico Ltd. and FORUS Therapeutics Inc. for the development, marketing and/or commercialization\nof selinexor in certain geographies outside of the U.S., and we expect to rely on additional partners to develop and commercialize our\nproducts outside of the U.S. In addition, we intend to seek one or more collaborators to aid in the further development, marketing\nand/or commercialization of selinexor and our other compounds for indications both within and outside of oncology. All of the risks\nrelating to product development, regulatory approval and commercialization described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K also apply\nto the activities, including activities in any country or territory outside of the U.S. and EU, as applicable, of our collaborators.\nPotential collaborators include large and mid-size pharmaceutical companies, regional and national pharmaceutical companies\nand biotechnology companies and we face significant competition in seeking appropriate collaborators, including as a result of a\nsignificant number of recent business combinations among large pharmaceutical companies that have reduced the number of potential\ncollaborators. Whether we reach a definitive agreement for a collaboration will depend, among other things, upon the assessment of\nthe potential collaborator’s expertise, its current and expected resources and competing priorities, the terms and conditions of the\nproposed collaboration and the proposed collaborator’s evaluation of a number of factors. Those factors may include the design or\nresults of clinical trials, the likelihood of approval by the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities, the potential market for the product or\nproduct candidate, the costs and complexities of manufacturing and delivering such product or product candidate to patients, the\npotential of competing products, the existence of uncertainty with respect to our ownership of intellectual property, which can exist if\nthere is a challenge to such ownership without regard to the merits of the challenge, and industry and market conditions generally. A\npotential collaborator may also consider alternative product candidates or technologies for similar indications that may be available to\ncollaborate on and whether such a collaboration could be more attractive than the one with us.\nCollaborations are complex and time-consuming to negotiate, document and manage. We may not be able to negotiate\ncollaborations on a timely basis, on acceptable terms, or at all, or we may be restricted under then-existing collaboration agreements\nfrom entering into future agreements on certain terms with potential collaborators. If we are unable to maintain our current\ncollaboration agreements or enter into new collaboration agreements, we may have to curtail, reduce or delay the development or\ncommercialization programs for our products or product candidates, or increase our expenditures and undertake development or\ncommercialization activities at our own expense. If we elect to increase our expenditures to fund and undertake development or\ncommercialization activities on our own, we may need to obtain additional expertise and additional capital, which may not be\navailable to us on acceptable terms, or at all. If we do not have sufficient funds or expertise to undertake the necessary development\nand commercialization activities, we may not be able to further develop our product candidates or bring them to market and generate\nproduct revenue.\nOur ability to generate revenues from these arrangements will depend on our collaborators’ abilities to successfully perform the\nfunctions assigned to them in these arrangements, and our collaboration agreements may not lead to the development or\ncommercialization of our products or product candidates in the most efficient manner, or at all, and may result in lower product\nrevenues or profitability to us than if we were to market and sell these products ourselves. In connection with any such arrangements\nwith third parties, we will likely have limited control over the amount and timing of resources that our collaborators dedicate to the\ndevelopment, marketing and/or commercialization of our products or product candidates. Further, if our collaborations do not result in\nthe successful development and commercialization of our products or product candidates or if any one of our collaborators terminates\nits agreement with us, we may not receive any future milestone or royalty payments under the collaboration. If we do not receive the\nfunding we expect under these agreements, the development and commercialization of our products or product candidates could be\ndelayed and we may need additional resources to develop product candidates.\nCollaborations involving our products and product candidates pose the following risks to us:\n• collaborators have significant discretion in determining the efforts and resources that they will apply to these\ncollaborations;\n• collaborators may not perform their obligations as expected or in compliance with applicable local and national laws and\nregulatory requirements;\n81\n• collaborators may not pursue development, marketing and/or commercialization of our products or product candidates or\nmay elect not to continue or renew development, marketing or commercialization programs based on clinical trial results,\nchanges in the collaborator’s strategic focus or available funding or external factors such as an acquisition that diverts\nresources or creates competing priorities;\n• collaborators may delay clinical trials, provide insufficient funding for a clinical trial program, stop a clinical trial or\nabandon a product candidate, repeat or conduct new clinical trials or require a new formulation of a product candidate for\nclinical testing;\n• collaborators could independently develop, or develop with third parties, products that compete directly or indirectly with\nour products or product candidates if the collaborators believe that competitive products are more likely to be successfully\ndeveloped or can be commercialized under terms that are more economically attractive than ours;\n• a collaborator with marketing and distribution rights to one or more products or product candidates may not commit\nsufficient resources to the marketing and distribution of our products or product candidates;\n• disagreements with collaborators, including disagreements over proprietary rights, contract interpretation or the preferred\ncourse of development or commercialization, might cause delays or termination of the research, development or\ncommercialization of products or product candidates, might lead to additional responsibilities for us with respect to our\nproducts or product candidates, or might result in litigation or arbitration, any of which would be time-consuming and\nexpensive;\n• collaborators may not properly maintain or defend our intellectual property rights or may use our proprietary information\nin such a way as to invite litigation that could jeopardize or invalidate our intellectual property or proprietary information\nor expose us to potential litigation;\n• collaborators may infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties, which may expose us to litigation and potential\nliability;\n• we may lose certain valuable rights under circumstances identified in any collaboration arrangement that we enter into,\nsuch as if we undergo a change of control;\n• collaborations may be terminated and, if terminated, may result in a need for additional capital to pursue further\ndevelopment, marketing and/or commercialization of the applicable products or product candidates or to enter into new\ncollaboration agreements;\n• collaborators may learn about our discoveries and use this knowledge to compete with us in the future; and\n• the number and type of our collaborations could adversely affect our attractiveness to other collaborators or acquirers.\nIf any of these events occurs, the market potential of our products and product candidates, if approved, could be reduced, and\nour business could be materially harmed.\nIf we are unable to establish and maintain our agreements with third parties to distribute XPOVIO to patients, our results of\noperations and business could be adversely affected.\nWe rely on third parties to commercially distribute XPOVIO to patients. For example, we have contracted with a limited\nnumber of specialty pharmacies, which sell XPOVIO directly to patients, and specialty distributors, which sell XPOVIO to healthcare\nentities who then resell XPOVIO to patients. While we have entered into agreements with each of these pharmacies and distributors to\ndistribute XPOVIO in the U.S., they may not perform as agreed or they may terminate their agreements with us. We may also need to\nenter into agreements with additional pharmacies or distributors, and there is no guarantee that we will be able to do so on a timely\nbasis, at commercially reasonable terms, or at all. If we are unable to maintain and, if needed, expand, our network of specialty\npharmacies and specialty distributors, we would be exposed to substantial distribution risk.\nThe use of specialty pharmacies and specialty distributors involves certain risks, including, but not limited to, risks that these\norganizations will:\n• not provide us accurate or timely information regarding their inventories, the number of patients who are using XPOVIO\nor serious adverse reactions, events and/or product complaints regarding XPOVIO;\n• not effectively sell or support XPOVIO or communicate publicly concerning XPOVIO in a manner that is contrary to\nFDA rules and regulations;\n82\n• reduce their efforts or discontinue to sell or support, or otherwise not effectively sell or support, XPOVIO;\n• not devote the resources necessary to sell XPOVIO in the volumes and within the time frames that we expect;\n• be unable to satisfy financial obligations to us or others; or\n• cease operations.\nAny such events may result in decreased product sales, which would harm our results of operations and business.\nWe rely on third parties as we conduct our clinical trials and some aspects of our research and preclinical studies, and those third\nparties may not perform satisfactorily, including failing to meet deadlines for the completion of such trials, research or testing.\nWe rely on third parties, such as CROs, clinical data management organizations, medical institutions and clinical investigators,\nas we conduct our clinical trials. We currently rely and expect to continue to rely on third parties to conduct some aspects of our\nresearch and preclinical studies. Any of these third parties may terminate their engagements with us at any time. If we need to enter\ninto alternative arrangements, it would delay our drug development activities.\nOur reliance on these third parties for research and development activities reduces our control over these activities but does not\nrelieve us of our responsibilities. For example, we remain responsible for ensuring that each of our clinical trials is conducted in\naccordance with the general investigational plan and protocols for the trial. Moreover, the FDA requires us to comply with GCP\nstandards when conducting, recording and reporting the results of clinical trials to ensure that data and reported results are credible\nand accurate and that the rights, integrity and confidentiality of trial participants are protected. The EMA also requires us to comply\nwith comparable standards. Regulatory authorities ensure compliance with these requirements through periodic inspections of trial\nsponsors, principal investigators and trial sites. If we or any of the third parties that we rely on in connection with our clinical trials fail\nto comply with applicable requirements, the clinical data generated in our clinical trials may be deemed unreliable and the FDA, EMA\nor other comparable foreign regulatory authorities may require us to perform additional clinical trials before approving our marketing\napplications. We cannot assure you that upon inspection by a given regulatory authority, such regulatory authority will determine that\nany of our clinical trials comply with such requirements. We also are required to register ongoing clinical trials and post the results of\ncompleted clinical trials on a government-sponsored database, such as ClinicalTrials.gov, within certain timeframes. Failure to do so\ncan result in fines, adverse publicity and civil and criminal sanctions.\nFurthermore, these third parties may also have relationships with other entities, some of which may be our competitors. If these\nthird parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties, meet expected deadlines or conduct our clinical trials in accordance\nwith regulatory requirements or our stated protocols, we will not be able to obtain, or may be delayed in obtaining, marketing\napprovals for our product candidates and will not be able to, or may be delayed in our efforts to, successfully commercialize our\nproducts. In such an event, our financial results and the commercial prospects for our products or product candidates, if approved,\ncould be harmed, our costs could increase and our ability to generate revenues could be delayed, impaired or foreclosed.\nWe also expect to rely on other third parties to store and distribute drug supplies for our clinical trials. Any performance failure\non the part of such third parties could delay clinical development or marketing approval of our product candidates or\ncommercialization of our products, producing additional losses and depriving us of potential product revenue.\nWe rely on third parties to conduct investigator-sponsored clinical trials of selinexor and our other product candidates. Any failure\nby a third party to meet its obligations with respect to the clinical development of our product candidates may delay or impair our\nability to obtain regulatory approval for selinexor and our other product candidates.\nWe rely on academic and private non-academic institutions to conduct and sponsor clinical trials relating to selinexor and our\nother product candidates. We do not solely control the design or conduct of the investigator-sponsored trials, and it is possible that the\nFDA or foreign regulatory authorities will not view these investigator-sponsored trials as providing adequate support for future\nclinical trials, whether controlled by us or third parties, for any one or more reasons, including elements of the design, execution of the\ntrials, safety concerns or other trial results.\nSuch arrangements will provide us certain information rights with respect to the investigator-sponsored trials, such as access to\nand the ability to use and reference the data, including for our own regulatory filings, resulting from the investigator-sponsored trials.\nHowever, we do not have control over the timing and reporting of the data from investigator-sponsored trials, nor do we own the data\nfrom the investigator-sponsored trials. If we are unable to confirm or replicate the results from the investigator-sponsored trials or if\nnegative results are obtained, we would likely be further delayed or prevented from advancing clinical development of our product\ncandidates. Further, if investigators or institutions breach their obligations with respect to the clinical development of our product\ncandidates, or if the data proves to be inadequate compared to the first-hand knowledge we might have gained had the investigator-\n83\nsponsored trials been sponsored and conducted by us, then our ability to design and conduct any future clinical trials ourselves may be\nadversely affected.\nAdditionally, the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities may disagree with the sufficiency of our right to reference the\npreclinical, manufacturing or clinical data generated by these investigator-sponsored trials, or our interpretation of preclinical,\nmanufacturing or clinical data from these investigator-sponsored trials. If so, the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities may require us\nto obtain and submit additional preclinical, manufacturing, or clinical data before we may initiate our planned trials and/or may not\naccept such additional data as adequate to initiate our planned trials.\nWe are completely dependent on third parties for the manufacture of our products and product candidates and any difficulties,\ndisruptions, delays or unexpected costs, or the need to find alternative sources, could adversely affect our results of operations,\nprofitability and future business prospects.\nWe do not own or operate, and currently have no plans to establish, any manufacturing facilities for our products or product\ncandidates. We currently rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third-party contract manufacturers to manufacture our products and\nproduct candidates for our commercial and clinical use.\nFacilities used by our third-party manufacturers may be inspected by the FDA after we submit a marketing application and\nbefore potential approval of the product candidate and are also subject to ongoing periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA for\ncompliance with cGMP and other regulatory requirements following approval. Similar regulations apply to manufacturers of our\nproduct candidates for use or sale in foreign countries. We do not control the manufacturing processes of, and are completely\ndependent on, our third-party manufacturers for compliance with the applicable regulatory requirements for the manufacture of our\nproducts and product candidates. Third-party manufacturers may not be able to comply with cGMP regulations or similar regulatory\nrequirements outside of the U.S. If our manufacturers cannot successfully manufacture material that conforms to our specifications\nand the strict regulatory requirements of the FDA and any applicable foreign regulatory authority, they will not be able to secure\nand/or maintain regulatory approval for their manufacturing facilities. If these facilities are not approved for commercial manufacture\nor are not able to maintain approval, we may need to find alternative manufacturing facilities, which could significantly impact our\nability to develop, obtain regulatory approval for or market our products or product candidates as alternative qualified manufacturing\nfacilities may not be available on a timely or cost-efficient basis, or at all. Failure by any of our manufacturers to comply with\napplicable cGMP regulations or other regulatory requirements could result in sanctions being imposed on us or the contract\nmanufacturer, including fines, injunctions, civil penalties, delays, suspensions or withdrawals of approvals, operating restrictions,\ninterruptions in supply and criminal prosecutions, any of which could significantly and adversely affect supplies of our products or\nproduct candidates and have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe clinical and commercial supplies of the drug product for XPOVIO are currently manufactured pursuant to a combination of\nlong-term supply agreements and as-needed purchase order agreements with our third-party manufacturers. Our ability to have our\nproducts manufactured in sufficient quantities and at acceptable costs to meet our commercial demand and clinical development needs\nis dependent on the uninterrupted and efficient operation of our third-party contract manufacturers’ facilities. Further, through our\nthird-party contract manufacturers and data service providers, we provide serialized commercial products as required to comply with\nthe DSCSA and its foreign equivalents where applicable. If our third-party contract manufacturers or data service providers fail to\nsupport our efforts to continue to serialize, track, trace and authenticate units of our products in compliance with these requirements\nand their and their foreign equivalents, as well as any future requirements, we may face legal penalties or be restricted from selling our\nproducts.\nReliance on third-party manufacturers entails other risks, including:\n• reliance on the third party for regulatory compliance and quality assurance;\n• the possible breach, termination or nonrenewal of a manufacturing agreement by the third party, including at a time that is\ncostly or inconvenient to us;\n• the possible failure of the third party to manufacture our products or product candidates according to our schedule, or at\nall, including if the third-party manufacturer gives greater priority to the supply of other products over our products and\nproduct candidates, or otherwise does not satisfactorily perform according to the terms of the manufacturing agreement;\n• equipment malfunctions, power outages or other general disruptions experienced by our third-party manufacturers to their\nrespective operations and other general problems with a multi-step manufacturing process; and\n• the possible misappropriation or disclosure by the third party or others of our proprietary information, including our trade\nsecrets and know-how.\n84\nWe currently rely on a single source supplier for our active pharmaceutical ingredient and our drug product manufacturing\nrequirements. Any performance failure on the part of our existing or future manufacturers could delay clinical development, marketing\napproval or commercialization of our products or product candidates. If our suppliers or contract manufacturers are so affected, our\nsupply chain could be disrupted, our product shipments could be delayed, our costs could be increased and our business could be\nadversely affected. If our current contract manufacturers cannot perform as agreed, we may be required to replace those\nmanufacturers. Although we believe that there are several potential alternative manufacturers who could manufacture our products and\nproduct candidates, we could incur added costs and delays in identifying and qualifying any such replacement. Consequently, we may\nnot be able to reach agreement with third-party manufacturers on satisfactory terms, which could negatively impact our XPOVIO\nrevenues or delay commercialization of any product candidates that are subsequently approved.\nIf, because of the factors discussed above, we are unable to have our products manufactured on a timely or sufficient basis, we\nmay not be able to meet clinical development needs or commercial demand for our products or product candidates or we may not be\nable to manufacture our products in a cost-effective manner. As a result, we may lose sales, fail to generate projected revenues or\nsuffer development or regulatory setbacks, any of which could have an adverse impact on our profitability and future business\nprospects.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nIf we are unable to obtain and maintain patent protection for our products or product candidates and other discoveries, or if the\nscope of the patent protection obtained is not sufficiently broad, our competitors could develop and commercialize drugs and other\ndiscoveries similar or identical to ours, and our ability to successfully commercialize our products or product candidates and other\ndiscoveries may be adversely affected.\nOur success depends in large part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent protection in the U.S. and other countries with\nrespect to our proprietary products and product candidates and other discoveries. We seek to protect our proprietary position by filing\npatent applications in the U.S. and abroad related to our novel products and product candidates and other discoveries that are\nimportant to our business. As of February 23, 2024, 165 patents were in force that relate to exportin 1 inhibitors, including\ncomposition of matter patents for selinexor, verdinexor and eltanexor in the U.S., and their use in targeted therapeutics. In addition, 32\npatents were in force that relate to our PAK4/NAMPT inhibitors, including three composition of matter patents for KPT-9274 in the\nU.S. and its use in targeted therapeutics. With respect to our KPT-1200 program, as of February 23, 2024, 12 patents were in force\nthat relate to IL-12 compositions and uses of IL-12 in targeted therapeutics. We cannot be certain that any other patents will issue with\nclaims that cover any of our key products, product candidates or other discoveries.\nThe patent prosecution process is expensive and time-consuming, and we may not be able to file and prosecute all necessary or\ndesirable patent applications at a reasonable cost or in a timely manner. It is also possible that we will fail to identify patentable\naspects of our research and development output before it is too late to obtain patent protection.\nThe patent position of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies generally is highly uncertain, involves complex legal and\nfactual questions and has in recent years been the subject of much litigation. As a result, the issuance, scope, validity, enforceability\nand commercial value of our patent rights are highly uncertain. Our pending and future patent applications may not result in patents\nbeing issued which protect our product candidates or other discoveries, or which effectively prevent others from commercializing\ncompetitive drugs and discoveries. Changes in either the patent laws or interpretation of the patent laws in the U.S. and other countries\nmay diminish the value of our patents or narrow the scope of our patent protection.\nThe laws of foreign countries may not protect our rights to the same extent as the laws of the U.S. For example, in some foreign\njurisdictions, our ability to secure patents based on our filings in the U.S. may depend, in part, on our ability to timely obtain\nassignment of rights to the invention from the employees and consultants who invented the technology. Publications of discoveries in\nthe scientific literature often lag behind the actual discoveries, and patent applications in the U.S. and other jurisdictions are typically\nnot published until 18 months after filing, or in some cases not at all. Therefore, we cannot be certain that we were the first to make\nthe inventions claimed in our patents or pending patent applications, or that we were the first to file for patent protection of such\ninventions.\nAssuming the other requirements for patentability are met, prior to March 2013, in the U.S., the first to invent the claimed\ninvention was entitled to the patent, while outside of the U.S., the first to file a patent application is entitled to the patent. In March\n2013, the U.S. transitioned to a first-inventor-to-file system in which, assuming the other requirements for patentability are met, the\nfirst inventor to file a patent application is entitled to the patent. We may be subject to a third-party preissuance submission of prior art\nto the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (“USPTO”) or become involved in opposition, derivation, revocation, reexamination, or post-\ngrant or inter partes review or interference proceedings challenging our patent rights or the patent rights of others. An adverse\ndetermination in any such submission, proceeding or litigation could reduce the scope of, or invalidate, our patent rights, allow third\n85\nparties to commercialize our discoveries or drugs and compete directly with us, without payment to us, or result in our inability to\nmanufacture or commercialize drugs without infringing third-party patent rights.\nEven if our patent applications issue as patents, they may not issue in a form that will provide us with any meaningful\nprotection, prevent competitors from competing with us or otherwise provide us with any competitive advantage. Our competitors\nmay be able to circumvent our patents by developing similar or alternative discoveries or drugs in a non-infringing manner.\nThe issuance of a patent is not conclusive as to its inventorship, scope, validity or enforceability, and our patents may be\nchallenged in the courts or patent offices in the U.S. and abroad. Such challenges may result in loss of exclusivity or in patent claims\nbeing narrowed, invalidated or held unenforceable, which could limit our ability to stop others from using or commercializing similar\nor identical discoveries and drugs, or limit the duration of the patent protection of our products, product candidates and discoveries.\nGiven the amount of time required for the development, testing and regulatory review of new product candidates, patents protecting\nsuch candidates might expire before or shortly after such candidates are commercialized. As a result, our patent portfolio may not\nprovide us with sufficient rights to exclude others from commercializing drugs similar or identical to ours.\nWe may become involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents and other intellectual property rights, which could be\nexpensive, time-consuming and unsuccessful.\nCompetitors or commercial supply companies or others may infringe our patents and other intellectual property rights. For\nexample, we are aware of third parties selling a version of our lead product candidate for research purposes, which may infringe our\nintellectual property rights. To counter such infringement, we may advise such companies of our intellectual property rights,\nincluding, in some cases, intellectual property rights that provide protection for our lead product candidates, and demand that they stop\ninfringing those rights. Such demand may provide such companies the opportunity to challenge the validity of certain of our\nintellectual property rights, or the opportunity to seek a finding that their activities do not infringe our intellectual property rights. We\nmay also be required to file infringement actions, which can be expensive and time-consuming. In an infringement proceeding, a\ndefendant may assert and a court may agree with a defendant that a patent of ours is invalid or unenforceable, or may refuse to stop the\nother party from using the intellectual property at issue. An adverse result in any litigation could put one or more of our patents at risk\nof being invalidated or interpreted narrowly. Furthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with\nintellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during\nthis type of litigation.\nThird parties may initiate legal proceedings alleging that we are infringing their intellectual property rights, the outcome of which\nwould be uncertain and could have a material adverse effect on the success of our business.\nOur commercial success depends upon our ability and the ability of any current and future collaborators to develop,\nmanufacture, market and sell XPOVIO and our product candidates and use our proprietary technologies without infringing the\nproprietary rights of third parties. We may become party to, or threatened with, future adversarial proceedings or litigation regarding\nintellectual property rights with respect to our products or product candidates and technology, including interference proceedings\nbefore the USPTO. Third parties may assert infringement claims against us based on existing patents or patents that may be granted in\nthe future. No litigation asserting such infringement claims is currently pending against us, and we have not been found by a court of\ncompetent jurisdiction to have infringed a third party’s intellectual property rights. If we are found to infringe or think there is a risk\nwe may be found to infringe, a third party’s intellectual property rights, we could be required or choose to obtain a license from such\nthird party to continue developing, marketing and selling our products, product candidates and technology. However, we may not be\nable to obtain any required license on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Even if we were able to obtain a license, it could be\nnon-exclusive, thereby giving our competitors access to the same intellectual property licensed to us. We could be forced, including by\ncourt order, to cease commercializing the infringing intellectual property or product or to cease using the infringing technology. In\naddition, we could be found liable for monetary damages. A finding of infringement could prevent us from commercializing our\nproducts or product candidates or force us to cease some of our business operations, which could materially harm our business. Claims\nthat we have misappropriated the confidential information or trade secrets of third parties could have a similar negative impact on our\nbusiness.\nWe may be subject to claims that our employees have wrongfully used or disclosed alleged trade secrets of their former employers.\nMany of our employees were previously employed at universities or other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies,\nincluding our competitors or potential competitors. Although we try to ensure that our employees do not use the proprietary\ninformation or know-how of others in their work for us, we may be subject to claims that we or these employees have used or\ndisclosed intellectual property, including trade secrets or other proprietary information, of any such employee’s former employer.\nAlthough we have no knowledge of any such claims being alleged to date, if such claims were to arise, litigation may be necessary to\n86\ndefend against any such claims. If we fail in defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose\nvaluable intellectual property rights or personnel. Even if we are successful in defending against such claims, litigation could result in\nsubstantial costs and be a distraction to management.\nIntellectual property litigation could cause us to spend substantial resources and distract our personnel from their normal\nresponsibilities.\nEven if resolved in our favor, litigation or other legal proceedings relating to intellectual property claims may cause us to incur\nsignificant expenses and could distract our technical and management personnel from their normal responsibilities. In addition, there\ncould be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments and if securities\nanalysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a material adverse effect on the price of our common stock.\nSuch litigation or proceedings could substantially increase our operating losses and reduce the resources available for development\nactivities or any future sales, marketing or distribution activities. We may not have sufficient financial or other resources to adequately\nconduct such litigation or proceedings. Some of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of such litigation or proceedings\nmore effectively than we can because of their greater financial resources. Uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation\nof patent litigation or other proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete in the marketplace.\nObtaining and maintaining our patent protection depends on compliance with various procedural, documentary, fee payment and\nother requirements imposed by governmental patent agencies, and our patent protection could be reduced or eliminated for non-\ncompliance with these requirements.\nPeriodic maintenance fees, renewal fees, annuity fees and various other governmental fees on patents and/or applications will be\ndue to the USPTO and various foreign patent offices at various points over the lifetime of the patents and/or applications. We have\nsystems in place to remind us to pay these fees, and we rely on our outside counsel to pay these fees when due. Additionally, the\nUSPTO and various foreign patent offices require compliance with a number of procedural, documentary, fee payment and other\nsimilar provisions during the patent application process. We employ reputable law firms and other professionals to help us comply\nwith such provisions, and in many cases, an inadvertent lapse can be cured by payment of a late fee or by other means in accordance\nwith rules applicable to the particular jurisdiction. However, there are situations in which non-compliance can result in abandonment\nor lapse of the patent or patent application, resulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction. If such an\nevent were to occur, it could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIf our product candidates or any of our future product candidates obtain regulatory approval, additional competitors could enter\nthe market with generic versions of such products, which may result in a material decline in sales of our competing products.\nUnder the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 (the “Hatch-Waxman Amendments”) to the FDCA,\na company may file an ANDA, seeking approval of a generic version of an approved innovator product. Under the Hatch-Waxman\nAmendments, a company may also submit an NDA under section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA that references the FDA’s prior approval of\nthe innovator product or preclinical studies and/or clinical trials that were not conducted by, or for, the sponsor and for which the\nsponsor has not obtained a right of reference. A 505(b)(2) NDA product may be for a new or improved version of the original\ninnovator product. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments also provide for certain periods of regulatory exclusivity, which preclude FDA\napproval (or in some circumstances, FDA filing and review) of an ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA.\nIn certain circumstances, third parties may file an ANDA or NDA under Section 505(b)(2) as early as the so-called “NCE-1”\ndate that is one year before the expiry of the five-year period of New Chemical Entity exclusivity or more generally four years after\nNDA approval. The third parties are allowed to rely on the safety and effectiveness data of the innovator’s product, may not need to\nconduct clinical trials and can market a competing version of a product after the expiration or loss of patent exclusivity or the\nexpiration or loss of regulatory exclusivity and often charge significantly lower prices. Upon the expiration or loss of patent protection\nor the expiration or loss of regulatory exclusivity for a product, the major portion of revenues for that product may be dramatically\nreduced in a very short period of time. If we are not successful in defending our patents and regulatory exclusivities, we will not\nderive the expected benefit from them. For example, the NCE-1 date for selinexor was July 3, 2023 after which a third party could be\npositioned to market an ANDA or Section 505(b)(2) product that competes with selinexor prior to the expiry of our patents if the third\nparty successfully challenged the validity of our patents protecting the product.\nIn addition to the benefits of regulatory exclusivity, an innovator NDA holder may have patents claiming the active ingredient,\nproduct formulation or an approved use of the drug, which would be listed with the product in the FDA publication “Approved Drug\nProducts with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations,” known as the Orange Book. If there are patents listed in the Orange Book for the\napplicable, approved innovator product, a generic or 505(b)(2) sponsor that seeks to market its product before expiration of the patents\nmust include in their applications what is known as a “Paragraph IV” certification, challenging the validity or enforceability, or\n87\nclaiming non-infringement, of the listed patent or patents. Notice of the certification must be given to the patent owner and NDA\nholder and if, within 45 days of receiving notice, either the patent owner or NDA holder sues for patent infringement, approval of the\nANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA is stayed for up to 30 months.\nAccordingly, if any of our product candidates that are regulated as drugs are approved, competitors could file ANDAs for\ngeneric versions of these products or 505(b)(2) NDAs that reference our products. If there are patents listed for such drug products in\nthe Orange Book, those ANDAs and 505(b)(2) NDAs would be required to include a certification as to each listed patent indicating\nwhether the ANDA sponsor does or does not intend to challenge the patent. We cannot predict which, if any, patents in our current\nportfolio or patents we may obtain in the future will be eligible for listing in the Orange Book, how any generic competitor would\naddress such patents, whether we would sue on any such patents or the outcome of any such suit.\nIf we do not successfully extend the term of patents covering our product candidates under the Hatch-Waxman Amendments and\nsimilar foreign legislation, our business may be materially harmed.\nDepending upon the timing, duration and conditions of FDA marketing approval, if any, of our products or product candidates,\none or more of our U.S. patents may be eligible for patent term extension under the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. The Hatch-\nWaxman Amendments permit a patent term extension of up to five years for one patent covering an approved product as\ncompensation for effective patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. However, we may\nnot receive an extension if we fail to apply within applicable deadlines, fail to apply prior to expiration of relevant patents or otherwise\nfail to satisfy applicable requirements. Moreover, the length of the extension could be less than we request. The total patent term,\nincluding the extension period, may not exceed 14 years following FDA approval. Accordingly, the length of the extension, or the\nability to even obtain an extension, depends on many factors.\nIn the U.S., only a single patent can be extended for each qualifying FDA approval, and any patent can be extended only once\nand only for a single product. Laws governing analogous patent term extensions in foreign jurisdictions vary widely, as do laws\ngoverning the ability to obtain multiple patents from a single patent family. Because both selinexor and verdinexor are protected by a\nsingle family of patents and applications, we may not be able to secure patent term extensions for both of these product candidates in\nall jurisdictions where these product candidates are approved.\nIf we are unable to obtain a patent term extension for a product or product candidate or the term of any such extension is less\nthan we request, the period during which we can enforce our patent rights for that product or product candidate, if any, in that\njurisdiction will be shortened and our competitors may obtain approval to market competing products sooner. As a result, our revenue\ncould be materially reduced.\nIf we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our trade secrets, our business and competitive position would be harmed.\nIn addition to seeking patents for our products, product candidates and other discoveries, we also rely on trade secrets, including\nunpatented know-how, technology and other proprietary information, to maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect these\ntrade secrets, in part, by entering into non-disclosure and confidentiality agreements with parties who have access to them, such as our\nemployees, outside scientific collaborators, CROs, contract manufacturers, consultants, advisors and other third parties. We also enter\ninto confidentiality and invention or patent assignment agreements with our employees and consultants. Despite these efforts, any of\nthese parties may breach the agreements and disclose our proprietary information, including our trade secrets, and we may not be able\nto obtain adequate remedies for such breaches. To the extent that we are unable to timely enter into confidentiality and invention or\npatent assignment agreements with our employees and consultants, our ability to protect our business through trade secrets and patents\nmay be harmed. Enforcing a claim that a party illegally disclosed or misappropriated a trade secret is difficult, expensive and time-\nconsuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, some courts inside and outside of the U.S. are less willing or unwilling to\nprotect trade secrets. If any of our trade secrets were to be lawfully obtained or independently developed by a competitor, we would\nhave no right to prevent them from using that technology or information to compete with us. If any of our trade secrets were to be\ndisclosed to or independently developed by a competitor, our competitive position would be harmed. To the extent inventions are\nmade by a third party under an agreement that does not grant us an assignment of their rights in inventions, we may choose or be\nrequired to obtain a license.\nNot all of our trademarks are registered. Failure to secure those registrations could adversely affect our business.\nAs of February 23, 2024, we have trademark registrations in the U.S. for KARYOPHARM THERAPEUTICS, our color logo,\nand a combination of the two, XPOVIO, PORE for our online research portal, and KARYFORWARD and our KARYFORWARD\nlogo for our financial aid and charitable services. We also have pending applications in the U.S. to register KARYOPHARM alone,\nand our logo in greyscale, for pharmaceuticals. Outside of the U.S., XPOVIO is registered or pending in 46 additional jurisdictions,\n88\nand is registered in Katakana in Japan, Hangul in South Korea, and Chinese characters in Taiwan. KARYOPHARM, the greyscale\nlogo, KARYOPHARM THERAPEUTICS with the color logo, and the KARYFORWARD logo are each registered or pending in four\njurisdictions outside of the U.S. We also have registrations or applications for eight additional possible drug names in numerous\nforeign jurisdictions. If we do not secure registrations for our trademarks, we may encounter more difficulty in enforcing them against\nthird parties than we otherwise would, which could adversely affect our business. During trademark registration proceedings in the\nU.S. and foreign jurisdictions, we may receive rejections. We are given an opportunity to respond to those rejections, but we may not\nbe able to overcome such rejections. In addition, in the USPTO and in comparable agencies in many foreign jurisdictions, third parties\nare given an opportunity to oppose pending trademark applications and to seek to cancel registered trademarks. Opposition or\ncancellation proceedings may be filed against our trademarks, and our trademarks may not survive such proceedings.\nIn addition, any proprietary name we propose to use with our key product candidates in the U.S. must be approved by the FDA,\nregardless of whether we have registered it, or applied to register it, as a trademark. The FDA typically conducts a review of proposed\ndrug names, including an evaluation of potential for confusion with other drug names. If the FDA objects to any of our proposed\nproprietary drug names for any of our product candidates, if approved, we may be required to expend significant additional resources\nin an effort to identify a suitable proprietary drug name that would qualify under applicable trademark laws, not infringe the existing\nrights of third parties and be acceptable to the FDA.\nRisks Related to Our Operations and Employee Matters\nOur future success depends on our ability to retain key members of our management team and to attract, retain and motivate\nqualified personnel.\nWe are highly dependent on the management, technical and scientific expertise of principal members of our management and\nscientific teams, including our President and Chief Executive Officer. Although we have entered into formal employment agreements\nwith our executive officers, these agreements do not prevent them from terminating their employment with us at any time. We do not\nmaintain “key person” insurance for any of our executives or other employees. The loss of the services of any of our key employees\ncould impede the achievement of our research, development, commercialization and other business objectives.\nRecruiting and retaining qualified scientific, clinical, manufacturing and sales and marketing personnel is critical to our success.\nWe may not be able to attract and retain these personnel on acceptable terms given the competition among numerous pharmaceutical\nand biotechnology companies for similar personnel. We also experience competition for the hiring of scientific and clinical personnel\nfrom universities and research institutions. In addition, we rely on consultants and advisors, including scientific and clinical advisors,\nto assist us in formulating our research and development and commercialization strategies. Our consultants and advisors may be\nemployed by employers other than us and may have commitments under consulting or advisory contracts with other entities that may\nlimit their availability to us.\nOur business and operations may be materially adversely affected in the event of information technology system failures or\nsecurity breaches, and the costs and consequences of implementing data protection measures could be significant.\nDespite the implementation of security measures, our internal computer systems, and those of our CROs and other third parties\non which we rely, are vulnerable to damage or other impacts from cyber-attacks, computer viruses, unauthorized access, sabotage,\nnatural disasters, fire, terrorism, war and telecommunication and electrical failures. Such systems are also vulnerable to service\ninterruptions or to security breaches from inadvertent or intentional actions by our employees, third-party vendors and/or business\npartners, or from cyber incidents initiated by malicious third parties. Cyber incidents are increasing in their frequency, sophistication\nand intensity, and have become increasingly difficult to detect, respond to and recover from. Cyber incidents could include the\ndeployment of harmful malware, ransomware, denial-of-service attacks, unauthorized access to or deletion of files, social engineering\nand other means to affect service reliability and threaten the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information. Cyber incidents\nalso could include phishing attempts or e-mail fraud to cause payments or information to be transmitted to an unintended recipient.\nWe could be subject to risks caused by misappropriation, misuse, leakage, falsification or intentional or accidental release or loss of\ninformation maintained in the information systems and networks of our company, including personal data of our employees. In\naddition, outside parties may attempt to penetrate our systems or those of our vendors or fraudulently induce our employees or\nemployees of our vendors to disclose sensitive information to gain access to our data. Like other companies, we may experience\nthreats to our data and systems, including malicious codes and viruses, and other cyber-attacks. In addition, we face other kinds of\nrisks related to our commercial and personal data, including lost or stolen devices or other systems (including paper records) that\ncollect and store our personal and commercial information. Furthermore, our manufacturing vendors could also be subject to a cyber-\nattack that could negatively impact the manufacturing process of our products and/or product candidates, which could, in turn, harm\nour patients, result in a product recall, or provide uncertain medical or trial results.\n89\nWe are aware of certain vendors who have been impacted by cyber-attacks, inclusive of but not limited to ransomware,\nphishing, and spam. While such events have not directly impacted us, similar events in the future could have a material impact on us.\nIf a cyber-attack or other security incident were to occur and cause interruptions in our operations, it could result in a material\ndisruption of our development and commercialization programs and our business operations, whether due to a loss of our trade secrets\nor other proprietary information or other similar disruptions, in addition to possibly requiring substantial expenditures of resources to\nremedy. For example, the loss of clinical trial data from completed, ongoing or planned clinical trials could result in delays in our\nregulatory approval efforts and significantly increase our costs to recover or reproduce the data. To the extent that any disruption or\nsecurity breach were to result in a loss of, or damage to, our data or applications, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or\nproprietary information, we could incur liability, our reputation or competitive position could be damaged, and the further\ndevelopment and commercialization of our products or product candidates could be delayed or halted. We may not have adequate\ninsurance coverage to provide compensation for any losses associated with such events. In addition, we may in certain instances be\nrequired to provide notification to individuals or others in connection with the loss of their personal or commercial information.\nIf a material breach of our security or that of our vendors occurs, our financial or other confidential information could be\ncompromised, the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed, we could lose business, our\nreputation and credibility could be damaged and we could be subject to legal proceedings. In addition, the cost and operational\nconsequences of implementing further data protection measures could be significant. We could be required to expend significant\namounts of money and other resources to repair or replace information systems or networks. The development and maintenance of\nthese systems, controls and processes is costly and requires ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts to\novercome security measures become more sophisticated. Moreover, despite our efforts, the possibility of these events occurring\ncannot be eliminated entirely.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nOur stock price has in the past and may in the future fail to meet minimum requirements for continued listing on the Nasdaq\nGlobal Select Market. Our ability to publicly or privately sell equity securities and the liquidity of our common stock could be\nadversely affected if we are delisted from the Nasdaq Global Select Market or if we are unable to transfer our listing to another\nstock market.\nIn the past, we have received written notification from the Nasdaq Stock Market (“Nasdaq”) informing us that we were not in\ncompliance with certain continued listing requirements of the Nasdaq Global Select Market. As previously disclosed, on December 6,\n2023, we received a deficiency letter from the Listing Qualifications Department (the “Staff”) notifying us that, for the prior 30\nconsecutive business days, the bid price of our common stock had closed below the minimum $1.00 per share requirement for\ncontinued inclusion on the Nasdaq Global Select Market pursuant to Nasdaq Listing Rule 5450(a)(1) (the “Bid Price Rule”). On\nFebruary 16, 2024, we received a letter from the Staff notifying us that we regained compliance with the Bid Price Rule for continued\ninclusion on the Nasdaq Global Select Market. To regain compliance with the Bid Price Rule, our common stock was required to\nmaintain a closing bid price of $1.00 per share or more for at least 10 consecutive business days. This requirement was met on\nFebruary 15, 2024.\nThere can be no assurances that we will continue to maintain compliance with the requirements for listing our common stock on\nNasdaq. Any potential delisting of our common stock from the Nasdaq Global Select Market would likely result in decreased liquidity\nand increased volatility for our common stock and would adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital or to enter into\nstrategic transactions. Any potential delisting of our common stock from the Nasdaq Global Select Market would make it more\ndifficult for our stockholders to sell our common stock in the public market.\nProvisions in our corporate charter documents and under Delaware law could make an acquisition of us, which may be beneficial\nto our stockholders, more difficult and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management.\nProvisions in our corporate charter and our bylaws may discourage, delay or prevent a merger, acquisition or other change in\ncontrol of us that stockholders may consider favorable, including transactions in which stockholders might otherwise receive a\npremium for their shares. These provisions could also limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of\nour common stock, thereby depressing the market price of our common stock. In addition, because our board of directors is\nresponsible for appointing the members of our management team, these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our\nstockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our\nboard of directors. Among other things, these provisions:\n• establish a classified board of directors such that not all members of the board are elected at one time;\n• allow the authorized number of our directors to be changed only by resolution of our board of directors;\n90\n• limit the manner in which stockholders can remove directors from the board;\n• establish advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals that can be acted on at stockholder meetings and\nnominations to our board of directors;\n• require that stockholder actions must be effected at a duly called stockholder meeting and prohibit actions by our\nstockholders by written consent;\n• limit who may call stockholder meetings;\n• authorize our board of directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval, which could be used to institute a\n“poison pill” that would work to dilute the stock ownership of a potential hostile acquirer, effectively preventing\nacquisitions that have not been approved by our board of directors; and\n• require the approval of the holders of at least 75% of the votes that all our stockholders would be entitled to cast to amend\nor repeal certain provisions of our charter or bylaws.\nMoreover, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General\nCorporation Law, which prohibits a person who owns in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock from merging or combining\nwith us for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person acquired in excess of 15% of our outstanding\nvoting stock, unless the merger or combination is approved in a prescribed manner.\nThe price of our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile and your investment in our stock could decline in value\nor fluctuate significantly, including as a result of analysts’ activities.\nOur stock price has been, and may continue to be, volatile and your investment in our stock could decline or fluctuate\nsignificantly. Our common stock price has ranged from $0.62 to $4.87 in the 52-week period ended February 23, 2024. On February\n23, 2024, the closing sale price of our common stock on the Nasdaq Global Select Market was $1.24 per share. The stock market in\ngeneral and the market for pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies in particular have experienced extreme volatility that has\noften been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies, such as the response to world-wide economic disruptions\nrelated to the COVID-19 pandemic, the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, the war between Israel and Hamas, inflation and\nsustained high interest rates. The market price for our common stock may be influenced by many factors, including:\n• our failure to successfully execute on our commercialization strategy for XPOVIO or our product candidates, if approved;\n• the level of success of competitive products or technologies;\n• results, delays in, or the halting of our clinical trials or those of our competitors, including reports of AEs related to the\nuse of our products;\n• announcements by us or our competitors of new products or data, significant mergers, acquisitions, licenses or joint\nventures;\n• commencement or termination of collaborations for our development programs and the commercialization of our\nproducts;\n• adverse regulatory or legal developments in the U.S. and other countries;\n• developments or disputes concerning patent applications, issued patents or other proprietary rights;\n• additions or departures of key personnel;\n• the level of expenses related to the commercialization of XPOVIO and clinical development programs for any of our\nproduct candidates;\n• the results of our efforts to discover, develop, acquire or in-license additional products or product candidates;\n• actual or anticipated changes in estimates of financial results or guidance, clinical development timelines or\nrecommendations by securities analysts;\n• actual or anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly or annual financial results;\n• changes in healthcare laws affecting pricing, reimbursement or access;\n• market conditions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology sectors, including as the result of uncertainties due to or\nimpacts from pandemics or other public health emergencies;\n91\n• general economic, industry and market conditions, such as those caused by the ongoing conflict between Russia and\nUkraine, the war between Israel and Hamas, inflation and fluctuations in interest rates;\n• our ability to raise additional capital and/or refinance our debt and the terms on which we can raise capital and/or\nrefinance debt;\n• sales of large blocks of our common stock, including by our executive officers, directors and significant stockholders, or\nsubstantial changes in short interest in our common stock; and\n• the other risks and uncertainties described in this “Risk Factors” section.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic caused significant disruptions in the financial markets and also impacted the volatility of our stock\nprice and trading in our stock. In addition, U.S. and global markets are experiencing volatility and disruption following the escalation\nof geopolitical tensions and the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine, the war between Israel and Hamas, inflation and\nsustained high interest rates. A continuation or worsening of the levels of market disruption and volatility could have an adverse effect\non the market price of our common stock. Furthermore, the trading market for our common stock relies, in part, on the research and\nreports that industry or financial analysts publish about us or our business. Our stock price could decline significantly if we fail to\nmeet or exceed analysts’ forecasts and expectations or if one or more of the analysts covering our business downgrade their\nevaluations of our stock. Further, if one or more of these analysts cease to cover our stock, we could lose visibility in the market for\nour stock, which in turn could cause our stock price to decline.\nSecurities or other litigation could result in substantial costs and may divert management’s time and attention from our business.\nSecurities class action litigation is often brought against a company following a decline or periods of volatility in the market\nprice of its securities. This risk is especially relevant for us because pharmaceutical companies have experienced significant stock\nprice volatility in recent years, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and we are therefore a target of this type of litigation.\nFor example, we were subject to a class action lawsuit and a shareholder derivative lawsuit alleging federal securities laws violations,\nboth of which have been dismissed. We may face additional securities class action litigation or other litigation in the future, including\nif we fail to successfully commercialize XPOVIO, or if we cannot obtain regulatory approvals for, or if we otherwise fail to\nsuccessfully commercialize and launch, our product candidates.\nThe outcome of litigation is necessarily uncertain, and we could be forced to expend significant resources in the defense of such\nsuits, and we may not prevail. Monitoring and defending against legal actions is time-consuming for our management and detracts\nfrom our ability to fully focus our internal resources on our business activities. In addition, we may incur substantial legal fees and\ncosts in connection with any such litigation. We have not established any reserves for any potential liability relating to any such\npotential lawsuits. It is possible that we could, in the future, incur judgments or enter into settlements of claims for monetary damages.\nWe currently maintain insurance coverage for some of these potential liabilities. Other potential liabilities may not be covered by\ninsurance, insurers may dispute coverage or the amount of insurance may not be enough to cover damages awarded. In addition,\ncertain types of damages may not be covered by insurance, and insurance coverage for all or certain forms of liability may become\nunavailable or prohibitively expensive in the future. A decision adverse to our interests on one or more legal matters or litigation could\nresult in the payment of substantial damages, or possibly fines, and could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, financial\ncondition and results of operations.\nWe have broad discretion in the use of our cash, cash equivalents and investments and may not use them effectively.\nOur management has broad discretion to use our cash, cash equivalents and investments to fund our operations and could spend\nthese funds in ways that do not improve our results of operations or enhance the value of our common stock. The failure by our\nmanagement to apply these funds effectively could result in financial losses that could have a material adverse effect on our business,\ncause the price of our common stock to decline and delay the development of our product candidates. Pending their use to fund our\noperations, we may invest our cash and cash equivalents in a manner that does not produce income or that loses value.\nIf we identify a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, it could have an adverse effect on our business\nand financial results and our ability to meet our reporting obligations could be negatively affected, each of which could negatively\naffect the trading price of our common stock.\nA material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there\nis a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected\non a timely basis. Accordingly, a material weakness increases the risk that the financial information we report contains material errors.\n92\nWe regularly review and update our internal controls, disclosure controls and procedures, and corporate governance policies. In\naddition, we are required under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 to report annually on our internal control over financial reporting.\nAny system of internal controls, however well designed and operated, is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only\nreasonable, not absolute, assurances that the objectives of the system are met. If we, or our independent registered public accounting\nfirm, determine that our internal control over our financial reporting is not effective, or we discover areas that need improvement in\nthe future, or we experience high turnover of our personnel in our financial reporting functions, these shortcomings could have an\nadverse effect on our business and financial results, and the price of our common stock could be negatively affected.\nIf we cannot conclude that we have effective internal control over our financial reporting, or if our independent registered public\naccounting firm is unable to provide an unqualified opinion regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting,\ninvestors could lose confidence in the reliability of our financial statements, which could lead to a decline in our stock price. Failure to\ncomply with reporting requirements could also subject us to sanctions and/or investigations by the SEC, the Nasdaq Stock Market or\nother regulatory authorities.\nIf the estimates we make, or the assumptions on which we rely, in preparing our consolidated financial statements, our projected\nguidance and/or our projected market opportunities prove inaccurate, our actual results may vary from those reflected in our\nprojections and accruals.\nOur consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the\nUnited States of America (“GAAP”). The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and\njudgments that affect the reported amounts of our assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, the amounts of charges accrued by us and\nrelated disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions\nthat we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances.\nWe cannot assure you, however, that our estimates, or the assumptions underlying them, will be correct. Further, from time to\ntime we issue guidance on our expected financial performance for future periods, such as our expectations regarding our revenue, non-\nGAAP research and development and selling, general and administrative expenses, and cash, cash equivalents and investments\navailable for operations, which guidance is based on estimates and the judgment of management. If, for any reason, our actual results\ndiffer materially from our guidance, we may have to adjust our publicly announced financial guidance. If we fail to meet, or if we are\nrequired to change or update any element of, our publicly disclosed financial guidance or other expectations about our business, our\nstock price could decline.\nFurther our estimates of the potential market opportunities for XPOVIO and our product candidates include several key\nassumptions based on our industry knowledge, industry publications, third-party research and other surveys, which may be based on a\nsmall sample size and fail to accurately reflect market opportunities. While we believe that our internal assumptions are reasonable,\nthese assumptions involve the exercise of significant judgment on the part of our management, are inherently uncertain and the\nreasonableness of these assumptions has not been assessed by an independent source. If any of our assumptions or estimates, or these\npublications, research, surveys or studies prove to be inaccurate, then the actual market for XPOVIO or any other products or product\ncandidates may be smaller than we expect, and as a result our product revenue may be limited and it may be more difficult for us to\nachieve profitability.\nOur ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards to offset future taxable income may be subject\nto certain limitations.\nUnder the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), our net operating loss and tax credit\ncarryforwards are subject to review and possible adjustment by the Internal Revenue Service (and state tax authorities under relevant\nstate tax rules). In addition, as described below in “Changes in tax laws or in their implementation or interpretation may adversely\naffect our business and financial condition,” the TCJA, as amended by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (the\n“CARES Act”), includes changes to U.S. federal tax rates and the rules governing net operating loss carryforwards that may\nsignificantly impact our ability to utilize our net operating losses to offset taxable income in the future. Furthermore, the use of net\noperating loss and tax credit carryforwards may become subject to an annual limitation under Sections 382 and 383 of the Code,\nrespectively, and similar state provisions in the event of certain cumulative changes in the ownership interest of significant\nstockholders in excess of 50 percent over a three-year period. This could limit the amount of tax attributes that can be utilized annually\nto offset future taxable income or tax liabilities. The amount of the annual limitation is determined based on the value of a company\nimmediately prior to the ownership change. Subsequent ownership changes may further affect the limitation in future years. Our\ncompany has completed several financings since its inception which resulted in an ownership change under Sections 382 and 383 of\nthe Code. In addition, future changes in our stock ownership, some of which are outside of our control, could result in ownership\n93\nchanges in the future. For these reasons, we may not be able to use some or all of our net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards,\neven if we attain profitability.\nChanges in tax laws or in their implementation or interpretation may adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nChanges in tax law may adversely affect our business or financial condition. The TCJA, as amended by the CARES Act,\nsignificantly revises the Code. The TCJA, among other things, contains significant changes to corporate taxation, including reduction\nof the corporate tax rate from a top marginal rate of 35% to a flat rate of 21% and limitation of the deduction for net operating losses\nto 80% of current year taxable income for losses arising in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017 and the elimination of the\ncarryback of such losses (though any such net operating losses may be carried forward indefinitely). In addition, beginning in 2022,\nthe TCJA eliminates the option to deduct research and development expenditures currently and requires corporations to capitalize and\namortize them over five years.\nIn addition to the CARES Act, as part of Congress’ response to the COVID-19 pandemic, economic relief legislation was\nenacted in 2020 and 2021 containing tax provisions. Further, as of August 2022, the IRA introduced new tax provisions, including a\none percent excise tax imposed on certain stock repurchases by publicly traded companies. The one percent excise tax generally\napplies to any acquisition of stock by the publicly traded company (or certain of its affiliates) from a stockholder of the company in\nexchange for money or other property (other than stock of the company itself), subject to a de minimis exception. Thus, the excise tax\ncould apply to certain transactions that are not traditional stock repurchases. Regulatory guidance under the TCJA and such additional\nlegislation is and continues to be forthcoming, and such guidance could ultimately increase or lessen their impact on our business and\nfinancial condition. In addition, it is uncertain if and to what extent various states will conform to the TCJA and additional tax\nlegislation.\nItem 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments\nNot applicable.\nItem 1C. Cybersecurity\nCybersecurity Risk Management and Strategy\nLike all companies with an internet presence, we are regularly subject to cyberattacks and other cyber incidents, and, therefore,\ncybersecurity is an important element of our ongoing information technology operations. We devote significant resources to protecting\nand enhancing the security of our computer systems, business information, software, networks and other technology assets, by\napplying our cybersecurity risk management processes, which consider physical, procedural and technical safeguards. We have a\nmulti-faceted program for assessing, identifying and managing cybersecurity risks, that is designed to help protect our information\nassets and operations from internal and external cyber threats by:\n• organizing our cybersecurity efforts based on the National Institute of Standards and Technology (“NIST”) Cybersecurity\nFramework by applying the framework’s rubric of Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover;\n• seeking to understand, manage and mitigate risk while ensuring business resiliency and protecting business, employee and\npatient information from unauthorized access or attack;\n• identifying critical business information, the lifecycles of that information, and the systems where this information is\nstored, distributed, processed, and eventually destroyed. For example, by managing important external parties and their\noperations, analyzing their cybersecurity risk to our business operations, and reviewing the residual risk with business\nleaders to accept and manage each external party appropriately;\n• protecting and securing our systems from attack with secure configuration standards and protective cybersecurity tools;\n• detecting potential attacks through appropriate tools, including cybersecurity-related data collection and analysis to help\nidentify potential attacks;\n• responding to alerts from those tools with processes to verify whether there is a real incident and the severity of that\nincident using appropriate resources and team members, including establishing and exercising a Cybersecurity Incident\nResponse Plan (“IRP”) based on recognized industry practices, including NIST guidance; and\n• establishing and exercising processes and procedures to recover from cybersecurity incidents.\n94\nOur IRP contains tools, and guidance related to cybersecurity events and is designed to help coordinate our response to, and\nrecovery from, cybersecurity incidents, and includes processes to triage, assess the severity of, escalate, contain, investigate, and\nremediate incidents as well as comply with applicable legal obligations. In addition, as part of our overall risk mitigation strategy, we\nalso maintain cyber insurance coverage; however, such insurance may not be sufficient in type or amount to cover us against claims\nrelated to security breaches, cyber-attacks and other related breaches.\nWe regularly engage external parties, inclusive of but not limited to, service vendors, consultants, independent privacy\nassessors, peer companies, industry groups, and governance experts to enhance our understanding and application of oversight of the\ncybersecurity landscape. For example, we provide an annual assessment of our cybersecurity program, completed by our third-party\nChief Information Security Officer (“CISO”), to our Audit Committee for review and feedback. These external parties provide an\nindustry perspective on appropriate risk management and investment in our cybersecurity efforts that is reviewed and approved by\ncompany management and the Board of Directors.\nWe do not believe that there are currently any known risks from cybersecurity threats that are reasonably likely to materially\naffect the Company or its business strategy, results of operations or financial condition.\nCybersecurity Governance and Oversight\nThe Audit Committee of our Board of Directors provides direct oversight over cybersecurity risk. The Audit Committee\nreceives and provides feedback on quarterly updates from management regarding cybersecurity and is notified between such updates\nregarding significant new cybersecurity threats or incidents, if any. As part of these quarterly updates to the Audit Committee, our\nVice President of Information Technology presents any developments, emerging risks or key topics to the Audit Committee,\nincluding, among other things, the external threat environment, risk profile changes, training initiatives, the status of projects to\nstrengthen cybersecurity, emerging global policies and regulations, cybersecurity technologies and industry practices, cyber readiness,\nresults of third-party assessments, mitigation efforts and response plans. The full Board of Directors receives regular reports from the\nChair of the Audit Committee, as well as periodic updates highlighting recent incidents throughout the industry and the emerging\nthreat landscape.\nOur Vice President of Information Technology leads an IT Security Team and has overall responsibility for the security\nprogram. The IT Security Team is responsible for leading company-wide cybersecurity strategy, policy, standards and processes. The\nIT Security Team works across the enterprise to assess and prepare our employees and third parties to manage cybersecurity risks and\ndetect, investigate and respond to cybersecurity incidents. Our Vice President of Information Technology has 25 years of information\ntechnology experience, including 22 years of leadership responsibility, and has substantial operational experience with cybersecurity\npolicy, protection, incident response, and governance. We also utilize a third-party cybersecurity advisor to act as our CISO,\nsupporting the Vice President of Information Technology. This fractional executive has extensive experience as a CISO and\ncybersecurity executive with over 25 years of expertise in designing, building, and operating transformational information security\nprograms, is a Certified Information Systems Security Professional, and holds a Master of Science in Strategic Intelligence.\nFurther, our IRP establishes a Security Council, which is responsible for providing oversight, direction, and governance of\nincident response policies and processes and is composed of certain company stakeholders, including our Vice President of\nInformation Technology and our third-party CISO.\nIn an effort to deter and detect cyber threats, we provide a monthly cybersecurity awareness newsletter to all employees,\nincluding part-time and temporary contractors, which covers timely and relevant topics, such as social engineering, phishing,\npassword protection, confidential data protection, asset use and mobile security, and reminds employees of the importance of reporting\nall incidents quickly. We run frequent phishing tests to raise awareness of spam emails, the primary attack vectors for cyber threats\nand to further raise awareness of cyber threats. We provide annual training on employee responsibilities for protecting company\ninformation and data along with our overall compliance responsibility. Each October during cybersecurity awareness month in the\nU.S., we provide weekly updates on cybersecurity awareness and host a company-wide lunch and learn discussion of our\ncybersecurity program and the impact of cybersecurity on individuals as well as the company, with a data protection, cybersecurity\nand incident response and prevention training and compliance program.\n95\nItem 2. Properties\nOur headquarters are located in Newton, Massachusetts, where we lease 98,502 square feet of office and laboratory space. We\nalso lease approximately 3,681 square feet of office space in Munich, Germany and 4,736 square feet of office space in Tel Aviv-\nYafo, Israel.\nItem 3. Legal Proceedings\nThe information required by this Item is provided under “Litigation” in Note 11 “Commitments and Contingencies” of the\nConsolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nItem 4. Mine Safety Disclosures\nNot applicable.\n96\nPART II\nItem 5.

[Reserved]\n98\nItem 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our\nconsolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report. Some of the information contained in this\ndiscussion and analysis and set forth elsewhere in this report, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our\nbusiness, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. You should review the section entitled “Risk\nFactors” in Part I - Item 1A of this report for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from\nthe results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis.\nOverview\nWe are a commercial-stage pharmaceutical company pioneering novel cancer therapies and dedicated to the discovery,\ndevelopment and commercialization of first-in-class drugs directed against nuclear export for the treatment of cancer and other\ndiseases. Our scientific expertise is based upon an understanding of the regulation of intracellular communication between the nucleus\nand the cytoplasm. We have discovered and are developing and commercializing novel, small molecule Selective Inhibitor of Nuclear\nExport (“SINE”) compounds that inhibit the nuclear export protein exportin 1 (“XPO1”). These SINE compounds represent a new\nclass of drug candidates with a novel mechanism of action that have the potential to treat a variety of diseases with high unmet\nmedical need. Our lead asset, XPOVIO® (selinexor), was the first oral XPO1 inhibitor to receive marketing approval, receiving its\ninitial U.S. approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) in July 2019, and is currently approved and marketed in\nthe U.S. for the following indications:\n• In combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone for the treatment of adult patients with multiple myeloma who have\nreceived at least one prior therapy. Approval in this indication was based on the results from the BOSTON (Bortezomib,\nSelinexor and Dexamethasone) study;\n• In combination with dexamethasone for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma who\nhave received at least four prior therapies and whose disease is refractory to at least two proteasome inhibitors, at least\ntwo immunomodulatory agents, and an anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody. Approval in this indication was based on the\nresults from the STORM (Selinexor Treatment of Refractory Myeloma) study; and\n• For the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (“DLBCL”), not otherwise\nspecified, including DLBCL arising from follicular lymphoma, after at least two lines of systemic therapy. This indication\nwas approved under accelerated approval based on response rate and was based on the results from the SADAL (Selinexor\nAgainst Diffuse Aggressive Lymphoma) study. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon\nverification and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial.\nThe commercialization of XPOVIO in the U.S. is currently supported by sales representatives, nurse liaisons, and a market\naccess team, as well as KaryForward™, an extensive patient and healthcare provider support program. Our commercial efforts are also\nsupplemented by patient support initiatives coordinated by our dedicated network of participating specialty pharmacy providers. We\nplan to continue to educate physicians, other healthcare providers and patients about XPOVIO’s clinical profile and unique\nmechanism of action as we continue to expand XPOVIO use.\nThe commercialization of XPOVIO and NEXPOVIO® (selinexor) (the brand name for selinexor in Europe and the United\nKingdom (“UK”)) outside of the U.S. is managed by our partners in their respective territories. XPOVIO/NEXPOVIO has received\nregulatory approval in various indications in over 40 countries outside the U.S. and is commercially available in a growing number of\ncountries as our partners continue to secure reimbursement approvals.\nOur primary focus is on marketing XPOVIO in its currently approved indications as well as developing and seeking the\nregulatory approval of selinexor as an oral agent targeting multiple high unmet need cancer indications, including our core programs\nin endometrial cancer, multiple myeloma, and myelofibrosis. We plan to continue to conduct clinical trials and to seek additional\napprovals for the use of selinexor as a single agent or in combination with other oncology therapies to expand the patient populations\nthat are eligible for treatment with selinexor. In January 2024, we announced that further clinical development of our eltanexor\nprogram is on hold in an effort to focus our resources on our prioritized late-stage programs.\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had an accumulated deficit of $1.5 billion. We had net losses of $143.1 million, $165.3 million,\nand $124.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. We recognized total revenue of $146.0\nmillion in 2023, including $112.0 million of XPOVIO net product revenue and $34.0 million of license revenue. License revenue\nincluded $15.0 million of revenue for the reimbursement of development related expenses from the Menarini Group (“Menarini”). As\nof December 31, 2023, we had $191.4 million in cash, cash equivalents and investments.\n99\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial\nstatements, which we have prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these\nconsolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and\nliabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported amounts\nof revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. We believe that the estimates and assumptions involved in the accounting\npolicies described below may have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements and, therefore, consider these\nto be our critical accounting estimates. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Actual results may differ from\nthese estimates under different assumptions and conditions. See Note 2 “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” to the\nconsolidated financial statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information about our\nsignificant accounting policies.\nProduct Revenue Reserves\nWe recognize product revenue, net of variable consideration related to certain allowances and accruals, when the customer takes\ncontrol of the product, which is typically upon delivery to the customer. Revenue from product sales is recorded at the net sales price,\nwhich includes estimates of variable consideration for which reserves are reported. These reserves are based on the amounts earned, or\nto be claimed on the related sales, and are generally classified as reductions of accounts receivable (if the amount is payable to the\ncustomer) or a current liability (if the amount is payable to a party other than a customer). Certain amounts are known at the time of\nsale based on contractual terms and are recorded pursuant to the most likely amount method, which is the single most likely amount in\na range of possible considerations. Other amounts are estimated pursuant to the expected value method, which is the sum of\nprobability-weighted amounts in a range of possible considerations. Relevant factors used in the expected value method include:\ncurrent contractual and statutory requirements, specific known market events and trends, industry data, and forecasted customer\nbuying and payment patterns. These reserves reflect our best estimates of the variable consideration based on the terms of the\nrespective underlying contracts.\nThe estimates for our product revenue allowances and accruals are most significantly affected by chargebacks, which are\ncontractual commitments to provide products to qualified healthcare entities at prices lower than the list prices charged to our\ncustomers who purchase XPOVIO directly from us, and rebates that represent discount obligations under government programs,\nincluding Medicaid, Medicare, the Department of Veterans Affairs, the Department of Defense, and others.\nA 10% increase or decrease in these estimates would impact net product revenue by a corresponding increase or decrease of less\nthan $3.0 million.\nLicense and Asset Purchase Agreements\nWe generate revenue from license or similar agreements with pharmaceutical companies for the development and\ncommercialization of certain of our products and product candidates.\nAt contract inception, we evaluate all goods or services in the agreement to determine if they are distinct. If they are not distinct,\nthey are combined with other promised goods or services to create a bundle of promised goods or services that are distinct. Distinct\ngoods or services and distinct bundles of goods or services are considered performance obligations. Optional future services where\nany additional consideration paid to us reflects their standalone selling prices do not provide the customer with a material right and,\ntherefore, are not considered performance obligations. Optional future services that are priced in a manner which provides the\ncustomer with a significant or incremental discount are considered performance obligations because they provide the customer with a\nmaterial right.\nWe utilize judgment to estimate the transaction price at contract inception. We evaluate contingent milestones to determine if\nthey should be included in the transaction price using the most likely amount method. Milestone payments that are not within our\ncontrol, such as regulatory approvals, are not considered likely of being achieved until those approvals are received and are excluded\nfrom the transaction price using the most likely amount method. The transaction price is then allocated to each performance obligation\non a relative standalone selling price basis, for which we recognize revenue as or when the performance obligations are satisfied. At\nthe end of each reporting period, we re-evaluate our estimate of the transaction price including the probability of achieving milestone\npayments that may not be subject to a material reversal and adjust the transaction price if necessary. Any such adjustments are\nrecorded on a cumulative catch-up basis, which would affect license and other revenue in the period of adjustment.\n100\nAccrued Research and Development Costs\nWe estimate our accrued research and development costs by reviewing quotes and contracts, identifying services that have been\nperformed on our behalf, and estimating the associated cost incurred for services performed when we have not yet been invoiced or\notherwise notified of the actual cost. Most of our service providers invoice us monthly in arrears for services performed or when\ncontractual milestones are met. We make estimates of our accrued research and development costs at each balance sheet date in our\nfinancial statements based on facts and circumstances known to us at that time. We periodically confirm the accuracy of our estimates\nwith the service providers and make adjustments if necessary. The significant estimates in our accrued research and development costs\ninclude fees to be paid to contract research organizations (“CROs”) and contract manufacturing organizations (“CMOs”) in connection\nwith research and development activities as well as fees to be paid to investigative sites in connection with clinical studies, for which\nwe have not yet been invoiced.\nWe base our expenses related to CROs and CMOs on our estimates of the services performed and efforts expended pursuant to\nquotes and contracts with CROs and CMOs that conduct research and development activities on our behalf. The payment terms of\nthese agreements are subject to negotiation, vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows. There may be\ninstances in which payments made to our service providers will exceed the level of services performed and result in a prepayment. In\naccruing service fees, we estimate the time period over which the services will be performed and the level of effort to be expended in\neach period. If the actual timing of the performance of services or the level of effort varies from our estimates, we adjust the accrual or\nprepayment accordingly. Although we do not expect our estimates to be materially different from amounts actually incurred, if our\nestimates of the status and timing of services performed differ from the actual status and timing of services performed, it could result\nin us reporting amounts that are too high or too low in any particular period. To date, our estimates have not been materially different\nthan amounts actually incurred.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table summarizes our results of operations (in thousands):\nFor the Years Ended December 31,\n2023 2022 2021\nProduct revenue, net $ 112,011 $ 120,445 $ 98,436\nLicense and other revenue 34,022 36,629 111,383\nTotal revenue 146,033 157,074 209,819\nOperating expenses:\nCost of sales 4,942 5,213 3,402\nResearch and development 138,750 148,662 160,842\nSelling, general and administrative 131,881 145,401 143,846\nLoss from operations (129,540) (142,202) (98,271)\nOther expense, net (13,236) (22,720) (25,549)\nLoss before income taxes (142,776) (164,922) (123,820)\nIncome tax provision (323) (369) (268)\nNet loss $ (143,099) $ (165,291) $ (124,088)\nProduct Revenue, net (in thousands, except for percentages)\nFor the Years Ended December 31, 2023 vs. 2022 2022 vs. 2021\n2023 2022 2021 $ Change % Change $ Change % Change\nProduct revenue, net $ 112,011 $ 120,445 $ 98,436 $ (8,434) (7)% $ 22,009 22%\nNet product revenue from U.S. commercial sales of XPOVIO for the year ended December 31, 2023 decreased 7% as compared\nto the year ended December 31, 2022. A number of myeloma foundations that help support Medicare Part D patients with their out-of-\npocket costs for multiple myeloma oral oncolytics, including XPOVIO, closed during the first quarter of 2023 and some remained\nclosed throughout 2023. During the foundation closures, we provided XPOVIO to these patients at no charge through our Patient\nAssistance Program (“PAP”), which adversely impacted our 2023 revenues by approximately $5.8 million as patients who entered our\nPAP earlier in the year remained in the program through the calendar year and received their refills during the course of their\ntreatment. We believe this trend will be mainly limited to 2023 since, beginning in 2024, changes in the design of Medicare Part D\n101\nunder the Inflation Reduction Act eliminated the patient burden of the 5% Beneficiary Coinsurance requirement and we expect less\nneed for Medicare Part D patients to utilize PAP for co-pay assistance in 2024 compared to 2023.\nLicense and Other Revenue (in thousands, except for percentages)\nFor the Years Ended December 31, 2023 vs. 2022 2022 vs. 2021\n2023 2022 2021 $ Change % Change $ Change % Change\nMenarini $ 24,360 $ 15,672 $ 75,000 $ 8,688 55% $ (59,328) (79)%\nAntengene 2,713 13,353 30,429 (10,640) (80)% (17,076) (56)%\nOther 6,949 7,604 5,954 (655) (9)% 1,650 28%\nTotal license and other revenue $ 34,022 $ 36,629 $ 111,383 $ (2,607) (7)% $ (74,754) (67)%\nLicense and other revenue for the year ended December 31, 2023 decreased by $2.6 million as compared to the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022 primarily due to a decrease in milestone-related revenue and royalty revenue from Antengene Therapeutics\nLimited (“Antengene”), partially offset by an increase in milestone-related revenue, license-related revenue, and royalty revenue from\nMenarini. The license agreements with Menarini and Antengene are each defined and described in Note 5 “License and Asset\nPurchase Agreements”, to the consolidated financial statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nWe expect license and other revenue to increase in 2024 as compared to 2023 primarily due to expected milestone\nachievements.\nOperating Costs and Expenses (in thousands, except for percentages)\nFor the Years Ended December 31, 2023 vs. 2022 2022 vs. 2021\n2023 2022 2021 $ Change % Change $ Change % Change\nCost of sales $ 4,942 $ 5,213 $ 3,402 $ (271) (5)% $ 1,811 53%\nResearch and development 138,750 148,662 160,842 (9,912) (7)% (12,180) (8)%\nSelling, general and administrative 131,881 145,401 143,846 (13,520) (9)% 1,555 1%\nTotal operating expenses $ 275,573 $ 299,276 $ 308,090 $ (23,703) (8)% $ (8,814) (3)%\nCost of Sales\nWe expect cost of sales to remain relatively consistent in 2024 as compared to 2023.\nResearch and Development Expenses (in thousands, except for percentages)\nFor the Years Ended December 31, 2023 vs. 2022 2022 vs. 2021\n2023 2022 2021 $ Change % Change $ Change % Change\nClinical trial and related costs $ 65,693 $ 56,502 $ 68,473 $ 9,191 16% $ (11,971) (17)%\nPersonnel costs 49,907 59,095 52,001 (9,188) (16)% 7,094 14%\nConsulting, professional and other\ncosts 16,621 18,714 21,171 (2,093) (11)% (2,457) (12)%\nStock-based compensation 6,529 14,351 11,842 (7,822) (55)% 2,509 21%\nIn-process research and development — — 7,355 — — (7,355) (100)%\nTotal research and development\nexpenses $ 138,750 $ 148,662 $ 160,842 $ (9,912) (7)% $ (12,180) (8)%\nResearch and development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2023 decreased by $9.9 million as compared to the year\nended December 31, 2022, primarily due to a decrease in personnel costs of $9.2 million and a decrease in stock-based compensation\nof $7.8 million, which was primarily because of a reduction in headcount and contractors, including severance-related expenses\n102\nincurred in 2022. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in clinical trial and related costs of $9.2 million, primarily due\nto the advancement of our three pivotal Phase 3 trials and the timing of purchases of comparator drug used in our clinical trials.\nWe expect our research and development expenses to increase slightly in 2024 as compared to 2023 as we continue to advance\nour three pivotal Phase 3 trials.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses (in thousands, except for percentages)\nFor the Years Ended December 31, 2023 vs. 2022 2022 vs. 2021\n2023 2022 2021 $ Change % Change $ Change % Change\nPersonnel costs $ 66,465 $ 68,167 $ 66,465 $ (1,702) (2)% $ 1,702 3%\nConsulting, professional and other\ncosts 50,606 56,412 59,594 (5,806) (10)% (3,182) (5)%\nStock-based compensation 14,810 20,822 17,787 (6,012) (29)% 3,035 17%\nTotal selling, general and\nadministrative expenses $ 131,881 $ 145,401 $ 143,846 $ (13,520) (9)% $ 1,555 1%\nSelling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2023 decreased by $13.5 million as compared to\nthe year ended December 31, 2022, primarily due to a decrease in stock-based compensation and a decrease in consulting, professional\nand other costs. The decrease in stock-based compensation of $6.0 million was primarily due to severance-related expenses incurred\nduring 2022.

We\nhave had recurring losses since inception and incurred a loss of $143.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. We expect that\nour cash, cash equivalents and investments at December 31, 2023 will be sufficient to fund our current operating plans and capital\nexpenditure requirements for at least twelve months from the date of issuance of the financial statements contained in this Annual\nReport on Form 10-K.\nThe following table provides information regarding our cash flows (in thousands):\nFor the Years Ended December 31, 2023 vs. 2022 2022 vs. 2021\n2023 2022 2021 $ Change % Change $ Change % Change\nNet cash used in operating activities $ (92,723) $(149,554) $(107,116) $ 56,831 (38)% $ (42,438) 40%\nNet cash provided by (used in)\ninvesting activities 7,940 (104,256) 141,840 112,196 (108)% (246,096) (174)%\nNet cash provided by financing\nactivities 1,124 193,738 73,648 (192,614) (99)% 120,090 163%\nEffect of foreign exchange rates (34) (488) (48) 454 (93)% (440) 917%\nNet (decrease) increase in cash, cash\nequivalents and restricted cash $ (83,693) $ (60,560) $ 108,324 $ (23,133) 38% $(168,884) (156)%\nNet Cash Used in Operating Activities\nThe $56.8 million decrease in net cash used in operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to the\nyear ended December 31, 2022 was primarily driven by a decrease in expenses and $27.3 million of milestone payments we received\nfrom Antengene in 2023.\nNet Cash Provided by (Used in) Investing Activities\nThe $112.2 million increase in net cash provided by investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared\nto the year ended December 31, 2022 was primarily driven by a $66.9 million decrease in purchases of investments and a $45.2\nmillion increase in proceeds from the sales and maturities of investments.\nNet Cash Provided by Financing Activities\nThe $192.6 million decrease in net cash provided by financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared\nto the year ended December 31, 2022 was primarily driven by net proceeds of approximately $154.7 million from a private placement\noffering of our common stock in 2022 and $35.1 million in net proceeds received from the sale of common stock under our “at the\nmarket offering” program in 2022.\nA discussion of changes in our financial condition for the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the year ended\nDecember 31, 2021 is included under the heading “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results\nof Operations” in the 2022 Form 10-K.\nSources of Liquidity\nOn December 5, 2022, we entered into a securities purchase agreement with certain institutional investors pursuant to which we\nissued and sold, in a private placement offering of securities, an aggregate of (i) 31,791,908 shares of common stock and (ii)\naccompanying warrants to purchase up to 9,537,563 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $6.36 per share. We received\naggregate net proceeds of approximately $154.7 million.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, we received $32.0 million in milestone and upfront payments under our license and\ndistribution arrangements pursuant to which we are entitled to receive additional milestone payments, if certain development goals and\nsales milestones are achieved, as well as royalties on future net sales of the licensed and sold products in the territories under such\narrangements. In addition, under the Menarini Agreement, Menarini will reimburse us for 25% of all development related expenses we\n104\nincur for selinexor from 2022 through 2025, provided that such reimbursements shall not exceed $15.0 million per calendar year. We\nreceived $15.0 million of reimbursements for development related expenses under the Menarini Agreement during the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023.\nIn September 2019, we entered into the Revenue Interest Financing Agreement (the “Revenue Interest Agreement”) with\nHealthCare Royalty Partners III, L.P. and HealthCare Royalty Partners IV, L.P. (“HCR”) which was amended in June 2021 (the\n“Amended Revenue Interest Agreement”). Pursuant to the Revenue Interest Agreement, HCR paid us $75.0 million, less certain\ntransaction expenses, on September 27, 2019 and pursuant to the Amended Revenue Interest Agreement, HCR paid us $60.0 million\non June 23, 2021. For additional information on the Amended Revenue Interest Agreement, see Note 10, “Long-Term Obligations”, to\nthe consolidated financial statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOn February 17, 2023, we entered into an Open Market Sale Agreement (the “2023 Open Market Sale Agreement”) with\nJefferies LLC, as agent (“Jefferies”). Under the 2023 Open Market Sale Agreement, we may issue and sell shares of our common\nstock having an aggregate offering price of up to $100.0 million (the “Shares”) from time to time through Jefferies (the “2023 Open\nMarket Offering”). Upon entry into the 2023 Open Market Sale Agreement, we terminated our previous Open Market Sale Agreement\nwith Jefferies, as agent, which we had entered into in August 2018 (the “2018 Open Market Sale Agreement”), pursuant to which we\ncould issue and sell shares of our common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $175.0 million (the “Open Market\nShares”). During the year ended December 31, 2022, we sold an aggregate of 3,991,652 Open Market Shares under the 2018 Open\nMarket Sale Agreement, for net proceeds of approximately $35.1 million.\nWe did not sell any Open Market Shares under the 2018 Open Market Sale Agreement nor any Shares under the 2023 Open\nMarket Sales Agreement during the year ended December 31, 2023. As of December 31, 2023, $100.0 million of Shares was available\nfor issuance and sale under the 2023 Open Market Sale Agreement.\nCommitments, Contingencies and Contractual Obligations\nOperating Leases\nWe are party to an operating lease of 98,502 square feet of office and research space in Newton, Massachusetts with a term\nthrough September 30, 2025 (the “Newton, MA Lease”). Pursuant to the Newton, MA Lease, we have provided a security deposit in\nthe form of a cash-collateralized letter of credit in the amount of $0.3 million which is classified in long-term restricted cash on our\nconsolidated balance sheets. We expect to incur total lease costs of $6.7 million from December 31, 2023 to September 30, 2025.\nIn addition, we are party to certain short-term leases having a term of twelve months or less at the commencement date. We\nrecognize short-term lease expense on a straight-line basis and do not record a related right-of use asset or lease liability for such\nleases. These costs were insignificant for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021.\nContractual Obligations\nWe have contractual obligations under our 3.00% Convertible Senior Notes due 2025 and under our Revenue Interest Financing\nAgreement as disclosed in Note 10, “Long-Term Obligations”, to the consolidated financial statements included under Part II, Item 8\nof this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nFunding Requirements\nWe expect our expenses to remain relatively consistent in 2024 as compared to 2023. We expect to continue to incur costs\nrelated to our clinical development programs as we rapidly advance three pivotal Phase 3 trials, as well as commercialization expenses\nrelated to sales, marketing, manufacturing and distribution of any of our products, to the extent that these functions are not the\nresponsibility of our collaborators.\nIdentifying potential product candidates and conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials is a time-consuming, expensive and\nuncertain process that takes years to complete. In addition, our product candidates for which we receive marketing approval may not\nachieve commercial success. Our ability to become and remain profitable depends on our ability to generate revenue. There can be no\nassurance as to the amount or timing of any such revenue, and we may not achieve profitability for several years, if at all, as described\nmore fully in the risk factor entitled “We have incurred significant losses since inception, expect to continue to incur significant losses,\nand may never achieve or maintain profitability,” under the heading “Risk Factors” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nAccordingly, we will need to continue to rely on additional financing to achieve our business objectives. Adequate additional\nfinancing may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. We may seek additional capital due to favorable market conditions\nor strategic considerations, even if we believe we have sufficient funds for our current or future operating plans. If we are unable to\n105\nraise capital when needed or on attractive terms, we would be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate our research and development\nprograms or commercialization efforts.\nWe currently expect that cash, cash equivalents and investments at December 31, 2023 will be sufficient to fund our current\noperating plans and capital expenditure requirements for at least twelve months from the date of issuance of the financial statements\ncontained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K while we continue to commercialize XPOVIO in the U.S. and continue the clinical\ntrials of our product candidates. Our future long-term capital requirements will depend on many factors, as described more fully in the\nrisk factor entitled “We will need additional funding to achieve our business objectives. If we are unable to raise capital when needed\nor on acceptable terms, we would be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate our research and development programs and/or\ncommercialization efforts,” under the heading “Risk Factors” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nIn addition to the expenses required to fund our operations described above, our funding requirements also include the\nfollowing:\n• Lease costs for our headquarters in Newton, Massachusetts with a term through September 30, 2025, which totaled $3.7\nmillion in 2023 and increase annually; we expect total future lease costs to be approximately $6.7 million;\n• Future long-term debt obligations related to the 3.00% Convertible Senior Notes due 2025 of $182.9 million over the next\nthree years; and\n• Future royalty obligations to HCR under our Revenue Interest Financing Agreement of approximately $201.6 million.\nItem 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\nWe are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates. We had cash, cash equivalents and investments of $191.4\nmillion as of December 31, 2023. Our primary exposure to market risk is interest rate sensitivity, which is affected by changes in the\ngeneral level of U.S. interest rates. Due to the short-term duration of our investment portfolio and the low risk profile of our\ninvestments, an immediate 100 basis point shift in interest rates would not have a material effect on the fair market value of our\ninvestment portfolio.\nWe do not believe our cash, cash equivalents and investments have significant risk of default or illiquidity. While we believe our\ncash, cash equivalents and investments do not contain excessive risk, we cannot provide absolute assurance that in the future our\ninvestments will not be subject to adverse changes in securities at one or more financial institutions that are in excess of federally\ninsured limits. Given the potential instability of financial institutions, we cannot provide assurance that we will not experience losses\non these deposits and investments.\nWe are also exposed to market risk related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. We contract with contract research\norganizations and contract manufacturing organizations that are located in Canada, the United Kingdom and Europe, which are\ndenominated in foreign currencies. We also contract with a number of clinical trial sites outside of the U.S., and our budgets for those\nstudies are frequently denominated in foreign currencies. We are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency rates in connection with\nthese agreements. We do not currently hedge our foreign currency exchange rate risk.\nItem 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\nThe financial statements required to be filed pursuant to this Item 8 are appended to this Annual Report on Form 10-K and are\nincorporated herein by reference. An index of those financial statements is found in Item 15 of Part IV of this Annual Report on Form\n10-K.\nItem 9A. Controls and Procedures\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nWe have established disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the\nreports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods\nspecified in the rules and forms prescribed by the Securities and Exchange Commission and is accumulated and communicated to\nmanagement, including the principal executive officer (our President and Chief Executive Officer) and principal financial officer (our\nExecutive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer), to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\n106\nOur management, under the supervision and with the participation of our President and Chief Executive Officer and Executive\nVice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as\ndefined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form\n10-K. Management recognizes that any disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide\nonly reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives. Our disclosure controls and procedures have been designed to provide\nreasonable assurance of achieving their objectives. Based on such evaluation, our President and Chief Executive Officer and\nExecutive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective\nat the reasonable assurance level as of December 31, 2023.\nManagement’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term\nis defined in Rules13a-15(f) and15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial\nreporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to\nthe risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with policies or\nprocedures may deteriorate. Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed under the supervision of our principal\nexecutive officer and principal financial officer to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the\npreparation of our financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting\nprinciples.\nUnder the supervision and with the participation of management, including our principal executive officer and principal\nfinancial officer we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the 2013\nframework in Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway\nCommission. Based on our evaluation under that framework, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting\nwas effective as of December 31, 2023.\nOur independent registered public accounting firm that audited the financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form\n10-K has issued an attestation report on our internal control over financial reporting, which is included below.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by\nRule 13a-15(d) and 15d-15(d) of the Exchange Act that occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2023 that have materially\naffected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\n107\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Karyopharm Therapeutics Inc.\nOpinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited Karyopharm Therapeutics Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on\ncriteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway\nCommission (2013 framework), (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Karyopharm Therapeutics Inc. (the Company) maintained, in all\nmaterial respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on the COSO criteria.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)\n(PCAOB), the 2023 consolidated financial statements of the Company and our report dated February 29, 2024 expressed an\nunqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its\nassessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Annual\nReport on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control\nover financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be\nindependent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations\nof the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the\naudit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material\nrespects.\nOur audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material\nweakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and\nperforming such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable\nbasis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the\nreliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally\naccepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)\npertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the\nassets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial\nstatements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being\nmade only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance\nregarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a\nmaterial effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.

Form 10-K Summary\nNone.\n111\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Shareholders and\nthe Board of Directors of Karyopharm Therapeutics Inc.\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Karyopharm Therapeutics Inc. (the Company) as of\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive loss, stockholders’ (deficit) equity and\ncash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the\n“consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the\nfinancial position of the Company at December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the\nthree years in the period ended December 31, 2023, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)\n(PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal\nControl—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013\nframework), and our report dated February 29, 2024 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nAdoption of ASU No. 2020-06\nAs discussed in Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed its method of accounting for convertible\nsenior notes in 2021 due to the adoption of Accounting Standards Update No. 2020-06, Debt—Debt with Conversion and Other\nOptions (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging—Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40).\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on\nthe Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required\nto be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and\nregulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the\naudit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or\nfraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due\nto error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence\nregarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used\nand significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe\nthat our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that\nwas communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are\nmaterial to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication\nof the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are\nnot, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or\ndisclosures to which it relates.\n112\nAccrued Research and Development Costs\nDescription of the The Company’s accrued research and development costs totaled $19.6 million at December 31, 2023. As\nMatter discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s accrued research and development\ncosts are recognized based on various inputs, including an evaluation of the progress to complete specific tasks\nusing data such as clinical site activations, patient enrollment, and other information provided to the Company\nby its service providers based on their actual costs incurred. Payments for these activities are based on the terms\nof individual arrangements, which may differ from the pattern of costs incurred, and are reflected on the\nconsolidated balance sheet as accrued expenses.\nAuditing the Company’s accrued research and development costs is especially challenging due to the significant\nvolume of information received from service providers that conduct research and development activities on the\nCompany’s behalf. While the Company’s estimates of accrued research and development costs are primarily\nbased on information received related to each study or ongoing work order from its service providers, the\nCompany may need to make an estimate for additional costs incurred. Finally, due to the duration of certain of\nthe Company’s ongoing research and development activities and the timing of invoicing received from service\nproviders, the actual amounts incurred are not typically known by the report date.\nHow We Addressed We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design, and tested the operating effectiveness of the controls over\nthe Matter in Our the Company’s process for recording accrued research and development costs. These procedures included\nAudit controls over management’s review of inputs used, as well as the completeness and accuracy of the underlying\ndata, in calculating the accrual.\nTo test accrued research and development costs, our audit procedures included, among others, testing the\naccuracy and completeness of the underlying data used to calculate accrued research and development costs, as\nwell as evaluating the assumptions used by management. To assess the nature and extent of services incurred,\nwe corroborated the progress of clinical trials with the Company’s research and development personnel that\noversee the clinical trials and obtained information from service providers regarding costs incurred to date. We\nalso tested subsequent invoices received and inspected the Company’s contracts with service providers and any\npending change orders to assess the effect on the accrual.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nWe

Organization and Operations\nWe are a commercial-stage pharmaceutical company pioneering novel cancer therapies and dedicated to the discovery,\ndevelopment and commercialization of first-in-class drugs directed against nuclear export for the treatment of cancer and other\ndiseases. Our scientific expertise is based upon an understanding of the regulation of intracellular communication between the nucleus\nand the cytoplasm. We have discovered and are developing and commercializing novel, small molecule Selective Inhibitor of Nuclear\nExport compounds that inhibit the nuclear export protein exportin 1. Our primary focus is on marketing XPOVIO® (selinexor) in its\ncurrently approved indications, as well as developing and seeking the regulatory approval of selinexor as an oral agent targeting\nmultiple high unmet cancer indications, including our core programs in endometrial cancer, multiple myeloma, and myelofibrosis. We\nwere incorporated in Delaware on December 22, 2008 and have a principal place of business in Newton, Massachusetts.\nOur lead asset, XPOVIO, received its initial U.S. approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”) in July\n2019 and is currently approved and marketed for the following indications: (i) in combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone for\nthe treatment of adult patients with multiple myeloma who have received at least one prior therapy; (ii) in combination with\ndexamethasone for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma who have received at least four prior\ntherapies and whose disease is refractory to at least two proteasome inhibitors, at least two immunomodulatory agents, and an anti-\nCD38 monoclonal antibody; and (iii) for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma\n(“DLBCL”), not otherwise specified, including DLBCL arising from follicular lymphoma, after at least two lines of systemic therapy.\nThe commercialization of XPOVIO and NEXPOVIO (the brand name for selinexor in Europe and the United Kingdom) outside of the\nU.S. is managed by our partners in their respective territories. XPOVIO/NEXPOVIO has received regulatory approval in various\nindications in over 40 countries outside the U.S. and is commercially available in a growing number of countries as our partners\ncontinue to secure reimbursement approvals.\nTo date, we have financed our operations primarily through a combination of product revenue sales, private placements of our\ncommon stock, proceeds from our initial public offering and follow-on offerings of our common stock, proceeds from the issuance of\nconvertible debt, proceeds pursuant to a revenue interest financing agreement and subsequent amendment (deferred royalty\nobligation), proceeds from our “at the market offering” program and cash generated from our business development activities. As of\nDecember 31, 2023, we had an accumulated deficit of $1.5 billion. We expect that our cash, cash equivalents and investments at\nDecember 31, 2023 will be sufficient to fund our current operating plans and capital expenditure requirements for at least twelve\nmonths from the date of issuance of these financial statements.\n2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nBasis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally\naccepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”) and include the accounts of (i) Karyopharm Therapeutics Inc., (ii)\nKaryopharm Securities Corp. (“KPSC”), our wholly-owned Massachusetts corporation incorporated in December 2013, (iii)\nKaryopharm Europe GmbH, our wholly-owned German limited liability company, incorporated in September 2014, (iv) Karyopharm\nTherapeutics (Bermuda) Ltd., a limited liability company, registered in Bermuda in March 2015 and dissolved in January 2022, and\n(v) Karyopharm Israel Ltd., our wholly-owned Israeli subsidiary formed in June 2018. All intercompany balances and transactions\nhave been eliminated in consolidation.\nSegment Information\nOperating segments are defined as components of an enterprise about which separate discrete information is available for\nevaluation by the chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. We view our\noperations and manage our business in one operating segment, which is the business of discovering, developing and commercializing\ndrugs to treat cancer and certain other diseases. All of our revenue to date is attributable to the U.S.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions\nthat affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial\nstatements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.\n119\nOn an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including estimates related to our net product revenue, license and other\nrevenue, clinical trial accruals, stock-based compensation expense, interest expense on our deferred royalty obligation, our embedded\nderivative liability, valuation allowances, and other reported amounts of expenses during the reported period. We base our estimates\non historical experience and other market-specific or relevant assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances.\nAlthough we regularly assess these estimates, actual results could differ from those estimates. Changes in estimates are recorded in the\nperiod in which they become known.\nConcentrations of Credit Risk and Off-Balance Sheet Risk\nFinancial instruments which potentially subject us to credit risk consist primarily of cash, cash equivalents and investments. We\nhold these investments in highly rated financial institutions, and, by policy, limit the amounts of credit exposure to any one financial\ninstitution. These amounts at times may exceed federally insured limits. We have not experienced any credit losses in such accounts\nand do not believe we are exposed to any significant credit risk on these funds. We have no off-balance sheet concentrations of credit\nrisk, such as foreign currency exchange contracts, option contracts or other hedging arrangements.\nThe following table summarizes customers that represent 10% or greater of our consolidated total revenue:\nFor the Years Ended December 31,\n2023 2022 2021\nCustomer A 35% 32% 22%\nCustomer B 23% 24% 14%\nCustomer C 13% 13% 8%\nMenarini 17% 10% 36%\nAntengene 2% 9% 15%\nThe following table summarizes customers with amounts due that represent 10% or greater of our consolidated accounts\nreceivable, net balance:\nAs of December 31,\n2023 2022\nCustomer A 31% 21%\nCustomer B 22% 21%\nCustomer C 11% 6%\nMenarini 17% 2%\nAntengene 3% 47%\nFair Value Measurements\nFair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between\nmarket participants at the measurement date. We disclose information on all assets and liabilities reported at fair value that enables an\nassessment of the inputs used in determining the reported fair values. The fair value hierarchy prioritizes valuation inputs based on the\nobservable nature of those inputs. The fair value hierarchy applies only to the valuation inputs used in determining the reported fair\nvalue and is not a measure of credit quality. The hierarchy defines three levels of valuation inputs:\nLevel 1 inputs: Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities\nLevel 2 inputs: Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either\ndirectly or indirectly\nLevel 3 inputs: Unobservable inputs that reflect our own assumptions about the assumptions market participants would use in\npricing the asset or liability.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents consist primarily of demand deposit accounts and deposits in short-term money market funds. Cash\nequivalents are stated at cost, which approximates fair value. We consider all highly liquid investments with maturities of three\nmonths or less from the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. We do not hold any money market funds with significant liquidity\nrestrictions that would be required to be excluded from cash equivalents.\n120\nInvestments\nWe determine the appropriate classification of our investments at the time of purchase. All of our investments are reported as\nshort-term as they are available for use during the normal cycle of business. We review any investment when its fair value is less than\nits amortized cost and when evidence indicates that the investment’s carrying amount is not recoverable within a reasonable period.\nWe evaluate whether the decline in fair value has resulted from credit losses or other factors. In making this assessment, we consider\nthe extent to which fair value is less than amortized cost, any changes to the rating of the security by a rating agency, and adverse\nconditions specifically related to the security, among other factors. If this assessment indicates that a credit loss exists and if the\npresent value of cash flows expected to be collected is less than the amortized cost basis, an allowance is recorded on our consolidated\nbalance sheet, limited by the amount that the fair value is less than the amortized cost basis. Any impairment that is not related to a\ncredit loss is recognized in other comprehensive income (loss).\nChanges in the allowance for credit losses are recorded as a provision for (or reversal of) credit loss expense. Losses are charged\nagainst the allowance when we believe the uncollectability of an investment is confirmed or when either of the criteria regarding intent\nor requirement to sell is met.\nAccounts Receivable\nAmounts are recorded as accounts receivable when our right to consideration is unconditional other than the passage of time.\nAccounts receivable consists of amounts due from customers, net of customer allowances for cash discounts and chargebacks. Our\ncontracts with customers have standard payment terms that generally require payment within 30 to 65 days. We analyze accounts for\ncollectability and periodically evaluate the creditworthiness of our customers. We determined an allowance for credit losses was not\nmaterial as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 as we have had no bad debt write-offs to date and we do not currently have credit issues\nwith any customers.\nAccrued Research and Development Costs\nWe estimate our accrued research and development costs by reviewing quotes and contracts, identifying services that have been\nperformed on our behalf, and estimating the associated cost incurred for services performed when we have not yet been invoiced or\notherwise notified of the actual cost. Most of our service providers invoice us monthly in arrears for services performed or when\ncontractual milestones are met. We make estimates of our accrued research and development costs at each balance sheet date in our\nfinancial statements based on facts and circumstances known to us at that time. We periodically confirm the accuracy of our estimates\nwith the service providers and make adjustments if necessary. The significant estimates in our accrued research and development costs\ninclude fees to be paid to contract research organizations (“CROs”), and contract manufacturing organizations (“CMOs”) in\nconnection with research and development activities as well as fees to be paid to investigative sites in connection with clinical studies,\nfor which we have not yet been invoiced.\nWe base our expenses related to CROs and CMOs on our estimates of the services performed and efforts expended pursuant to\nquotes and contracts with CROs and CMOs that conduct research and development activities on our behalf. The payment terms of\nthese agreements are subject to negotiation, vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows. There may be\ninstances in which payments made to our service providers will exceed the level of services performed and result in a prepayment. In\naccruing service fees, we estimate the time period over which the services will be performed and the level of effort to be expended in\neach period. If the actual timing of the performance of services or the level of effort varies from our estimates, we adjust the accrual or\nprepayment accordingly. Although we do not expect our estimates to be materially different from amounts actually incurred, if our\nestimates of the status and timing of services performed differ from the actual status and timing of services performed, it could result\nin us reporting amounts that are too high or too low in any particular period. To date, our estimates have not been materially different\nthan amounts actually incurred.\nDeferred Royalty Obligation\nWe treat the debt obligation to HealthCare Royalty Partners III, L.P. and HealthCare Royalty Partners IV, L.P. (“HCR”), as\ndiscussed further in Note 10, “Long-Term Obligations”, as a deferred royalty obligation, amortized using the effective interest rate\nmethod over the estimated life of the revenue streams. We recognize interest expense thereon using the effective rate, which is based\non our current estimates of future revenues over the life of the arrangement. We periodically assess our expected revenues using\ninternal projections, impute interest on the carrying value of the deferred royalty obligation, and record interest expense using the\nimputed effective interest rate. To the extent our estimates of future revenues are greater or less than previous estimates or the\nestimated timing of such payments is materially different than previous estimates, we will account for any such changes by adjusting\nthe effective interest rate on a prospective basis, which will adjust future interest expense with a corresponding impact to the\nclassification of our deferred royalty obligation. The assumptions used in determining the expected repayment term of the deferred\n121\nroyalty obligation and amortization period of the issuance costs requires that we make estimates that could impact the short-term and\nlong-term classification of such costs, as well as the period over which such costs will be amortized.\nCommon Stock Warrants\nWe classify our common stock warrants in stockholder’s equity if they only allow for settlement in shares of our common stock,\nare indexed to our common stock, and meet the criteria for equity classification. See Note 8, “Stockholders’ Equity” for further detail.\nRevenue Recognition\nTo determine revenue recognition, we perform the following five steps: (i) identify the contract(s) with a customer; (ii) identify\nthe performance obligations in the contract; (iii) determine the transaction price; (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance\nobligations in the contract; and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) we satisfy a performance obligation. At contract inception, we\nassess whether the goods or services promised within a contract with a customer are distinct and, therefore, represent a separate\nperformance obligation. Goods or services that are determined not to be distinct are combined with other promised goods and services\nuntil a distinct bundle is identified. We then determine the transaction price, which is the total amount of consideration we expect to\nreceive from a customer in exchange for the promised goods or services and includes an estimate of any variable consideration in the\ncontract. We then allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation and recognize the associated revenue when (or as) our\ncustomer obtains control of the goods or services within the performance obligation.\nIncremental costs of obtaining a contract with a customer are capitalized and amortized consistent with the pattern of\ntransferring the goods or services to which the cost relates when the expected amortization period of the asset is greater than one year.\nIncremental costs are expensed as incurred if the expected amortization period of the asset that we would have recognized is one year\nor less.\nProduct Revenue Recognition\nWe ship XPOVIO in the U.S. to specialty pharmacies and specialty distributors, collectively referred to as our customers, under\na limited number of distribution arrangements with such third parties. Our specialty pharmacy customers resell XPOVIO directly to\npatients, while our specialty distributor customers resell XPOVIO to healthcare entities, who then resell to patients. We also enter into\ncertain arrangements with group purchasing organizations and/or other payors that provide for government mandated and/or privately\nnegotiated rebates, chargebacks, and discounts with respect to the purchase of our products.\nEach unit of XPOVIO that is ordered by our customers represents a distinct performance obligation that is completed when\ncontrol of the product is transferred to the customer. Accordingly, we recognize product revenue when the customer obtains control of\nour product, which occurs at a point in time, generally upon delivery pursuant to our agreements with our customers. If taxes are\ncollected from customers relating to product sales and remitted to governmental authorities, they are excluded from revenue.\nRevenue from product sales is recorded at the net sales price, which includes estimates of variable consideration for which\nreserves are reported. These reserves, as detailed below, are based on the amounts earned, or to be claimed on the related sales, and are\ngenerally classified as reductions of accounts receivable (if the amount is payable to the customer) or a current liability (if the amount\nis payable to a party other than a customer). Certain amounts are known at the time of sale based on contractual terms and are\nrecorded pursuant to the most likely amount method, which is the single most likely amount in a range of possible considerations.\nOther amounts are estimated pursuant to the expected value method, which is the sum of probability-weighted amounts in a range of\npossible consideration amounts. Relevant factors used in the expected value method include: current contractual and statutory\nrequirements, specific known market events and trends, industry data, and forecasted customer buying and payment patterns. These\nreserves reflect our best estimates of the variable consideration based on the terms of the respective underlying contracts.\nThe following are the components of variable consideration related to product revenue:\nCash discounts and distributor fees: We provide customary discounts on XPOVIO sales to our customers for prompt payment,\nthe terms of which are explicitly stated in our contracts with such customers. We also pay fees to our customers for sales order\nmanagement, data, and distribution services, the terms of which are also explicitly stated in our contracts with such customers. Such\nfees are not for a distinct good or service and, accordingly, are recorded as a reduction of revenue, as well as a reduction to accounts\nreceivable (cash discounts) or as a component of accrued expenses (distributor fees).\nProduct returns: Consistent with industry practice, we offer our customers and other indirect purchasers a limited right of return\nfor purchased units of XPOVIO for damage, defect, recall, and/or product expiry (beginning three months prior to the product’s\nexpiration date and ending twelve months after the product’s expiration date). We estimate the amount of product sales that will be\nreturned using quantitative and qualitative considerations, such as visibility into the inventory remaining in the distribution channel.\n122\nReserves for estimated returns are recorded as a reduction of revenue in the period that the related revenue is recognized, as well as a\ncomponent of accrued expenses.\nBased on the distribution model for XPOVIO, contractual inventory limits with our customers, the price of XPOVIO, and\nlimited contractual return rights, we expect minimal XPOVIO returns. We update our estimated return liability each reporting period\nbased on actual shipments of XPOVIO subject to contractual return rights, changes in expectations about the amount of estimated\nand/or actual returns, and other qualitative considerations.\nChargebacks: Chargebacks for fees and discounts represent the estimated obligations resulting from our contractual\ncommitments to provide products to qualified healthcare entities at prices lower than the list prices charged to our customers who\npurchase XPOVIO directly from us. Our customers charge us for the discount provided to the healthcare entities. Chargebacks are\ngenerally determined at the time of resale to the qualified healthcare provider by our customers. Accordingly, reserves for chargebacks\nconsist of credits that we expect to issue for units that remain in the distribution channel inventory at the end of the reporting period\nthat we expect will be sold to qualified healthcare entities, as well as chargebacks that customers have claimed, but for which we have\nnot yet issued a credit. We record reserves for chargebacks based on contractual terms in the same period that the related revenue is\nrecognized, resulting in a reduction of product revenue and accounts receivable. We generally issue credits to the customer for such\namounts within a few weeks after the customer notifies us of the resale to a discount-eligible healthcare entity.\nGovernment rebates: We are subject to discount obligations under state Medicaid programs, Medicare, the Department of\nVeterans Affairs, the Department of Defense, and others. These reserves are recorded in the same period the related revenue is\nrecognized, resulting in a reduction of product revenue and the establishment of a current liability, which is included as a component\nof accrued expenses. For Medicare, we estimate the number of patients in the prescription drug coverage gap for whom we will owe\nan additional liability under Medicare Part D. Our liability for these rebates consists of invoices received for claims from prior and\ncurrent quarters that have not been paid or for which an invoice has not yet been received, estimates of claims for the current quarter,\nand estimated future claims that will be made for product that has been recognized as revenue, but which remains in distribution\nchannel inventories at the end of the reporting period.\nOther incentives: Other incentives offered by us include co-payment assistance, which we provide as financial assistance to\npatients with commercial insurance that requires prescription drug co-payments by the patient. We calculate the accrual for co-\npayment assistance based on estimates of claims and the average co-payment assistance amounts per claim that we expect to receive\nassociated with sales of XPOVIO that have been recognized as revenue but remain in distribution channel inventories at the end of the\nreporting period. Such estimates are based on industry experience with similar products, as well as actual amounts from our product\nsales to date. Any adjustments to such estimated liabilities on units in the distribution channel at period end, as well as actual amounts\nincurred on units sold through the distribution channel during the period, are recorded in the same period that the related revenue is\nrecognized, resulting in a reduction of product revenue and the establishment of a current liability, which is included as a component\nof accrued expenses.\nProduct revenue reserves and allowances: As noted above, cash discounts and chargebacks are recorded as reductions of\naccounts receivable and product returns, distributor fees, government rebates, and other incentives are recorded as a component of\naccrued expenses. Actual amounts of consideration ultimately received may differ from our estimates. If actual results in the future\nvary from our estimates, we will adjust these estimates, which would affect product revenue, net and earnings in the period in which\nsuch variances become known.\nLicense and Asset Purchase Agreements\nWe generate revenue from license or similar agreements with pharmaceutical companies for the development and\ncommercialization of certain of our products and product candidates. Such agreements may include the transfer of intellectual property\nrights in the form of licenses, transfer of technological know-how, delivery of drug substances, research and development services,\nand participation on certain committees with the counterparty. Payments made by the customer may include non-refundable upfront\nfees, payments upon the exercise of options, payments based upon the achievement of defined milestones, and royalties on sales of\nproducts and product candidates if they are approved and commercialized. Our license and asset purchase agreements are detailed in\nNote 5, “License and Asset Purchase Agreements”.\nAt contract inception, we evaluate all goods or services in the agreement to determine if they are distinct. If they are not distinct,\nthey are combined with other promised goods or services to create a bundle of promised goods or services that are distinct. Distinct\ngoods or services and distinct bundles of goods or services are considered performance obligations. Optional future services where\nany additional consideration paid to us reflects their standalone selling prices do not provide the customer with a material right and,\ntherefore, are not considered performance obligations. Optional future services that are priced in a manner which provides the\n123\ncustomer with a significant or incremental discount are considered performance obligations because they provide the customer with a\nmaterial right.\nWe utilize judgment to estimate the transaction price at contract inception. We evaluate contingent milestones to determine if\nthey should be included in the transaction price using the most likely amount method. Milestone payments that are not within our\ncontrol, such as regulatory approvals, are not considered likely of being achieved until those approvals are received and are excluded\nfrom the transaction price using the most likely amount method. The transaction price is then allocated to each performance obligation\non a relative standalone selling price basis, for which we recognize revenue as or when the performance obligations are satisfied. At\nthe end of each reporting period, we re-evaluate our estimate of the transaction price, including the probability of achieving milestone\npayments that may not be subject to a material reversal, and adjust the transaction price if necessary. Any such adjustments are\nrecorded on a cumulative catch-up basis, which would affect license and other revenue in the period of adjustment.\nWe then determine whether the performance obligations are satisfied over time or at a point in time and, if over time, the\nappropriate method of measuring progress for purposes of recognizing revenue. We evaluate the measure of progress, as applicable,\nfor each reporting period and, if necessary, adjust the measure of performance and related revenue recognition.\nWhen consideration is received, or such consideration is unconditionally due, from a customer prior to transferring goods or\nservices to the customer under the terms of a contract, a contract liability is recorded within deferred revenue. Contract liabilities\nwithin deferred revenue are recognized as revenue after control of the goods or services is transferred to the customer and all revenue\nrecognition criteria have been met.\nFor arrangements that include a license of intellectual property and sales-based royalties, including sales-based milestone\npayments, we recognize revenue when the related sales occur because the license of intellectual property is deemed to be the\npredominant item to which the royalties relate.\nWe account for asset purchase agreements under the accounting standards for business combinations and research and\ndevelopment, as applicable. In-process research and development acquired in an asset acquisition is expensed immediately unless\nthere is an alternative future use. Subsequent payments made for the achievement of milestones are evaluated to determine whether\nthey have an alternative future use or should be expensed.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nResearch and development costs are charged to expense as incurred and include, but are not limited to:\n• employee-related expenses, including salaries, benefits, travel and stock-based compensation expense;\n• expenses incurred under agreements with CROs, CMOs and consultants that help conduct clinical trials and preclinical\nstudies;\n• the cost of acquiring, developing and manufacturing clinical trial materials, including comparator products;\n• facilities, depreciation and other expenses, which include direct and allocated expenses for rent and maintenance of\nfacilities, insurance and other supplies; and\n• costs associated with preclinical activities and regulatory operations.\nCosts for certain research and development activities, such as clinical trials, are recognized based on various inputs, including an\nevaluation of the progress to completion of specific tasks using data such as patient enrollment, clinical site activations, and other\ninformation provided to us by our vendors based on their actual costs incurred. Payments for these activities are based on the terms of\nthe individual arrangements, which may differ from the pattern of costs incurred, and are accordingly reflected in our financial\nstatements as prepaid or accrued research and development costs.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSelling, general and administrative costs are charged to expense as incurred and consist primarily of salaries, benefits, travel,\nand other related costs, including stock-based compensation, for personnel in executive, finance, commercial and administrative\n124\nfunctions. Other significant costs include facility costs not otherwise included in research and development expenses, legal fees\nrelating to patent and corporate matters and fees for accounting and consulting services.\nAccounting for Stock-Based Compensation\nWe grant stock-based awards to employees and non-employees, including stock options, restricted stock units (“RSUs”),\nperformance-based restricted stock units (“PSUs”) and shares issued under our employee stock purchase plan (“ESPP”). We account\nfor all stock-based awards at their fair value as of the grant date and recognize compensation expense on the consolidated statements\nof operations on a straight-line basis over the vesting period of the award. We use the Black-Scholes option pricing model to\ndetermine the fair value of stock options as of the grant date. The fair value of RSUs is the quoted closing market price per share of\nour common stock on the Nasdaq Global Select Market on the grant date. Forfeitures are recognized as they occur.\nPSUs are awards which will vest if certain performance goals are achieved over a certain performance period. Certain portions\nof certain PSU awards vest based on continuous service to the Company throughout the performance period even if the performance\ngoal is not achieved. Stock-based compensation expense for PSUs is determined using the grant date fair value, which is the quoted\nclosing market price per share of our common stock on the Nasdaq Global Select Market on the grant date. The grant date fair value of\nPSUs with a market condition also includes a discount that represents the likelihood that the related performance goals will not be\nachieved. Stock-based compensation expense for PSUs with a market condition is recognized on a straight-line basis over the service\nperiod. Market conditions include goals related to the performance of our common stock. Stock-based compensation expense for\nPSUs without a market condition is not recognized until the achievement of the performance goal is deemed probable (the “Probable\nDate”). At the Probable Date, we record a cumulative catch-up expense for the portion of the grant date fair value attributable to the\nperiod from the grant date to the Probable Date. The remaining expense is recognized over the remaining service period on a straight-\nline basis.\nForeign Currency Transactions\nThe functional currency of our subsidiaries in Germany and Israel are the Euro and Shekel, respectively. Foreign currency\ntransaction gains and losses are recorded on the consolidated statements of operations and were immaterial for the years ended\nDecember 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021.\nIncome Taxes\nWe use the liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined\nbased on the difference between the financial reporting and the tax reporting basis of assets and liabilities and are measured using the\nenacted tax rates and laws that are expected to be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. We provide a valuation\nallowance against deferred tax assets unless, based upon the available evidence, it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets\nwill be realized. We have evaluated available evidence and concluded that we may not realize the benefit of our deferred tax assets;\ntherefore, a valuation allowance has been established for the full amount of the net deferred tax assets. We recognize interest and/or\npenalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense. Our state tax provision pertains to income generated by our KPSC\nentity. Our foreign tax provision pertains to foreign income taxes due by our German and Israel subsidiaries, both of which operate on\na cost-plus profit margin basis.\nNet Loss Per Share\nBasic and diluted net loss per common share is calculated by dividing net loss by the weighted-average number of common\nshares outstanding for the periods. Diluted net loss per share is computed by dividing the diluted net loss by the weighted average\nnumber of common shares, including potential dilutive common shares assuming the dilutive effect of outstanding stock options and\nunvested restricted stock units. For periods in which we have reported net losses, diluted net loss per common share is the same as\nbasic net loss per share, since dilutive common shares are not included if their effect is anti-dilutive.\nThe following potentially dilutive securities were excluded from the calculation of diluted net loss per share due to their anti-\ndilutive effect (in thousands):\nAs of December 31,\n2023 2022 2021\nOutstanding stock options 8,621 13,026 12,178\nUnvested RSUs and PSUs 7,666 3,403 2,301\nAs discussed further in Note 10, “Long-Term Obligations”, we have the option to settle the conversion obligation for our 3.00%\nconvertible senior notes due 2025 (the “Notes”) in cash, shares or any combination of the two. Based on our net loss position, there\nwas no impact on the calculation of dilutive loss per share during the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021.\n125\nAs discussed further in Note 8, “Stockholders’ Equity”, there were warrants to purchase up to 9,787,563 shares of our common\nstock outstanding as of December 31, 2023. These warrants were excluded from the calculation of basic and diluted net loss per\ncommon share during the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 as the warrant holders do not have an obligation to share in\nour losses.\nComprehensive Loss\nComprehensive loss consists of net loss and certain changes in stockholders' deficit that are excluded from net loss, which\ncurrently consists of unrealized gains and losses on investments and foreign currency translation adjustments.\n3. Product Revenue\nTo date, our only source of product revenue has been from the U.S. sales of XPOVIO. The following table summarizes activity\nin each of the product revenue allowance and reserve categories (in thousands):\nFees, Rebates,\nDiscounts and and Other\nChargebacks Incentives Returns Total\nBeginning balance at January 1, 2021 $ 2,079 $ 2,193 $ 669 $ 4,941\nProvision (reversal) related to sales in the current year 13,546 7,849 (235) 21,160\nCredits or payments made (13,714) (7,736) (90) (21,540)\nEnding balance at December 31, 2021 1,911 2,306 344 4,561\nProvision related to sales in the current year 17,920 9,979 219 28,118\nCredits or payments made (16,966) (8,551) (21) (25,538)\nEnding balance at December 31, 2022 2,865 3,734 542 7,141\nProvision related to sales in the current year 21,106 11,025 — 32,131\nCredits or payments made (21,455) (10,089) (224) (31,768)\nEnding balance at December 31, 2023 $ 2,516 $ 4,670 $ 318 $ 7,504\nDiscounts and chargebacks are recorded as reductions of accounts receivable, and returns, fees, rebates, and other incentives are\nrecorded as a component of accrued expenses and other liabilities.\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2022, net product revenue of $17.8 million and $23.6 million, respectively, was included in\naccounts receivable, net.\n4. Inventory\nPrior to regulatory approval, we expense costs relating to the production of inventory as research and development expenses in\nthe period incurred. We capitalize the costs incurred to manufacture our products after regulatory approval when, based on our\njudgment, future commercialization is considered probable and the future economic benefit is expected to be realized. We value our\ninventories at the lower of cost or estimated net realizable value. We determine the cost of our inventories, which includes amounts\nrelated to materials and manufacturing overhead, on a first-in, first-out basis. Raw materials and work in process includes all inventory\ncosts prior to packaging and labelling, including raw materials, active pharmaceutical ingredient, and drug product. Finished goods\ninclude packaged and labelled products.\nRaw materials and work in process that may be used for either research and development or commercial sale are classified as\ninventory until the material is consumed or otherwise allocated for research and development. If the material is intended to be used for\nresearch and development, it is expensed as research and development once that determination is made.\nWe assess the recoverability of our inventory each reporting period and write-down any inventory that has become obsolete, that\nhas a cost basis in excess of its estimated realizable value, or that is not expected to be sold or otherwise consumed before expiry.\nInventory write-downs are recorded as cost of sales in the period the impairment is identified.\nCost of sales includes the cost of producing and distributing inventories related to sales of XPOVIO in the U.S. and sales of\nselinexor to our partners who commercialize our products outside of the U.S. Cost of sales is recognized in the period the related sales\noccur and includes compensation expense for employees involved with production and distribution, freight, and indirect overhead\ncosts, as well as third-party royalties payable on net product revenue. Cost of sales may also include excess or obsolete inventory\nadjustment charges, abnormal costs, unabsorbed manufacturing and overhead costs, and manufacturing variances.\n126\nThe following table presents our inventory (in thousands), all of which was related to XPOVIO:\nAs of December 31,\n2023 2022\nRaw materials $ 553 $ 1,370\nWork in process 1,732 1,878\nFinished goods 758 976\nTotal inventory $ 3,043 $ 4,224\nXPOVIO was initially approved by the FDA in July 2019 at which time we began to capitalize costs to manufacture XPOVIO.\nPrior to FDA approval of XPOVIO, all costs related to the manufacturing of XPOVIO and related material were charged to research\nand development expense in the period incurred.\n5. License and Asset Purchase Agreements\nThe following license and asset purchase agreements affected the consolidated financial statements during the years ended\nDecember 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021:\nAntengene License Agreement\nIn May 2020, we entered into an amendment to our May 2018 license agreement (the “Original Antengene Agreement” and, as\namended, the “Amended Antengene Agreement”) with Antengene Therapeutics Limited, a corporation organized and existing under\nthe laws of Hong Kong (“Antengene”) and a subsidiary of Antengene Corporation Co. Ltd., a corporation organized and existing\nunder the laws of the People’s Republic of China, pursuant to which we expanded the territory licensed to Antengene in the Original\nAntengene Agreement for the exclusive development and commercialization rights of selinexor, eltanexor and KPT-9274, each for the\ndiagnosis, treatment and/or prevention of all human oncology indications, as well as verdinexor for the diagnosis, treatment and/or\nprevention of certain human non-oncology indications (“Antengene Licensed Compounds”).\nUnder the terms of the Amended Antengene Agreement, Antengene has the exclusive development and commercialization\nrights for the Antengene Licensed Compounds in mainland China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Macau, South Korea, Brunei, Cambodia,\nIndonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, Vietnam, Australia and New Zealand (the “Antengene\nTerritory”). Under the terms of the Original Antengene Agreement, we received an upfront cash payment of $11.7 million in 2018 and\nin June 2020 we received a one-time upfront cash payment of $11.7 million in connection with the Amended Antengene Agreement.\nWe are also entitled to future milestone payments from Antengene if certain development, regulatory and commercialization goals are\nachieved. Finally, we are also eligible to receive tiered double-digit royalties based on future net sales of selinexor and eltanexor, and\ntiered single- to double-digit royalties based on future net sales of verdinexor and KPT-9274 in the Antengene Territory. In addition,\nupon completion of the manufacturing technology transfer plan, we will grant to Antengene non-exclusive rights to manufacture the\nAntengene Licensed Compounds solely for their development and commercialization in the Antengene Territory.\nAs part of the Amended Antengene Agreement, Antengene also has the right to participate in global clinical studies of the\nAntengene Licensed Compounds and will bear the cost and expense for patients enrolled in such global clinical studies in the\nAntengene Territory. Antengene is responsible for seeking regulatory and marketing approvals for the Antengene Licensed\nCompounds in the Antengene Territory, as well as any development of the products necessary to obtain such approvals. Antengene is\nalso responsible for the commercialization of the Antengene Licensed Compounds in the Antengene Territory at its own cost and\nexpense. Until Antengene manufactures its own drug supply, we will furnish clinical and commercial supplies to Antengene pursuant\nto supply agreements between us and Antengene, the costs of which will be borne by Antengene.\nThe Amended Antengene Agreement will continue in effect on a product-by-product, country-by-country basis until the later of\nthe tenth anniversary of the first commercial sale of the applicable product in such country or the expiration of specified patent\nprotection and regulatory exclusivity periods for the applicable product in such country. However, the Amended Antengene\nAgreement may be terminated earlier by (i) either party for breach of the Amended Antengene Agreement by the other party or in the\nevent of the insolvency or bankruptcy of the other party, (ii) Antengene on a product-by-product basis for certain safety reasons or on\na product-by-product, country-by-country basis for any reason with 180 days prior notice or (iii) us in the event Antengene challenges\nor assists with a challenge to certain of our patent rights.\nWe identified the following performance obligations in the Amended Antengene Agreement: exclusive licenses, initial data\ntransfers, and a stand-ready obligation to provide initial clinical supply for each of the Antengene Licensed Compounds. We also\nidentified as performance obligations the following customer options for each of the Antengene Licensed Compounds that were\n127\noffered at a significant and incremental discount and represent material rights: (i) the material right for additional data transfers; (ii)\nthe material right for additional clinical supply and related substance supply; (iii) the material right for manufacturing technology\ntransfers and licenses; and (iv) the material right for the option for a backup compound, which represents Antengene’s option to select\na replacement compound in the event it elects to discontinue the development of the Antengene Licensed Compounds. All of the\nperformance obligations that received an allocation of the initial transaction price of $11.7 million were fully satisfied as of December\n31, 2020, except for the performance obligations related to eltanexor, which were fully satisfied during the year ended December 31,\n2021. As such, we recognized $0.3 million in revenue when initial clinical supply of eltanexor was delivered to Antengene during the\nyear ended December 31, 2021.\nAll development and regulatory milestones, which represent variable consideration, will be evaluated each reporting period and\nincluded in the transaction price if the milestone is considered likely of achievement and if it is probable that a significant revenue\nreversal will not occur in future periods. Milestones included in the transaction price will be fully recognized in revenue in the same\nreporting period because all performance obligations that received an allocation of the transaction price were fully satisfied as\nDecember 31, 2021.\nAny consideration related to sales-based milestones, as well as royalties on net sales upon commercialization of XPOVIO by\nAntengene, are recognized when the related sales occur, as they were determined to relate predominantly to the intellectual property\nlicenses granted to Antengene.\nMenarini License Agreement\nIn December 2021, we entered into a license agreement (the “Original Menarini Agreement”) with Berlin-Chemie AG, an\naffiliate of the Menarini Group (“Menarini”), pursuant to which we granted Menarini a non-exclusive license to develop, and an\nexclusive license to commercialize, products containing selinexor (the “Product”), for all human oncology indications in the European\nEconomic Area, United Kingdom, Switzerland, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova, Russia, Tajikistan,\nTurkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Ukraine, Turkey, Mexico, all Central America countries and all South America countries (collectively, the\n“Menarini Territory”). In March 2023, the Original Menarini Agreement was amended (the “Amended Menarini Agreement”) to\nexpand the Menarini Territory to include all countries in the continent of Africa and Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Kuwait,\nOman, Qatar, Bahrain, Lebanon, Jordan, Iraq, and Yemen (together with the Menarini Territory, the “Expanded Menarini Territory”).\nIn addition, we granted to Menarini a non-exclusive license to package and label the Product in or outside of the Expanded Menarini\nTerritory for all human oncology indications solely to enable Menarini to commercialize the Product within the Expanded Menarini\nTerritory.\nUnder the terms of the Amended Menarini Agreement, we will use commercially reasonable efforts to develop the Product,\ntransfer any marketing approval or authorization with respect to the Product in the Expanded Menarini Territory to Menarini and to\ncomplete any post-marketing approval or authorization studies required by a regulatory authority as a condition of maintaining the\napproval in any country in the Expanded Menarini Territory. Menarini is obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to apply for\nand obtain marketing approval or authorization of the Product, and to obtain price or reimbursement approval for the Product after\napproval of the relevant marketing approval or authorization, in each country of the Expanded Menarini Territory in each indication\nfor which we have conducted a registrational clinical trial. Menarini is also obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts at its sole\ncost and expense to launch and commercialize the Product in each country of the Expanded Menarini Territory in each indication for\nwhich we have conducted a registrational clinical trial.\nWe received an upfront cash payment of $75.0 million in December 2021 under the Original Menarini Agreement and $3.5\nmillion in April 2023 upon execution of the Amended Menarini Agreement. In addition, we are entitled to receive additional\nmilestone payments from Menarini if certain development and sales performance milestones are achieved. We are further eligible to\nreceive tiered royalties ranging from the mid-teens to mid-twenties based on future net sales of the Product in the Expanded Menarini\nTerritory. The payments owed by Menarini to us are subject to reduction in specified circumstances. Menarini will reimburse us for\n25% of all expenses we incur for the development of the Product during 2022 through 2025, provided that such reimbursements shall\nnot exceed $15.0 million per calendar year. These amounts represent variable consideration and will be recognized as earned.\nThe Amended Menarini Agreement will continue in effect on a country-by-country basis until the last to occur among: (i) the\nfifteenth anniversary of the first commercial sale of the Product in the applicable country, (ii) the expiration of the last-to-expire of the\nlicensed patent rights in the applicable country or (iii) the expiration of any regulatory exclusivity protection covering the Product in\nsuch country. However, the Amended Menarini Agreement may be terminated earlier by either party for (i) an uncured material\nbreach of the Amended Menarini Agreement by the other party (A) on a country-by-country basis with respect to the country to which\nthe breach does not affect the Amended Menarini Agreement as a whole or (B) in its entirety if the breach affects the Amended\nMenarini Agreement as a whole, or (ii) in the event of the insolvency or bankruptcy of the other party. We may also terminate the\nAmended Menarini Agreement for certain patent challenges by Menarini.\n128\nWe assessed this arrangement and concluded that the contract counterparty, Menarini, is a customer. We identified the following\nmaterial promises in the arrangement: the granting of a non-exclusive license to develop, and an exclusive license to commercialize,\nproduct and label the Product, as well as the initial transfer of know-how and information to Menarini. The Amended Menarini\nAgreement provides that we will supply to Menarini, and Menarini will purchase from us, all required quantities of Product for the\nExpanded Menarini Territory in accordance with a supply agreement separately entered into by and between us and Menarini in 2022\n(the “Supply Agreement”). We determined that the promise of the Supply Agreement was not a performance obligation at the outset\nof the arrangement as the rate charged for the Product was not at a significant and incremental discount and therefore did not represent\na material right. We then determined that the granting of the license and the initial transfer of know-how were not distinct from one\nanother and must be combined as a performance obligation (the “Combined Performance Obligation”). Based on these determinations,\nwe identified one distinct performance obligation at the inception of the contract: the Combined Performance Obligation. We further\ndetermined that the up-front payment of $75.0 million constituted the entirety of the consideration included in the transaction price at\ncontract inception, which was allocated to the Combined Performance Obligation. The Combined Performance Obligation was fully\nsatisfied as of December 31, 2021.\nAll development and regulatory milestones, which represent variable consideration, will be evaluated each reporting period and\nincluded in the transaction price if the milestone is considered likely of achievement and if it is probable that a significant revenue\nreversal will not occur in future periods. Milestones included in the transaction price will be fully recognized in revenue in the same\nreporting period because the Combined Performance Obligation was fully satisfied as of December 31, 2021.\nAny consideration related to sales-based milestones, as well as royalties on net sales upon commercialization by Menarini, are\nrecognized when the related sales occur, as they were determined to relate predominantly to the intellectual property licenses granted\nto Menarini.\nNeumedicines Asset Purchase Agreement and Libo License Agreement\nIn November 2020, we entered into an asset purchase agreement (the “Asset Purchase Agreement”) with Neumedicines Inc.\n(“Neumedicines”). Pursuant to the Asset Purchase Agreement, we agreed to acquire certain clinical-stage assets from Neumedicines,\nincluding a proprietary recombinant human interleukin 12 (“Il-12”). The acquisition closed in July 2021 (the “Closing”), having a total\nvalue of approximately $7.4 million. We paid $0.5 million in cash during the year ended December 31, 2020, and at the time of\nclosing, paid $5.5 million in cash and issued 150,000 shares of our common stock to Neumedicines. Further, we will owe\nNeumedicines up to $65.0 million in royalty payments on net product sales of the acquired IL-12 asset (“KPT-1200”) and an\nadditional 75,000 shares of our common stock as well as other contingent and variable cash payments upon the satisfaction of certain\ndevelopment and regulatory milestones. The $7.4 million of consideration was recorded as research and development expense for the\nyear ended December 31, 2021. The $5.5 million cash portion of the consideration paid at the time of closing was recorded as an\ninvesting activity on the consolidated statement of cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2021.\nContemporaneously with the Closing, we entered into a license agreement with Libo Pharma Corp. (“Libo”) under which we\ngranted to Libo an exclusive license to manufacture, develop and commercialize IL-12 products in certain countries in Asia, Africa\nand Oceania. In December 2023, we entered into an amended and restated license agreement with Libo (the \"Amended Libo\nAgreement\") under which we granted to Libo an exclusive license to manufacture, develop and commercialize IL-12 products\nworldwide for all indications except for acute radiation syndrome, which remains limited to certain countries in Asia, Africa and\nOceania.\nSummary of License and Other Revenue\nThe following table presents information about our license and other revenue (in thousands):\nFor the Years\nEnded December 31,\n2023 2022 2021\nMenarini $ 24,360 $ 15,672 $ 75,000\nAntengene 2,713 13,353 30,429\nOther 6,949 7,604 5,954\nTotal license and other revenue $ 34,022 $ 36,629 $ 111,383\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, we recognized (i) $15.0 million of revenue for the reimbursement of development\nrelated expenses, $4.0 million of milestone-related revenue, $3.5 million of license-related revenue, $1.1 million of royalty revenue,\nand $0.8 million of other reimbursement revenue from Menarini; (ii) $1.5 million of royalty revenue, and $1.2 million of other\nreimbursement revenue from Antengene; and (iii) $3.4 million of license-related revenue, $2.5 million of milestone-related revenue,\n$0.5 million of royalty revenue, and $0.5 million of other reimbursement revenue from our other partners.\n129\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, we recognized (i) $15.0 million of revenue for the reimbursement of development\nrelated expenses, $0.3 million of royalty revenue, and $0.4 million of other reimbursement revenue from Menarini; (ii) $7.8 million of\nmilestone-related revenue, $3.8 million of royalty revenue, and $1.8 million of other reimbursement revenue from Antengene; and (iii)\n$5.2 million of royalty revenue and $2.3 million of milestone-related revenue from our other partners.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, we recognized (i) $75.0 million of revenue related to the upfront payment we received\nfrom Menarini; (ii) $29.3 million of milestone-related revenue, $0.8 million of royalty revenue, and $0.3 million of other revenue from\nAntengene; and (iii) $6.0 million of other revenue.\nLicense and other revenue of $9.1 million and $22.5 million were included in accounts receivable, net at December 31, 2023\nand 2022, respectively. License and other revenue of $1.0 million and $7.8 million were included in other current assets at\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n6. Fair Value Measurements\nFinancial instruments, including cash, cash equivalents, accounts receivable, net, other current assets, other assets, restricted\ncash, accounts payable, and accrued expenses, are presented at amounts that approximate fair value at December 31, 2023 and 2022.\nItems classified as Level 2 consist of corporate debt securities, commercial paper, and U.S. government and agency securities.\nWe estimate the fair values of these marketable securities by taking into consideration valuations obtained from third-party pricing\nsources. These pricing sources utilize industry standard valuation models, including both income and market-based approaches, for\nwhich all significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly, to estimate fair value. These inputs include market pricing\nbased on real-time trade data for the same or similar securities, issuer credit spreads, benchmark yields, and other observable inputs.\nWe validate the prices provided by our third-party pricing sources by understanding the models used, obtaining market values from\nother pricing sources and analyzing pricing data in certain instances.\nIn certain cases where there is limited activity or less transparency around inputs to valuation, the related assets or liabilities are\nclassified as Level 3. The embedded derivative liability associated with a Revenue Interest Financing Agreement we entered into with\nHCR in September 2019 and amended in June 2021 and August 2023, as discussed further in Note 10, “Long-Term Obligations”, is\nmeasured at fair value and is included as a component of the deferred royalty obligation on our consolidated balance sheets. The\nembedded derivative liability is subject to remeasurement at the end of each reporting period, with changes in fair value recognized as\na component of other expense, net on the consolidated statements of operations. The valuation method incorporates certain\nunobservable Level 3 key inputs including: (i) the probability-weighted net sales of XPOVIO and any of our other future products,\nincluding worldwide net product sales, upfront payments, milestones and royalties; (ii) our risk-adjusted discount rate; and (iii) the\nprobability of a change in control occurring during the term of the instrument.\nThe following tables present information about our financial assets and liability that have been measured at fair value and\nindicate the fair value hierarchy of the valuation inputs utilized to determine such fair value (in thousands):\nQuoted\nPrices Significant\nin Active Other Significant\nMarkets for Observable Unobservable\nAs of Identical Assets Inputs Inputs\nDescription December 31, 2023 (Level 1) (Level 2) (Level 3)\nFinancial assets\nCash equivalents:\nMoney market funds $ 27,963 $ 27,963 $ — $ —\nU.S. government and agency securities 1,998 — 1,998 —\nInvestments:\nCorporate debt securities 77,961 — 77,961 —\nCommercial paper 13,744 — 13,744 —\nU.S. government and agency securities 47,507 — 47,507 —\n$ 169,173 $ 27,963 $ 141,210 $ —\nFinancial liability\nEmbedded derivative liability $ 2,800 $ — $ — $ 2,800\n130\nQuoted\nPrices Significant\nin Active Other Significant\nMarkets for Observable Unobservable\nAs of December Identical Assets Inputs Inputs\nDescription 31, 2022 (Level 1) (Level 2) (Level 3)\nFinancial assets\nCash equivalents:\nMoney market funds $ 115,498 $ 115,498 $ — $ —\nCommercial paper 7,629 — 7,629 —\nInvestments:\nCorporate debt securities 78,143 — 78,143 —\nCommercial paper 43,914 — 43,914 —\nU.S. government and agency securities 20,722 — 20,722 —\n$ 265,906 $ 115,498 $ 150,408 $ —\nFinancial liability\nEmbedded derivative liability $ 2,800 $ — $ — $ 2,800\n7.

Stockholders’ Equity\nAuthorized Common Shares\nOn May 24, 2023, our stockholders approved an amendment to our Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended, to\nincrease the number of authorized shares of our common stock from 200,000,000 shares to 400,000,000 shares.\nPrivate Placement Offering and Common Share Warrants\nOn December 5, 2022, we entered into a securities purchase agreement with certain institutional investors pursuant to which we\nissued and sold, in a private placement offering of securities, an aggregate of (i) 31,791,908 shares of common stock and (ii)\naccompanying warrants to purchase up to 9,537,563 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $6.36 per share. We received\naggregate net proceeds of approximately $154.7 million. The warrants are exercisable at any time between December 7, 2022 and\nDecember 7, 2027. As of December 31, 2023, none of these warrants have been exercised.\nOn August 1, 2023, in connection with the Second Amendment to the Revenue Interest Agreement, we issued warrants to HCR\nto purchase up to 250,000 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $2.25 per share. The warrants are exercisable through\nAugust 1, 2030. As of December 31, 2023, none of these warrants have been exercised.\nOpen Market Sale Agreement\nOn February 17, 2023, we entered into an Open Market Sale Agreement (the “2023 Open Market Sale Agreement”) with\nJefferies LLC, as agent (“Jefferies”). Under the 2023 Open Market Sale Agreement, we may issue and sell shares of our common\nstock having an aggregate offering price of up to $100.0 million (the “Shares”) from time to time through Jefferies (the “2023 Open\nMarket Offering”). Upon entry into the 2023 Open Market Sale Agreement, we terminated our previous Open Market Sale Agreement\nwith Jefferies, as agent, which we had entered into in August 2018 (the “2018 Open Market Sale Agreement”), pursuant to which we\ncould issue and sell shares of our common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $175.0 million (the “Open Market\nShares”).\nUnder the 2023 Open Market Sale Agreement, Jefferies may sell the Shares by methods deemed to be an “at the market\noffering” as defined in Rule 415(a)(4) promulgated under the Securities Act. We may sell the Shares in amounts and at times to be\ndetermined by us from time to time subject to the terms and conditions of the 2023 Open Market Sale Agreement, but we have no\nobligation to sell any of the Shares in the 2023 Open Market Offering.\nWe or Jefferies may suspend or terminate the offering of Shares upon notice to the other party and subject to other conditions.\nWe have agreed to pay Jefferies commissions for its services in acting as agent in the sale of the Shares in the amount of up to 3.0% of\ngross proceeds from the sale of the Shares pursuant to the 2023 Open Market Sale Agreement. We have also agreed to provide\nJefferies with customary indemnification and contribution rights.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we sold an aggregate of 3,991,652 and 638,341 Open Market Shares,\nrespectively, under the 2018 Open Market Sale Agreement, for net proceeds of approximately $35.1 million and $9.9 million,\nrespectively. We did not sell any Open Market Shares under the 2018 Open Market Sale Agreement nor any Shares under the 2023\nOpen Market Sale Agreement during the year ended December 31, 2023. As of December 30, 2023, $100.0 million of Shares was\navailable for issuance and sale under the 2023 Open Market Sale Agreement.\n9. Stock-based Compensation\nOn May 19, 2022, our stockholders approved the 2022 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2022 Plan”), succeeding our 2013 Stock\nIncentive Plan (the “2013 Plan”), which has expired and under which no further grants may be made. The 2022 Plan provides for the\n132\ngrant of incentive stock options, non-statutory stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock awards, RSU awards and other\nstock-based awards. On May 24, 2023, our stockholders approved an amendment to the 2022 Plan to increase the number of shares of\nour common stock available for issuance under the 2022 Plan by 5,000,000 shares. As of December 31, 2023, there were 8,591,362\nshares available for future grants under the 2022 Plan.\nUnder the terms of the 2022 Plan, 2013 Plan and the 2010 Stock Incentive Plan, which was replaced by the 2013 Plan, we\ngranted stock options, RSUs, and PSUs to our employees, officers, directors, consultants and advisors. Stock options have a ten-year\nterm and an exercise price equal to the fair market value of a share of our common stock on the grant date. Stock options vest over\nfour years with 25% vesting on the one-year anniversary of the grant date and the remainder vesting in equal monthly installments\nthereafter. RSUs generally vest over a period of one to four years in annual installments beginning on the first anniversary of the grant\ndate. PSUs will vest if certain performance goals are achieved over a certain performance period. Certain portions of certain PSU\nawards vest based on continuous service to the Company throughout the performance period even if the performance goal is not\nachieved.\nDuring 2023, 2022, and 2021, we also granted stock options and RSUs through inducement grants outside of our stockholder\napproved equity compensation plans as permitted under the Nasdaq Stock Market listing rules to certain employees to induce them to\naccept employment with us (collectively, “Inducement Awards”). In February 2022, our Board approved the 2022 Inducement Stock\nIncentive Plan (the “2022 Inducement Plan”) under which 850,000 shares of common stock were initially reserved for issuance for\ninducement awards to be granted to newly hired full-time employees. In May 2022 and February 2023, the Board increased the\nnumber of shares reserved for issuance under the 2022 Inducement Plan by 850,000 and 1,200,000, respectively. We assessed the\nterms of these Inducement Awards and determined there was no possibility that we would have to settle these awards in cash and\ntherefore, equity accounting was applied. As of December 31, 2023, there were 874,498 shares available for future grants under the\n2022 Inducement Plan.\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had 25,753,096 shares reserved for issuance, which includes shares available for future grants and\noutstanding stock options, RSUs and PSUs under the 2010 Plan, 2013 Plan, 2022 Plan, and Inducement Awards (including the\nInducement Awards granted under the 2022 Inducement Plan).\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, we accelerated the vesting and extended the exercise date of certain stock-based\nawards granted to our former Chief Executive Officer and former Chief Scientific Officer in connection with their departure from the\nCompany in May 2022. These modifications resulted in the recognition of incremental stock-based compensation expense of $7.4\nmillion.\nStock-based Compensation Expense\nIn connection with all stock-based payment awards, total stock-based compensation expense recognized was as follows (in\nthousands):\nFor the Years Ended December 31,\n2023 2022 2021\nCost of sales $ 370 $ 226 $ 154\nResearch and development 6,529 14,351 11,842\nSelling, general and administrative 14,810 20,822 17,787\nTotal $ 21,709 $ 35,399 $ 29,783\nThe total stock-based compensation expense recognized by award type was as follows (in thousands):\nFor the Years Ended December 31,\n2023 2022 2021\nOptions $ 8,862 $ 21,513 $ 19,288\nRSUs 10,662 12,587 9,348\nPSUs 1,222 — —\nESPP 963 1,299 1,147\nTotal $ 21,709 $ 35,399 $ 29,783\n133\nStock Options\nThe following table summarizes stock option activity related to the 2010 Plan, 2013 Plan, 2022 Plan, and Inducement Awards\n(including the stock option Inducement Awards granted under the 2022 Inducement Plan):\nWeighted- Aggregate\nWeighted- Average Intrinsic\nAverage Remaining Value\nExercise Contractual (in\nOptions Price Term (years) thousands)\nOptions outstanding at December 31, 2022 13,026,359 $ 11.46 5.3 $ 6\nGranted 306,000 $ 2.23\nExercised (13,193) $ 3.46\nForfeited (1,120,412) $ 10.31\nExpired (3,577,944) $ 12.65\nOptions outstanding at December 31, 2023 8,620,810 $ 10.79 5.3 $ —\nOptions exercisable at December 31, 2023 6,739,120 $ 11.59 4.4 $ —\nThe total intrinsic value of stock options exercised for the year ended December 31, 2023 was less than $0.1 million. The total\nintrinsic value of stock options exercised for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 was $0.3 million and $1.0 million,\nrespectively.\nThe fair value of each stock option granted is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The\nfollowing table summarizes the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of the stock option awards:\nFor the Years Ended December 31,\n2023 2022 2021\nVolatility 80% 79%-81% 76%-78%\nExpected term (in years) 5.5-5.9 5.5-6.1 5.9-6.1\nRisk-free interest rate 3.75%-4.21% 1.69%-4.23% 0.62%-1.35%\nDividend —% —% —%\nWe use the simplified method to calculate the expected term as our historical exercise data does not provide a reasonable basis\nupon which to estimate the expected term. The expected term is applied to the stock option grant group as a whole, as we do not\nexpect substantially different exercise or post-vesting termination behavior among our employee population. Our expected stock price\nvolatility assumption is based on the historical volatility of our publicly traded stock. The risk-free interest rate is based on a treasury\ninstrument whose term is consistent with the expected term of the stock options. We account for forfeitures as they occur.\nUsing the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, the weighted-average grant date fair values of options granted during the years\nended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 was $1.54, $5.83 and $7.57 per share, respectively.\nAt December 31, 2023, there was $9.7 million of unrecognized compensation related to unvested stock option awards, which are\nexpected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.7 years.\nRestricted Stock Units and Performance-Based Restricted Stock Units\nThe following is a summary of RSU and PSU activity for the 2010 Plan, 2013 Plan, 2022 Plan, and Inducement Awards\n(including the RSU Inducement Awards granted under the 2022 Inducement Plan):\nNumber of Weighted\nShares -Average\nUnderlying Grant Date\nRSUs and PSUs Fair Value\nUnvested at December 31, 2022 3,402,825 $ 10.35\nGranted 7,075,522 $ 2.84\nForfeited (1,761,720) $ 6.01\nVested (1,050,201) $ 10.55\nUnvested at December 31, 2023 7,666,426 $ 4.40\n134\nAs of December 31, 2023, there was $24.0 million of unrecognized compensation costs related to unvested RSUs and PSUs,\nwhich are expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.9 years.\nEmployee Stock Purchase Plan\nWe have an ESPP that permits eligible employees to enroll in six-month offering periods. Participants may purchase shares of\nour common stock, through payroll deductions, at a price equal to 85% of the fair market value of the common stock on the first or\nlast day of the applicable six-month offering period, whichever is lower. Purchase dates under the ESPP occur on or about May 1 and\nNovember 1 each year. In 2013, our stockholders approved an increase in the number of shares of common stock authorized for\nissuance pursuant to the ESPP to 242,424 shares of common stock, plus an annual increase to be added on the first day of each fiscal\nyear, commencing on January 1, 2015 and ending on December 31, 2023, equal to the lesser of 484,848 shares of our common stock,\n1% of the number of outstanding shares on such date, or an amount determined by the Board (the \"Evergreen Provision\"). On May 24,\n2023, our stockholders approved an amendment and restatement (the “Amended and Restated ESPP”) of our ESPP. The Amended and\nRestated ESPP (i) eliminated the Evergreen Provision and (ii) increased the number of shares of common stock authorized for\nissuance under the ESPP from 2,508,923 shares to 4,008,923 shares.\nAs of December 31, 2023, 1,632,818 shares of our common stock remained available for issuance under the Amended and\nRestated ESPP.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, $1.1 million, $2.3 million and $2.0 million, respectively, was\nwithheld from employees, on an after-tax basis, in order to purchase 638,182, 508,391 and 330,257 shares of our common stock,\nrespectively. As of December 31, 2023, there was $0.2 million of total unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to the\nAmended and Restated ESPP. The expense is expected to be recognized over a period of four months.\nThe fair value of the option component of the shares purchased under the Amended and Restated ESPP was estimated using the\nBlack-Scholes option-pricing model with the following weighted-average assumptions:\nFor the Years Ended December 31,\n2023 2022 2021\nVolatility 77% - 92% 68% - 131% 58% - 68%\nExpected term (in years) 0.5 0.5 0.5\nRisk-free interest rate 4.58% - 5.51% 0.06% - 4.58% 0.03% - 0.06%\nDividend —% —% —%\n10. Long-Term Obligations\n3.00% Convertible Senior Notes due 2025\nOn October 16, 2018, we completed an offering of $150.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 3.00% convertible senior\nnotes due 2025. In addition, on October 26, 2018, we issued an additional $22.5 million aggregate principal amount of the Notes\npursuant to the full exercise of the option to purchase additional Notes granted to the initial purchasers in the offering. The Notes were\nsold in a private offering to qualified institutional buyers in reliance on Rule 144A under the Securities Act. In accordance with\naccounting guidance for debt with conversion and other options, we separately accounted for the liability component (“Liability\nComponent”) and the embedded conversion option (“Equity Component”) of the Notes by allocating the proceeds between the\nLiability Component and the Equity Component, due to our ability to settle the Notes in cash, shares of our common stock or a\ncombination of cash and shares of our common stock, at our option. In connection with the issuance of the Notes, we incurred\napproximately $5.6 million of debt issuance costs, which primarily consisted of underwriting, legal and other professional fees, and\nallocated these costs between the Liability Component and the Equity Component based on the allocation of the proceeds. Of the total\ndebt issuance costs, $2.2 million was allocated to the Equity Component and recorded as a reduction to additional paid-in capital and\n$3.4 million was allocated to the Liability Component and recorded as a reduction of the Notes. The portion allocated to the Liability\nComponent is amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method over seven years.\nIn 2021, upon adoption of ASU 2020-06, we reclassified the Equity Component as of January 1, 2021 and combined it with the\nLiability Component of the Notes, increasing the carrying value of our convertible debt by approximately $50.6 million, with a\ncorresponding decrease to additional paid-in capital of $65.6 million and accumulated deficit of $15.0 million. Our deferred tax\nliability related to the Notes also decreased by approximately $11.8 million, with a corresponding increase in the income tax valuation\nallowance.\n135\nThe Notes are senior unsecured obligations and bear interest at a rate of 3.00% per year payable semiannually in arrears on April\n15 and October 15 of each year, beginning on April 15, 2019. Upon conversion, the Notes will be converted into cash, shares of our\ncommon stock, or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock, at our election. As of October 15, 2022, the Notes are\nsubject to redemption at our option in whole or in part, if the conditions described below are satisfied. Holders may require us to\nrepurchase their Notes following a fundamental change (as defined within the indenture governing the Notes) at a cash repurchase\nprice generally equal to the principal amount of the Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest. The Notes will mature\non October 15, 2025, unless earlier converted, redeemed or repurchased in accordance with their terms. Subject to satisfaction of\ncertain conditions and during the periods described below, the Notes may be converted at an initial conversion rate of 63.0731 shares\nof common stock per $1,000 principal amount of the Notes (equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $15.85 per\nshare of common stock).\nHolders of the Notes may convert all or any portion of their Notes, in multiples of $1,000 principal amount, at their option at\nany time prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding June 15, 2025 only under the following\ncircumstances:\n(1) during any calendar quarter commencing after the calendar quarter ending on December 31, 2018 (and only during such\ncalendar quarter), if the last reported sale price of our common stock for at least 20 trading days (whether or not\nconsecutive) during the period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on, and including, the last trading day of the\nimmediately preceding calendar quarter is greater than or equal to 130% of the conversion price for the Notes on each\napplicable trading day;\n(2) during the five-business day period immediately after any five consecutive trading day period (the “Measurement\nPeriod”) in which the trading price per $1,000 principal amount of Notes for each trading day of the Measurement\nPeriod was less than 98% of the product of the last reported sale price of our common stock and the conversion rate on\neach such trading day;\n(3) if we call the Notes for redemption, until the close of business on the business day immediately preceding the\nredemption date; or\n(4) upon the occurrence of specified corporate events as described within the indenture governing the Notes.\nAs of December 31, 2023, none of the above circumstances had occurred and as such, the Notes could not have been converted.\nAs of October 15, 2022, we may redeem for cash all or part of the Notes at our option if the last reported sale price of our\ncommon stock equals or exceeds 130% of the conversion price then in effect for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive)\nduring any 30 consecutive trading day period ending within five trading days prior to the date on which we send any notice of\nredemption. The redemption price will be 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest,\nif any. In addition, calling any convertible note for redemption will constitute a make-whole fundamental change with respect to that\nconvertible note, in which case the conversion rate applicable to the conversion of that convertible note, if it is converted in\nconnection with the redemption, will be increased in certain circumstances. We did not redeem any of the Notes as of December 31,\n2023.\nThe outstanding balances of the Notes consisted of the following (in thousands):\nAs of December 31,\n2023 2022\nPrincipal $ 172,500 $ 172,500\nLess: debt issuance costs (1,581) (2,395)\nNet carrying amount $ 170,919 $ 170,105\nWe determined the expected life of the Notes was equal to its seven-year term and the effective interest rate was 3.53%. As of\nDecember 31, 2023, the “if-converted value” did not exceed the remaining principal amount of the Notes. The fair value of the Notes\nwas determined based on data points other than quoted prices that are observable, either directly or indirectly, and has been classified\nas Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy. The fair value of the Notes, which differs from their carrying value, is influenced by market\n136\ninterest rates, our stock price and stock price volatility. The estimated fair value of the Notes as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 was\napproximately $87.9 million and $133.1 million, respectively.\nThe following table sets forth total interest expense recognized related to the Notes (in thousands):\nFor the Years\nEnded December 31,\n2023 2022 2021\nContractual interest expense $ 5,175 $ 5,175 $ 5,175\nAmortization of debt issuance costs 814 812 780\nTotal $ 5,989 $ 5,987 $ 5,955\nFuture minimum payments on the Notes were as follows (in thousands):\nFuture Minimum\nYears ended December 31, Payments\n2024 $ 5,175\n2025 177,675\nTotal minimum payments 182,850\nLess: interest expense and issuance costs (11,931)\nConvertible senior notes $ 170,919\nDeferred Royalty Obligation\nIn September 2019, we entered into a Revenue Interest Financing Agreement (“the Revenue Interest Agreement”) with HCR. In\nJune 2021, we, and certain of our subsidiaries, entered into an amendment of the Revenue Interest Agreement (the “Amended\nRevenue Interest Agreement”) with, among others, HCR. We received $75.0 million, less certain transaction expenses, upon closing\nof the Revenue Interest Agreement (the “First Investment Amount”) and $60.0 million upon closing of the Amended Revenue Interest\nAgreement (the “Second Investment Amount” and, together with the First Investment Amount, the “Investment Amount”).\nIn exchange for the above payments, HCR receives payments from us at a tiered percentage (the “Applicable Tiered\nPercentage”) of net revenues of selinexor and any of our other future products, including worldwide net product sales and upfront\npayments, milestones, and royalties. The Applicable Tiered Percentage is subject to reduction in the future if a target based on\ncumulative U.S. net sales of selinexor is met. Prior to the Second Amendment (as defined below) in August 2023, total payments to\nHCR were capped at 185% of the Investment Amount (the \"Payment Cap\").\nUnder the terms of the Amended Revenue Interest Agreement, if HCR had not received 100% of the First Investment Amount\nand 65% of the Second Investment Amount by December 31, 2024 (the \"First Minimum Aggregate Payment\"), or 100% of both the\nFirst Investment Amount and the Second Investment Amount by September 30, 2026, we were required to make a cash payment\nsufficient to gross up the payments to such minimum amounts.\nOn August 1, 2023, we entered into a Second Amendment to the Amended Revenue Interest Agreement (the “Second\nAmendment”) with HCR. The Second Amendment (i) increased the Payment Cap from 185% to 195% of the Investment Amount; (ii)\nextended by six months the payment date of the First Minimum Aggregate Payment from December 31, 2024 to June 30, 2025; and\n(iii) issued warrants to HCR for the purchase of up to 250,000 shares of our common stock with a termination date of August 1, 2030\nand an exercise price of $2.25 per share. Except as set forth in the Second Amendment, all other terms and conditions of the Amended\nRevenue Interest Agreement remain in full force and effect.\nAs the repayment of the funded amount is contingent upon worldwide net product sales and upfront payments, milestones, and\nroyalties, the repayment term may be shortened or extended depending on actual worldwide net product sales and upfront payments,\nmilestones, and royalties. The repayment period commenced on October 1, 2019 for the First Investment Amount and on July 1, 2021\nfor the Second Investment Amount, and expires on the earlier of (i) the date in which HCR has received cash payments totaling an\naggregate of 195% of the Investment Amount or (ii) the legal maturity date of October 1, 2031. If HCR has not received payments\nequal to 195% of the Investment Amount by the twelve-year anniversary of the initial closing date, we will be required to pay an\namount equal to the Investment Amount plus a specific annual rate of return less payments previously paid to HCR. In the event of a\nchange of control, we are obligated to pay HCR an amount equal to 195% of the Investment Amount less payments previously paid to\nHCR. In addition, upon the occurrence of an event of default, including, among others, our failure to pay any amounts due to HCR,\ninsolvency, our failure to pay indebtedness when due, the revocation of regulatory approval of XPOVIO in the U.S. or our breach of\nany covenant contained in the Amended Revenue Interest Agreement and our failure to cure the breach within the prescribed time\n137\nframe, we are obligated to pay HCR an amount equal to 195% of the Investment Amount less payments previously paid to HCR. In\naddition, upon an event of default, HCR may exercise all other rights and remedies available under the Amended Revenue Interest\nAgreement, including foreclosing on the collateral that was pledged to HCR, which consists of all of our present and future assets. As\nof December 31, 2023, we have made $61.7 million in payments to HCR.\nWe have concluded that the features of both the First Investment Amount and Second Investment Amount are similar to those of\na debt instrument. Accordingly, we have accounted for the transaction as long-term debt and presented it as a deferred royalty\nobligation on our consolidated balance sheets. We have also determined that the repayment of 195% of the Investment Amount, less\nany payments made to date, upon a change of control is an embedded derivative that requires bifurcation from the debt instrument and\nfair value recognition, as further described in Note 6, “Fair Value Measurements” to our consolidated financial statements.\nThe effective interest rate as of December 31, 2023 was 15%. In connection with the First Investment Amount, we incurred debt\nissuance costs totaling $1.4 million. Debt issuance costs have been netted against the debt and are being amortized over the estimated\nterm of the debt using the effective interest method, adjusted on a prospective basis for changes in the underlying assumptions and\ninputs.\nThe carrying value of the deferred royalty obligation at December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022 was $129.7 million and\n$129.9 million, respectively, based on $135.0 million of proceeds, net of the fair value of the bifurcated embedded derivative liability\nupon execution of the Revenue Interest Agreement and the Amended Revenue Interest Agreement, and debt issuance costs incurred.\nThe carrying value of the deferred royalty obligation approximated fair value at December 31, 2023 and 2022 and is based on our\ncurrent estimates of future payments to HCR over the life of the arrangement, which are considered Level 3 inputs.\n11. Commitments and Contingencies\nOperating Leases\nWe determine if an arrangement contains a lease at contract inception based on the facts and circumstances in the arrangement.\nLease classification, recognition, and measurement are then determined at the lease commencement date. For arrangements that\ncontain a lease we (i) identify lease and non-lease components, (ii) determine the consideration in the contract, (iii) determine whether\nthe lease is an operating or financing lease; and (iv) recognize lease right-of-use assets and liabilities. Lease liabilities and their\ncorresponding right-of-use assets are recorded based on the present value of lease payments over the expected lease term.\nThe interest rate implicit in lease contracts is typically not readily determinable and as such, we use our incremental borrowing\nrate based on the information available at the lease commencement date, which represents an internally developed rate that would be\nincurred to borrow, on a collateralized basis, over a similar term, an amount equal to the lease payments in a similar economic\nenvironment. In determining the incremental borrowing rate, we consider (i) our estimated public credit rating, (ii) our observable debt\nyields, as well as other bonds in the market issued by other companies with similar credit ratings as us, and (iii) adjustments necessary\nfor collateral, lease term, and inflation or foreign currency.\nMost leases include options to renew and/or terminate the lease, which can impact the lease term. The exercise of these options\nis at our discretion and we do not include any of these options within the expected lease term as we are not reasonably certain we will\nexercise these options. Leases that have a lease term of 12 months or less at commencement date are excluded from this treatment and\nare recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.\nFixed, or in substance fixed, lease payments on our operating lease are recognized over the expected term of the lease on a\nstraight-line basis. Variable lease expenses that are not considered fixed, or in substance fixed, are recognized as incurred. Fixed and\nvariable lease expense on our operating lease is recognized within operating expenses on our consolidated statements of operations.\nWe are party to an operating lease of 98,502 square feet of office and research space in Newton, Massachusetts with a term\nthrough September 30, 2025 (the “Newton, MA Lease”). The lease contains a renewal option for an additional five years which was\nnot included in the lease term as its exercise is not reasonably certain. Pursuant to the Newton, MA Lease, we have provided a security\ndeposit in the form of a cash-collateralized letter of credit in the amount of $0.3 million which is classified within long-term restricted\ncash on the consolidated balance sheets.\nThe Newton, MA Lease provides for increases in future minimum annual rental payments, as defined in the lease agreement.\nThe operating lease expense for each of the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 were $2.8 million. Variable lease costs\npertain to reimbursement of certain landlord expenses and were immaterial for each of the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and\n2021.\n138\nIn addition, we are party to certain short-term leases having a term of twelve months or less at the commencement date. We\nrecognize short-term lease expense on a straight-line basis and do not record a related right-of use asset or lease liability for such\nleases. These costs were immaterial for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021.\nWe review the carrying values of our lease assets for possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate\nthat the carrying amounts of the assets may not be recoverable. We have not recorded an impairment in any period since inception.\nLease Commitments\nAs of December 31, 2023, future minimum lease payments under non-cancellable operating lease agreements for which we have\nrecognized operating lease right-of-use assets and liabilities are as follows (in thousands):\nFuture\nMinimum\nYears ending December 31, Payments\n2024 $ 3,817\n2025 2,918\nTotal minimum lease payments 6,735\nLess: present value adjustment (638)\nOperating lease liabilities $ 6,097\nAs of December 31, 2023, the remaining lease term on the Newton, MA Lease was 1.8 years and the discount rate used to\ncalculate the operating lease liability was 11%.\nLitigation\nFrom time to time we may face legal claims or actions in the normal course of business. There are no outstanding legal claims or\nactions as of December 31, 2023.\n12. Accrued Expenses\nAccrued expenses consisted of the following (in thousands):\nAs of December 31,\n2023 2022\nResearch and development costs $ 19,601 $ 15,600\nCompensation and employee-related costs 16,510 19,625\nInterest 13,454 11,673\nProduct rebates, discounts, reserves, and royalties 4,706 5,110\nOther 7,123 6,407\nTotal accrued expenses $ 61,394 $ 58,415\n13. Property and Equipment, Net\nProperty and equipment are recorded at cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization\nexpense is recorded using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets, generally three to five years.\nLeasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the lease term or the estimated useful economic lives of the related assets.\nExpenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to expense while the costs of significant improvements are capitalized. Upon\nretirement or sale, the costs of the assets disposed of and the related accumulated depreciation or amortization is removed from the\n139\nconsolidated balance sheets and any related gains or losses are reflected on the consolidated statements of operations. Property and\nequipment, net consisted of the following (in thousands):\nAs of December 31,\nEstimated Useful Life\n(In Years) 2023 2022\nLaboratory equipment 4 $ 830 $ 870\nFurniture and fixtures 5 654 654\nOffice and computer equipment 3 809 809\nLeasehold improvements Lesser of useful life or lease term 4,878 5,451\nTotal property and equipment 7,171 7,784\nLess accumulated depreciation and amortization (6,565) (6,645)\nTotal property and equipment, net $ 606 $ 1,139\n14. 401(k) Plan\nWe have a 401(k) retirement and profit-sharing plan (the “401(k) Plan”) covering all qualified employees. The 401(k) Plan\nallows each participant to contribute a portion of their base wages up to an amount not to exceed an annual statutory maximum.\nEffective January 1, 2011, we adopted a Safe Harbor Plan that provides a Company match up to 4% of components of employee\ncompensation. We contributed a match of $3.7 million, $3.1 million, and $2.9 million to the 401(k) Plan for the years ended\nDecember 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\n15. Income Taxes\nWe recorded an income tax provision of $0.3 million, $0.4 million, and $0.3 million, respectively, for the years ended\nDecember 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021. Our current income tax provision consists of state income tax due from our KPSC entity, as well\nas foreign income taxes due from our German and Israel subsidiaries, both of which operate on a cost-plus profit margin. We did not\nhave a deferred income tax provision for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021.\nThe components of income (loss) before income taxes were as follows (in thousands):\nFor the Years Ended December 31,\n2023 2022 2021\nForeign $ 247 $ 892 $ (30,052)\nU.S. (143,023) (165,814) (93,768)\nTotal $ (142,776) $ (164,922) $ (123,820)\n140\nDeferred taxes are recognized for temporary differences between the basis of assets and liabilities for financial statement and\nincome tax purposes. The significant components of our deferred tax assets are comprised of the following (in thousands):\nAs of December 31,\n2023 2022\nDeferred tax assets:\nU.S. and state net operating loss carryforwards $ 198,158 $ 189,629\nResearch and development credits 108,682 100,436\nFixed assets and intangible assets 25,028 27,312\nStock-based compensation 8,500 13,818\nAccruals and other temporary differences 6,380 6,613\nInterest Expense - Sec 163(j) 6,894 9,236\nLease liability 1,461 2,193\nDeferred royalty obligation 8,310 1,805\nCapitalized research and development 47,986 27,748\nDeferred royalty embedded derivative 671 679\nUnicap - Sec 263A 800 1,214\nValuation allowance (411,838) (379,166)\nTotal deferred tax assets 1,032 1,517\nDeferred tax liabilities:\nConvertible debt amortization (7) (5)\nRight-of-use asset (1,025) (1,512)\nTotal deferred tax liabilities (1,032) (1,517)\nNet deferred tax assets $ — $ —\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (“TCJA”) requires taxpayers to capitalize and amortize research and development\nexpenditures under section 174 for tax years beginning after December 31, 2021. This rule became effective for us during 2022 and\nresulted in capitalized research and development costs of $135.9 million and $131.4 million as of December 31, 2023 and 2022,\nrespectively. We will amortize these costs for tax purposes over 5 years for research and development performed in the U.S. and over\n15 years for research and development performed outside the U.S.\nWe have evaluated the positive and negative evidence bearing upon the realizability of our deferred tax assets. Based on our\nhistory of operating losses, we have concluded that it is more likely than not that the benefit of our deferred tax assets will not be\nrealized. Accordingly, we have provided a full valuation allowance for deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2023 and 2022. The\nvaluation allowance increased by approximately $32.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2023 primarily due to increased\ncapitalization of research and development expenditures as required by changes to the tax laws from the TCJA as described above and\nincreased U.S. and state net operating loss carryforwards due to the generation of taxable losses in 2023.\n141\nA reconciliation of income tax expense computed at the statutory federal income tax rate to income taxes as reflected in the\nfinancial statements is as follows:\nFor the Years Ended December 31,\n2023 2022 2021\nFederal income tax expense at statutory\nrate 21.0% 21.0% 21.0%\nState income tax, net of federal benefit 4.0% 4.0% 0.8%\nPermanent differences (1.0)% (3.3)% (2.7)%\nResearch and development credit 7.3% 6.3% 11.3%\nForeign rate differential —% —% (5.2)%\nChange in valuation allowance (22.9)% (29.3)% (35.4)%\nMigrated intellectual property —% —% 13.9%\nStock-based compensation and 162m\nadjustment (5.0)% (2.0)% (4.3)%\nProvision to return adjustments (2.8)% —% (0.5)%\nOther (0.8)% 3.1% 0.9%\nEffective income tax rate (0.2)% (0.2)% (0.2)%\nAs of December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, we had U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $768.5\nmillion, $737.4 million and $735.2 million, respectively, which may be able to offset future income tax liabilities. Of the $768.5\nmillion carryforward as of December 31, 2023, $475.6 million of the carryforward has an indefinite life and $292.9 million will expire\nat various dates through 2037. As of December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, we had U.S. state net operating loss carryforwards of\napproximately $655.7 million, $616.4 million and $590.3 million, respectively, which may be available to offset future state income\ntax liabilities and expire at various dates through 2043. As of December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, we did not have any foreign net\noperating loss carryforwards to offset future foreign income tax liabilities.\nAs of December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, we had federal research and development and orphan drug tax credit carryforwards\nof approximately $99.3 million, $90.9 million and $80.6 million, respectively, available to reduce future tax liabilities, which expire at\nvarious dates through 2043. As of December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, we had state research and development tax credit\ncarryforwards of approximately $11.9 million, $12.0 million and $9.4 million, respectively, available to reduce future tax liabilities,\nwhich expire at various dates through 2038. We completed a study of research and development tax credits through December 31,\n2022 and adjusted our deferred tax asset for the results of that study. For the year ended December 31, 2023, we generated research\ncredits but have not conducted a study to document the qualified activities. This study may result in an adjustment to our research and\ndevelopment credit carryforwards; however, until a study is completed and any adjustment is known, no amounts are being presented\nas an uncertain tax position. A full valuation allowance has been provided against our research and development credits and, if an\nadjustment is required, this adjustment would be offset by an adjustment to the deferred tax asset established for the research and\ndevelopment credit carryforwards and the valuation allowance.\nPrior to executing the Original Menarini Agreement in December 2021, the rights to, among other things, develop, manufacture\nand commercialize selinexor in the Menarini Territory were transferred from our former Bermuda subsidiary, Karyopharm\nTherapeutics (Bermuda) Ltd., to Karyopharm Therapeutics Inc. For tax purposes, the transfer is treated as a return of capital and the\nfair market value of the rights are recorded as an intangible asset that is amortized over a fifteen-year period. The fair market value of\nthe rights was determined to be equal to the $75.0 million upfront payment we received from Menarini and was recorded as a $17.2\nmillion deferred tax asset, fully offset by a valuation allowance.\nUnder the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, the net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards are subject to review and\npossible adjustment by the Internal Revenue Service and state tax authorities. Net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards may\nbecome subject to an annual limitation in the event of certain cumulative changes in the ownership interest of significant shareholders\nover a three-year period in excess of 50 percent, as defined under Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code, respectively, as\nwell as similar state provisions. This could limit the amount of tax attributes that can be utilized annually to offset future taxable\nincome or tax liabilities. The amount of the annual limitation is determined based on the value of us immediately prior to the\nownership change. Subsequent ownership changes may further affect the limitation in future years. Previously, we have completed\nseveral financings since our inception, which have resulted in changes in control as defined by Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal\nRevenue Code. We reduced our deferred tax assets for tax attributes we believe will expire unused. In the future, we may complete\nfinancings that could result in a change in control, which will reduce our deferred tax assets for tax attributes we believe will expire\nunused due to the change in control limitations.\n142\nWe will recognize interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in the income tax provision. As of December 31,\n2023, 2022 and 2021, we had no accrued interest or penalties related to uncertain tax positions and no such amounts have been\nrecognized.\nWe or one of our subsidiaries file income tax returns in the U.S. and various state and foreign jurisdictions. Our federal, state\nand foreign income tax returns are generally subject to tax examinations for the tax years ended December 31, 2020 through\nDecember 31, 2023. To the extent we have tax attribute carryforwards, the tax years in which the attribute was generated may still be\nadjusted upon examination by the Internal Revenue Service, state or foreign tax authorities to the extent utilized in a future period.\n143\nEXHIBIT INDEX\nExhibit\nNumber Description of Exhibit\n3.1 Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Registrant, as amended

(Nasdaq: KPTI), a commercial-stage pharmaceutical company pioneering novel cancer therapies, today reported financial results for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, and highlighted select corporate milestones and progress on its key clinical development programs.\n\n[ ![\\(PRNewsfoto/Karyopharm Therapeutics Inc.\\)](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/1890042/Karyopharm_Therapeutics_Logo.jpg) ](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/1890042/Karyopharm_Therapeutics_Logo.html)\n\n\"We are pleased with the strength of our commercial performance with consecutive quarter-over-quarter growth in the highly competitive multiple myeloma marketplace and look forward to leveraging the foundation that we have built in this indication to serve additional patients. Looking ahead with our improved capital structure following our debt refinancing and disciplined expense management, we are strongly positioned for our next stage of growth, to redefine the standard of care for patients with myelofibrosis and endometrial cancer, driven by selinexor's growing body of compelling clinical and preclinical data in these indications,\" said Richard Paulson, President and Chief Executive Officer of Karyopharm.\n\n**Second Quarter 2024 and Recent Highlights**\n\n**_XPOVIO Commercial Performance_**\n\n  * Achieved U.S. net product revenue of $28.0 million for the second quarter of 2024, compared to $26.0 million for the first quarter of 2024 and $28.5 million for the second quarter of 2023.\n  * XPOVIO net product revenue was supported by quarter-over-quarter growth in both new patient starts and refills.\n  * Continued quarter-over-quarter growth with > 10% growth in the community setting, which represents ~60% of overall net product revenues. In the academic setting, demand for XPOVIO was consistent quarter-over-quarter amidst ongoing competitive pressures, driven by the expanding use of XPOVIO immediately preceding and following T-cell therapies in later lines. The vast majority of XPOVIO new patient mix continues to be in the second to fourth lines of therapy.\n  * Continued global momentum in the second quarter of 2024 with favorable reimbursement decisions in the United Kingdom and South Korea, and additional regulatory approvals in relapsed/refractory (R/R) DLBCL in mainland China and R/R multiple myeloma in multiple international markets.\n\n\n\n**_Research and Development (R &D) Highlights_**\n\n**Myelofibrosis**\n\n  * Pre-clinical data were presented on the mechanism of action for XPO1 inhibition in myelofibrosis targeting multiple oncogenic pathways beyond JAK/STAT, including inhibition of NF-κB-driven proinflammatory cytokines and p53-mediated cell cycle regulation, at the June 2024 European Hematology Association meeting. These data suggest that XPO1 may be fundamental in myelofibrosis, providing the mechanistic rationale for both monotherapy as well as additive, if not synergistic, activity in combination with ruxolitinib, which we believe further supports the promising clinical results, including durable spleen volume reduction and symptom improvement, observed to date from the Phase 1 trial.\n  * Pivotal SENTRY Phase 3 trial of selinexor in combination with ruxolitinib in JAK-naive myelofibrosis continues to enroll with strong momentum, supported by high interest from investigators and minimal competition from other therapies in the JAK-naïve setting; expected top-line data readout on track for 2H 2025.\n\n\n\n**Endometrial Cancer**\n\n  * Long-term follow-up data from a pre-specified exploratory subgroup analysis of patients with advanced or recurrent _TP53_ wild-type endometrial cancer from the SIENDO study (NCT03555422) were presented at \"ASCO Plenary Series: Rapid Abstract Updates\" oral session at the ASCO Annual Meeting in June 2024.\n  * In the exploratory subgroup analysis from the Phase 3 SIENDO Study, 113 patients with _TP53_ wild-type advanced/recurrent endometrial cancer were randomized to receive selinexor (n=77) vs placebo (n=36) as maintenance therapy after 1L platinum-based chemotherapy. As of the April 1, 2024 data cut-off date, and a median duration of follow-up of 36.8 months, selinexor-treated patients had a median PFS of 28.4 months compared to 5.2 months for patients receiving placebo. In selinexor-treated patients with _TP53_ wild-type/pMMR and _TP53_ wild-type/dMMR endometrial cancer, the median PFS was 39.5 months and 13.1 months compared to 4.9 months and 3.7 months in those treated with placebo, respectively. Although immature, overall survival (OS) in the _TP53_ wild-type subgroup was promising, with a hazard ratio of 0.65; median OS for selinexor has not been reached as of the data cut-off date. No new safety signals were identified as of the data cut-off date of April 1, 2024. The most common treatment-emergent adverse events in selinexor treated _TP53_ _wild-type_ patients were nausea (90%), vomiting (60%) and diarrhea (45%), the majority of which were grades 1-2.\n  * The updated SIENDO analysis also highlighted findings from an exploratory quality-adjusted time without symptoms or toxicity analysis (Q-TWiST) used to assess quality and toxicity-adjusted PFS. The findings showed the restricted mean Q-TWiST for selinexor to be 26 months compared to 15 months for placebo, resulting in a difference of nearly 11 months.\n  * Pivotal XPORT-EC-042 Phase 3 trial in _TP53_ wild-type endometrial cancer is now expected to read-out top-line data in early 2026, primarily due to higher-than-expected screen failure rates.\n\n\n\n**Multiple Myeloma**\n\n  * Updated clinical data on SPd (selinexor in combination with pomalidomide and dexamethasone) regimen from STOMP and MM-028 trials were published in the Frontiers of Oncology Journal in May 2024. Both the Phase 1b/2 Selinexor and Backbone Treatments of Myeloma Patients (STOMP) trial (NCT02343042) and the Phase 2b XPORT-MM-028 (NCT04414475) trials are evaluating multiple selinexor combinations, including SPd, in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM). The updated results for SPd 40 mg from these studies showed a median PFS of 18.4 months and a manageable safety profile with no new safety signals.\n  * Pivotal XPORT-MM-031 (EMN29) Phase 3 trial, an oral combination of selinexor 40 mg, pomalidomide and dexamethasone in patients with previously treated multiple myeloma, is enrolling patients at a lower rate than expected in an increasingly global competitive clinical trial environment targeting a similar patient population. Given this evolving environment and the positive SPd 40 mg PFS data published from the STOMP and MM-028 trials, Karyopharm intends to work with the trial's sponsor, the European Myeloma Network, to amend certain aspects of the design for this trial, including a reduction in the number of patients that are targeted for enrollment, and the statistical plan. With these updates, Karyopharm expects top-line data readout in 1H 2025; there remains a potential to seek regulatory approval pending the outcome of the study results.\n\n\n\n**KPT-9274 (Padnarsertib)**\n\n  * KPT-9274, a first-in-class, oral small molecule and a dual inhibitor of PAK4 and NAMPT that was discovered at Karyopharm, was granted two Rare Pediatric Disease Designations (RPDD) by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) and for the treatment of Ewing sarcoma (EWS) in June 2024. The FDA further granted KPT-9274 two Orphan Drug Designations in July 2024 for the treatment of soft tissue sarcoma, which includes RMS, and for the treatment of EWS. RMS and EWS are rare cancers of the bone or soft tissue, primarily diagnosed in pediatric patients, with poor survival outcomes and high unmet need for new therapies. KPT-9274 showed tumor regressions and decreased metastatic properties in pediatric RMS and EWS pre-clinical models. Karyopharm is evaluating out-licensing and/or partnership opportunities for further advancement of this program.\n\n\n\n**Financing Transactions and****2024****Financial Outlook**\n\n  * In May 2024, the Company completed certain financing transactions which extended the vast majority of its debt maturities into 2028 and 2029 and amended its royalty agreement with HealthCare Royalty, further strengthening its balance sheet.\n\n\n\nBased on its current operating plans, Karyopharm has updated its guidance for full year 2024 as follows:\n\n  * Total revenue to be in the range of $145.0 million to $160.0 million as compared to initial guidance of $140.0 million to $160.0 million. Total revenue consists of U.S. XPOVIO net product revenue and license, royalty and milestone revenue earned from partners.\n  * U.S. XPOVIO net product revenue to be in the range of $105.0 million to $120.0 million as compared to initial guidance of $100.0 million to $120.0 million.\n  * R&D and selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses to be in the range of $250.0 million to $265.0 million, which includes approximately $20.0 million estimated non-cash stock-based compensation expense, as compared to initial guidance of $260.0 million to $280.0 million including $20.0 million to $25.0 million of estimated non-cash stock-based compensation expense.\n  * The Company expects that its existing cash, cash equivalents and investments, and the revenue it expects to generate from XPOVIO net product sales, as well as revenue generated from its license agreements, will be sufficient to fund its planned operations into the first quarter of 20261 aided by ongoing disciplined expense management and initiated cost saving measures.\n\n\n\n1 Excluding re-payment of $24.5 million aggregate principal amount of the Company's remaining senior convertible notes due 2025 and $25.0 million minimum liquidity covenant under the senior secured term loan due 2028.\n\n**Second Quarter 2024 Financial Results**\n\n**Total revenue:** Total revenue for the second quarter of 2024 was $42.8 million, compared to $37.6 million for the second quarter of 2023.\n\n**Net product revenue:** Net product revenue for the second quarter of 2024 was $28.0 million, compared to $28.5 million for the second quarter of 2023.\n\n**License and other revenue:** License and other revenue for the second quarter of 2024 was $14.8 million, compared to $9.1 million for the second quarter of 2023. The increase was primarily due to $4.0 million of milestone-related revenue recognized from Menarini in 2024 and a $2.3 million increase in revenue for the reimbursement of development-related expenses from Menarini due to an increase in the corresponding expenses.\n\n**Cost of sales:** Cost of sales for the second quarter of 2024 was $1.5 million, compared to $1.2 million for the second quarter of 2023. Cost of sales reflects the costs of XPOVIO units sold and the costs of products sold to our partners.\n\n**R &D expenses:** R&D expenses for the second quarter of 2024 were $38.4 million, compared to $31.5 million for the second quarter of 2023. The increase was primarily due to an increase in clinical trial and related costs, related mainly to increased activity in our ongoing pivotal Phase 3 trials in myelofibrosis and multiple myeloma, including increased purchases of comparator drugs.\n\n**SG &A expenses:** SG&A expenses for the second quarter of 2024 were $31.1 million, compared to $34.5 million for the second quarter of 2023. The decrease was primarily due to our ongoing cost reduction initiatives and lower headcount.\n\n**Interest income:** Interest income for the second quarter of 2024 was $1.9 million, compared to $2.8 million for the second quarter of 2023.\n\n**Interest expense:** Interest expense for the second quarter of 2024 was $8.9 million, compared to $5.8 million for the second quarter of 2023. The increase in interest expense was due to the Company's new term loan and new secured convertible senior notes.\n\n**Gain on extinguishment of debt and other income:** The Company recognized a non-cash gain on extinguishment of debt of $44.7 million and other income of $14.3 million during the second quarter of 2024, which related to the refinancing transactions that were completed during the second quarter of 2024. \n\n**Net income (loss):** Karyopharm reported net income of $23.8 million, or $0.15 income per basic share and $0.20 loss per diluted share, for the second quarter of 2024, compared to a net loss of $32.6 million, or $0.29 loss per basic and diluted share, for the second quarter of 2023.\n\n**Cash position:** Cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and investments as of June 30, 2024 totaled $152.5 million, compared to $192.4 million as of December 31, 2023.\n\n**Conference Call Information**\n\nKaryopharm will host a conference call today, August 6, 2024, at 8:00 a.m. Eastern Time, to discuss the second quarter 2024 financial results and provide business highlights. To access the conference call, please dial (800) 836-8184 (local) or (646) 357-8785 (international) at least 10 minutes prior to the start time and ask to be joined into the Karyopharm Therapeutics call.

If you would prefer to receive a paper copy of our proxy materials,\nplease follow the instructions included in the Notice.

Technical support will be available starting at 8:45 a.m. on the day of the meeting.\nWhy is the Annual Meeting a virtual, online meeting?\nWe believe that hosting a virtual meeting will facilitate stockholder attendance and participation at the Annual\nMeeting by enabling stockholders to participate remotely from any location around the world. Our virtual meeting will be\n1\ngoverned by our Rules of Conduct and Procedures, which will be posted on the virtual meeting platform on the date of the\nAnnual Meeting. We have designed the virtual Annual Meeting to provide the same rights and opportunities to participate\nas stockholders would have at an in-person meeting, including the right to vote and ask questions through the virtual\nmeeting platform. There will not be a physical meeting location, and stockholders will not be able to attend the Annual\nMeeting in person. We will continue to evaluate the format of our stockholder meetings on an annual basis.\nWhy did you send me these proxy materials?\nWe are providing these proxy materials because our Board is soliciting your proxy to vote at the Annual Meeting.\nThis proxy statement summarizes information related to your vote at the Annual Meeting. All stockholders who find it\nconvenient to do so are cordially invited to attend the Annual Meeting online. However, you do not need to attend the\nmeeting virtually to vote your shares. Instead, you may submit a proxy to vote your shares as described in further detail in\nthe answer to the question “How do I vote?” below.\nThe Notice of Annual Meeting, proxy statement, and voting instructions, together with our 2023 Annual Report,\nwill be made available to each stockholder entitled to vote starting on or about April 19, 2024. These materials are\navailable for viewing, printing and downloading on the Internet at www.proxyvote.com.\nWho can vote at the Annual Meeting and what are the voting rights of such stockholders?\nOnly stockholders of record at the close of business on April 4, 2024 (the “Record Date”) are entitled to vote at the\nAnnual Meeting. On the Record Date, there were 116,465,736 shares of our common stock outstanding and entitled to\nvote (each share entitles its holder to one vote). Common stock is our only class of stock outstanding.\nMay I see a list of stockholders entitled to vote as of the Record Date?\nA list of registered stockholders as of the close of business on the Record Date will be available for examination by\nany stockholder for any purpose germane to the Annual Meeting for a period of 10 days ending on the day before the\nAnnual Meeting. If you wish to view this list, please contact our Corporate Secretary at Karyopharm Therapeutics Inc., 85\nWells Avenue, Newton, Massachusetts 02459, Attention: Corporate Secretary, (617) 658-0600.\nWhat is the purpose of the Annual Meeting?\nAt the Annual Meeting, stockholders will consider and vote on the following matters:\n(1) To elect the following three Class II directors nominated by our Board to serve as directors, each to hold\noffice for a three-year term to expire at the 2027 annual meeting of stockholders and until their resignation or\nremoval or until their successors are duly elected and qualified: Deepika R.

You must specify how you want your shares voted or your Internet proxy cannot be\ncompleted and you will receive an error message.

You must submit your telephonic proxy before 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on May 28, 2024, the\nday before the Annual Meeting, for your telephonic proxy to be valid and for your vote to count.\n• By Mail: If you received a printed copy of the proxy materials, complete and sign the enclosed proxy card\nand mail it in the enclosed envelope, postage prepaid, to Vote Processing, c/o Broadridge, 51 Mercedes Way,\nEdgewood, NY 11717, where the proxy card must be received no later than May 28, 2024, the day before the\nAnnual Meeting, for it to be valid and for your vote to count. Your shares will be voted according to your\ninstructions. If you return your proxy card but do not specify how you want your shares voted on any\nparticular matter, they will be voted in accordance with the recommendations of our Board.\n• Online while virtually attending the Annual Meeting: You may vote your shares online while virtually\nattending the Annual Meeting by visiting www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/KPTI2024. You will need\nyour control number included on your Notice or proxy card in order to be able to vote during the Annual\nMeeting.\nIf your shares are held in “street name,” meaning they are held for your account by a Nominee, you may submit\nvoting instructions or vote your shares by any of the following methods:\n• Over the Internet prior to the Annual Meeting or by Telephone: You will receive instructions from your\nNominee if they permit you to submit voting instructions over the Internet or by telephone. You should follow\nthose instructions.\n• By Mail: You will receive instructions from your Nominee explaining how you can submit voting\ninstructions by mail. You should follow those instructions.\n• Online while virtually attending the Annual Meeting: You will receive instructions from your Nominee\nexplaining how you can vote your shares online during the Annual Meeting. You will need your control\nnumber included on the Notice or voting instruction form in order to demonstrate proof of beneficial\nownership and to be able to vote during the Annual Meeting.\nIf you hold your shares of our common stock in multiple accounts, you should vote your shares or submit a proxy as\ndescribed above for each account.\n3\nCan I revoke or change my vote?\nIf your shares are registered directly in your name, you may revoke your proxy and change your vote at any time\nbefore the Annual Meeting. To do so, you must do one of the following:\n• Submit a proxy over the Internet or by telephone prior to the Annual Meeting as instructed above. Only your\nlatest Internet or telephonic proxy submitted prior to the Annual Meeting will be counted. You may not\nrevoke or change your proxy over the Internet or by telephone after 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on May 28,\n2024.\n• Sign a new proxy card and submit it by mail to Vote Processing, c/o Broadridge, 51 Mercedes Way,\nEdgewood, NY 11717, where the proxy card must be received no later than May 28, 2024. Only your latest\ndated proxy will be counted.\n• Attend the virtual Annual Meeting and vote online as instructed above. Attending the virtual Annual Meeting\nalone will not revoke your Internet proxy, telephonic proxy, or proxy submitted by mail, as the case may be.\n• Provide our Corporate Secretary written notice before or at the Annual Meeting that you want to revoke your\nproxy.\nIf your shares are held in “street name,” you may submit new voting instructions with a later date by contacting\nyour Nominee. You may also vote your shares online while virtually attending the Annual Meeting, which will have the\neffect of revoking any previously submitted voting instructions.\nWill my shares be voted if I do not return my proxy or do not provide specific voting instructions on the proxy\ncard or voting instruction form that I submit?\nIf your shares are registered directly in your name, your shares will not be voted if you do not submit a proxy\nover the Internet, by telephonic vote or by returning your proxy by mail prior to the Annual Meeting, or attend and vote\nonline at the virtual Annual Meeting. If you submit a proxy card without giving specific voting instructions on one or\nmore matters listed in the Notice, your shares will be voted as recommended by our Board on such matters, and as the\nproxyholders may determine in their discretion how to vote with respect to the matters properly presented for a vote at the\nAnnual Meeting.\nIf your shares are held in “street name,” your Nominee may, under certain circumstances, vote your shares if you\ndo not timely return your voting instructions. Stock exchange rules permit a broker to vote shares held in a brokerage\naccount on certain proposals if the broker does not receive voting instructions from you. Stock exchange rules, however,\nprohibit brokers from voting uninstructed shares in the case of election of directors, executive compensation matters and\ncertain other matters. Of the matters to be voted on at the Annual Meeting, we expect the only proposal on which brokers\nwill have discretionary voting authority is the ratification of the appointment of our independent registered public\naccounting firm (Proposal 6).\nA “broker non-vote” results on a matter when your broker returns a proxy but does not vote on a particular proposal\nbecause it does not have discretionary authority to vote on that proposal and has not received voting instructions from you.\nWe encourage you to timely provide voting instructions to your Nominee. This ensures that your shares will be\nvoted at the Annual Meeting according to your instructions. You should receive directions from your Nominee about how\nto submit your voting instructions to them.\nWhat constitutes a quorum at the Annual Meeting?\nA quorum is needed to hold a valid meeting. A quorum will be present if the holders of at least a majority in voting\npower of the shares of common stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote on the Record Date are present at the\nvirtual Annual Meeting either “in person” virtually or as represented by proxy. For purposes of establishing a quorum,\nabstentions and broker non-votes are counted as present or represented. If a quorum is not present, we expect to adjourn\nthe Annual Meeting until we obtain a quorum. The presence at the Annual Meeting, in person or by proxy, of holders\nrepresenting a majority in voting power of our outstanding common stock as of the Record Date, or 58,232,869 shares,\n4\nconstitutes a quorum at the Annual Meeting, permitting us to conduct the business of the Annual Meeting. Shares present\nvirtually during the Annual Meeting will be considered shares of common stock present in person at the meeting.\nWhat vote is required to approve each matter and how are votes counted?\nProposal 1 - Election of Directors\nThe three nominees for director to receive the highest number of votes FOR election will be elected as Class II\ndirectors. This is called a plurality. Shares held in street name by Nominees who indicate on their proxies that they do not\nhave authority to vote the shares on Proposal 1 will not be counted as votes FOR or WITHHELD from any director\nnominee and will be treated as broker non-votes. Broker non-votes will have no effect on the voting on Proposal 1.\nYou may:\n• vote FOR all nominees;\n• vote FOR one or more nominees and WITHHOLD your vote from the other nominee or nominees; or\n• WITHHOLD your vote from all nominees.\nVotes that are withheld will not be included in the vote tally for the election of directors and will not affect the vote\nresults.\nProposal 2 - Approval of an Amendment to our 2022 Plan to Increase the Number of Shares of our Common\nStock Available for Issuance Thereunder by 6,000,000 Shares\nTo approve Proposal 2, stockholders holding a majority of the votes cast on the matter must vote FOR the proposal.\nShares held in street name by Nominees who indicate on their proxies that they do not have authority to vote the shares on\nProposal 2 will not be counted as votes FOR or AGAINST Proposal 2 and will be treated as broker non-votes. Broker\nnon-votes will have no effect on the voting on Proposal 2. If you vote to ABSTAIN on Proposal 2, your shares will not be\nvoted FOR or AGAINST the proposal and will also not be counted as votes cast or shares voting on Proposal 2. As a\nresult, voting to ABSTAIN will have no effect on the voting on Proposal 2.\nProposal 3 - Approval of an Amendment to our Amended & Restated ESPP to Increase the Number of\nShares of our Common Stock Available for Issuance Thereunder by 5,000,000 Shares\nTo approve Proposal 3, stockholders holding a majority of the votes cast on the matter must vote FOR the proposal.\nShares held in street name by Nominees who indicate on their proxies that they do not have authority to vote the shares on\nProposal 3 will not be counted as votes FOR or AGAINST Proposal 3 and will be treated as broker non-votes. Broker\nnon-votes will have no effect on the voting on Proposal 3. If you vote to ABSTAIN on Proposal 3, your shares will not be\nvoted FOR or AGAINST the proposal and will also not be counted as votes cast or shares voting on Proposal 3. As a\nresult, voting to ABSTAIN will have no effect on the voting on Proposal 3.\nProposal 4 - Approval of a One-Time Stock Option Exchange Program for Non-Executive Officer Employees\nTo approve Proposal 4, stockholders holding a majority of the votes cast on the matter must vote FOR the proposal.\nShares held in street name by Nominees who indicate on their proxies that they do not have authority to vote the shares on\nProposal 4 will not be counted as votes FOR or AGAINST Proposal 4 and will be treated as broker non-votes. Broker\nnon-votes will have no effect on the voting on Proposal 4. If you vote to ABSTAIN on Proposal 4, your shares will not be\nvoted FOR or AGAINST the proposal and will also not be counted as votes cast or shares voting on Proposal 4. As a\nresult, voting to ABSTAIN will have no effect on the voting on Proposal 4.\nProposal 5 - Advisory Vote on the Compensation of Our Named Executive Officers\nTo approve Proposal 5, stockholders holding a majority of the votes cast on the matter must vote FOR the approval\nof the compensation of our NEOs, as described in this proxy statement. Shares held in street name by Nominees who\nindicate on their proxies that they do not have authority to vote the shares on Proposal 5 will not be counted as votes FOR\nor AGAINST Proposal 5 and will be treated as broker non-votes. Broker non-votes will have no effect on the voting on\nProposal 5. If you vote to ABSTAIN on Proposal 5, your shares will not be voted FOR or AGAINST the proposal and\n5\nwill also not be counted as votes cast or shares voting on Proposal 5. As a result, voting to ABSTAIN will have no effect\non the voting on Proposal 5. As an advisory vote, this proposal is not binding. The outcome of this advisory vote will not\noverrule any decision by us or our Board (or any committee thereof). However, our Compensation Committee and our\nBoard value the opinions expressed by our stockholders in their vote on this proposal and will consider the outcome of the\nvote when making future compensation decisions for our NEOs.\nProposal 6 - Ratification of the Appointment of our Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo approve Proposal 6, stockholders holding a majority of the votes cast on the matter must vote FOR the proposal.\nIf your shares are held by your Nominee in “street name” and you do not timely provide voting instructions with respect\nto your shares, we expect that your Nominee will have the authority to vote your shares on Proposal 6. If you vote to\nABSTAIN on Proposal 6, your shares will not be voted FOR or AGAINST the proposal and will also not be counted as\nvotes cast or shares voting on Proposal 6. As a result, voting to ABSTAIN will have no effect on the voting on Proposal 6.\nAlthough stockholder ratification of our Audit Committee’s appointment of Ernst & Young LLP as our independent\nregistered public accounting firm for the year ending December 31, 2024 is not required, we believe that it is advisable to\ngive stockholders an opportunity to ratify this appointment. If this proposal is not approved at the Annual Meeting, our\nAudit Committee and Board will reconsider the appointment of Ernst & Young LLP as our independent registered public\naccounting firm for future service.\nHow does the Board recommend that I vote on the proposals?\nOur Board recommends that you vote:\n• FOR the election of the three nominees to serve as Class II directors on our Board for a three-year term to\nexpire at the 2027 annual meeting of stockholders and until their resignation or removal or until their\nsuccessors are duly elected and qualified;\n• FOR the approval of an amendment to our 2022 Plan to increase the number of shares of our common stock\navailable for issuance thereunder by 6,000,000 shares;\n• FOR the approval of an amendment to our Amended & Restated ESPP to increase the number of shares of\nour common stock available for issuance thereunder by 5,000,000 shares;\n• FOR the approval of a one-time stock option exchange program for non-executive officer employees;\n• FOR the approval of the compensation of our NEOs; and\n• FOR the ratification of the appointment of Ernst & Young LLP as our independent registered public\naccounting firm for the year ending December 31, 2024.\nAre there other matters to be voted on at the Annual Meeting?\nWe do not know of any matters that may come before the Annual Meeting other than Proposals 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6. If\nany other matters are properly presented at the Annual Meeting, the persons named in the accompanying proxy intend to\nvote, or otherwise act, in accordance with their judgment on the matter.\nHow do I submit a question at the virtual Annual Meeting?\nWe invite appropriate questions pertinent to the Company and the matters to be voted on at the Annual Meeting.\nWe will not be providing a business update at the Annual Meeting or discussing matters related to our business or\noperations. If there are any matters of individual concern to a stockholder or not related to the matters to be voted on at the\nAnnual Meeting, or if a question was not otherwise answered, such matters may be raised separately after the Annual\nMeeting by contacting Investor Relations at https://investors.karyopharm.com/contact-us.\nIf you wish to submit a question on the day of the Annual Meeting, beginning at 8:45 a.m. Eastern Time, you may\nlog into the virtual meeting platform at www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/KPTI2024, proceed to the “Ask A Question”\narea on the lower left side of the screen, select a “Question Topic” from the drop down menu, type your question where it\nstates “Enter Question” and click the “Submit” tab. Our virtual meeting will be governed by our Rules of Conduct and\n6\nProcedures, which will be posted at www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/KPTI2024 during the Annual Meeting. The\nRules of Conduct and Procedures will address the ability of stockholders to ask questions during the meeting, including\nrules on permissible topics, and rules for how questions and comments will be recognized. We will answer appropriate\nquestions that are pertinent to the Company and the matters to be voted on by the stockholders at the Annual Meeting.\nBecause time is limited at the Annual Meeting, we may not be able to answer all questions that are submitted. To promote\nfairness, efficiently use the Company’s resources and address all stockholder questions, we will limit each stockholder to\none question, which should be succinct and should cover only one topic. Questions from multiple stockholders on the\nsame topic or that are otherwise related may be grouped, summarized and answered together.\nHow are we soliciting proxies and tabulating votes?\nWe will pay all of the costs of soliciting proxies. In addition to these proxy materials, our directors, officers, and\nother employees may also solicit proxies in person or by mail, telephone, fax or email without additional compensation.\nWe have retained Alliance Advisors, LLC, a proxy solicitation firm, to assist in the solicitation of proxies for a fee of\napproximately $29,000, plus expenses. We will also reimburse brokerage firms, banks and other agents for the cost of\nforwarding proxy materials to beneficial owners. Votes will be tabulated by Broadridge. If you have any questions or need\nassistance with voting please contact Alliance Advisors.\nAlliance Advisors\n200 Broadacres Drive\nBloomfield, NJ 07003\n877-495-1344\nKPTI@AllianceAdvisors.com\nHow do I obtain an Annual Report on Form 10-K?\nIf you would like a copy of our 2023 Annual Report, we will send you one without charge.

Final voting results will be published in a\ncurrent report on Form 8-K that we expect to file with the SEC within four business days after the Annual Meeting. If\nfinal voting results are not available to us in time to file a Form 8-K within four business days after the Annual Meeting,\nwe intend to file a Form 8-K to publish preliminary results and, within four business days after the final results are known\nto us, file an amended Form 8-K to publish the final results.\n7\nPROPOSAL 1:\nELECTION OF DIRECTORS\nOur Board is divided into three classes, with one class of our directors standing for election each year to serve for a\nthree-year term. Directors for each class are elected at the annual meeting of stockholders held in the year in which the\nterm for their class expires and hold office until their resignation or removal or until their successors are duly elected and\nqualified. In accordance with our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, our Board may fill existing vacancies on the\nBoard by appointment.\nThe term of office of our Class II directors, Deepika R. Pakianathan, Ph.D., Richard Paulson, M.B.A. and Chen\nSchor, M.B.A., C.P.A., will expire at the Annual Meeting. Accordingly, the nominees for Class II director for election at\nthe Annual Meeting are Dr. Pakianathan and Messrs. Paulson and Schor. If Dr. Pakianathan and Messrs. Paulson and\nSchor are elected at the Annual Meeting, each such individual will be elected to serve for a three-year term that will expire\nat our 2027 annual meeting of stockholders and until such individual’s successor is duly elected and qualified.\nIf no contrary indication is made, proxies are to be voted for Dr. Pakianathan and Messrs. Paulson and Schor, or in\nthe event that any of Dr. Pakianathan or Messrs. Paulson or Schor is not a candidate or is unable to serve as a director at\nthe time of the election (which is not currently expected), for any nominee who is designated by our Board to fill the\nvacancy.\nOur Board currently consists of eight members. We have no formal policy regarding board diversity, but our\nCorporate Governance Guidelines provide that the background and qualifications of the members of our Board considered\nas a group should provide a significant breadth of experience, knowledge, and ability to assist our Board in fulfilling its\nresponsibilities. Our priority in the selection of board members is: (a) identification of members who will further the\ninterests of our stockholders through his or her established record of professional accomplishment; (b) ability to contribute\npositively to the collaborative culture among board members; (c) knowledge of our business; (d) understanding of the\ncompetitive landscape; and (e) adherence to high ethical standards.

This\nsection describes key corporate governance practices that we have adopted, including our Code of Ethics and Business\nConduct, which applies to all of our officers, directors and employees, Corporate Governance Guidelines, and charters for\nour Board of Directors’ Audit Committee, Compensation Committee, Nominating, Corporate Governance & Compliance\nCommittee, and Commercialization and Portfolio Committee. We have posted copies of our Code of Ethics and Business\nConduct and the Corporate Governance Guidelines, as well as each of our committee charters, under the heading\n“Corporate Governance” in the “Investors” section of our website, www.karyopharm.com, which you can access free of\ncharge. Information contained on the website is not incorporated by reference in, or considered part of, this proxy\nstatement. We intend to disclose on our website any amendments to, or waivers from, our Code of Ethics and Business\nConduct that are required to be disclosed by law or the Listing Rules of the Nasdaq Stock Market (“Nasdaq”). We will\nalso provide copies of these documents as well as our other corporate governance documents, free of charge, to any\nstockholder upon written request to Karyopharm Therapeutics Inc., 85 Wells Avenue, Newton, Massachusetts 02459,\nAttention: Investor Relations.\nDirector Independence\nRule 5605 of the Nasdaq Listing Rules requires a majority of a listed company’s board of directors to be comprised\nof independent directors. In addition, the Nasdaq Listing Rules require that, subject to specified exceptions, each member\nof a listed company’s audit, compensation and nominations committees be independent and that audit and compensation\ncommittee members also satisfy independence criteria set forth in Rule 10A-3 and Rule 10C-1, respectively, under the\nSecurities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”).\nUnder Rule 5605(a)(2) of the Nasdaq Listing Rules, a director will only qualify as an “independent director” if, in\nthe opinion of our Board, that person does not have a relationship that would interfere with the exercise of independent\njudgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director. In order to be considered independent for purposes of Rule\n10A-3 of the Exchange Act, a member of an audit committee of a listed company may not, other than in his or her\ncapacity as a member of the audit committee, the board of directors, or any other board committee, accept, directly or\nindirectly, any consulting, advisory, or other compensatory fee from the listed company or any of its subsidiaries or\notherwise be an affiliated person of the listed company or any of its subsidiaries.\nIn addition, in affirmatively determining the independence of any director who will serve on a company’s\ncompensation committee, Rule 10C-1 under the Exchange Act requires that a company’s board of directors consider all\nfactors specifically relevant to determining whether a director has a relationship to such company which is material to that\ndirector’s ability to be independent from management in connection with the duties of a compensation committee\nmember, including, but not limited to: (a) the source of compensation of the director, including any consulting, advisory\nor other compensatory fee paid by such company to the director; and (b) whether the director is affiliated with the\ncompany or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates.\nOur Board has reviewed the composition of our Board and its committees and the independence of each director.\nBased upon information requested from and provided by each director concerning his or her background, employment and\naffiliations, including family relationships, our Board has determined that each of our directors, with the exception of Mr.\nPaulson, is an “independent director” as defined under Rule 5605(a)(2) of the Nasdaq Listing Rules. In making this\ndetermination, our Board considered the consulting agreement we have in place with Dr. Mirza and concluded that this\narrangement does not constitute a relationship that would interfere with such director’s exercise of independent judgment\nin carrying out his responsibilities as a director. Our Board also determined that Messrs. Bohlin and Schor and Dr.\nPakianathan, who currently comprise our Audit Committee; Dr. Pakianathan, Mr. Greene and Ms. Oliger, who currently\ncomprise our Compensation Committee; and Messrs. Greene, Bohlin, and Schor, who currently comprise our Nominating,\nCorporate Governance & Compliance Committee, satisfy the independence standards for such committees established by\nthe SEC and the Nasdaq Listing Rules, as applicable. Our Board also determined that Dr. Honig, a former director, was an\n“independent director” prior to his resignation from our Board effective as of December 31, 2023.\n13\nThere are no family relationships among any of our directors or executive officers.\nBoard Leadership Structure\nOur bylaws and Corporate Governance Guidelines provide our Board with flexibility to combine or separate the\npositions of Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer and/or to implement the role of Lead Independent\nDirector in accordance with its determination that utilizing one or the other structure would be in the best interests of the\nCompany.\nAt this time, we do not have a Chairman of the Board, though our Board appointed Mr. Greene to serve as Lead\nIndependent Director in 2015. While our Board believes that oversight of the Company is the responsibility of our Board\nas a whole, and this responsibility can be properly discharged without a Chairman or Lead Independent Director, our\nBoard determined that appointing Mr. Greene as Lead Independent Director would facilitate interactions between our\nChief Executive Officer and the other independent directors and would enable the Board and the Company to utilize Mr.\nGreene’s breadth of experience across many strategic and operational matters in biotechnology companies.\nMr. Greene serves as a liaison between our President and Chief Executive Officer and our independent directors. He\nmeets regularly and communicates directly with the independent directors outside the presence of management and\nreports any comments and concerns of the independent directors to our President and Chief Executive Officer. He also\nmeets regularly with our senior management to discuss operational and strategic matters. Mr. Greene presides over\nexecutive sessions of the Board and provides our President and Chief Executive Officer with an annual review, as well as\nregular feedback, based on the consensus views collected from members of our Board.\nWhile our President and Chief Executive Officer facilitates communications between members of our Board and\nworks with management in the preparation of the agenda for each meeting of the Board, Mr. Greene also has an important\nrole in establishing the agenda, determining what information is provided to our Board and coordinating with management\nto ensure that sufficient meeting time is allocated to each agenda item. Additionally, all of our directors are encouraged to\nmake suggestions for agenda items or pre-meeting materials for meetings of our Board.\nOur Board has concluded that the current leadership structure described above is appropriate at this time. However,\nour Board will continue to periodically review our leadership structure and may make such changes in the future, as it\ndeems appropriate.\nThe Board’s Role in Risk Oversight\nOur Board has responsibility for the oversight of the Company’s risk management processes and, either as a whole\nor through its committees, regularly discusses with management our major risk exposures, the potential impact of these\nrisks on our business and the steps we take to manage them. The risk oversight process includes receiving regular reports\nfrom Board committees and members of senior management to enable our Board to understand the Company’s risk\nidentification, risk management and risk mitigation strategies with respect to areas of potential material risk, including the\nCompany’s corporate strategy, business objectives, compliance, financial condition, legal, regulatory, commercial,\ninformation technology and reputational risk. The committees of the Board execute their risk oversight responsibility for\nrisk management as follows:\n• The Audit Committee reviews information regarding liquidity and operations and oversees our management\nof financial risks as well as risks associated with cybersecurity. Periodically, the Audit Committee reviews\nour policies with respect to risk assessment, risk management, loss prevention and financial-related regulatory\ncompliance. Oversight by the Audit Committee includes direct communication with our external auditors, and\ndiscussions with management regarding significant risk exposures and the actions management has taken to\nlimit, monitor or control such exposures.\n• The Compensation Committee is responsible for the design and oversight of our executive compensation\nphilosophy, policies, plans and practices, including ensuring that our overall executive compensation program\nappropriately links pay to performance and aligns the interests of our executives with our stockholders and\nthat the elements of our compensation programs mitigate excessive risk-taking. The Compensation\nCommittee also reviews succession planning for our executive officers.\n14\n• The Nominating, Corporate Governance & Compliance Committee manages risks associated with the\nindependence of members of our Board, corporate disclosure practices, potential conflicts of interest, and\ncorporate responsibility and sustainability efforts, including the impact of environment, social and governance\n(“ESG”) issues. The Nominating, Corporate Governance & Compliance Committee also provides oversight of\nour non-financial compliance program by monitoring our compliance policies, standards, procedures, systems\nand initiatives as well as oversight of our quality, regulatory and commercial compliance programs.\nWhile each committee is responsible for evaluating certain risks and overseeing the management of such risks, the\nentire Board is regularly informed through committee reports about such risks. Matters of significant risk are considered\nby our Board as a whole.\nHuman Capital\nWe believe that the success of our business is fundamentally due to our greatest asset, our employees. To that end,\nwe have invested significant resources toward the attraction, retention and development of our people and the promotion\nof diversity in our workforce.

As such, we\nprovide our employees and their families with access to a variety of innovative, flexible and convenient health and\nwellness programs, including benefits that provide protection and security so they can have peace of mind concerning\nevents that may require time away from work or that impact their financial well-being. Our full-time employees are all\neligible to participate in our health, vision, dental, life, and long-term disability insurance plans. To encourage employees\nto keep up with routine medical care and participate in our wellness program, we fund a Health Reimbursement Account\nfor participating employees that partially covers employee deductibles, and to help our employees cover medical expenses\npre-tax, we also offer employees a Flexible Spending Account in addition to providing a monthly wellness fund designed\nto support broad well-being activities. In addition, we encourage health and wellness by providing two on-site gym\noptions for our Newton-based employees as well as health passes to a local gym. Beyond our health and wellness benefits,\nour employees outside of the U.S. receive competitive compensation and benefits that are regularly benchmarked to\nensure market norms and reflect our standards. All employees globally have access to complimentary virtual fitness\nprograms, mental and emotional health support services, as well as support programs to assist working parents with\nchildcare and tutoring. This benefit also extends to eldercare, pet care, and other needs facing our diverse global team.\nWe encourage and support the growth and development of our employees and, wherever possible, seek to fill\npositions internally, through lateral and promotional advancements and by leveraging our employee referral process.\nContinual learning and career development is encouraged through ongoing performance and development conversations\nwith employees, a formal mentorship program, tuition assistance, employee and leadership training programs targeting\nboth technical and soft skills, and customized corporate training engagements and seminars where employees are\nencouraged to attend in connection with current and future roles. Employees at all levels have an opportunity to develop\nand hone their skillsets, which provides a critically important growth path and continuity for our top performers.\n15\nFurther, we strongly believe in fostering a culture of inclusiveness and employee well-being, which is key to our\nculture and overall success. We strive to bring together employees with a wide variety of backgrounds, skills and culture\nand encourage all our employees to maintain a work environment in which our differences are respected. We have\nrelationships with many local affinity groups, including the biotech industry’s largest LGBTQ professional group and\nLatinos in biotech, which extend our reach, build relationships and foster greater cohesion among our employees.\nWe have also created a women’s Employee Resource Group (“ERG”) where women and allies can connect, share\nexperiences, and inspire one another.

We have also established key working relationships with local universities where we hire\nmany of our interns in our annual internship program.\nCorporate Responsibility\nWe are highly committed to policies and practices focused on ESG matters, positively impacting our social\ncommunity and maintaining and cultivating good corporate governance. By focusing on ESG policies and practices, we\nbelieve we can affect a meaningful and positive change in our community and continue to cultivate our open and inclusive\ncollaborative culture.\nSome of our 2023 initiatives included continuing support for the scientific, medical, patient, and local communities\nin which we operate, including patient education, public health, quality of healthcare, and disease awareness, sponsoring\nlocal youth programs that focus on providing educational resources and career development opportunities for members of\nunderserved communities and schools with diverse populations, and supporting patient community needs in response to\nnatural disasters through both charitable giving to the community at large and specifically for those patients impacted.\nWe also enable our employees to participate in various charity events, including walks, races, and other events that\nimpact change in the communities of the patients we serve. We have recently implemented a volunteer time off program\nto support volunteer activities that enhance the communities in which we live and work while providing our employees\nthe paid time to help those around them. This allows our employees to support causes that are meaningful to them and\ntheir families and aligns with our mission, goals, and vision.\nOur ESG Report, which describes our approach to ESG programs, is available on our website at\nhttps://investors.karyopharm.com/corporate-sustainability.

In making this determination, our\nBoard considered the formal education and nature and scope of Mr. Bohlin and Mr. Schor’s previous experience, coupled\nwith past or present service on various audit committees. For the relevant experience which qualifies Dr. Pakianathan as\nan audit committee financial expert, please see her biographical information under “Proposal 1: Election of Directors –\nInformation Regarding Directors” section of this proxy statement. Our Audit Committee assists our Board in its oversight\nof the quality and integrity of our accounting, auditing and financial reporting process, the audits of our financial\nstatements and our independent registered public accounting firm, including its appointment, compensation, and retention.\nThe Audit Committee met nine times during 2023, including telephonic meetings.

Our Compensation Committee assists our Board in the discharge of its responsibilities relating to the\ncompensation of our executive officers and Board members. The Compensation Committee met five times during 2023,\nincluding telephonic meetings. Pursuant to its charter, the Compensation Committee’s general responsibilities currently\ninclude, among other things, the following:\n• reviewing and approving, or recommending for approval by the Board, the compensation of our chief\nexecutive officer and our other executive officers;\n• overseeing the evaluation of our senior executives, including the annual review of succession planning for our\nsenior executives, which includes transitional leadership in the event of an unplanned vacancy;\n• overseeing and administering our incentive compensation and equity-based plans;\n• reviewing and making recommendations to our Board with respect to non-employee director compensation;\n• reviewing our policies, strategies and programs relating to human capital management;\n• overseeing and administering the implementation or revision of any compensation recovery or “clawback”\npolicy of the Company; and\n• reviewing and discussing with management our compensation disclosure required by SEC rules.\nThe Compensation Committee generally meets at least four times annually and with greater frequency if necessary.\nThe agenda for each meeting is usually developed by the chair of the Compensation Committee, in consultation with our\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer and Chief Human Resources Officer. The Compensation Committee meets\nregularly in executive session. However, from time to time, various members of management and other employees, as\nwell as outside advisors or consultants, may be invited by the Compensation Committee to make presentations, to provide\nfinancial or other background information or advice or to otherwise participate in Compensation Committee meetings. No\nofficer may participate in, or be present during, any deliberations or determinations of the Compensation Committee\nregarding the compensation for such officer. The charter of the Compensation Committee grants the Compensation\nCommittee full access to all of our books, records, facilities, and personnel, as well as authority to obtain, at our expense,\nadvice and assistance from internal and external legal, accounting, or other advisors and consultants, and other external\nresources that the Compensation Committee considers necessary or appropriate in the performance of its duties. In\nparticular, the Compensation Committee has the sole authority to retain compensation consultants to assist in its\nevaluation of executive and director compensation, including the authority to approve the consultant’s reasonable fees and\nother retention terms.\nIn addition, under its charter, the Compensation Committee may form, and delegate authority to, subcommittees,\nconsisting of independent directors, as it deems appropriate. The Compensation Committee can also delegate to one or\nmore executive officers the authority to grant equity awards to certain employees, as further described in its charter and\nsubject to the terms of our equity plans. The Compensation Committee has, at times, delegated to our President and Chief\nExecutive Officer the authority to make equity awards under our 2022 Plan within approved guidelines to employees in\nconnection with annual, promotional and recognition grants, as applicable, other than grants to employees with a title of\nSenior Vice President or above (including our NEOs). The number of restricted stock units (“RSUs”) or performance-\nbased RSUs (“PSUs”), as applicable, our President and Chief Executive Officer may grant under the 2022 Plan to any\nindividual must be within the range set by our Compensation Committee for these awards.\nHistorically, the Compensation Committee has approved and, in the case of our President and Chief Executive\nOfficer, the Compensation Committee has recommended to the Board and the Board has approved, significant\nadjustments to executives’ annual compensation, determined variable cash compensation and equity awards, and\nestablished new performance objectives at one or more meetings held during the last quarter of the year and the first\nquarter of the following year. However, the Compensation Committee also considers matters related to individual\ncompensation, such as compensation for new executive hires, as well as high-level strategic issues, such as the efficacy of\n18\nour compensation strategy, potential modifications to that strategy, and new trends, plans, or approaches to compensation,\nat various meetings throughout the year. The Compensation Committee is responsible for making determinations, or\nmaking recommendations to our Board, regarding compensation of executive officers, making changes to pre-approved\nsalary ranges, salary increase budgets, equity award budgets, variable cash compensation targets, incentive payments, and\npre-approved equity ranges for new hires and high performers, and making material changes to benefits offered to our\nemployees. In determining compensation of executive officers other than our President and Chief Executive Officer, the\nCompensation Committee, with input from its compensation consultant, also considers the recommendations of our\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer. In addition, the Compensation Committee, with input from its compensation\nconsultant, makes recommendations to our Board regarding the compensation of our President and Chief Executive\nOfficer and our non-employee directors. The Compensation Committee also administers our equity-based plans and\ncompensation programs.\nNominating, Corporate Governance & Compliance Committee\nThe members of our Nominating, Corporate Governance & Compliance Committee currently include Messrs.\nGreene (Chair), Bohlin, and Schor. During 2023, Dr. Honig served as a member of the Nominating, Corporate\nGovernance & Compliance Committee until his resignation from the Board, effective as of December 31, 2023. The\nNominating, Corporate Governance & Compliance Committee met five times during 2023, including telephonic meetings.\nPursuant to its charter, the Nominating, Corporate Governance & Compliance Committee’s general responsibilities\ncurrently include, among other things, the following:\n• identifying individuals qualified to become Board members consistent with the criteria approved by the\nBoard, including the consideration of personal diversity;\n• recommending to our Board the persons to be nominated for election as directors and to each committee of\nour Board;\n• developing and recommending corporate governance guidelines to the Board;\n• developing and overseeing periodic self-evaluations, which are generally conducted annually, to assess the\neffectiveness of our Board and its committees;\n• overseeing the implementation of and monitoring the Company’s non-financial compliance program,\nincluding policies, standards, procedures, systems and initiatives, with a focus on quality, regulatory and\ncommercial compliance matters;\n• overseeing our Code of Ethics and Business Conduct;\n• evaluating, monitoring and discussing with senior management the adequacy and effectiveness of the\nCompany’s non-financial compliance program and compliance assurance systems and initiatives and\nconsidering recommendations for improvement thereof;\n• making findings and recommendations to the Board regarding the adequacy of the Company’s non-financial\ncompliance program;\n• assisting the Audit Committee in assessing financial risk arising from non-financial compliance matters;\n• developing and overseeing an orientation program for new directors and a continuing education program for\ncurrent directors; and\n• reviewing the Company’s corporate responsibility and sustainability efforts, including the impact of ESG\nissues on the Company.\nEach year, the Board and its committees conduct detailed self-evaluations covering topics such as Board and\ncommittee leadership structure, composition and effectiveness, quality of Board and committee materials and discussions,\npriority agenda items, schedule sufficiency, and Board processes. The Board, led by the Lead Independent Director,\ndiscusses the evaluation reports to determine what, if any, actions or improvements should be undertaken in the near-term\nand long-term. The Board and committee evaluations are discussed in executive session to allow for additional candid\ndiscussion. Historically, our Board and committee self-evaluation process has been conducted by the Company under the\noversight of the Nominating, Corporate Governance & Compliance Committee. In 2022, we engaged a third-party\n19\nadvisory firm to conduct the 2022 self-evaluation, including the completion of an extensive questionnaire by each director\nfor the Board and each committee of the Board on which he or she sits. Following the review of the individual\nquestionnaires, the third-party advisory firm conducted individual interviews with each director to more fully assess and\nunderstand the needs, comments and patterns resulting from the questionnaire responses. This interview process was\nintended to elicit, among other things, each director’s opinions on the overall effectiveness of the Board and its\ncommittees, the information the Board receives, the conduct of Board meetings, communication among directors and\nmanagement, the oversight of key business risks and ESG issues, Board composition, and any other matters that any\ndirector wishes to raise. The results were summarized by the third-party advisory firm in an anonymous report and\nreviewed by the Nominating, Corporate Governance & Compliance Committee, which then reported any key findings and\nobservations to the full Board for discussion and action. We intend to use an outside third party to conduct the annual\nBoard and committee self-evaluation every few years and will otherwise continue to conduct the self-evaluation process\ninternally on an annual basis, as we did for the 2023 Board and committee self-evaluation process.\nCommercialization and Portfolio Committee\nThe members of our Commercialization and Portfolio Committee currently include Ms. Oliger (Chair) and Drs.\nPakianathan, Mirza and Su. During 2023, Dr. Honig served as a member of the Commercialization and Portfolio\nCommittee until his resignation from the Board, effective as of December 31, 2023 and Dr. Su has served as a member of\nthe Commercialization and Portfolio Committee since August 2023 when he was elected to the Board. The\nCommercialization and Portfolio Committee met four times during 2023, including telephonic meetings. Pursuant to its\ncharter, the Commercialization and Portfolio Committee’s general responsibilities currently include, among other things,\nthe following:\n• ensuring commercial, medical affairs and research and development programs are consistent with our\nstrategic goals and objectives;\n• periodically conducting in-depth reviews of our product development pipeline, intellectual property portfolio\nand commercial strategies;\n• reviewing commercial and medical launch strategies prior to regulatory approval of new products or\nindications;\n• overseeing the research and development elements of our long-range plan and lifecycle management plans\nand our portfolio decision making process, as well as the identification, prioritization and optimization of\nresearch and development investments;\n• advising us on elements necessary for commercial, medical affairs and research and development decision\nmaking as well as the effectiveness of our research and development programs; and\n• providing other support as requested by the Board in maximizing the value of our products to patients.\nCompensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation\nDuring 2023, Ms. Oliger, Mr. Greene and Dr. Pakianathan served on our Compensation Committee. None of the\nmembers of our Compensation Committee is or has been an officer or employee of the Company or had any relationship\nrequiring disclosure under Item 404 of Regulation S-K. None of our executive officers currently serves, or in the past\nfiscal year has served, as a member of the Board of Directors or Compensation Committee of any entity that has one or\nmore executive officers serving on our Board or Compensation Committee.\nCode of Ethics and Business Conduct\nWe have adopted a written Code of Ethics and Business Conduct that applies to our directors, officers and\nemployees, including our principal executive officer, principal financial officer, principal accounting officer or controller,\nor persons performing similar functions. We have posted on our website, www.karyopharm.com, a current copy of the\nCode of Ethics and Business Conduct and all disclosures that are required by law or Nasdaq Listing Rules concerning any\namendments to, or waivers from, any provision of the Code of Ethics and Business Conduct. Information contained on the\nwebsite is not incorporated by reference in, or considered part of, this proxy statement.\n20\nDirector Nomination Process\nDirector Qualifications\nIn evaluating director nominees, the Nominating, Corporate Governance & Compliance Committee considers,\namong other things, the following factors:\n• reputation for personal and professional integrity, honesty and adherence to high ethical standards;\n• demonstrated business acumen, experience and ability to exercise sound judgments in matters that relate to\nthe current and long-term objectives of the Company;\n• commitment to understand the Company and its industry and to regularly attend and participate in meetings of\nthe Board and its committees;\n• interest and ability to understand the sometimes-conflicting interests of the various constituencies of the\nCompany, which include stockholders, employees, customers, governmental units, creditors and the general\npublic, and to act in the interests of all stockholders;\n• diversity of expertise and experience in substantive matters pertaining to our business relative to other Board\nmembers;\n• diversity of background and perspective, including with respect to age, gender, race, place of residence and\nspecialized experience; and\n• practical and mature business judgment, including the ability to make independent analytical inquiries.\nThe Nominating, Corporate Governance & Compliance Committee’s goal is to assemble a Board that brings to the\nCompany a variety of perspectives and skills derived from high quality business and professional experience. Moreover,\nthe Nominating, Corporate Governance & Compliance Committee believes that the background and qualifications of the\nmembers of our Board, considered as a group, should provide a significant breadth of experience, knowledge and abilities\nto assist the Board in fulfilling its responsibilities. Nominees are not discriminated against on the basis of race, religion,\nnational origin, sex, sexual orientation, disability, or any other basis proscribed by law.\nThe Nominating, Corporate Governance & Compliance Committee has not adopted a formal policy with respect to\na fixed set of specific minimum qualifications for its candidates for membership on the Board. The committee considers\nsuch factors, including those set forth above, as it may deem are in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders.\nThe committee further believes it is appropriate for at least one member of our Board to meet the criteria for an “audit\ncommittee financial expert” as that phrase is defined under the regulations promulgated by the SEC, and that a majority of\nthe members of our Board be independent as required under the Nasdaq qualification standards. The Nominating,\nCorporate Governance & Compliance Committee believes it is appropriate for our President and Chief Executive Officer\nto serve as a member of our Board. Our directors’ performance and qualification criteria are reviewed periodically by the\nNominating, Corporate Governance & Compliance Committee.\nIdentification and Evaluation of Nominees for Directors\nThe Nominating, Corporate Governance & Compliance Committee identifies nominees for director by first\nevaluating the current members of our Board willing to continue in service. Current members with qualifications and\nskills that are consistent with the Nominating, Corporate Governance & Compliance Committee’s criteria for service on\nthe Board and who are willing to continue in service are considered for re-nomination, balancing the value of continuity of\nservice by existing members of our Board with that of obtaining a new perspective or expertise. The Nominating,\nCorporate Governance & Compliance Committee reviews the overall service provided by these directors to the Company\nduring their terms, including the number of meetings attended, level of participation, quality of performance and any other\nrelationships and transactions that might impair the directors’ independence, as well as the results of the Board’s self-\nevaluation, which is generally conducted annually, to determine whether to recommend them to the Board for nomination\nfor a new term.\nIf any member of our Board does not wish to continue to serve on the Board or if our Board decides not to re-\nnominate a member for re-election, and our Board seeks to fill such vacancy, the Nominating, Corporate Governance &\n21\nCompliance Committee identifies a new nominee that meets the criteria above. The Nominating, Corporate Governance &\nCompliance Committee generally inquires of our Board and members of management for their recommendations and may\nalso review the composition and qualification of the boards of directors of our competitors or seek input from industry\nexperts or analysts. The Nominating, Corporate Governance & Compliance Committee then reviews the qualifications,\nexperience, and background of suggested candidates. Final candidates, if other than our current directors, are interviewed\nby the members of the Nominating, Corporate Governance & Compliance Committee and by certain of our other\nindependent directors and executive management. In making its determinations, the Nominating, Corporate Governance &\nCompliance Committee evaluates each individual in the context of our Board as a whole, with the objective of assembling\na group that can best contribute to the success of the Company and represent stockholder interests through the exercise of\nsound judgment. After review and deliberation of all feedback and data, the Nominating, Corporate Governance &\nCompliance Committee makes its recommendation to our Board. The Nominating, Corporate Governance & Compliance\nCommittee has previously engaged a search firm to conduct a search for additional directors with extensive development,\nregulatory or commercialization expertise to join our Board. In 2023, the Nominating, Corporate Governance &\nCompliance Committee retained a third-party search firm to conduct a search to identify a new candidate to serve on our\nBoard. This search resulted in the appointment Dr. Su in August 2023. The Nominating, Corporate Governance &\nCompliance Committee may in the future engage third-party search firms in those situations where particular\nqualifications are required or where existing contacts are not sufficient to identify an appropriate candidate.\nWe have not received director candidate recommendations from our stockholders and do not have a formal policy\nregarding consideration of such recommendations. However, any recommendations received from stockholders will be\nevaluated in the same manner that potential nominees suggested by board members, management, or other parties are\nevaluated. Stockholders wishing to recommend a director candidate for consideration by our Nominating, Corporate\nGovernance & Compliance Committee must submit such recommendation in writing to our principal executive offices at\nKaryopharm Therapeutics Inc., 85 Wells Avenue, Newton, Massachusetts 02459, Attention: Corporate Secretary. Such\nrecommendation must be received by us no later than February 28, 2025. Such submissions must state the nominee’s\nname, together with appropriate biographical information and background materials, and information with respect to the\nstockholder or group of stockholders making the recommendation, including the number of shares of common stock\nowned by such stockholder or group of stockholders. We may require any proposed nominee to furnish such other\ninformation as we may reasonably require to determine the eligibility of the proposed nominee to serve as an independent\ndirector or that could be material to a reasonable stockholder’s understanding of the independence, or lack thereof, of such\nproposed nominee.\nStockholders also have the right under our bylaws to directly nominate director candidates, without any action or\nrecommendation on the part of our Nominating, Corporate Governance & Compliance Committee or the Board, by\nfollowing the procedures set forth below under “Stockholder Proposals.” If our Board determines to nominate a\nstockholder-recommended candidate and recommends his or her election, then his or her name will be included in our\nproxy statement and proxy card for the next annual meeting of stockholders. Otherwise, candidates nominated by\nstockholders in accordance with the procedures set forth in the bylaws will not be included in our proxy statement for the\nnext annual meeting.\nLimits on Director Service on Other Company Boards\nWe have a highly effective and engaged Board, and we believe that our directors’ service on other companies’\nboards enable them to contribute valuable knowledge and perspective to our Board activities. Nonetheless, the Board is\nsensitive to the external obligations of its directors and the potential for overboarding to compromise their ability to\neffectively serve the Company. Our Corporate Governance Guidelines limit each director’s service on other boards of\npublic companies to a number that permits them, given their individual circumstances, to responsibly perform all director\nduties. Directors who serve as chief executive officers of a public company may not serve on more than two public\ncompany boards other than the board of the company of which he or she is chief executive officer. All other directors may\nnot serve on more than five public company boards.\nCommunications with Our Board of Directors\nStockholders seeking to communicate with our Board must submit their written comments to Karyopharm\nTherapeutics Inc., 85 Wells Avenue, Newton, Massachusetts 02459, Attention: Corporate Secretary. The Corporate\nSecretary will forward such communications to each member of our Board; provided that, if in the opinion of our\n22\nCorporate Secretary it would be inappropriate to send a particular stockholder communication to a specific director, such\ncommunication will only be sent to the remaining directors (subject to the remaining directors concurring with such\nopinion).\nDirector Compensation\nWe seek to attract exceptional people to serve on our Board and, therefore, our policy is to compensate non-\nemployee members of our Board competitively relative to members of the board of directors of comparable companies.\nThe Board believes that including equity as a part of our director compensation helps align the interest of directors with\nthose of our stockholders. Accordingly, our director compensation is a mix of cash and equity compensation. The Board\nalso believes that it is appropriate for the Lead Independent Director and the Chair of each standing committee of the\nBoard to receive additional compensation for the additional workload and time commitment required for Board members\nwho serve in such capacities. The non-employee members of our Board are also reimbursed for travel, lodging, and other\nreasonable expenses incurred in attending Board or committee meetings. Directors who are also employees, such as Mr.\nPaulson, do not receive any compensation for service on the Board in addition to compensation received for their service\nas our employees.\nThe following table reflects the cash and equity compensation that our directors were eligible to receive under the\nterms of our Non-Employee Director Compensation Policy in effect during 2023.\n2023\nCompensation Type ($)\nAnnual Cash Retainers\nBoard\nAll non-employee directors 50,000\nAdditional retainer - Lead Independent Director or independent Chairman 35,000\nAudit Committee\nChair 20,000\nNon-chair members 10,000\nCompensation Committee\nChair 20,000\nNon-chair members 10,000\nNominating, Corporate Governance & Compliance Committee\nChair 20,000\nNon-chair members 10,000\nCommercialization and Portfolio Committee\nChair 20,000\nNon-chair members 10,000\nInitial Stock Option Award (Shares)(1) 68,000\nAnnual Stock Option Award (Shares)(2) 34,000\n(1) This is a one-time non-qualified stock option award granted upon initial election to our Board and is equal to twice\nthe number of shares of common stock underlying the most recent annual stock option grant to non-employee\ndirectors. The stock option vests with respect to one-third of the shares on the first anniversary of the grant date and\nwith respect to an additional 1/36th of the total number of shares underlying the grant at the end of each successive\nmonth following the first anniversary of the grant date until the third anniversary of the grant date.\n(2) This non-qualified stock option award is granted following each annual meeting of stockholders and vests in full on\nthe first anniversary of the grant date. If a non-employee director is elected or appointed to our Board at a time other\nthan at our annual meeting of stockholders, the number of shares of our common stock subject to such annual grant\nwill be pro-rated based on the number of days served by such director through the date immediately preceding the\ndate of the annual meeting of stockholders.\nIn March 2024, the Non-Employee Director Compensation Policy was amended to increase the annual stock option\naward to 69,000 shares from 34,000 shares and the initial stock option award to 138,000 shares from 68,000 shares.\nThe stock options granted to our non-employee directors for service on our Board have an exercise price equal to\nthe fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant, expire ten years after the date of grant, and are subject to\n23\nthe director’s continued service to the Company on the applicable vesting dates. In addition, our 2022 Plan includes\nlimitations on director compensation, including, with respect to non-employee directors, a maximum aggregate amount of\ncash paid and value of awards granted (calculated based on grant date fair value for financial reporting purposes) equal to,\nin the case of any incumbent director, $750,000 in any calendar year, and, in the case of any newly elected or appointed\ndirector, $1,000,000 in such director’s initial year of election or appointment. Exceptions to these limitations may only be\nmade by our Board in extraordinary circumstances provided that the non-employee director receiving any additional\ncompensation does not participate in the decision to award such compensation. The foregoing limitations in non-employee\ndirector compensation do not apply to cash or equity awards granted to a non-employee director in his or her capacity as\nan advisor to the Company.\nThe following table sets forth the compensation paid to or earned by our non-employee directors during the year\nended December 31, 2023.\nFees Earned\nor Paid Option All Other\nIn Cash Awards Compensation Total\nName(1) ($)(2) ($)(3) ($) ($)\nGaren G.

As of December 31, 2023, Dr. Su held outstanding stock options to\npurchase 68,000 shares of our common stock.\nLimitation of Liability and Indemnification\nOur certificate of incorporation limits the personal liability of directors for breach of fiduciary duty to the maximum\nextent permitted by the Delaware General Corporation Law (the “DGCL”) and provides that no director will have\npersonal liability to us or to our stockholders for monetary damages for any breach of fiduciary duty as a director.\nHowever, these provisions do not eliminate or limit the liability of any of our directors:\n• for any breach of the director’s duty of loyalty to us or our stockholders;\n• for acts or omissions not in good faith or which involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law;\n• for voting or assenting to unlawful payments of dividends, stock repurchases, or other distributions; or\n• for any transaction from which the director derived an improper personal benefit.\nAny amendment to or repeal of these provisions will not eliminate or reduce the effect of these provisions in respect\nof any act, omission or claim that occurred or arose prior to such amendment or repeal. If the DGCL is amended to\nprovide for further limitations on the personal liability of directors of corporations, then the personal liability of our\ndirectors will be further limited to the greatest extent permitted by the DGCL.\nIn addition, our certificate of incorporation provides that we must indemnify our directors and officers, and we must\nadvance expenses, including attorneys’ fees, to our directors and officers in connection with legal proceedings, subject to\nvery limited exceptions.\nWe maintain an insurance policy that covers certain liabilities of our directors and officers arising out of claims\nbased on acts or omissions in their capacities as directors or officers. In addition, we have entered into indemnification\nagreements with our directors. These indemnification agreements require us, among other things, to indemnify each such\ndirector for some expenses, including attorneys’ fees, judgments, fines, and settlement amounts incurred by him in any\naction or proceeding arising out of his service as one of our directors.\nCertain of our non-employee directors may, through their relationships with their employers, be insured and/or\nindemnified against certain liabilities incurred in their capacity as members of our Board.\nInsofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”)\nmay be permitted to directors, executive officers or persons controlling us, in the opinion of the SEC, such\nindemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and is therefore unenforceable.\n25\nReport of the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors\nThe Audit Committee oversees the Company’s financial reporting process on behalf of the Board of Directors. We\nhave reviewed the Company’s audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023 and\ndiscussed them with Company management and Ernst & Young LLP, the Company’s independent registered public\naccounting firm for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nWe have received from, and discussed with, Ernst & Young LLP, which is responsible for expressing an opinion on\nthe conformity of the Company’s audited consolidated financial statements with accounting principles generally accepted\nin the United States, its judgments as to the quality, not just the acceptability, of the Company’s accounting principles and\nsuch other matters as are required to be discussed with the Audit Committee under generally accepted auditing standards,\nincluding the matters required to be discussed by the applicable requirements of the Public Company Accounting\nOversight Board (the “PCAOB”) and the SEC. In addition, we have discussed with Ernst & Young LLP its independence\nfrom management and the Company, have received from Ernst & Young LLP the written disclosures and the letter\nrequired by applicable requirements of the PCAOB regarding its communications with us concerning independence, and\nhave considered the compatibility of non-audit services with the auditors’ independence.\nBased on the review and discussions referred to above, we recommended to the Board of Directors that the audited\nconsolidated financial statements be included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023.\nThis report of the Audit Committee is not “soliciting material,” shall not be deemed “filed” with the SEC and shall\nnot be incorporated by reference by any general statement incorporating by reference this proxy statement into any filing\nunder the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, whether made before\nor after the date hereof and irrespective of any general incorporation language in any such filing, except to the extent that\nwe specifically incorporate this information by reference, and shall not otherwise be deemed filed under such acts.\nThe foregoing report has been furnished by the Audit Committee.\nRespectfully submitted,\nThe Audit Committee of the Board of Directors\nGaren G. Bohlin (Chair)\nDeepika R. Pakianathan\nChen Schor\n26\nPROPOSAL 2:\nAPPROVAL OF AN AMENDMENT TO OUR 2022 EQUITY INCENTIVE PLAN, AS AMENDED, TO\nINCREASE THE NUMBER OF SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK AVAILABLE FOR ISSUANCE\nTHEREUNDER BY 6,000,000 SHARES\nWe are seeking stockholder approval to amend our 2022 Equity Incentive Plan, as amended (the “2022 Plan”) to\nincrease the number of shares of common stock reserved for issuance under the 2022 Plan by 6,000,000 shares. We expect\nthat the proposed share increase, together with the remaining shares under the 2022 Plan, will last approximately one year\nunder our current equity compensation program. No other amendments are being made to the 2022 Plan. Based on the\nrecommendation of the Compensation Committee, on March 14, 2024, our Board approved the second amendment to the\n2022 Plan, subject to stockholder approval (the “Amendment”).\nReasons Why Stockholders Should Approve the Amendment\nIncentivizes, Retains and Motivates Talent. We are a commercial-stage pharmaceutical company whose dedication\nto pioneering novel cancer therapies is fueled by a belief in the extraordinary strength and courage of patients with cancer.\nWe discover, develop and commercialize novel, life-changing cancer therapies in disease areas with high unmet need. Our\nprimary focus is on marketing our lead asset, XPOVIO® (selinexor), in its currently approved indications as well as\ndeveloping and seeking the regulatory approval of selinexor as an oral agent targeting multiple high unmet need cancer\nindications. We are currently advancing our innovative pipeline of development programs with three ongoing pivotal\nPhase 3 clinical trials in endometrial cancer, multiple myeloma and myelofibrosis, all of which have expected data\nreadouts in 2025. We are at a critical stage in the growth of our company and our employees play a key role in achieving\nour 2024 and longer-term corporate goals, including (i) the successful execution of our clinical development program,\nfocused on our three ongoing pivotal Phase 3 trials, which, if approved could potentially create new standards of care for\npatients suffering from endometrial cancer, multiple myeloma and/or myelofibrosis; and (ii) continuing to leverage our\nand our partners’ commercial capabilities to grow our position in the multiple myeloma market both in the U.S. and\nabroad.\nThe effectiveness of the execution on our strategic plans and our ability to achieve success in the commercialization\nof XPOVIO and the progress of our clinical development programs has been and continues to be critically dependent on\nour ability to recruit, retain and incentivize the best available employees and non-employee directors in what is a\ntremendously competitive labor market. Our equity compensation program has always been and will continue to be a key\ncomponent in our ability to pay market-competitive compensation to our employees, non-employee directors, consultants\nand advisors who contribute to our success. As of March 29, 2024 we had 2,080,078 shares available for issuance under\nthe 2022 Plan, which will be insufficient to allow us to make critical, market-based grants to our executives and other\nemployees and non-employee directors over the next twelve months. If the Amendment is not approved by our\nstockholders, we will not be able to continue to grant meaningful equity awards to our existing employees and directors,\nwhich would adversely impact our business in a number of ways. Without equity available, we may be forced to increase\nthe cash component of our compensation programs, which we do not believe would be as effective in attracting, retaining\nor motivating our workforce. Use of cash would also strain resources needed to support our business needs and growth\nobjectives. Further, an inability to provide equity compensation would place us at a significant disadvantage compared to\nour competitors with whom we compete for talent. Therefore, we believe approval of the Amendment is in stockholders’\nbest interests and vital to our future success.\nBroad-based Eligibility for Equity Awards. We believe that all of our employees are critical in our continued efforts\nto bring XPOVIO to patients with cancer who can benefit from our drug as well as in the successful completion and\nsubsequent regulatory submissions of our three ongoing pivotal clinical trials. Therefore, our equity incentive program is\nbroad-based, with all eligible employees in good standing receiving equity awards annually as part of our annual\nperformance review based upon level, performance and contribution. We believe that using equity as a means of\ncompensation broadly best aligns the interests of all of our employees with the interests of our stockholders by linking\ntheir compensation to our growth and the creation of stockholder value. Furthermore, equity awards have strong retention\nvalue since our Board typically grants awards to employees that generally vest over a three or four-year period.\nAccordingly, employees must remain with us for a substantial period of time in order to realize the potential benefits of\ntheir equity awards.\n27\nAligns with our Pay-for-Performance Compensation Philosophy. We believe that equity compensation is\nfundamentally performance-based. As the value of our stock appreciates, our employees receive greater compensation at\nthe same time that our stockholders are receiving a greater return on their investment. Conversely, if the stock price does\nnot appreciate following the grant of an equity award, then our employees would not receive any compensation with\nrespect to stock options and would receive lower compensation than intended with respect to RSUs. Further, in February\n2023 and 2024, our Board awarded PSUs to certain employees, which are contingent on meeting pre-defined performance\ncriteria, thereby furthering our commitment to pay-for-performance and alignment with value creation for our\nstockholders.\nAligns Employee and Director Interests with Stockholder Interests. Providing our employees and non-employee\ndirectors with compensation in the form of equity directly aligns the interests of those employees and directors with the\ninterests of our stockholders. If the Amendment is approved by our stockholders, we will be able to continue granting\nequity incentives that foster this alignment between our employees and non-employee directors and our stockholders. If,\nhowever, the Amendment is not approved, we may have to restructure existing compensation programs, which will likely\nnecessitate the replacement of components of compensation historically awarded in equity with cash, or with other\ninstruments that may not necessarily align employee interests with those of stockholders as effectively as equity awards\ndo. If we were to replace equity awards with cash, our cash reserves would be diverted away from our XPOVIO\ncommercialization efforts as well as our clinical development programs, which may negatively impact our ability to\nmaximize the value of our multiple myeloma franchise as well as the timing and progress of our three ongoing pivotal\nPhase 3 trials, and in turn, impair stockholder value.\nWe Are Mindful of the Dilution Associated with our Equity Compensation Practices. We understand that our equity\ncompensation needs must be balanced against the dilutive effect our equity compensation program has on our\nstockholders. Our Compensation Committee and Board strive to thoughtfully manage long-term stockholder dilution, burn\nrate and stock-based compensation expense while maintaining our ability to attract, retain and motivate our workforce.\nWe review market data on equity compensation with the Compensation Committee’s independent compensation\nconsultant and the Compensation Committee on a regular basis with the goal of ensuring that our pay packages are\ncompetitive for all levels of employees, including our executives, and align with the compensation practices of our peers.\nWe actively manage dilution. Shares used to pay the exercise price of an award are not returned to the equity plan pool.\nOur Board, after weighing these considerations, believes the proposed dilution to stockholders as a result of the\nAmendment is judicious and sustainable and, importantly, critical to meet our business goals.\nTo further our efforts to retain and incentivize our employees, we are also asking stockholders to approve Proposal\n4 in this proxy statement, which would permit us to implement a one-time option exchange program for our non-executive\nofficer employees. As of March 29, 2024, 100% of our outstanding stock options had an exercise price greater than our\nstock price on March 29, 2024 and therefore had no intrinsic value. Thus, all of our current outstanding option awards are\nnot in fact serving to retain employees, exacerbating our equity compensation needs. The implementation of the Option\nExchange, as defined below, is intended, with respect to those non-executive officer employees who are eligible to\nparticipate in the program, to be a meaningful step in restoring the equity holdings of such persons by allowing them to\nexchange outstanding options that are underwater for grants of new RSUs so that their holdings once again become\nretentive and aligned with the interests of stockholders. As the exchange of options to RSUs will not be a one-for-one\nexchange, any shares subject to exchanged options that are in excess of the shares needed to issue new RSUs will not\nbecome available for issuance under the 2022 Plan. Even if our stockholders approve the Option Exchange, our Board\nbelieves that approval by our stockholders of the Amendment is necessary to ensure we can provide market competitive\ncompensation awards to our employees, non-employee directors and other service providers.\nConsistent with Stockholder Interests and Sound Corporate Governance. As described under the heading “Sound\nGovernance Features of the Amended 2022 Plan” and more thoroughly below, the 2022 Plan, as amended by the\nAmendment (the “Amended 2022 Plan”), was purposefully designed to include features that are consistent with the\ninterests of our stockholders and sound corporate governance.\n28\nWhy We Are Requesting Stockholder Approval of an Amendment to the 2022 Plan\nBackground\nThe 2022 Plan is our existing equity incentive plan and was originally approved by our Board on April 4, 2022 and\nby our stockholders on May 19, 2022, with the first amendment to the 2022 Plan approved by our Board on March 30,\n2023 and by our stockholders on May 24, 2023. The 2022 Plan is critical to our ability to continue to grant equity awards\nto all of our employees (other than to newly hired employees who will generally receive grants under the Karyopharm\nTherapeutics Inc. 2022 Inducement Stock Incentive Plan, as amended (the “2022 Inducement Plan”).\nOur Compensation Committee determined the requested number of shares provided for in the Amendment based on\nprojected annual equity awards to employees and our non-employee directors, employee recognition and promotion\nawards, and an assessment of the magnitude of increase that our stockholders would likely find appropriate. If\nstockholders approve the Amendment, subject to adjustment in the event of stock splits and other similar events, awards\nmay be made under the Amended 2022 Plan, for up to a number of shares of common stock equal to the sum of: (i)\n15,100,000 shares of common stock; and (ii) such additional number of shares of common stock (up to 14,231,243) as is\nequal to the sum of (x) the number of shares of common stock that were reserved for issuance under our 2013 Stock\nIncentive Plan (the “2013 Plan”), which remained available for grant immediately prior to May 19, 2022, the date our\nstockholders originally approved the 2022 Plan and (y) the number of shares of common stock subject to awards granted\nunder our 2013 Plan that were outstanding as of such date which awards expire, terminate or are otherwise surrendered,\ncancelled, forfeited or repurchased by the Company at their original issuance price pursuant to a contractual repurchase\nright (subject, however, in the case of incentive stock options to any limitations under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986,\nas amended, and any regulations thereunder (the “Code”)).\nFor newly hired employees, we have historically relied on the inducement grant exception under Nasdaq Listing\nRule 5635(c)(4), including pursuant to the 2022 Inducement Plan, to grant nonstatutory stock options and/or RSUs\n(“Inducement Awards”) to all of our eligible newly hired full-time employees. Because the number of shares available for\nissuance under the 2022 Plan has been (and will continue to be even if the Amendment is approved) carefully calibrated to\nenable us to make equity grants to our current employees, the 2022 Inducement Plan will remain in effect even if the\nAmendment is approved and we expect to continue utilizing the 2022 Inducement Plan for all our new hire equity grants.\nAs of March 29, 2024, there were 930,282 shares remaining available for the grant of new awards under the 2022\nInducement Plan.\nThe following table includes information regarding all of our (i) outstanding equity awards under all of our equity\ncompensation plans under which shares of common stock may be issued, other than our Amended & Restated ESPP, (ii)\noutstanding Inducement Awards that were granted as stock options or RSUs outside of our equity compensation plans,\n(iii) outstanding warrants and Convertible Senior Notes due 2025 (the “Notes”) under which shares of common stock may\nbe issued upon exercise or conversion, as applicable, (iv) shares available for future awards under the 2022 Plan (prior to\nthe Amendment) and the 2022 Inducement Plan and (v) the number of shares of common stock outstanding, each as of\nMarch 29, 2024 and does not reflect the potential effect of the Option Exchange (should such program be approved by our\nstockholders):\nNumber of shares underlying outstanding options 8,472,304\nWeighted average exercise price of outstanding options $10.66\nWeighted average remaining contractual term of outstanding options 4.97 years\nNumber of outstanding RSUs 8,030,937\nNumber of outstanding PSUs (assuming maximum performance for PSUs)(1) 4,646,460\nNumber of shares underlying outstanding warrants and Notes(2) 23,659,685\nShares available under the 2022 Plan (assuming maximum performance for PSUs) 2,080,078\nShares available under the 2022 Inducement Plan 930,282\nShares requested for approval pursuant to the 2022 Plan 6,000,000\nEstimated total number of shares available for issuance under all plans (assuming approval of the\nAmendment and maximum performance for PSUs) 9,010,360\nNumber of shares of common stock outstanding 116,434,177\n29\n(1) In February 2023, our Compensation Committee added PSUs to the mix of equity awards for a portion of our\nemployee base as part of our annual performance review (the “2023 PSUs”). In February 2024, PSUs continued to\nbe included in the mix of equity awards as part of our annual performance review (the “2024 PSUs”). The number\nof PSUs outstanding as of March 29, 2024 is reflected in the table above assuming maximum performance. For\nmembers of our executive leadership team, the 2023 PSU awards will vest between zero and 200% of the target\nnumber of shares awarded and the 2024 PSU awards will vest between zero and 150% of the target number of\nshares awarded. For all other PSU recipients, both the 2023 PSUs and the 2024 PSUs will vest between 50% and\n150% of the target number of shares awarded. Maximum performance reflects vesting at the 200% and 150% level,\nas applicable, for each of the three performance goals.\n(2) Includes (i) warrants to purchase up to 9,537,563 shares of common stock issued in a private placement offering of\nsecurities to certain institutional investors pursuant to a December 2022 Securities Purchase Agreement; (ii)\nwarrants to purchase up to 250,000 shares of common stock issued in connection with the August 2023 Second\nAmendment to the Revenue Interest Financial Agreement, as amended, with Healthcare Royalty Partners III, L.P.\nand HealthCare Royalty Partners IV, L.P.; and (iii) the potential conversion of 13,872,122 shares of common stock\nunder our Notes.\nAs of March 29, 2024, there were no outstanding shares of restricted stock, no stock appreciation rights (“SAR”), or\nany other stock-based awards.\nWe expect that the proposed share pool following approval of the Amendment will allow us to continue to grant\nequity awards (other than to newly hired employees who will generally receive grants under the 2022 Inducement Plan to\nthe extent eligible) at our historic rates for approximately one year, but the actual duration of the share pool may vary\nbased on changes in participation, the Company’s stock price and market practice. If stockholders do not approve the\nAmendment, the 2022 Plan will remain in effect pursuant to its terms.\nIf this proposal is approved by our stockholders, we intend to register the additional shares reserved for issuance\nunder the 2022 Plan by filing a Registration Statement on Form S-8 as soon as practicable following such approval.\nOur Board believes approval of the Amendment is in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders and\nrecommends a vote “FOR” the approval of the Amendment.\nThe remainder of this Proposal 2 includes:\n• Sound Governance Features of the Amended 2022 Plan;\n• Information Regarding Overhang and Burn Rate; and\n• Description of the Amended 2022 Plan.\nSound Governance Features of the Amended 2022 Plan\nThe Amended 2022 Plan continues to include several features that are designed to protect the interests of our\nstockholders, align awards with such interests, and reflect sound corporate governance practices. Certain of these features\nare highlighted below, and these and other terms of the plan are more fully described in the Description of the Amended\n2022 Plan further below as well as in the copy of the 2022 Plan and the Amendment in Appendix A to this proxy\nstatement.\n30\nNo “evergreen” provision √\nMinimum vesting requirements √\nClawback policy √\nNo equity grants below fair market value √\nNo “reload” equity awards √\nNo repricing of stock options or SARs without stockholder approval √\nNo dividend payments on unvested awards √\nNo liberal share recycling √\nLimits on non-employee director compensation √\nEquity granted under our stock-based compensation plans is broad-based √\nDouble-trigger acceleration of vesting upon a change in control √\nNo Evergreen. The Amended 2022 Plan does not include an “evergreen” or other provision that provides for\nautomatic increases in the number of shares available for grant under the plan and therefore any increase to the maximum\nshare reserve in the Amended 2022 Plan is subject to approval by our stockholders, allowing our stockholders to have a\nsay in our equity compensation programs.\nMinimum Vesting Provisions. Minimum vesting provisions of one year generally apply to all awards to participants,\nwith the exception of awards for up to 5% of the shares of stock reserved under the Amended 2022 Plan.\nClawback Policy. In accepting an award under the Amended 2022 Plan, participants agree to be bound by any\nclawback policy the Company has in effect or may adopt in the future.\nNo Automatic Vesting of Awards on a Change in Control Event; Double-trigger Acceleration of Vesting upon a\nChange in Control. The Amended 2022 Plan does not provide for the automatic vesting of awards in connection with a\nchange in control event. Instead, the Amended 2022 Plan includes “double-trigger” acceleration, pursuant to which\noptions, RSU awards and restricted stock awards will become fully vested and nonforfeitable if the holder of such award\nis terminated without cause or resigns for good reason within one year following a change in control event. For more\ninformation on the vesting treatment for equity awards granted under the Amended 2022 Plan, please see the section titled\n“Employment, Severance and Change in Control Arrangements” contained elsewhere in this proxy statement.\nNo liberal share recycling. The Amended 2022 Plan prohibits the re-granting of (i) shares withheld or delivered to\nsatisfy the exercise price of an award or to satisfy tax withholding obligations, (ii) shares that were subject to a SAR, and\nwere not issued upon the net settlement or net exercise of such award, or (iii) shares repurchased on the open market using\nproceeds from the exercise of an award.\nNo Repricing of Options or SARs. The Amended 2022 Plan prohibits the direct or indirect repricing of stock options\nor SARs without stockholder approval.\nNo Discounted Options or SARs. All options and SARs must have an exercise or measurement price that is at least\nequal to the fair market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant.\nNo Reload Options or SARs. No options or SARs granted under the Amended 2022 Plan may contain a provision\nentitling the award holder to the automatic grant of additional options or SARs in connection with any exercise of the\noriginal option or SAR.\nNo Dividend Equivalents on Options or SARs. No options or SARs granted under the Amended 2022 Plan may\nprovide for the payment or accrual of dividend equivalents.\nDividends and Dividend Equivalents on Restricted Stock, Restricted Stock Units and Other-Stock Based Awards Not\nPaid Until Award Vests. Any dividends or dividend equivalents paid with respect to restricted stock, RSUs or other stock-\nbased awards will be subject to the same restrictions on transfer and forfeitability as the award with respect to which they\nare paid.\n31\nLimit on Non-Employee Director Compensation. The maximum aggregate amount of cash earned or paid and value\nof awards (calculated based on grant date fair value for financial reporting purposes) granted to any non-employee\ndirector in any calendar year may not exceed $750,000 in the case of an incumbent director. However, such maximum\naggregate amount shall not exceed $1,000,000 in any calendar year for any individual non-employee director in such non-\nemployee director’s initial year of election or appointment. Exceptions to these limitations may only be made by our\nBoard in extraordinary circumstances provided that the non-employee director receiving any additional compensation\ndoes not participate in the decision to award such compensation.\nMaterial Amendments Require Stockholder Approval. Stockholder approval is required prior to an amendment of\nthe Amended 2022 Plan that would (i) materially increase the number of shares authorized (other than as provided under\nthe Amended 2022 Plan with respect to certain corporate events or substitute awards), (ii) expand the types of awards that\nmay be granted, or (iii) materially expand the class of participants eligible to participate.\nAdministered by an Independent Committee. The Amended 2022 Plan is administered by the Compensation\nCommittee, as delegated by our Board. The Compensation Committee is made up entirely of independent directors.\nInformation Regarding Overhang and Burn Rate\nIn developing our share request for the Amended 2022 Plan and analyzing the impact of utilizing equity as a means\nof compensation on our stockholders, we considered both our “overhang” and our “burn rate”.\nOverhang is a measure of potential dilution which we define as the sum of (i) the total number of shares underlying\nall equity awards outstanding and (ii) the total number of shares available for future award grants, divided by the sum of\n(a) the total number of shares underlying all equity awards outstanding, (b) the total number of shares available for future\nawards, and (c) the total number of shares of common stock outstanding. As of March 29, 2024, there were 21,149,701\nshares underlying all equity awards outstanding (assuming maximum performance for PSUs), 2,080,078 shares available\nfor future awards under the 2022 Plan (assuming maximum performance for PSUs), 930,282 shares available for future\nawards under the 2022 Inducement Plan and 116,434,177 shares of common stock were outstanding. Accordingly, our\noverhang at March 29, 2024 was 17.18%. If the 6,000,000 shares proposed to be authorized for grant under the Amended\n2022 Plan are included in the calculation, our overhang on March 29, 2024 would have been 20.57%. For purposes of the\nabove calculations, the number of shares of common stock outstanding does not include the 23,659,685 shares of common\nstock issuable upon exercise of outstanding warrants or pursuant to conversion of the Notes. If such shares of common\nstock issuable upon exercise of outstanding warrants or pursuant to conversion of the Notes are included in the\ncalculations, our overhang at March 29, 2024 would have been 14.71% on a fully-diluted basis and 17.71% on a fully-\ndiluted basis if the 6,000,000 shares proposed to be authorized for grant under the Amended 2022 Plan are also included\nin the calculation.\nNet burn rate provides a measure of the potential dilutive impact of our equity award program, which we define as\nthe number of shares covered by awards granted in a given fiscal year minus shares subject to outstanding equity awards\nforfeited and expired during that year, divided by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding\nfor that year. We believe a net burn rate measure (that is, burn rate calculated to reflect forfeitures and expirations of\nawards) indicates the rate at which we actually create potential future stockholder dilution. The following table sets forth\ninformation regarding historical awards granted and awards forfeited or expired in each of the 2021 through 2023 fiscal\nperiods, and the corresponding annual net burn rate, for each of such three fiscal years, as well as the average net burn rate\nfor those three years:\n2023 2022 2021\nAwards Granted(1) 7,381,522 5,857,251 5,309,278\nLess: Forfeitures and Expirations(1) (6,460,076) (2,729,782) (3,076,162)\nNet Shares Awarded 921,446 3,127,469 2,233,116\nWeighted Average Number of Shares of Common Stock\nOutstanding 114,220,826 81,870,651 75,217,760\nNet Burn Rate 0.81% 3.82% 2.97%\nThree-year Average Net Burn Rate 2.53%\n32\n(1) Included in “Awards Granted” and “Forfeitures and Expirations” for 2023 are 2,686,652 PSUs and 334,886 PSUs,\nrespectively, each assuming maximum performance. Prior to 2023, we did not grant any PSU awards and no PSU\nawards vested in 2023.\nWe recognize that equity awards dilute existing stockholders, and, therefore, we and our Compensation Committee\nare mindful to responsibly manage our equity compensation program. We believe our historical three-year burn rate is\nreasonable for the reasons set forth below:\n• Broad-based equity program: In order to retain and motivate top talent in what is a tremendously\ncompetitive labor market for biotech companies, drive successful expansion of our commercial business and\nprogress our clinical development program in our three core programs, it is critical that we grant competitive,\nmarket-driven equity awards to our employees. As a result, unlike many companies, our equity is not\nconcentrated in our executive leadership team. Rather, our equity compensation program has always been and\nwill continue to be a key component in our ability to pay market-competitive compensation to all of our\neligible employees, not just those in leadership positions, and to motivate employees at every level of the\norganization to drive stockholder value. For example, approximately 69% of our 2023 equity awards were\ngranted to employees who are not NEOs.\n• Leadership and strategic transitions and forfeiture impact: In mid-2021, we began a transition process for\nour executive leadership team and, as a result, experienced significant changes in our leadership and strategic\ndirection, which continued into 2022. We made a number of key changes to our executive leadership team,\nincluding a CEO transition and a new Chief Commercial Officer in 2021 and new Chief Medical Officer and\nChief Development Officer in 2022, each of whom we would not have been able to recruit without market-\ncompetitive equity incentives. As a result, our 2021 and 2022 burn rates were negatively impacted by these\nequity grants, primarily the new hire equity awards granted to Mr. Paulson in 2021, which were both market\ncompetitive awards for a new CEO and essential to incentivize him to join our company as CEO. Further, in\nconnection with these leadership transitions, equity grants previously awarded to our former executives that\nwere forfeited upon their departure from the Company are reflected in the table above for 2022 and 2023. In\n2023 there were 2.5 million shares underlying awards of former executive officers that were forfeited or\nexpired. The leadership changes beginning with the appointment of Mr. Paulson in mid-2021 and subsequent\nchanges implemented to our strategic commercial and pipeline focus, have shown positive results and we\ntherefore believe that the Amended 2022 Plan is critical to sustaining this momentum as we continue to build\nstockholder value through our commercialization and clinical development programs.\nWe have been and are committed to continuing to be careful, responsible stewards of our equity compensation\nprogram. We recognize that each equity award that we make dilutes our stockholders and intend to continue to actively\nmonitor our share reserve and burn rate to ensure that we maximize stockholders’ value by granting the appropriate\nnumber of equity awards necessary to reward, motivate and retain our employees and directors. This requires prudence,\nprocess and sound judgment, all of which we are committed to because we know that we will not be able to compete for\ntalent and deliver sustainable success to our stockholders without an equity compensation program.\nEquity Compensation Plan Information\nFor more information on our equity compensation plans, please see the section titled “Executive Compensation –\nEquity Compensation Plan Information” contained elsewhere in this proxy statement.\nDescription of the Amended 2022 Plan\nThe following is a brief summary of the Amended 2022 Plan. A copy of each of the 2022 Plan, Amendment No. 1\nand Amendment No. 2 is attached in Appendix A to this proxy statement. References to our Board in this summary shall\ninclude the Compensation Committee or any similar committee or sub-committee or the officers of the Company to the\nextent that the Board’s powers or authority under the Amended 2022 Plan have been delegated to such committee or\nofficers, in accordance with the Amended 2022 Plan.\n33\nTypes of Awards; Eligibility; Shares Available for Awards; Share Counting Rules\nThe Amended 2022 Plan provides for the grant of incentive stock options intended to qualify under Section 422 of\nthe Code, non-statutory stock options, SARs, restricted stock, RSUs, other stock-based awards and cash awards as\ndescribed below (collectively, “awards”). Employees, directors consultants and advisors to the Company are eligible to\nreceive awards under the Amended 2022 Plan. The term “Company” and similar terms shall include any of the\nCompany’s present or future parent or subsidiary corporations as defined in Sections 424(e) or (f) of the Code and any\nother business venture (including, without limitation, joint venture or limited liability company) in which the Company\nhas a controlling interest, as determined by the Board.\nSubject to adjustment in the event of stock splits, stock dividends and other similar events, awards may be made\nunder the Amended 2022 Plan (any or all of which awards may be in the form of incentive stock options) for up to a\nnumber of shares of common stock equal to the sum of: (i) 15,100,000 shares of our common stock; and (ii) such\nadditional number of shares of common stock (up to 14,231,243) as is equal to the sum of (x) the number of shares of\ncommon stock reserved for issuance under the 2013 Plan that remained available for grant immediately prior to the date\nour stockholders originally approved the 2022 Plan and (y) the number of shares of common stock subject to awards\ngranted under our 2013 Plan that were outstanding as of such date which awards expire, terminate or are otherwise\nsurrendered, cancelled, forfeited or repurchased by the Company at their original issuance price pursuant to a contractual\nrepurchase right (subject, however, in the case of incentive stock options to any limitations under the Code). Shares of\ncommon stock issued under the Amended 2022 Plan may consist in whole or in part of authorized but unissued shares or\ntreasury shares.\nThe Amended 2022 Plan provides that the maximum aggregate amount of cash and value of awards (calculated\nbased on grant date fair value for financial reporting purposes) granted to any individual non-employee director in any\ncalendar year may not exceed $750,000 in the case of an incumbent director. However, such maximum aggregate amount\nshall not exceed $1,000,000 in any calendar year for any individual non-employee director in such non-employee\ndirector’s initial year of election or appointment. Moreover, fees paid by the Company on behalf of any non-employee\ndirector in connection with regulatory compliance and any amounts paid to a non-employee director as reimbursement of\nan expense will not count against this limit. Exceptions to this limitation may only be made by our Board in extraordinary\ncircumstances provided that any non-employee director receiving additional compensation does not participate in the\ndecision to award such compensation. This limitation does not apply to cash or awards granted to a non-employee director\nin his or her capacity as an advisor or consultant to the Company.\nFor purposes of counting the number of shares available for the grant of awards under the Amended 2022 Plan, all\nshares of common stock covered by SARs will be counted against the number of shares available for the grant of awards.\nHowever, SARs that may be settled only in cash will not be so counted. Similarly, to the extent that an RSU award may be\nsettled only in cash, no shares will be counted against the shares available for the grant of awards under the Amended\n2022 Plan. In addition, if we grant a SAR in tandem with an option for the same number of shares of our common stock\nand provide that only one such award may be exercised (“tandem SAR”), only the shares covered by the option, and not\nthe shares covered by the tandem SAR, will be so counted, and the expiration of one in connection with the other’s\nexercise will not restore shares to the Amended 2022 Plan.\nShares covered by awards under the Amended 2022 Plan that expire or are terminated, surrendered, or cancelled\nwithout having been fully exercised or are forfeited in whole or in part (including as the result of shares subject to such\naward being repurchased by us at the original issuance price pursuant to a contractual repurchase right) or that result in\nany shares not being issued (including as a result of a SAR or an RSU that was settleable either in cash or in stock actually\nbeing settled in cash) will again be available for the grant of awards under the Amended 2022 Plan (subject, in the case of\nincentive stock options, to any limitations under the Code). In the case of the exercise of a SAR, the number of shares\ncounted against the shares available for the grant of awards under the Amended 2022 Plan will be the full number of\nshares subject to the SAR multiplied by the percentage of the SAR actually exercised, regardless of the number of shares\nactually used to settle the SAR upon exercise, and the shares covered by a tandem SAR will not again become available\nfor grant upon the expiration or termination of the tandem SAR.\n34\nShares of common stock that are delivered (by actual delivery, attestation, or net exercise) to us by a participant to\npurchase shares of common stock upon exercise of an award or to satisfy tax withholding obligations (including shares\nretained from the award creating the tax obligation) will not be added back to the number of shares available for the future\ngrant of awards under the Amended 2022 Plan. Shares repurchased by us on the open market using proceeds from the\nexercise of an award will also not increase the number of shares available for future grant of awards under the Amended\n2022 Plan.\nIn connection with a merger or consolidation of an entity with us or our acquisition of property or stock of an entity,\nour Board may grant awards under the Amended 2022 Plan in substitution for any options or other stock or stock-based\nawards granted by such entity or an affiliate thereof on such terms as our Board determines appropriate in the\ncircumstances, notwithstanding any limitation on awards contained in the Amended 2022 Plan. No such substitute awards\nshall count against the overall share limit, except as required by reason of Section 422 and related provisions of the Code.\nDescriptions of Awards\nOptions. A participant who is awarded an option receives the right to purchase a specified number of shares of\ncommon stock at a specified exercise price and subject to the other terms and conditions that are specified in connection\nwith the award agreement. An option that is not intended to be an “incentive stock option” is a “non-statutory stock\noption.” Options may not be granted at an exercise price that is less than 100% of the fair market value of our common\nstock on the date of grant. If our Board approves the grant of an option with an exercise price to be determined on a future\ndate, the exercise price may not be less than 100% of the fair market value of our common stock on that future date.\nUnder present law, incentive stock options may not be granted at an exercise price less than 110% of the fair market value\nin the case of stock options granted to participants who hold more than 10% of the total combined voting power of all\nclasses of our stock or any of our subsidiaries. Under the terms of the Amended 2022 Plan, options may not be granted for\na term in excess of ten years (and, under present law, five years in the case of incentive stock options granted to\nparticipants who hold greater than 10% of the total combined voting power of all classes of our stock or any of our\nsubsidiaries).\nThe Amended 2022 Plan permits participants to pay the exercise price of options using one or more of the following\nmanners of payment: (i) payment by cash or by check, (ii) except as may otherwise be provided in the applicable award\nagreement or approved by our Board, in connection with a “cashless exercise” through a broker, (iii) to the extent\nprovided in the applicable award agreement or approved by our Board, and subject to certain conditions, by delivery to us\n(either by actual delivery or attestation) of shares of common stock owned by the participant valued at their fair market\nvalue, (iv) to the extent provided in an applicable non-statutory stock option award agreement or approved by our Board,\nby delivery of a notice of “net exercise” as a result of which we will retain a number of shares of common stock otherwise\nissuable pursuant to the stock option equal to the aggregate exercise price for the portion of the option being exercised\ndivided by the fair market value of our common stock on the date of exercise, (v) to the extent permitted by applicable law\nand provided for in the applicable award agreement or approved by our Board, by any other lawful means (but not by a\npromissory note of the participant), or (vi) by any combination of these forms of payment. No option granted under the\nAmended 2022 Plan may contain a provision entitling the participant to the automatic grant of additional options in\nconnection with any exercise of the original option. No options granted under the Amended 2022 Plan may provide for the\npayment or accrual of dividend equivalents.\nStock Appreciation Rights. A participant who is awarded a SAR receives, upon exercise, a number of shares of our\ncommon stock, or cash (or a combination of shares of our common stock and cash) determined by reference to\nappreciation, from and after the date of grant, in the fair market value of a share of our common stock over the\nmeasurement price. The Amended 2022 Plan provides that the measurement price of a SAR may not be less than 100% of\nthe fair market value of our common stock on the date the SAR is granted (provided, however, that if our Board approves\nthe grant of a SAR effective as of a future date, the measurement price shall not be less than 100% of the fair market value\non such future date) and that SARs may not be granted with a term in excess of 10 years. No SARs granted under the\nAmended 2022 Plan may contain a provision entitling the participant to the automatic grant of additional SARs in\nconnection with any exercise of the original SAR. No SARs granted under the Amended 2022 Plan may provide for the\npayment or accrual of dividend equivalents.\nLimitation on Repricing of Options or SARs. With respect to options and SARs, unless such action is approved by\nstockholders or otherwise permitted under the terms of the Amended 2022 Plan in connection with certain changes in\n35\ncapitalization and reorganization events, we may not (1) amend any outstanding option or SAR granted under the\nAmended 2022 Plan to provide an exercise price or measurement price per share that is lower than the then-current\nexercise price or measurement price per share of such outstanding option or SAR, (2) cancel any outstanding option or\nSAR (whether or not granted under the Amended 2022 Plan) and grant in substitution therefor new awards under the\nAmended 2022 Plan (other than certain substitute awards issued in connection with a merger or consolidation of an entity\nwith us or an acquisition by us, described above) covering the same or a different number of shares of our common stock\nand having an exercise price or measurement price per share lower than the then-current exercise price or measurement\nprice per share of the canceled option or SAR, (3) cancel in exchange for a cash payment any outstanding option or SAR\nwith an exercise price or measurement price per share above the then-current fair market value of our common stock, or\n(4) take any other action under the Amended 2022 Plan that constitutes a “repricing” within the meaning of the rules of\nthe Nasdaq Stock Market or any other exchange or marketplace on which the Company’s stock is listed or traded.\nRestricted Stock Awards. A participant who is granted a restricted stock award is entitled to acquire shares of our\ncommon stock, subject to our right to repurchase all or part of such shares at their issue price or other stated or formula\nprice (or to require forfeiture of such shares if issued at no cost) in the event that the conditions specified in the applicable\naward are not satisfied prior to the end of the applicable restriction period established for such award. Any dividends\n(whether paid in cash, stock or property) declared and paid by us with respect to shares of restricted stock will be paid to\nthe participant only if and when such shares become free from the restrictions on transferability and forfeitability that\napply to such shares. No interest will be paid on unvested dividends.\nRestricted Stock Unit Awards. A participant who is granted an RSU award is entitled to receive shares of our\ncommon stock, or cash equal to the fair market value of such shares or a combination thereof, to be delivered at the time\nsuch award vests or on a deferred basis pursuant to the terms and conditions established by our Board. Our Board may\nprovide that settlement of RSUs will be deferred, on a mandatory basis or at the election of the participant, in a manner\nthat complies with Section 409A of the Code. A participant has no voting rights with respect to any RSU. An RSU award\nagreement may provide the applicable participant with the right to receive an amount equal to any dividends or other\ndistributions declared and paid on an equal number of outstanding shares of our common stock. Any such dividend\nequivalents may be settled in cash and/or shares of our common stock and will be subject to the same restrictions on\ntransfer and forfeitability as the RSUs with respect to which such dividend equivalents are awarded. No interest will be\npaid on dividend equivalents.\nOther Stock-Based Awards. Under the Amended 2022 Plan, our Board may grant other awards of shares of our\ncommon stock, and other awards that are valued in whole or in part by reference to, or are otherwise based on, shares of\nour common stock or other property, having such terms and conditions as our Board may determine. We refer to these\ntypes of awards as other stock-based awards. Other stock-based awards may be available as a form of payment in\nsettlement of other awards granted under the Amended 2022 Plan or as payment in lieu of compensation to which a\nparticipant is otherwise entitled. Other stock-based awards may be paid in shares of our common stock or in cash, as our\nBoard may determine. The award agreement of an other stock-based award may provide the participant who receives that\naward of an other stock-based award with the right to receive dividend equivalents. Dividend equivalents may be settled\nin cash and/or shares of our common stock and will be subject to the same restrictions on transfer and forfeitability as the\nother stock-based award with respect to which they are awarded. No interest will be paid on dividend equivalents.\nCash Awards. Under the Amended 2022 Plan, the Board has the right to grant cash-based awards including awards\nsubject to performance conditions.\nPerformance Conditions. Awards under the Amended 2022 Plan may be made subject to the achievement of\nperformance goals. Our Board may specify that the degree of granting, vesting and/or payout of any award subject to\nperformance-based vesting conditions will be subject to the achievement of one or more of the following performance\nmeasures established by the Board, which may be based on the relative or absolute attainment of specified levels of one or\nany combination of the following measures (and which may be determined pursuant to generally accepted accounting\nprinciples (“GAAP”) or on a non-GAAP basis, as determined by the Board): (i) the entry into an arrangement or\nagreement with a third party for the development, commercialization, marketing or distribution of products, services or\ntechnologies, or for conducting a research program to discover and develop a product, service or technology, and/or the\nachievement of milestones under such arrangement or agreement, including events that trigger an obligation or payment\nright; (ii) achievement of domestic and international regulatory milestones, including the submission of filings required to\n36\nadvance products, services and technologies in clinical development and the achievement of approvals by regulatory\nauthorities relating to the commercialization of products, services and technologies; (iii) the achievement of discovery,\npreclinical and clinical stage scientific objectives, discoveries or inventions for products, services and technologies under\nresearch and development; (iv) the entry into or completion of a phase of clinical development for any product, service or\ntechnology, such as the entry into or completion of phase 1, 2 and/or 3 clinical trials; (v) the consummation of debt or\nequity financing transactions, or acquisitions of business, technologies and assets; (vi) new product or service releases;\n(vii) the achievement of qualitative or quantitative performance measures set forth in operating plans approved by the\nBoard from time to time; (viii) specified levels of product sales, net income, earnings before or after discontinued\noperations, interest, taxes, depreciation and/or amortization, operating profit before or after discontinued operations and/or\ntaxes, sales, sales growth, earnings growth, cash flow or cash position, gross margins, stock price, market share, return on\nsales, assets, equity or investment; (ix) improvement of financial ratings; (x) achievement of balance sheet or income\nstatement objectives; (xi) total stockholder return or stock price; (xii) other comparable measures of financial and\noperational performance; and/ or (xiii) any other measure selected by the Board. Such goals may reflect absolute entity or\nbusiness unit performance or a relative comparison to the performance of a peer group of entities or other external\nmeasure of the selected performance criteria and may be absolute in their terms or measured against or in relationship to\nother companies comparably, similarly or otherwise situated. The Board may specify that such performance measures will\nbe adjusted to exclude any one or more of: (I) extraordinary items; (II) gains or losses on the dispositions of discontinued\noperations; (III) the cumulative effects of changes in accounting principles; (IV) the write-down of any asset; (V)\nfluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates; (VI) charges for restructuring and rationalization programs; (VII) non-\ncash, mark-to-market adjustments on derivative instruments; (VIII) amortization of purchased intangibles; (IX) the net\nimpact of tax rate changes; (X) non-cash asset impairment charges; (XI) gains on extinguishment of the tax receivable\nagreement; and (XII) any other factors as the Board may determine. Such performance measures: (A) may vary by\nparticipant and may be different for different awards; (B) may be particular to a participant or the department, branch, line\nof business, subsidiary or other unit in which the participant works; and (C) may cover such period as may be specified by\nthe Board. The Board will have the authority to make equitable adjustments to the performance goals in recognition of\nunusual or non-recurring events affecting the Company or the financial statements of the Company, in response to\nchanges in applicable laws or regulations or to account for items of gain, loss or expense determined to be extraordinary\nor unusual in nature or infrequent in occurrence or related to the disposal of a segment of a business or related to a change\nin accounting principles. Our Board may adjust the cash or number of shares payable pursuant to a performance award,\nand the Board may, at any time, waive the achievement of the applicable performance measures. Notwithstanding its\ndesignation as a performance award, no option or SAR will provide for the payment or accrual of dividend equivalents,\nany dividends declared and paid by the Company with respect to shares of restricted stock will be subject to the same\ndividend rules for restricted stock awards not designated as a performance award and any right to receive dividend\nequivalents on an award of RSUs and other stock-based awards will be subject to the same dividend equivalent rules for\nsuch awards that are not designated as a performance award.\nEligibility to Receive Awards\nAll of our employees, officers, and directors, as well as our consultants and advisors, are eligible to receive awards\nunder the Amended 2022 Plan. However, incentive stock options may only be granted to our employees, employees of our\npresent or future parent or subsidiary corporations as defined in Sections 424(e) or (f) of the Code, and employees of any\nother entities the employees of which are eligible to receive incentive stock options under the Code.\nTransferability of Awards\nAwards may not be sold, assigned, transferred, pledged or otherwise encumbered by a participant, either voluntarily\nor by operation of law, except by will or the laws of descent and distribution or, other than in the case of an incentive\nstock option, pursuant to a qualified domestic relations order. During the life of the participant, awards are exercisable\nonly by the participant. However, except with respect to awards that are subject to Section 409A of the Code and incentive\nstock options, our Board may permit or provide in an award for the gratuitous transfer of the award by the participant to or\nfor the benefit of any immediate family member, family trust or other entity established for the benefit of the participant\nand/or an immediate family member thereof if we would be eligible to use a Form S-8 under the Securities Act for the\nregistration of the sale of the common stock subject to such award to the proposed transferee. Further, we are not required\nto recognize any such permitted transfer until such time as the permitted transferee has, as a condition to the transfer,\ndelivered to us a written instrument in form and substance satisfactory to us confirming that such transferee will be bound\n37\nby all of the terms and conditions of the award. None of the restrictions described in this paragraph prohibit a transfer\nfrom the participant to the Company.\nNo Rights as a Stockholder; Clawback\nNo participant or designated beneficiary shall have any rights as a stockholder with respect to any shares of\ncommon stock to be distributed with respect to an award granted under the Amended 2022 Plan until becoming a record\nholder of such shares, subject to the terms of an award agreement. In accepting an award under the Amended 2022 Plan, a\nparticipant agrees to be bound by any clawback policy that the Company has in effect or may adopt in the future,\nincluding without limitation the Company’s Dodd-Frank Compensation Recovery Policy.\nPlan Benefits\nAs of March 29, 2024, approximately 552 persons were eligible to receive awards under the Amended 2022 Plan,\nincluding all five NEOs, one other executive officer who is not a NEO, 320 employees (excluding NEOs and other\nexecutive officers), seven non-employee directors (excluding our President and Chief Executive Officer who is an\nexecutive officer), 219 consultants and zero advisors (excluding consultants).\nAwards Granted Under 2022 Plan\nThe following table sets forth information about equity awards granted under the 2022 Plan since adoption of the\n2022 Plan by our stockholders on May 19, 2022 through March 29, 2024 to the individuals and groups described in the\ntable below:\nNumber of Number of\nShares of Number of Maximum\nCommon Stock Shares of Shares of\nUnderlying Common Stock Common Stock\nStock Options Underlying Underlying\nGranted RSUs Granted PSUs Granted\nName and Position (#) (#) (#)\nRichard Paulson, President and Chief Executive Officer — 694,800 1,168,200\nMichael Mason, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and\nTreasurer 45,000 313,205 280,989\nSohanya Cheng, Executive Vice President, Chief Commercial Officer 45,000 328,959 297,902\nStuart Poulton, Executive Vice President, Chief Development Officer 45,000 308,205 280,989\nReshma Rangwala, Executive Vice President, Chief Medical Officer and\nHead of Research — 298,959 297,902\nAll current executive officers as a group 165,000 2,181,128 2,530,482\nAll current directors who are not executive officers as a group 460,395 — —\nEach nominee for election as a director 115,800 694,800 1,168,200\nEach associate of any of such directors, executive officers or nominees — — —\nEach other person who received or is to receive 5 percent or more of such\noptions, warrants or rights — — —\nAll employees, including all current officers who are not executive officers,\nas a group 212,100 5,527,197 2,726,928\nOn March 29, 2024, the last reported sale price of our common stock on the Nasdaq Global Select Market was\n$1.51.\nNew Plan Benefits Table\nThe granting of awards under the Amended 2022 Plan is discretionary, and we cannot now determine the number or\ntype of awards to be granted in the future to any particular person or group, other than as set forth below.

Under our Non-Employee Director Compensation Policy, each non-employee director will\nreceive an annual stock option award of 69,000 shares on the date of our annual stockholder meeting. The value of a\nstock option to be granted under this policy will be determined using the same method we use to calculate the grant-\ndate fair value of stock options in our financial statements included in our 2023 Annual Report. Excludes (i) options\nthat the non-employee directors will be entitled to receive under our Non-employee Director Compensation Policy\nfor subsequent years following 2024 and (ii) any discretionary awards that any non-employee director may be\nawarded under the Amended 2022 Plan.\nAdministration\nThe Amended 2022 Plan will be administered by our Board. Our Board has the authority to grant awards and to\nadopt, amend and repeal the administrative rules, guidelines and practices relating to the Amended 2022 Plan that it deems\nadvisable and to construe and interpret the provisions of the Amended 2022 Plan and any award agreements entered into\nunder the Amended 2022 Plan. Our Board may correct any defect, supply any omission or reconcile any inconsistency in\nthe Amended 2022 Plan or any award. All actions and decisions by our Board with respect to the Amended 2022 Plan and\nany awards made under the Amended 2022 Plan will be made in our Board’s discretion and will be final and binding on\nall persons having or claiming any interest in the Amended 2022 Plan or in any award.\nPursuant to the terms of the Amended 2022 Plan, our Board may delegate any or all of its powers under the\nAmended 2022 Plan to one or more committees or subcommittees of our Board. The Board has authorized the\nCompensation Committee to administer certain aspects of the Amended 2022 Plan. Awards granted to non-employee\ndirectors must be granted and administered by a committee of the Board, all of the members of which are independent\ndirectors as defined by Section 5605(a)(2) of the Nasdaq Marketplace Rules.\nSubject to any requirements of applicable law, the Board may delegate to one or more officers the power to grant\nawards (subject to any limitations under the Amended 2022 Plan) to employees or officers and to exercise such other\npowers under the Amended 2022 Plan as the Board may determine, provided that the Board shall fix the terms of awards\nto be granted by such officers, the maximum number of shares subject to awards that the officers may grant, and the time\nperiod in which such awards may be granted; and provided further, that no officer shall be authorized to grant awards to\nany “executive officer” (as defined by Rule 3b-7 under the Exchange Act), or to any “officer” (as defined by Rule 16a-\n1(f) under the Exchange Act).\nSubject to applicable limitations contained in the Amended 2022 Plan, the Board, the Compensation Committee, or\nany other committee or subcommittee or officer to whom the Board has delegated authority pursuant to the Amended\n2022 Plan, as the case may be, selects the recipients of awards and determines (i) the number of shares of common stock,\ncash or other consideration covered by awards and the terms and conditions of such awards, including the dates upon\nwhich such awards become exercisable or otherwise vest, (ii) the exercise or measurement price of awards, if any, and (iii)\nthe duration of awards.\nExcept as otherwise provided in the Amended 2022 Plan, each award under the Amended 2022 Plan may be made\nalone or in addition or in relation to any other award. The terms of each award need not be identical, and our Board need\nnot treat participants uniformly. Our Board will determine the effect on an award of the disability, death, termination or\nother cessation of employment or service, authorized leave of absence or other change in the employment or other service\n39\nstatus of a participant, and the extent to which, and the period during which, the participant (or the participant’s legal\nrepresentative, conservator, guardian or designated beneficiary) may exercise rights or receive any benefits under an\naward.\nThe Board may at any time provide that any award shall become immediately exercisable in whole or in part, free\nfrom some or all restrictions or conditions or otherwise realizable in whole or in part, as the case may be. Subject to the\npreceding sentence, no award under the Amended 2022 Plan shall vest earlier than the first anniversary of its date of grant,\nunless such award is granted in lieu of salary, bonus or other compensation otherwise earned by or payable to the\nparticipant; provided, that, such limitation will not apply to awards granted, in the aggregate, for up to 5% of the\nmaximum number of authorized shares under the Amended 2022 Plan.\nIn the event of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization, combination of shares,\nreclassification of shares, spin-off or other similar change in capitalization or event, or any dividend or distribution to\nholders of our common stock, other than an ordinary cash dividend, we are required to make equitable adjustments (or\nmake substituted awards, as applicable), in the manner determined by our Board, to (i) the number and class of securities\navailable under the Amended 2022 Plan, (ii) the share counting rules set forth in the Amended 2022 Plan, (iii) the number\nand class of securities and exercise price per share of each outstanding option, (iv) the share- and per-share provisions and\nthe measurement price of each outstanding SAR, (v) the number of shares subject to and the repurchase price per share\nsubject to each outstanding award of restricted stock, and (vi) the share and per-share-related provisions and the purchase\nprice, if any, of each outstanding RSU award and each outstanding other stock-based award. In the event we effect a split\nof our common stock by means of a stock dividend and the exercise price of and the number of shares subject to an\noutstanding option are adjusted as of the date of the distribution of the dividend (rather than as of the record date for such\ndividend), then a participant who exercises an option between the record date and the distribution date for such stock\ndividend shall be entitled to receive, on the distribution date, the stock dividend with respect to the shares of common\nstock acquired upon such option exercise, notwithstanding the fact that such shares were not outstanding as of the close of\nbusiness on the record date for such stock dividend.\nWe will indemnify and hold harmless each director, officer, employee or agent to whom any duty or power relating\nto the administration or interpretation of the Amended 2022 Plan has been or will be delegated against any cost or expense\n(including attorneys’ fees) or liability (including any sum paid in settlement of a claim with our Board’s approval) arising\nout of any act or omission to act concerning the Amended 2022 Plan unless arising out of such person’s own fraud or bad\nfaith.\nAmendment of awards. Except as otherwise provided under the Amended 2022 Plan with respect to repricing\noutstanding stock options or SARs and with respect to actions requiring stockholder approval, our Board may amend,\nmodify or terminate any outstanding award, including but not limited to, substituting therefor another award of the same\nor a different type, changing the date of exercise or realization, and converting an incentive stock option to a non-statutory\nstock option, provided that the participant’s consent to any such action will be required unless our Board determines that\nthe action, taking into account any related action, does not materially and adversely affect the participant’s rights under\nthe Amended 2022 Plan or the change is otherwise permitted under the terms of the Amended 2022 Plan in connection\nwith certain corporate events.\nReorganization Events\nThe Amended 2022 Plan contains provisions addressing the consequences of any reorganization event. A\nreorganization event is defined under the Amended 2022 Plan as (a) any merger or consolidation of us with or into another\nentity as a result of which all of our common stock is converted into or exchanged for the right to receive cash, securities\nor other property, or is canceled, (b) any transfer or disposition of all of our common stock for cash, securities or other\nproperty pursuant to a share exchange or other transaction or (c) our liquidation or dissolution.\nProvisions Applicable to Awards Other than Restricted Stock. Under the Amended 2022 Plan, if a reorganization\nevent occurs, our Board may take any one or more of the following actions as to all or any (or any portion of) outstanding\nawards other than restricted stock on such terms as our Board determines (except to the extent specifically provided\notherwise in an applicable award agreement or another agreement between a participant and us): (1) provide that such\nawards shall be assumed, or substantially equivalent awards shall be substituted, by the acquiring or succeeding\ncorporation (or an affiliate thereof), (2) upon written notice to a participant, provide that all of the participant’s unvested\n40\nawards will be forfeited immediately before the reorganization event and/or that all of the participant’s unexercised\nawards will terminate immediately prior to the consummation of such reorganization event unless exercised by the\nparticipant (to the extent then exercisable) within a specified period following the date of such notice, (3) provide that\noutstanding awards shall become exercisable, realizable, or deliverable, or restrictions applicable to an award shall lapse,\nin whole or in part prior to or upon such reorganization event, (4) in the event of a reorganization event under the terms of\nwhich holders of our common stock will receive upon consummation thereof a cash payment for each share surrendered in\nthe reorganization event, which we refer to as the Acquisition Price, make or provide for a cash payment to participants\nwith respect to each award held by a participant equal to (A) the number of shares of our common stock subject to the\nvested portion of the award (after giving effect to any acceleration of vesting that occurs upon or immediately prior to\nsuch reorganization event) multiplied by (B) the excess, if any, of (I) the Acquisition Price over (II) the exercise,\nmeasurement or purchase price of such award and any applicable tax withholdings, in exchange for the termination of\nsuch award, provided, that if the Acquisition Price per share (as determined by our Board) does not exceed the exercise\nprice of the award, then the award will be canceled without any payment of consideration, (5) provide that, in connection\nwith our liquidation or dissolution, awards shall convert into the right to receive liquidation proceeds (if applicable, net of\nthe exercise, measurement or purchase price thereof and any applicable tax withholdings) and (6) any combination of the\nforegoing.\nOur Board is not obligated to treat all awards, all awards held by a participant, or all awards of the same type,\nidentically. Certain RSU awards that are subject to Section 409A of the Code will be settled in accordance with the terms\nof the applicable award agreement or as otherwise specified in the Amended 2022 Plan. Our Board, with reasonable notice\nto participants holding options or SARs, may impose a limitation on the ability of these participants to exercise their\nawards for the minimum number of days prior to the closing of the reorganization event as is reasonably necessary to\nfacilitate the orderly closing of the reorganization event.\nProvisions Applicable to Restricted Stock. Upon the occurrence of a reorganization event other than our liquidation\nor dissolution, our repurchase and other rights with respect to outstanding restricted stock will inure to the benefit of our\nsuccessor and will, unless our Board determines otherwise, apply to the cash, securities or other property which our\ncommon stock was converted into or exchanged for pursuant to such reorganization event in the same manner and to the\nsame extent as they applied to such restricted stock. However, our Board may either provide for termination or deemed\nsatisfaction of such repurchase or other rights under the instrument evidencing any restricted stock or any other agreement\nbetween a participant and us, either initially or by amendment or provide for forfeiture of such restricted stock if issued at\nno cost. Upon the occurrence of a reorganization event involving our liquidation or dissolution, except to the extent\nspecifically provided to the contrary in the instrument evidencing any award of restricted stock or any other agreement\nbetween the participant and us, all restrictions and conditions on all restricted stock then outstanding shall automatically\nbe deemed terminated or satisfied.\nChange in Control Events\nThe Amended 2022 Plan contains provisions addressing the consequences of any change in control event. A change\nin control event is defined under the Amended 2022 Plan as: (A) the acquisition by an individual, entity or group (within\nthe meaning of Section 13(d)(3) or 14(d)(2) of the Exchange Act), referred to herein as a Person, of beneficial ownership\nof any of our capital stock if, after such acquisition, such Person beneficially owns (within the meaning of Rule 13d-3\npromulgated under the Exchange Act) 50% or more of the combined voting power of our then-outstanding securities\nentitled to vote generally in the election of directors, referred to herein as the Outstanding Company Voting Securities;\nprovided, however, that for the purposes of the preceding provision, the following acquisitions shall not constitute a\nchange in control event: (1) any acquisition directly from us or (2) any acquisition by any corporation pursuant to a\nBusiness Combination (as defined below) which complies with clauses (x) and (y) of subsection (C) of this definition; or\n(B) such time as the Continuing Directors (as defined below) do not constitute a majority of the Board (or, if applicable,\nthe board of directors a successor corporation to us), where the term “Continuing Director” means at any date a member\nof the Board (x) who was a member of the Board on the date of the initial adoption of the 2022 Plan by the Board or (y)\nwho was nominated or elected subsequent to such date by at least a majority of the directors who were Continuing\nDirectors at the time of such nomination or election or whose election to the Board was recommended or endorsed by at\nleast a majority of the directors who were Continuing Directors at the time of such nomination or election; or (C) the\nconsummation of a merger, consolidation, reorganization, recapitalization or share exchange involving us or a sale or\nother disposition of all or substantially all of our assets of us (a “Business Combination”), unless, immediately following\nsuch Business Combination, each of the following two conditions is satisfied: (x) all or substantially all of the individuals\n41\nand entities who were the beneficial owners of the Outstanding Company Voting Securities immediately prior to such\nBusiness Combination beneficially own, directly or indirectly, more than 50% of the combined voting power of the then-\noutstanding securities entitled to vote generally in the election of directors of the resulting or acquiring corporation in such\nBusiness Combination (which shall include, without limitation, a corporation which as a result of such transaction owns\nthe Company or substantially all of the Company’s assets either directly or through one or more subsidiaries) in\nsubstantially the same proportions as their ownership of the Outstanding Company Voting Securities immediately prior to\nsuch Business Combination and (y) no Person beneficially owns, directly or indirectly, 50% or more of the combined\nvoting power of the then-outstanding securities of such corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors\n(except to the extent that such ownership existed prior to the Business Combination); or (D) our liquidation or dissolution.\nProvisions Applicable to Options. Notwithstanding the provisions with respect to the treatment of the options in a\nreorganization event, except to the extent specifically provided to the contrary in an award agreement or any other\nagreement between a participant and us, each option shall be immediately exercisable in full if, on or prior to the first\nanniversary of the date of the consummation of the change in control event, the participant’s employment with us or the\nacquiring or succeeding corporation is terminated for “good reason” by the participant or is terminated without “cause”\n(each, as defined below) by us or the acquiring or succeeding corporation.\nProvisions Applicable to Restricted Stock. Notwithstanding the provisions with respect to the treatment of the\nrestricted stock in a reorganization event, except to the extent specifically provided to the contrary in an award agreement\nor any other agreement between a participant and us, each restricted stock award shall immediately become free from all\nconditions or restrictions if, on or prior to the first anniversary of the date of the consummation of the change in control\nevent, the participant’s employment with us or the acquiring or succeeding corporation is terminated for “good reason” by\nthe participant or is terminated without “cause” by us or the acquiring or succeeding corporation.\nProvisions Applicable to RSUs. Notwithstanding the provisions with respect to the treatment of the RSUs in a\nreorganization event, except to the extent specifically provided to the contrary in an award agreement or any other\nagreement between a participant and us, each RSU that vests solely based on continued service shall become immediately\nvested in full and free from forfeiture if, on or prior to the first anniversary of the date of the consummation of the change\nin control event, the participant’s employment with us or the acquiring or succeeding corporation is terminated for “good\nreason” by the participant or is terminated without “cause” by us or the acquiring or succeeding corporation.\nProvisions Applicable to SARs and Other Stock-Based Awards. The Board may specify in an award at the time of\nthe grant the effect of a change in control event on any SAR or other stock-based award.\nUnder the Amended 2022 Plan, “good reason” means the occurrence of any of the following without the\nparticipant’s prior written consent: (A) any change in the participant’s position, title or reporting relationship with us from\nand after such reorganization event or change in control event that diminishes in any material respect the authority, duties\nor responsibilities of the participant as in effect immediately preceding the reorganization event or change in control\nevent, as the case may be; provided, however, that a change in the participant’s title or reporting relationship solely due to\nthe us becoming a division, subsidiary or other similar part of a larger organization following a reorganization event or\nchange in control event shall not by itself constitute “good reason”; or (B) any material reduction in the participant’s\nannual base compensation from and after such reorganization event or change in control event, as the case may be.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, “good reason” shall not be deemed to have occurred unless (x) the participant provides us\nwith written notice that the participant intends to terminate employment for one of the grounds set forth in subsections (A)\nor (B) within 60 days of such ground arising, (y) if such ground is capable of being cured, we have failed to cure such\nground within a period of 30 days from the date of such written notice, and (z) the participant terminates employment\nwithin six months from the date that “good reason” first occurs.\nUnder the Amended 2022 Plan, “cause” means the occurrence of any of the following: (A) the participant’s willful\nfailure to perform in any material respect the participant’s material duties or responsibilities for us, which is not cured\nwithin 30 days of written notice thereof to the participant from us; (B) repeated unexplained or unjustified absence from\nus inconsistent with the participant’s duties and responsibilities for us, which continues without explanation or\njustification after written notice thereof to the participant from us; (C) the participant’s willful misconduct that causes\nmaterial and demonstrable monetary or reputational injury to us, including, but not limited to, misappropriation or\n42\nconversion of our assets (other than non-material assets); or (D) the conviction of the participant of, or the entry of a plea\nof guilty or nolo contendere by the participant to, any crime involving moral turpitude or any felony.\nProvisions for Foreign Participants\nThe Board has established, and may further establish, one or more sub-plans under the Amended 2022 Plan to\nsatisfy applicable securities, tax or other laws of various jurisdictions. The Board has established, and may further\nestablish, such sub-plans by adopting supplements to the Amended 2022 Plan containing any limitations on the Board’s\ndiscretion under the Amended 2022 Plan and any additional terms and conditions not otherwise inconsistent with the\nAmended 2022 Plan as the Board deems necessary or desirable. All supplements adopted by the Board are deemed to be\npart of the Amended 2022 Plan, but each supplement only applies to participants within the affected jurisdiction.\nWithholding\nThe participant must satisfy all applicable federal, state, and local or other income and employment tax withholding\nobligations before we will deliver stock certificates or otherwise recognize ownership of common stock under an award.\nWe may elect to satisfy the withholding obligations through additional withholding on salary or wages. If we elect not to\nor cannot withhold from other compensation, the participant must pay us the full amount, if any, required for withholding\nor have a broker tender to us cash equal to the withholding obligations. Payment of withholding obligations is due before\nwe will issue any shares on exercise, vesting or release from forfeiture of an award or at the same time as payment of the\nexercise or purchase price, unless we determine otherwise. If provided for in an award or approved by the Board, a\nparticipant may satisfy the tax obligations in whole or in part by delivery (either by actual delivery or attestation) of shares\nof common stock, including shares retained from the award creating the tax obligation, valued at their fair market value.\nHowever, except as otherwise provided by the Board, that the total tax withholding where stock is being used to satisfy\nsuch tax obligations cannot exceed our minimum statutory withholding obligations (based on minimum statutory\nwithholding rates for federal and state tax purposes, including payroll taxes, that are applicable to such supplemental\ntaxable income), except that, to the extent that we are able to retain shares of common stock having a fair market value\nthat exceeds the statutory minimum applicable withholding tax without financial accounting implications or we are\nwithholding in a jurisdiction that does not have a statutory minimum withholding tax, we may retain such number of\nshares (up to the number of shares having a fair market value equal to the maximum individual statutory rate of tax) as we\nshall determine to be necessary to satisfy the tax liability associated with any award. Shares used to satisfy tax\nwithholding requirements cannot be subject to any repurchase, forfeiture, unfulfilled vesting or other similar requirements.\nAmendment or Termination\nNo award may be granted under the Amended 2022 Plan after May 18, 2032, but awards previously granted may\nextend beyond that date. Our Board may amend, suspend or terminate the Amended 2022 Plan or any portion of the\nAmended 2022 Plan at any time, except that (i) no amendment may be made to the plan to permit an option or SAR to be\nrepriced without stockholder approval and (ii) no amendment that would require stockholder approval under the rules of\nthe national securities exchange on which we maintain our primary listing may be made effective unless and until such\namendment has been approved by our stockholders. If the national securities exchange on which we maintain our primary\nlisting does not have rules regarding when stockholder approval of amendments to equity compensation plans is required\n(or if our common stock is not then listed on any national securities exchange), no amendment of the Amended 2022 Plan\nmaterially increasing the number of shares authorized under the plan (other than as provided under the Amended 2022\nPlan with respect to certain corporate events or substitute awards), expanding the types of awards that may be granted\nunder the plan or materially expanding the class of participants eligible to participate in the plan will be effective unless\nand until our stockholders approve such amendment. If at any time the approval of our stockholders is required as to any\nother modification or amendment under Section 422 of the Code or any successor provision with respect to incentive\nstock options, our Board may not effect such modification or amendment without such approval. Unless otherwise\nspecified in the amendment, any amendment to the Amended 2022 Plan adopted in accordance with the procedures\ndescribed above will apply to, and be binding on the holders of, all awards outstanding under the Amended 2022 Plan at\nthe time the amendment is adopted, provided that our Board determines that such amendment, taking into account any\nrelated action, does not materially and adversely affect the rights of participants under the Amended 2022 Plan. No award\nwill be made that is conditioned on stockholder approval of any amendment to the Amended 2022 Plan unless the award\nprovides that (i) it will terminate or be forfeited if stockholder approval of such amendment is not obtained within no more\nthan 12 months from the date the award was granted and (ii) it may not be exercised or settled (or otherwise result in the\nissuance of shares of our common stock) prior to the receipt of such stockholder approval.\n43\nIf stockholders do not approve the Amendment, the Amendment will not go into effect, and we will not grant\nadditional awards under the 2022 Plan in excess of the current share reserve. In this event, the Board will consider\nwhether to adopt alternative arrangements based on its assessment of our needs.\nFederal Income Tax Consequences\nThe following is a summary of the United States federal income tax consequences that generally will arise with\nrespect to awards granted under the Amended 2022 Plan. This summary is based on the federal tax laws in effect as of the\ndate of this proxy statement. In addition, this summary assumes that all awards are exempt from, or comply with, the rules\nunder Section 409A of the Code regarding nonqualified deferred compensation. Changes to these laws could alter the tax\nconsequences described below.\nIncentive Stock Options. A participant will not have income upon the grant of an incentive stock option. Also,\nexcept as described below, a participant will not have income upon exercise of an incentive stock option if the participant\nhas been employed by the Company or its corporate parent or 50% or majority-owned corporate subsidiary at all times\nbeginning with the option grant date and ending three months before the date the participant exercises the option. If the\nparticipant has not been so employed during that time, then the participant will be taxed as described below under “Non-\nstatutory Stock Options.” The exercise of an incentive stock option may subject the participant to the alternative minimum\ntax.\nA participant will have income upon the sale of the stock acquired under an incentive stock option at a profit (if\nsales proceeds exceed the exercise price). The type of income will depend on when the participant sells the stock. If a\nparticipant sells the stock more than two years after the option was granted and more than one year after the option was\nexercised, then all of the profit will be long-term capital gain. If a participant sells the stock prior to satisfying these\nwaiting periods, then the participant will have engaged in a disqualifying disposition and a portion of the profit will be\nordinary income and a portion may be capital gain. This capital gain will be long-term if the participant has held the stock\nfor more than one year and otherwise will be short-term. If a participant sells the stock at a loss (sales proceeds are less\nthan the exercise price), then the loss will be a capital loss. This capital loss will be long-term if the participant held the\nstock for more than one year and otherwise will be short-term.\nNon-statutory Stock Options. A participant will not have income upon the grant of a non-statutory stock option. A\nparticipant will have compensation income upon the exercise of a non-statutory stock option equal to the value of the\nstock on the day the participant exercised the option less the exercise price. Upon sale of the stock, the participant will\nhave capital gain or loss equal to the difference between the sales proceeds and the value of the stock on the day the\noption was exercised. This capital gain or loss will be long-term if the participant has held the stock for more than one\nyear and otherwise will be short-term.\nStock Appreciation Rights. A participant will not have income upon the grant of a SAR. A participant generally will\nrecognize compensation income upon the exercise of a SAR equal to the amount of the cash and the fair market value of\nany stock received. Upon the sale of the stock, the participant will have capital gain or loss equal to the difference\nbetween the sales proceeds and the value of the stock on the day the SAR was exercised. This capital gain or loss will be\nlong-term if the participant held the stock for more than one year and otherwise will be short-term.\nRestricted Stock Awards. A participant will not have income upon the grant of restricted stock unless an election\nunder Section 83(b) of the Code is made within 30 days of the date of grant. If a timely 83(b) election is made, then a\nparticipant will have compensation income equal to the value of the stock less the purchase price, if any. When the stock\nis sold, the participant will have capital gain or loss equal to the difference between the sales proceeds and the value of the\nstock on the date of grant. If the participant does not make an 83(b) election, then when the stock vests the participant will\nhave compensation income equal to the value of the stock on the vesting date less the purchase price, if any. When the\nstock is sold, the participant will have capital gain or loss equal to the sales proceeds less the value of the stock on the\nvesting date. Any capital gain or loss will be long-term if the participant held the stock for more than one year and\notherwise will be short-term.\nRestricted Stock Units. A participant will not have income upon the grant of an RSU. A participant is not permitted\nto make a Section 83(b) election with respect to an RSU award. When the shares or common stock are delivered with\nrespect to the RSUs (which may be upon vesting or may be at a later date), the participant will have income on the date of\n44\ndelivery in an amount equal to the fair market value of the stock on such date less the purchase price, if any. When the\nstock is sold, the participant will have capital gain or loss equal to the sales proceeds less the value of the stock on the\ndelivery date. Any capital gain or loss will be long-term if the participant held the stock for more than one year and\notherwise will be short-term.\nOther Stock-Based Awards. The tax consequences associated with any other stock-based award granted under the\nAmended 2022 Plan will vary depending on the specific terms of such award. Among the relevant factors are whether or\nnot the award has a readily ascertainable fair market value, whether or not the award is subject to forfeiture provisions or\nrestrictions on transfer, the nature of the property to be received by the participant under the award, and the participant’s\nholding period and tax basis for the award or underlying common stock.\nTax Consequences to the Company. There will be no tax consequences to the Company except that the Company\nwill be entitled to a deduction when a participant has compensation income, subject to the limitations of Section 162(m) of\nthe Code.\nTHE BOARD UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS THAT STOCKHOLDERS VOTE “FOR” THE APPROVAL\nOF THE AMENDMENT TO THE 2022 EQUITY INCENTIVE PLAN, AS AMENDED.\n45\nPROPOSAL 3:\nAPPROVAL OF AN AMENDMENT TO OUR AMENDED & RESTATED 2013 EMPLOYEE STOCK\nPURCHASE PLAN TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK AVAILABLE\nFOR ISSUANCE THEREUNDER BY 5,000,000 SHARES\nOn March 14, 2024, upon the recommendation of our Compensation Committee, our Board approved the adoption,\nsubject to stockholder approval, of an amendment (the “ESPP Amendment”) to the Company’s Amended & Restated\n2013 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the “Amended & Restated ESPP” and, as amended by the ESPP Amendment, the\n“Amended 2013 ESPP”)), to increase the number of shares of common stock authorized for issuance under the Amended\n& Restated ESPP from 4,008,923 shares to 9,008,923 shares. No other amendments are being made to the Amended &\nRestated ESPP.\nThe Amended 2013 ESPP is intended to benefit the Company and our stockholders by attracting, retaining and\nmotivating talented employees, which we believe to be critical for our success, and aligning the interests of participating\nemployees with those of our stockholders. We believe that the ability to participate in the Amended 2013 ESPP is an\nattractive feature for current and potential employees by affording them the opportunity to share in the growth and success\nof the Company. The Amended 2013 ESPP also helps to attract and retain employees because employee stock purchase\nplans are commonly offered by our peers and other industry leaders. As of March 29, 2024, 1,632,818 shares remained\navailable for future issuance under the Amended & Restated ESPP without giving effect to the approval of the ESPP\nAmendment. We estimate that, with an increase of 5,000,000 shares, we will have a sufficient number of shares of\ncommon stock to cover purchases under the Amended 2013 ESPP through approximately 2027, though the actual duration\nof the reserved shares will depend on participation and our stock price. Our Board believes it is in the best interests of the\nCompany and our stockholders to continue to provide our employees with the opportunity to acquire an ownership interest\nin the Company through their participation in the Amended 2013 ESPP, encouraging them to remain in our employ and\nmore closely aligning their interests with those of our stockholders. If the ESPP Amendment is not approved by our\nstockholders, our ability to recruit and retain employees could be negatively impacted if we do not have sufficient\nauthorized shares available for future issuance under our Amended 2013 ESPP for our employees’ participation. To\nfurther encourage stock ownership among our employees while providing our employees with a benefit that is common in\nthe companies with which we compete for talent, our Board has approved the ESPP Amendment. If the Company’s\nstockholders do not approve the ESPP Amendment, the proposed 5,000,000 additional shares will not become available\nfor issuance under our Amended & Restated ESPP and we will not have sufficient shares to maintain our Amended &\nRestated ESPP after the current offering period. In such event, our Board will consider whether to adopt alternative\narrangements based on its assessment of the Company’s compensation practices and the competitive markets in which the\nCompany competes for talented employees.\nOur Board urges stockholders to vote for this proposal as failure to obtain the required vote may limit the\nCompany’s ability to attract, retain and motivate employees. If this proposal is approved by our stockholders, we intend to\nregister the additional shares authorized for issuance under the Amended 2013 ESPP by filing a Registration Statement on\nForm S-8 as soon as practicable following such approval.\nDescription of the Amended 2013 ESPP\nThe following is a brief summary of the Amended 2013 ESPP. The following description is only a summary of the\nmaterial terms of the Amended 2013 ESPP, and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Amended & Restated ESPP\nand Amendment No. 1, a copy of each of which is attached to this proxy statement as Appendix B.\nEligibility\nAll employees of the Company and any subsidiary of the Company designated by our Board or Compensation\nCommittee are eligible to participate in the Amended 2013 ESPP, provided that they work more than twenty (20) hours\nper week and for more than five (5) months in a calendar year, have been employed by the Company or a designated\nsubsidiary for at least 30 days prior to enrolling in the Amended 2013 ESPP and are employed on the first day of the\napplicable offering period. No employee can be granted an option under the Amended 2013 ESPP that would result in the\nemployee owning common stock and/or options to purchase common stock representing five percent or more of the total\ncombined voting power or value of all classes of our outstanding capital stock. As of March 29, 2024, approximately 320\n46\nemployees (excluding NEOs and other executive officers), all five NEOs and one other executive officer who is not a\nNEO would have been eligible to participate in the Amended 2013 ESPP. Non-employee directors, consultants and\nadvisors are not permitted to participate in the Amended 2013 ESPP.\nAmended 2013 ESPP Operation\nThe Amended 2013 ESPP permits eligible employees to purchase shares of our common stock at a discount.\nEligible employees may elect to participate by completing an enrollment form, timely filing it with our payroll office and\nauthorizing after-tax payroll deductions from their pay. Employees can elect to contribute up to 15 percent (or such lower\nmaximum contribution rate as our Board or Compensation Committee may, at its discretion, designate). Our Board or\nCompensation Committee may also, in its discretion, establish a different minimum payroll deduction percentage.\nThe Amended 2013 ESPP will be implemented by consecutive six (6) month offering periods. Our Board or\nCompensation Committee may, in its discretion, choose a different offering period of not more than twelve (12) months.\nOffering periods will begin at such time as our Board may determine. On the first day of each offering period, each\nemployee who is enrolled in the Amended 2013 ESPP will automatically receive an option to purchase, on the last trading\nday of the offering period, up to that number of shares of our common stock determined by multiplying $2,083 by the\nnumber of full months in the offering period and dividing the result by the closing price of our common stock on the first\nday of the offering period, or such lesser number of shares set by the Board or Compensation Committee.\nHowever, no eligible employee may be granted an option under the Amended 2013 ESPP that permits the\nemployee’s rights to purchase shares under the Amended 2013 ESPP to accrue at a rate that exceeds $25,000 in fair\nmarket value (determined at the date the option is granted) of our common stock in any given calendar year in which such\noption is outstanding at any time.\nUnless an employee withdraws from the Amended 2013 ESPP, the employee’s option will be exercised\nautomatically on the last trading day of the offering period as to the largest whole number of shares that are exercisable\nand can be purchased with the deductions accumulated as of the last trading day of the offering period.\nOur Board or Compensation Committee will determine the purchase price of each of the shares purchased in a given\noffering period. The purchase price will be at least 85% of (i) the closing price of a share of our common stock on the first\ntrading day of the offering period or the last trading day of the offering period, whichever is lower or (ii) the closing price\nof a share of our common stock on the last trading day of the offering period. In the absence of a determination by the\nBoard or the Compensation Committee, the purchase price will be 85% of the lesser of the closing price of our common\nstock on the first trading day of the offering period or the last trading day of the offering period.\nAll payroll deductions received or held by the Company under the Amended 2013 ESPP may be used by us for any\ncorporate purpose, and we will not be obligated to segregate such payroll deductions. No interest will accrue on the\npayroll deductions (except to the extent that our Board or Compensation Committee, in its sole discretion, elects to credit\nemployee accounts with interest at a rate that it determines). An employee may decrease or discontinue the employee’s\npayroll deductions once during any offering period, by filing a new payroll deduction authorization form. However, an\nemployee may not increase his or her payroll deduction during an offering period. Employees may purchase common\nstock under the Amended 2013 ESPP only through payroll deductions. An employee’s payroll deduction elections remain\nin effect for successive offering periods unless amended or terminated by the employee at the time and on the terms set\nforth in the Amended 2013 ESPP. In addition, an employee may elect to discontinue his or her payroll deductions during\nan offering period but not elect to withdraw his or her funds. In such cases, funds deducted prior to his or her election to\ndiscontinue shall be applied to the purchase of common stock on the last day of the offering period in which the funds\nwere deducted. If an employee withdraws from participation during an offering period, the amounts contributed to the\nAmended 2013 ESPP will be refunded promptly without interest and the employee’s option granted for such offering\nperiod will automatically terminate. At the end of the offering period, the accumulated payroll contributions of each\nemployee who continues to participate in the plan as of such date will be used to purchase shares of common stock (at the\npurchase price described above) subject to the limitations described above. An employee’s withdrawal from an offering\nperiod will not have any effect upon his or her eligibility to participate in succeeding offering periods or in any other\nsimilar plan which the Company may adopt.\n47\nThe value of the common stock purchased will vary based on the fair market value of our common stock on the last\nday of the offering period. Accordingly, the dollar value and the number of shares that may be purchased in the future\npursuant to the Amended 2013 ESPP are not currently determinable.\nWe are required to make equitable adjustments to the number and class of securities available under the Amended\n2013 ESPP, the share limitations under the Amended 2013 ESPP and the purchase price for an offering period under the\nAmended 2013 ESPP to reflect stock splits, reverse stock splits, stock dividends, recapitalizations, combinations of shares,\nreclassifications of shares, spin-offs and other similar changes in capitalization or events or any dividends or distributions\nto holders of our common stock other than ordinary cash dividends.\nIn connection with a merger or other reorganization event (as defined in the Amended 2013 ESPP), our Board or a\ncommittee appointed by our Board may take any one or more of the following actions as to outstanding options to\npurchase shares of our common stock under the Amended 2013 ESPP on such terms as our Board or a committee\ndetermines:\n• provide that options shall be assumed, or substantially equivalent options shall be substituted, by the acquiring\nor succeeding corporation (or an affiliate thereof);\n• upon written notice to employees, provide that all outstanding options will be terminated immediately prior to\nthe consummation of such reorganization event and that all such outstanding options will become exercisable\nto the extent of accumulated payroll deductions as of a date specified by our Board or committee in such\nnotice, which date shall not be less than ten days preceding the effective date of the reorganization event;\n• upon written notice to employees, provide that all outstanding options will be cancelled as of a date prior to\nthe effective date of the reorganization event and that all accumulated payroll deductions will be returned to\nparticipating employees on such date;\n• in the event of a reorganization event under the terms of which holders of our common stock will receive\nupon consummation thereof a cash payment for each share surrendered in the reorganization event, which we\nrefer to as the acquisition price, change the last day of the offering period to be the date of the consummation\nof the reorganization event, and make or provide for a cash payment to each employee equal to (1) the\nacquisition price times the number of shares of our common stock that the employee’s accumulated payroll\ndeductions as of immediately prior to the reorganization event could purchase at the applicable purchase\nprice, where the acquisition price is treated as the fair market value of our common stock on the last day of the\napplicable offering period for purposes of determining the purchase price and where the number of shares that\ncould be purchased is subject to the applicable limitations under the Amended 2013 ESPP, minus (2) the\nresult of multiplying such number of shares by the purchase price;\n• provide that, in connection with our liquidation or dissolution, options shall convert into the right to receive\nliquidation proceeds (net of the purchase price thereof); and\n• any combination of the above actions.\nAuthorized Shares\nSubject to adjustment, as described above, the maximum aggregate number of shares of our common stock\nauthorized for issuance pursuant to the exercise of options granted under the Amended 2013 ESPP will be 9,008,923\nshares. If the total number of shares of common stock with respect to which options are to be exercised at the end of an\noffering period exceeds the number of shares remaining available for issuance under the Amended 2013 ESPP, the\nCompany will only issue to employees in that offering that number of shares remaining available for issuance, on a pro-\nrata basis.\nAdministration\nThe Amended 2013 ESPP will be administered by our Board or by a committee appointed by the Board. Our Board\nhas appointed the Compensation Committee to administer the Amended 2013 ESPP. Our Board or the Compensation\nCommittee has authority to make rules and regulations for the administration of the Amended 2013 ESPP, and its\ninterpretation and decisions with respect to the Amended 2013 ESPP will be final and conclusive.\n48\nOur Board or Compensation Committee has the ability to change offering periods (including the commencement\ndates and length thereof) with respect to future offerings without stockholder approval. Our Board may terminate, suspend\nor amend the Amended 2013 ESPP at any time and for any reason, however if the approval of any amendment of the\nAmended 2013 ESPP by the stockholders is required in order for the plan to continue to satisfy the requirements of\nSection 423 of the Code, then such amendment will not be effective unless and until approved by the Company’s\nstockholders.\nOur Board or Compensation Committee may allow employees who are citizens or residents of foreign jurisdictions\nto participate in an offering period or establish sub-plans for the benefit of such foreign employees to the extent such\nactions are in compliance with Section 423 of the Code.\nPlan Benefits\nParticipation in the Amended 2013 ESPP is discretionary. The benefits received by any individual under the plan\nare dependent upon the individual’s decision to participate in the Amended 2013 ESPP, the amount that the individual\ndecides to contribute to the Amended 2013 ESPP and the fair market value of the Company’s common stock on the\nexercise date. As a result, it is not possible to determine the benefits that will be received under the Amended 2013 ESPP\nby the Company’s NEOs, other executive officers and other employees. Non-employee directors, consultants and advisors\nare not eligible to participate in the Amended 2013 ESPP. On March 29, 2024, the last reported sale price of our common\nstock on the Nasdaq Global Select Market was $1.51.\nThe table below sets forth, for each of the individuals and groups indicated, the number of shares of our common\nstock purchased under the ESPP since inception through March 29, 2024.\nDollar Value Number of Shares\nName and Position $ (1) Purchased\nRichard Paulson, President and Chief Executive Officer — —\nMichael Mason, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer — —\nSohanya Cheng, Executive Vice President, Chief Commercial Officer 18,472 7,876\nStuart Poulton, Executive Vice President, Chief Development Officer — —\nReshma Rangwala, Executive Vice President, Chief Medical Officer and Head of Research — —\nAll current executive officers as a group 18,472 7,876\nAll current directors who are not executive officers as a group* — —\nEach nominee for election as a director* — —\nEach associate of any of such directors, executive officers or nominees — —\nEach other person who received or is to receive 5% of awards — —\nAll employees, including all current officers who are not executive officers, as a group 12,052,401 2,368,229\n* Ineligible to participate in the ESPP.\n(1) Based on the number of shares purchased multiplied by the closing price of our common stock on the applicable\nexercise date.\nFederal Income Tax Consequences\nThe following generally summarizes the United States federal income tax consequences that will arise with respect\nto participation in the Amended 2013 ESPP and with respect to the sale of common stock acquired under the plan. This\nsummary is based on the tax laws in effect as of the date of this proxy statement. The Amended 2013 ESPP is intended to\nqualify as an “employee stock purchase plan” as defined in Section 423 of the Code. This summary assumes that the\nAmended 2013 ESPP complies with Section 423 of the Code. Further, this summary assumes that the purchase price for\nshares is 85% of the closing price of a share of our common stock on the first day of the offering period or the last day of\nthe offering period, whichever is lower. Changes to these laws could alter the tax consequences described below.\nTax Consequences to Participants\nA participant will not have income upon enrolling in the Amended 2013 ESPP or upon purchasing stock at the end\nof a purchase period. A participant may have both compensation income and a capital gain or loss upon the sale of stock\nthat was acquired under the Amended 2013 ESPP. The amount of each type of income and loss will depend on whether\nthe participant disposes of the stock in a qualifying or disqualifying disposition. A qualifying disposition is when the\n49\nparticipant sells the stock more than two years after the commencement of the offering during which the stock was\npurchased and more than one year after the date on which the participant purchased the stock at a profit (i.e., the sales\nproceeds exceed the purchase price). In a qualifying disposition, the participant will have compensation income equal to\nthe lesser of:\n• 15% of the value of the stock on the day the offering commenced; and\n• the difference between the fair market value of the stock on the date of disposition and the purchase price.\nAny profit in excess of compensation income will be long-term capital gain. If the participant sells the stock at a\nloss (i.e., if sales proceeds are less than the purchase price) after satisfying these waiting periods, then the loss will be a\nlong-term capital loss.\nIf the participant sells the stock prior to satisfying these waiting periods, then he or she will have engaged in a\ndisqualifying disposition. Upon a disqualifying disposition, the participant will have compensation income equal to the\nvalue of the stock on the day he or she purchased the stock less the purchase price. The participant also will have a capital\ngain or loss equal to the difference between the sales proceeds and the value of the stock on the day he or she purchased\nthe stock. This capital gain or loss will be long-term if the participant has held the stock for more than one year and short-\nterm if held one year or less.\nTax Consequences to Us\nThere will be no tax consequences to us except that we will be entitled to a deduction when a participant recognizes\ncompensation income upon a disqualifying disposition. Any such deduction will be subject to the limitations of Section\n162(m) of the Code.\nTHE BOARD UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS THAT STOCKHOLDERS VOTE “FOR” THE APPROVAL\nOF THE AMENDMENT TO OUR AMENDED & RESTATED 2013 EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN.\n50\nPROPOSAL 4:\nAPPROVAL OF A ONE-TIME STOCK OPTION EXCHANGE PROGRAM FOR NON-EXECUTIVE OFFICER\nEMPLOYEES\nIntroduction\nWe are seeking stockholder approval of a one-time stock option exchange program (the “Option Exchange”) that\nwould allow U.S. employees who are not executive officers (“Eligible Participants”) to exchange out-of-the-money or\n“underwater” stock options, meaning outstanding stock options that have an exercise price that is significantly greater\nthan the market price for our stock, for a number of RSUs that is less than the number of options exchanged based on\nexchange ratios, as described below (the “Exchange Ratios”). No executive officers, directors, consultants or advisors are\neligible to participate in the Option Exchange. Unless otherwise indicated, all numbers presented in this proposal were\ndetermined as of March 29, 2024, the date on which an analysis related to the proposed Option Exchange was performed\nby Infinite Equity, Inc. (“Infinite Equity”), an outside consulting firm. These numbers are provided for illustrative\npurposes only. If the proposed Option Exchange is approved at the Annual Meeting and subsequently implemented, an\nupdated analysis will be conducted prior to filing the Schedule TO with the SEC to effect the Option Exchange.\nStockholder-Friendly Design\nIn reviewing alternatives to address our employees’ underwater options, our Compensation Committee and Board\nprioritized equitably considering the interests of our stockholders as well as those of our employees. We believe the\ndesign of the Option Exchange achieves this objective by providing a much less dilutive and more cost-effective retention\nand incentive tool than issuing additional equity or paying more cash compensation in order to continue to retain and\nmotivate our non-executive officer employees. We designed the Option Exchange by prudently balancing our goals of\nrestoring equity value for our non-executive officer employees, increasing employee retention and motivation in a\ncompetitive labor market, reducing the dilution created by the underwater stock options and better aligning our employee\nand stockholder interests for long-term growth. We believe the following features of the Option Exchange, as discussed in\nmore detail below, align with our stockholders’ interests and will allow us to continue to achieve our strategic goals and\nprovide future stockholder value:\n• Value for Value: The Option Exchange is not a one-for-one exchange. Instead, the number of new RSUs that\nare granted for surrendered options will be based on the Exchange Ratios, which are intended to result in a\n“value for value” exchange, meaning that the accounting fair value of the new RSUs will be approximately\nequal to the fair value of the stock options that are surrendered and will therefore not result in a windfall to\nparticipants nor significant incremental accounting expenses.\n• No Share Recycling: Shares from exchanged stock options that are in excess of the shares needed to issue the\nnew RSUs will not become available under the 2022 Plan, limiting future dilution.\n• New Vesting Term: The new RSUs will be unvested on the date of grant and will be subject to an 18 month\nvesting schedule commencing on the date of grant, subject to the holder’s continued service with us through\neach applicable vesting date.\n• Overhang Reduction: The number of shares subject to stock options surrendered in the Option Exchange\nwill not become available under the 2022 Plan except with respect to the number of shares subject to the new\nRSUs granted under the 2022 Plan pursuant to the Option Exchange, which will therefore result in a reduction\nof the overhang from our equity compensation program.\n• Limited Eligible Participants: Our executive officers, non-employee directors, consultants, advisors, non-\nU.S. employees and former employees are excluded from participation in the Option Exchange to keep the\nfocus on the retention of our current non-executive workforce.\n• Limited Eligible Stock Options: Only options granted before December 31, 2022 and that have an exercise\nprice of greater than $3.35 will be eligible to be exchanged for new RSUs to ensure that the program is not\ndesigned to address immaterial or fleeting changes in our stock price.\n51\nBackground\nWe rely on our employees to implement our strategic initiatives and expand and develop our business. Competition\nfor many of these employees, particularly in the pharmaceutical industry, is intense and many companies use stock\noptions as a means of attracting, motivating and retaining their key employees. Stock options have historically constituted\na critical part of our incentive and retention programs because our Board believes that equity compensation encourages\nemployees to work toward our success and rewards their contributions by allowing them to benefit from increases in the\nvalue of our common stock. The successes we have achieved are the result of significant, sustained efforts on their part\nand therefore, retaining their know-how and services is important to our ability to achieve our 2024 and longer-term\ncorporate goals, including (i) the successful execution of our clinical development program, focused on our three ongoing\npivotal Phase 3 trials, which, if approved could potentially create new standards of care for patients suffering from\nendometrial cancer, multiple myeloma and/or myelofibrosis; and (ii) continuing to leverage our and our partners’\ncommercial capabilities to grow our position in the multiple myeloma market both in the U.S. and abroad. We also believe\nthat it is important to reward our employees for their substantial efforts to date and going forward.\nWhile we have achieved a number of important milestones and made significant progress on our commercial,\nclinical development, organizational, and business goals over the past several years and we are optimistic regarding our\npotential future growth opportunities, the price of our common stock remains below historic levels. In the last several\nyears, our stock price has experienced significant volatility, due to a number of potential factors, many of which were\noutside the control of our company and employees, including a challenging financial market impacted by macro-economic\nfactors, worsening of investor sentiment leading to pressures in stock prices, particularly in the pharmaceutical and\nbiotech industries and a significantly increased competitive environment in the multiple myeloma market. As a result, our\nstock price fell from approximately $20.02 per share on March 30, 2020 to $1.51 per share on March 29, 2024. The\nsignificant decline in the price of our common stock has had a meaningful negative impact on the total compensation\nearned by our employees, which we believe to be a considerable challenge to our talent retention efforts.\nOn March 29, 2024, the closing price of our common stock on The Nasdaq Global Select Market was $1.51 per\nshare, resulting in 100% of our outstanding stock options held by Eligible Participants being underwater on such date,\nwith approximately 96% of those stock options having an exercise price of $5.00 or higher. Simply stated, these options\nare so significantly underwater that they do not have any retention or incentive value for our employees, and yet they will\nremain outstanding as a stock option “overhang” affecting all stockholders until they are exercised, expire or are otherwise\ncancelled (for example upon termination of the employee’s service with the Company). This overhang represents future\npotential (though unlikely) dilution to our stockholders and therefore negatively impacts our ability to increase our share\npool under our 2022 Plan, as presented above in Proposal 2, to sufficiently address our near-term equity needs. If the\nOption Exchange is approved by our stockholders and all eligible employees participate, then, based on currently expected\nExchange Ratios, the number of RSUs to be granted in exchange for 2,608,932 shares underlying outstanding eligible\nstock options would be 984,274. Importantly, any shares subject to underwater options that are exchanged in the Option\nExchange will not be returned to our equity plans, except with respect to the shares needed to grant the new RSUs. As\nsuch, the Option Exchange will result in an actual reduction in our overhang. The magnitude of the actual reduction in our\noverhang will depend upon a number of factors, including the level of participation in the Option Exchange and the final\nExchange Ratios.\nThe Option Exchange is thus purposely designed to balance the interests of our stockholders, by reducing our\noverhang, with our critical need to retain and incentivize our employees by granting RSUs with a new 18 month vesting\nschedule. We have a pressing need to retain and motivate our key talent, particularly in light of the highly competitive\nnature of the labor market in the pharmaceutical industry and the significant efforts, historical expertise and continuity\nneeded from our employees to continue to grow our multiple myeloma business, advance our three ongoing pivotal Phase\n3 clinical trials and execute on our long-term strategic initiatives. We believe that equity compensation provides a\nmeaningful incentive for our employees, creates an essential link between our employees and our stockholders and allows\nus to conserve cash resources to support our growth objectives. We also believe that our success depends, in large part, on\nour ability to maintain a competitive position by attracting, retaining and motivating key employees with experience and\nability. Central to these objectives is our equity compensation program, which is consistent with our compensation\nphilosophy and the compensatory practices of other pharmaceutical companies in our peer group and other companies that\nwe compete with for talent.\n52\nAccordingly, our Board believes approval of the Option Exchange is in the best interests of the Company and its\nstockholders and recommends a vote “FOR” the approval of the Option Exchange described below. The remainder of this\nProposal 4 includes:\n• Option Exchange Program Considerations\n• Reasons for the Option Exchange\n• Structure of the Option Exchange\n• Option Exchange Process\n• Impact of the Option Exchange\n• Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences\nOption Exchange Program Considerations\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2023, our management team and Compensation Committee began evaluating various\nalternatives for providing market competitive compensation to our employees. In consultation with the Compensation\nCommittee’s compensation consultant, Compensia, Inc. (“Compensia”), our management and Compensation Committee\nevaluated several alternatives to the Option Exchange, including granting additional stock options or restricted stock unit\nawards, paying additional cash compensation, repricing underwater stock options, exchanging underwater options for\nreplacement options or RSUs or exchanging underwater options for a cash payment, or some combination thereof. Each\nalternative was analyzed to assess whether it would be beneficial to our employees and in the best interests of our\nstockholders. Once our management team and Compensation Committee determined that the Option Exchange best\nbalanced our employee equity compensation needs with stockholder interests, they thoroughly evaluated whether or not to\ninclude executive officers or directors as eligible participants in the Option Exchange, and elected not to propose\nincluding executive officers or directors as eligible participants in the Option Exchange. After careful consideration, upon\nthe recommendation of our Compensation Committee, our Board determined that the Option Exchange was the most\nattractive alternative for the Company, its stockholders, and its employees for the reasons set forth in more detail in the\nsection below titled “Reasons for the Option Exchange.”\nOn March 14, 2024 our Board authorized the Option Exchange, subject to stockholder approval, pursuant to which\nwe would give Eligible Participants the opportunity to exchange eligible stock options for a lesser number of RSUs. Any\nstock option held by an eligible employee that was granted before December 31, 2022 and that has an exercise price of\ngreater than $3.35 (which were granted under our 2022 Plan, our 2013 Plan or our 2022 Inducement Plan or as\ninducement stock options granted pursuant to Nasdaq Listing Rule 5635(c)(4) outside of the 2022 Inducement Plan\n(“Inducement Options” and, together with the 2022 Plan, 2013 Plan, and 2022 Inducement Plan, the “Equity Plans”), is an\neligible stock option under the Option Exchange. All U.S. non-executive officer employees who are employed by us and\nhold eligible stock options as of the commencement of the Option Exchange shall be Eligible Participants. Members of\nour Board and our executive officers are not eligible to participate in the Option Exchange.\nAs of March 29, 2024, there were 2,608,932 shares of common stock underlying outstanding stock options held by\nEligible Participants with exercise prices ranging from $3.40 to $35.97 and a weighted average exercise price of $10.92.\nAll of these stock options have an exercise price greater than $3.35 per share and would therefore be eligible for the\nOption Exchange, if the Option Exchange is approved by our stockholders. The $3.35 per share threshold exercise price of\nthe eligible stock options is approximately 150% above the $1.34 per share closing price of our common stock on The\nNasdaq Global Select Market on March 14, 2024, the date on which our Board authorized the Option Exchange.\nStockholder approval of the Option Exchange is required under the terms of our 2022 Plan and the Nasdaq Listing\nRules. We also believe seeking stockholder approval of the Option Exchange promotes strong corporate governance. If\nour stockholders approve this proposal, our Board, Compensation Committee and management will implement the Option\nExchange, which must be effected through a tender offer under federal securities laws, as described below.\n53\nReasons for the Option Exchange\nEmployee Retention\nAs of March 29, 2024, 100% of the stock options held by the Eligible Participants were underwater, with 96%\nsignificantly underwater. As a result, we face considerable challenges in retaining such employees, and there is a\npossibility that our competitors may be able to offer equity incentives that are more attractive and that, in many cases, are\nmore market competitive than what we are currently offering to our existing employees. The Option Exchange is designed\nto address these concerns as well as improve morale among our employees generally and emphasize the importance of\nequity compensation as a component of our overall compensation package and a meaningful part of our pay-for-\nperformance philosophy.\nAs discussed in more detail below, none of the new RSUs issued under the Option Exchange will be vested on the\ndate of grant. Under the Option Exchange, Eligible Participants may surrender eligible options, including options that are\nfully vested when surrendered, for new RSUs, with 50% of the new RSUs vesting on the one-year anniversary of the grant\ndate and the remaining 50% vesting on the 18 month anniversary of the grant date, subject to continued service with us on\nthe respective vesting dates. We believe that the new RSUs, together with the new vesting requirements, creates the\npotential for a significant positive impact on retention, motivation and performance.\nRestoration of Equity Incentives\nIt is critical to our success that we motivate our employees. As noted above, we face intense competition for\nexperienced and talented personnel in our industry, and equity incentive awards must be a substantial part of our overall\ncompensation program in order for us to effectively compete for and retain that talent. We believe that significantly\nunderwater stock options are less effective as performance incentives because they provide little or no perceived value to\nemployee option holders, as stock options cannot be sold and only provide value to the holder when the trading price\nexceeds the option exercise price.\nWe believe that failure to address, in the near to medium term, the fact that 100% of stock options held by the\nEligible Participants were underwater as of March 29, 2024 will make it more difficult for us to motivate employees,\nwhich could negatively impact our business and results of operations. We believe that granting our non-executive officer\nemployees the opportunity to exchange their underwater stock options for RSUs would be far more effective in\nincentivizing eligible participants than the existing significantly underwater options.\nRealignment of Stockholder and Employee Interests\nIn considering alternatives to address our underwater stock options, our Compensation Committee was particularly\nmindful of structuring a program that would be acceptable to our stockholders and would align our employees’ interests\nwith those of our stockholders. We believe that the proposed Option Exchange provides a more cost-effective and\nstockholder-friendly retention and incentive tool as compared to other alternatives, including leaving the underwater\noptions outstanding, granting additional equity awards or paying higher cash compensation. As described above, the\nunderwater options create significant overhang that dilutes all stockholders without providing meaningful employee\nretention or incentives. Leaving underwater options outstanding and granting additional equity awards would create an\neven larger overhang and could potentially overcompensate our employees if our stock price were to rebound\nsignificantly. Further, our Compensation Committee determined that we could not sustainably increase cash compensation\nin a meaningful manner without impeding our ability to invest the required and appropriate resources to execute our\nbusiness goals, including the successful execution of our three ongoing pivotal Phase 3 clinical trials.\nThus, to accomplish the compensatory goals of the Option Exchange for our employees but also prioritize the\ninterests of our stockholders, the Exchange Ratios for the Option Exchange are intended to approximate, as closely as\npossible, as of a date shortly before the commencement of the exchange, a value for value exchange for accounting\npurposes, assuming all eligible options are exchanged. Specifically, the Exchange Ratios will be applied on a grant-by-\ngrant basis and will generally be designed to result in a fair value, for accounting purposes under ASC 718, of the new\nRSUs that will be approximately equal to the fair value of the exchanged stock options (based on valuation assumptions\nmade shortly before the Option Exchange commences). The Exchange Ratios will be established by grouping together\neligible options with certain exercise prices and assigning an appropriate exchange ratio to each grouping, based on the\nfair value of the eligible options (calculated using the Black-Scholes model in compliance with ASC 718) within the\n54\nrelevant grouping. Setting the Exchange Ratios in this manner is intended to result in the issuance of new RSUs that have\na fair value that is approximately equal to the fair value of the exchanged stock options. This should minimize any\nadditional compensation cost that we must recognize upon granting the new RSUs, other than some incremental\ncompensation expense that might result from fluctuations in the fair market value of our common stock after the Exchange\nRatios have been set but before the exchange date.\nReduction of Overhang\nAs of March 29, 2024, we had a total of 2,608,932 shares of common stock subject to outstanding stock options\nissued to Eligible Participants under our Equity Plans, with a range in exercise prices from $3.40 to $35.97 per share. As a\nresult, we have developed a significant stock option “overhang” consisting of outstanding but unexercised options, all of\nwhich are underwater and therefore not serving their intended purposes of motivating and retaining employees. Not only\ndo the underwater stock options have diminished employee retentive value, but they also cannot be removed from our\nstock option overhang until they are exercised, expire or are otherwise cancelled (for example, upon termination of an\nemployee’s service with the Company). We estimate that this overhang, which represents potential future dilution that\ncould result over the life of the options, could be reduced by approximately 1%, assuming all stock options are exchanged\nin the Option Exchange and based on currently assumed Exchange Ratios.\nAlignment of Stock Compensation Expense with Retention Value\nThe stock options eligible for exchange have exercise prices that were equal to the fair market value of our common\nstock on the original grant date for such options. Under applicable accounting rules, we are required to continue to\nrecognize stock compensation expense related to underwater options while they remain outstanding, even if they are never\nexercised. We believe that it is unproductive to recognize compensation expense on stock options that are not valued by\nour employees. Because the Exchange Ratios will be designed to approximate, as closely as possible, as of a date shortly\nbefore the commencement of the Option Exchange, a value-neutral exchange for accounting purposes, assuming all\neligible options are exchanged, we do not anticipate that there will be significant additional stock compensation expenses\nassociated with the new RSUs. Replacing underwater options that result in stock compensation expenses but have little or\nno retention or incentive value with new RSUs that will provide both enhanced retention and incentive value is a more\nefficient and effective compensation strategy.\nStructure of the Option Exchange\nThe following is a summary of the terms of the Option Exchange recommended by our Compensation Committee\nand adopted by our Board, subject to stockholder approval. Our Compensation Committee and Board reserve the right to\nmodify the terms of the Option Exchange (but not in a manner that is more favorable to Eligible Participants), or to\npostpone or cancel the Option Exchange, whether before or after the exchange period has commenced. The definitive\nterms of the Option Exchange will be set forth in an “Offer to Exchange” and related materials prepared under the federal\nsecurities laws, which are expected to be distributed to holders of eligible options shortly after the Annual Meeting,\nprovided that our stockholders approve the Option Exchange.\nEligible Participants\nThe Option Exchange will be available to U.S. employees, excluding our executive officers, who on the\ncommencement date for the Option Exchange are both employed by us and hold outstanding eligible stock options. Our\nexecutive officers, non-employee directors, consultants and advisors and non-U.S. employees are not eligible to\nparticipate in the Option Exchange. As of March 29, 2024, eligible stock options were held by 228 eligible employees,\nrepresenting approximately 71% of our non-executive officer employees. In order to receive new RSUs, participants in the\nOption Exchange must continue to be employed by us through the end of the Option Exchange period (the date the\nsurrendered options are cancelled and new RSUs are granted). Any employee holding eligible stock options who elects to\nparticipate in the Option Exchange, but whose service with us terminates for any reason before the date the new RSUs are\ngranted, including due to voluntary resignation, retirement, involuntary termination, layoff, death or disability, will retain\nhis or her eligible stock options subject to their existing terms and will not be eligible to receive new RSUs in the Option\nExchange.\n55\nEligible Stock Options\nAn eligible stock option includes any stock option granted under our Equity Plans that is held by an Eligible\nParticipant that was granted before December 31, 2022 and that has an exercise price greater than $3.35 per share.\nAs of March 29, 2024, eligible stock options to purchase 2,608,932 shares of common stock under our Equity Plans\nwere outstanding, with a weighted average exercise price of $10.92 per share and with a weighted average remaining life\nof 5.98 years. These eligible stock options represent approximately 31% of our outstanding stock options and\napproximately 2.2% of the issued and outstanding shares of our common stock as of March 29, 2024. If all of the eligible\noptions are exchanged pursuant to the Option Exchange and all holders of such options remain employed by the Company\non the last day of the Option Exchange period, then 984,274 RSUs will be granted to eligible holders, based on currently\nassumed Exchange Ratios.\nIllustrative Exchange Ratios\nThe Option Exchange is not a one-for-one exchange but is designed to approximate, as closely as possible, as of a\ndate shortly before commencement of the Option Exchange, a value-neutral exchange for accounting purposes, assuming\nall eligible options are exchanged (based on valuation assumptions made as of such date). In consultation with Compensia\nand Infinite Equity, our Compensation Committee established the Exchange Ratios illustrated below by grouping together\neligible stock options with similar exercise prices. Although the precise Exchange Ratio that will be used for the Option\nExchange cannot be determined now, and will depend on factors such as the accounting fair value of eligible stock options\n(calculated using a Black-Scholes option pricing model) and the fair market value of our common stock at the time of the\nOption Exchange, the table below provides an example of the Exchange Ratios that our Compensation Committee would\nuse if the fair market value of our common stock is $1.51 per share shortly before the commencement of the Option\nExchange. Calculation of fair value takes into account variables such as the volatility of our stock, the expected term of a\nstock option and interest rates. As shown in the table below, the applicable Exchange Ratios will vary based on the\nexercise price of the eligible stock option.\nAggregate Number of Exchange Ratio\nExercise Price Range per Outstanding Eligible Weighted Average (Surrendered Eligible\nShare Options Remaining Life (In Years) Options to New RSUs)\n$3.35 to $7.50 747,752 7.42 2 to 1\n$7.51 to $25.00 1,742,680 5.56 3 to 1\n$25.01 and above 118,500 3.22 4 to 1\nThe total number of shares of common stock subject to new RSUs will be determined by dividing the number of\nshares underlying the surrendered eligible option by the applicable Exchange Ratio and rounding down to the nearest\nwhole share. For purposes of illustration, if an eligible employee holds an eligible option to purchase 12,000 shares of\ncommon stock with an exercise price of $10.00 per share, the employee would be entitled to exchange that option for a\nnew RSU award covering 4,000 shares of common stock after applying the applicable 3:1 Exchange Ratio.\nVesting Schedules for New RSUs\nNew RSUs will not be vested on the date of grant. Eligible stock options, both that are vested and not vested as of\nthe exchange date, may be exchanged for new RSUs, 50% of which will vest on the one-year anniversary of the grant date\nand the remaining 50% of which will vest on the 18 month anniversary of the grant date, subject to continued service to us\non the respective vesting dates. This new vesting schedule supports the nature of equity awards as an incentive vehicle,\nrecognizes the prior services and contributions of eligible employees and provides us with a valuable additional period of\nemployee retention during a critical time for the Company.\nImpact of Option Exchange on Surrendered Options\nWhile the eligible stock options were granted under our various equity plans and arrangements, including as\ninducement awards outside of a stockholder approved plan, all new RSUs to be granted pursuant to the Option Exchange\nwill be granted under our 2022 Plan. Specifically, there are 2,608,932 shares underlying outstanding eligible stock\noptions. If these eligible options are exchanged in full, then we currently estimate that 984,274 new RSUs will be granted\nunder the 2022 Plan, assuming all eligible employees remain employed by us through the end of the Option Exchange\n56\nperiod and based on currently assumed Exchange Ratios. The 1,624,658 difference in the number of shares between the\nsurrendered options and the newly granted RSUs will not become available under the 2022 Plan.\nOption Exchange Process\nAdditional information regarding how we expect to conduct the Option Exchange, provided it is approved by\nstockholders, is set forth below. We may decide not to implement the Option Exchange even if we obtain stockholder\napproval, or we may delay, amend or terminate the Option Exchange once it is in progress (but not in a way that is more\nfavorable to Eligible Participants). Additionally, while we expect the terms of the Option Exchange to conform to the\nmaterial terms described in this Proposal 4, we may find it necessary or appropriate to change the terms of the Option\nExchange in response to Company policy decisions or to comply with any comments we may receive from the SEC,\nprovided that we will not change the terms of the Option Exchange in a manner that is more beneficial to Eligible\nParticipants without seeking further stockholder approval of such changes. The final terms of the Option Exchange will be\ndescribed in the exchange offer documents that will be filed with the SEC and available at www.sec.gov.\nOverview of the Option Exchange Process\nWe anticipate that the Option Exchange will commence as soon as reasonably practicable following approval of this\nProposal 4 by our stockholders (the “Commencement Date”). All U.S. employees, excluding our executive officers, who\nare employed by us on the Commencement Date, hold eligible stock option awards, and are still employed by us on the\ngrant date of the new RSUs may participate in the Option Exchange. Upon commencement of the Option Exchange,\nEligible Participants holding eligible stock options will receive a written exchange offer setting forth the terms of the\nOption Exchange in which they may voluntarily elect to participate. The written offer will be governed by the tender offer\nrules of the SEC. On or before the Commencement Date, we will file the offer to exchange and other related documents\nwith the SEC as part of a tender offer statement on Schedule TO. We will give eligible option holders at least 20 business\ndays to elect to participate in the Option Exchange. Eligible option holders may choose which eligible stock options they\nwish to exchange and may choose to exchange some, all or none of their eligible stock options. Upon completion of the\nOption Exchange, surrendered stock options will be cancelled and new RSUs will be granted.\nThe 2022 Plan, along with the terms set forth in the applicable award agreements for the new RSUs, will govern all\nterms and conditions of the new RSUs not specifically addressed by the Option Exchange described in this Proxy\nStatement, including treatment of the new RSUs following termination of employment.\nElection to Participate\nAssuming stockholder approval of the Option Exchange at the Annual Meeting, Eligible Participants will receive a\ntender offer document and will be able to voluntarily elect to participate in the Option Exchange. If you are both a\nstockholder and an eligible employee holding stock options that may be subject to the Option Exchange, please\nnote that voting to approve the Option Exchange pursuant to this Proposal 4 does not constitute an election to\nparticipate in the Option Exchange. The written exchange offer documents described above will be provided if and\nwhen stockholders have approved the Option Exchange and the Option Exchange has commenced, and eligible employees\nwill only be able to elect to participate after that time and in accordance with the terms of the written exchange offer\ndocuments.\nImpact of the Option Exchange\nEffect on Stockholders\nWhile we cannot predict how many Eligible Participants will elect to participate in the Option Exchange, the\nfollowing table illustrates the impact of the Option Exchange, grouped together by assumed Exchange Ratios, on the\nnumber of stock options outstanding as of March 29, 2024. The table below is based on the illustrative Exchange Ratios\nestablished by Infinite Equity and our Compensation Committee and set forth in the table above and assumes that 100% of\nemployees who are Eligible Participants as of March 29, 2024 participate in the Option Exchange and exchange 100% of\ntheir eligible stock options. In this example, the Option Exchange would result in a reduction in our equity overhang of\napproximately 1,624,658 shares of common stock.\n57\nOutstanding Eligible Stock Options Exchange\nAggregate\nNumber of\nShares Weighted\nUnderlying Average Potential Net\nExercise Price Eligible Options Exercise Price Exchange Aggregate RSUs Shares\nRange per Share (#) per Share ($) Ratio Granted Recaptured*\n$3.35 to $7.50 747,752 5.66 2 to 1 373,874 373,878\n$7.51 to $25.00 1,742,680 12.09 3 to 1 580,777 1,161,903\n$25.01 and above 118,500 26.80 4 to 1 29,623 88,877\nTotals 2,608,932 10.92 984,274 1,624,658\n* The net shares underlying eligible stock options in excess of the number of shares subject to the new RSUs granted in\nthe Option Exchange will not be returned to the pool available for issuance under the applicable Equity Plan.\nAs described above under the section titled “Exchange Ratios,” the total number of shares of common stock subject\nto new RSUs that a participating employee will receive with respect to a surrendered stock option will be determined by\ndividing the number of shares surrendered by the applicable Exchange Ratio and rounding down to the nearest whole\nshare.\nAccounting Impact\nWe follow the provisions of ASC 718, which requires that employee equity awards be accounted for under the fair\nvalue method. Any unrecognized compensation expense from the surrendered options will be recognized prior to the end\nof the service period of the new RSUs received in the Option Exchange. Incremental compensation cost, if any, associated\nwith the new RSUs under the Option Exchange will be recognized over the service period of the new RSUs. We do not\nexpect the incremental compensation expense, if any, to be material.\nMaterial U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Option Exchange\nThe following is a brief summary of certain U.S. federal income tax consequences generally arising with respect to\nthe Option Exchange.\nThe exchange of eligible options for new RSUs pursuant to the Option Exchange should be treated as the\ncancellation of the surrendered options and the grant of new RSUs. The Company and participating employees should not\nrecognize any income for U.S. federal income tax purposes upon either the cancellation of the surrendered options or the\ngrant of the new RSUs.\nThis discussion does not address all aspects of the U.S. federal income tax consequences of participating in the\nOption Exchange that may be relevant to eligible employees in light of their personal investment or tax circumstances and\ndoes not discuss any state, local or non-U.S. tax consequences of participating in the Option Exchange. Each eligible\nemployee is advised to consult his or her personal tax advisor concerning the application of the U.S. federal income tax\nlaws to such employee’s particular situation, as well as the applicability and effect of any state, local or non-U.S. tax laws\nbefore taking any actions with respect to the employee’s stock options eligible for the Option Exchange. The U.S. Internal\nRevenue Service is not precluded from adopting a contrary position, and the laws and regulations themselves are subject\nto change. A more detailed summary of the applicable tax considerations to eligible employees will be provided to them in\nconnection with the Option Exchange when it is commenced.\nIf you are both a stockholder and an eligible employee holding eligible stock options, please note that voting to approve\nthe Option Exchange does not constitute an election to participate in the Option Exchange.\nTHE BOARD UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS THAT STOCKHOLDERS VOTE “FOR” THE APPROVAL\nOF OUR ONE-TIME STOCK OPTION EXCHANGE PROGRAM FOR NON-EXECUTIVE OFFICER\nEMPLOYEES.\n58\nPROPOSAL 5:\nADVISORY VOTE ON THE COMPENSATION OF OUR NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS\nWe are providing our stockholders the opportunity to vote to approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation of our\nNEOs as disclosed in this proxy statement in accordance with the SEC’s rules. This proposal, which is commonly referred\nto as “say-on-pay,” is required by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, which\nadded Section 14A to the Exchange Act.\nWe encourage our stockholders to closely read the “Executive Compensation” section of this proxy statement,\nwhich describes in detail our executive compensation programs and the decisions made by our Compensation Committee\nand our Board with respect to the year ended December 31, 2023.\nAs we describe in detail in the “Compensation Discussion and Analysis” section of this proxy statement, we\nmaintain straightforward executive compensation programs that consist almost entirely of base salary, an annual cash\nincentive bonus and annual equity awards. These elements of compensation have been selected by our Compensation\nCommittee because the committee believes that they effectively achieve the fundamental goals of our compensation\nprogram, which are to attract, motivate and retain qualified and talented executives who are critical to our success,\nmotivating them to achieve our business goals and rewarding them for superior short- and long-term performance. One of\nthe goals of our Compensation Committee is to ensure that our compensation programs are aligned with the interests of\nour stockholders and our business goals in order to attain our ultimate objective of increasing stockholder value. We\nbelieve that, consistent with these goals, the total compensation paid to each of our NEOs is fair, reasonable and\ncompetitive. Further, we believe our programs do not encourage excessive risk-taking by management.\nWe do not provide any compensation or benefit plans to executive officers that are not also available to other\nemployees. We differentiate among executive officers primarily based on size of annual cash incentive awards and annual\nequity awards and, to a lesser extent, base salary.\nOur Board is asking stockholders to approve, on an advisory basis, the following resolution:\nRESOLVED, that the compensation paid to Karyopharm Therapeutics Inc.’s NEOs, as disclosed pursuant to the\ncompensation disclosure rules of the SEC, including the compensation tables and any related material disclosed in this\nproxy statement, is hereby approved.\nAs an advisory vote, this proposal is not binding. The outcome of this advisory vote does not overrule any decision\nby the Company or the Board (or any committee thereof), create or imply any change to the fiduciary duties of the\nCompany or the Board (or any committee thereof), or create or imply any additional fiduciary duties for the Company or\nthe Board (or any committee thereof). However, our Compensation Committee and Board value the opinions expressed by\nour stockholders in their vote on this proposal and will consider the outcome of the vote when making future\ncompensation decisions for NEOs.\nTHE BOARD UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS THAT STOCKHOLDERS VOTE “FOR” THE APPROVAL\nOF THE COMPENSATION OF OUR NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS.\n59\nEXECUTIVE COMPENSATION\nCompensation Discussion and Analysis\nThis Compensation Discussion and Analysis (“CD&A”) discusses the material elements of our executive\ncompensation policies and decisions and important factors relevant to an analysis of these policies and decisions. It\nprovides qualitative information regarding the manner and context in which compensation is awarded to and earned by\nour NEOs and is intended to place in perspective the information presented in the following tables and the corresponding\nnarrative. Our NEOs for the fiscal year ended on December 31, 2023 are:\nName Position\nRichard Paulson, M.B.A. President and Chief Executive Officer\nMichael Mason, M.B.A., C.P.A. Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer\nSohanya Cheng, M.B.A. Executive Vice President, Chief Commercial Officer\nStuart Poulton Executive Vice President, Chief Development Officer\nReshma Rangwala, M.D., Ph.D. Executive Vice President, Chief Medical Officer and Head of Research\nOverview and Business Highlights\nWe are a commercial-stage pharmaceutical company whose dedication to pioneering novel cancer therapies is\nfueled by a belief in the extraordinary strength and courage of patients with cancer. We discover, develop and\ncommercialize novel, life-changing cancer therapies in disease areas with high unmet need. Our primary focus is on\nmarketing XPOVIO in its currently approved indications as well as developing and seeking the regulatory approval of\nselinexor as an oral agent targeting multiple high unmet need cancer indications, including our core programs in\nendometrial cancer, multiple myeloma and myelofibrosis. We plan to continue to conduct clinical trials and to seek\nadditional approvals for the use of selinexor as a single agent or in combination with other oncology therapies to expand\nthe patient populations that are eligible for treatment with selinexor. In January 2024, we announced that further clinical\ndevelopment of our eltanexor program is on hold in an effort to focus our resources on our three prioritized late-stage\nprograms.\nDuring 2023, we achieved a number of important milestones and made significant progress on our commercial,\nclinical development, organizational, and business goals, which we believe positions us to further build on this momentum\nin 2024. Although we believe our focused execution of our key 2023 milestones, key aspects of which are described\nbelow, represents significant progress toward our longer-term strategic imperatives, our stock price performance continues\nto remain at historic lows. In the last several years, our stock price has experienced significant volatility, due to a number\nof potential factors, many of which were outside the control of our company and employees, including a challenging\nfinancial market impacted by macro-economic factors, worsening of investor sentiment leading to pressures in stock\nprices, particularly in the pharmaceutical and biotech industries, and a significantly increased competitive environment in\nthe multiple myeloma market.\nSome of the key highlights which factored into our performance assessment for purposes of determining 2023\ncompensation for our NEOs include:\nCommercial Achievements\n• Achieved U.S. net product revenue of $112.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 despite a number\nof headwinds in 2023, which adversely impacted our revenues, including increased competition from new\nmultiple myeloma product entrants, increased utilization of our patient assistance program due to the\nunexpected closure of multiple myeloma foundations, and increased gross-to-net and other discounts.\n• Secured partnership revenue of $34.0 million in 2023, which was comprised of reimbursement of\ndevelopment-related expenses, milestone-related revenue, license-related revenue and royalty revenue.\n60\nClinical Achievements\n• Successful progress on our efforts to strategically focus our pipeline by prioritizing cancers with high unmet\nneed and a high probability of success based on the potential to provide meaningful clinical benefit to\npatients, potential regulatory approval, and supportive scientific data, including advancement of site activation\nand study enrollment in our three ongoing pivotal Phase 3 trials.\n• Initiated pivotal Phase 3 portion of our clinical trial to assess the efficacy and safety of selinexor in\ncombination with ruxolitinib in JAKi-naïve patients with myelofibrosis following efficacy and safety data\nupdates during 2023 from our Phase 1 trial evaluating selinexor in combination with ruxolitinib in patients\nwith treatment-naïve myelofibrosis, which continue to be highly supportive of further evaluation of selinexor\nin combination with ruxolitinib in patients with treatment-naïve myelofibrosis.\n• Presented updated long-term safety and efficacy data from a pre-specified exploratory subgroup analysis from\nthe Phase 3 SIENDO trial in patients with advanced or recurrent TP53 wild-type endometrial cancer, which\nshowed an encouraging signal in the improvement in progression-free survival and overall survival.\nFinancial Achievements\n• Further positioned our organization to focus on and invest in our ongoing pivotal Phase 3 trials and drive agile\nexecution of business priorities, through (i) optimizing our cost structure with an approximate 20% reduction\nof our workforce, including full-time employees and contractors; (ii) closing all legacy clinical programs; and\n(iii) focusing our resources on our prioritized late-stage clinical programs, including by placing our eltanexor\nprogram on hold.\n• We ended 2023 with cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and investments of $192.4 million.\n2023 Say-on-Pay Results and Compensation Developments\nOur Compensation Committee considers a number of factors when evaluating our executive compensation program,\nincluding the level of support on our non-binding advisory proposal for our stockholders on the compensation of our\nNEOs (the “say-on-pay proposal”). At our 2023 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, our say-on-pay proposal received\nsupport from approximately 78.2% of the votes cast by our stockholders. Our Compensation Committee appreciated that a\nsignificant majority of our stockholders supported our pay practices, but noted that support had declined from the prior\nyear. Accordingly, the Compensation Committee carefully considered these voting results and believes the following\ndevelopments and adjustments related to our 2023 executive compensation program will improve pay-for-performance\nalignment:\n• Meaningful reduction in pay for our President and Chief Executive Officer and other NEOs to manage\ndilution in the current environment. These reductions represent a 62% reduction for our President and Chief\nExecutive Officer and an average 52% reduction for our current NEOs, with the exception of Dr. Rangwala\nwho was not an NEO in 2022, compared to 2022 compensation levels.\n• The addition of PSU awards in 2023 to our long-term incentive compensation program to strengthen the\nalignment between the interests of our executive officers and our stockholders by tying a substantial portion\nof equity compensation to the achievement of challenging, long-term goals and increasing the percentage of\nat-risk compensation for each executive officer.\n• The amendment of our Annual Bonus Plan to include a maximum annual bonus payout of 200% of the\ntarget bonus amount.\n• No one-time equity awards or off-cycle salary adjustments, other than in connection with Ms. Cheng’s\nexpansion of responsibilities during the year, as discussed below.\n• No discretionary adjustment to the Company’s corporate goal achievement results for 2023.\nWe and our Compensation Committee will continue to consider the outcomes of our future say-on-pay proposals\nwhen making compensation decisions regarding our NEOs and determining compensation policies and practices.\n61\nExecutive Compensation Program Best Practices\nOur Compensation Committee believes that a strong foundation for our compensation program is necessary to\nexecute our executive compensation philosophy effectively. The following best practices serve as the foundation for our\nexecutive compensation program:\nWhat We Do\n√Pay-for-Performance Compensation Philosophy: A large part of our executive compensation is performance-based with\napproximately 59% of our NEOs’ and 73% of our President and Chief Executive Officer’s compensation tied to variable, “at-risk”\nperformance-based compensation.\n√Annual Evaluation of Compensation: Annually assess risk of compensation policies, practices and programs.\n√Emphasis on Long-term Incentive Compensation: Use a mix of short-term and long-term incentive compensation, with an\nemphasis on long-term incentive compensation.\n√Minimum Vesting Periods: Minimum vesting provisions of one year generally apply to equity awards for 95% of the shares\nreserved for issuance under our 2022 Plan.\n√Utilize Competitive Market Data: Our Compensation Committee compares compensation program design and levels against\ncompetitive market data (based on our compensation peer group).\n√Change in Control Double-trigger: Neither cash benefits, including severance payments, nor acceleration of time-based equity\nawards are automatically provided to our executive officers in the event of a change in control of the Company unless either the\nacquirer does not assume the equity awards or there is also a termination of service (or the executive officer resigns for good reason)\nwithin one year from the date a change in control of the Company occurs.\n√Independent Compensation Consultant: Our Compensation Committee engaged Compensia, an independent compensation\nconsultant, to assist and advise the Compensation Committee in its review and determination of executive and director\ncompensation.\n√Clawback Policy: Our executive officers, including our NEOs, are subject to a compensation recovery (clawback) policy, which\nwas revised in 2023 to comply with new Nasdaq listing standards issued pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, under which we can\nrecover certain incentive-based compensation if we are required to prepare an accounting restatement due to material noncompliance\nwith financial reporting requirements.\nWhat We Don’t Do\n×No excessive perks: We do not offer our executive officers substantially enhanced health or welfare benefits or perquisites when\ncompared to our employee population.\n×No guaranteed salary increases or bonuses: We do not provide our executive officers with guaranteed annual base salary increases\nor guaranteed bonuses.\n×No tax gross-ups: We do not provide any excise or income tax gross-ups on severance or other payments in the event of a change in\ncontrol of the Company.\n×No repricing: We will not re-price our stock options or issue them with below-market exercise prices without stockholder approval.\nFor example, we are seeking stockholder approval of a stock option exchange program for non-executive officer employees at the\nAnnual Meeting, which we believe will provide a more cost-effective retention and incentive tool to our employees rather than\nissuing incremental equity or paying additional cash compensation. If we do not receive stockholder approval, then the program will\nnot proceed.\n×No hedging or pledging: Our directors, officers or other employees are prohibited from engaging in short sales, and purchasing or\npledging our common stock on margin.\nCompensation Philosophy\nThe objective of our executive compensation program is to align management interests with the drivers of value\ncreation for our stockholders and support the achievement of our strategic goals and objectives. We are committed to our\ncompensation philosophy, which incorporates the following principles:\n• Pay for Performance. We seek to provide competitive compensation opportunities to attract, retain and\nmotivate executive talent.\n• Reward Performance. We promote the achievement of key strategic and financial performance measures by\nlinking short-term and long-term cash and equity incentives to the achievement of measurable corporate\nperformance goals.\n• Alignment with Stockholders’ Interests. Total compensation levels should include a component that reflects\nstockholder returns and the Company’s overall performance through the use of equity-based awards.\n62\n• External Competitiveness. We strive to ensure that our executives’ total compensation levels are competitive\nwith peer companies so that we can attract and retain high performing key executive talent.\n• Internal Parity. To the extent practicable, base salary levels and short-term and long-term incentive\ncompensation target levels for similarly-situated executives within the Company should be comparable to\navoid divisiveness and encourage teamwork, collaboration, and a cooperative working environment.\n• Simplicity and Flexibility. Our executive compensation program should be straightforward and easy to\nunderstand for both our employees and stockholders. The compensation program should also be sufficiently\nflexible to be able to adapt to rapid changes in the competitive environment for executives in the\nbiotechnology and pharmaceuticals sectors.\n• Avoidance of Excessive Perquisites. Although we will consider certain perquisites that are common and\nappropriate for similarly-situated executives of public companies, as a general matter, we intend to avoid the\npayment of excessive, unusual, or unnecessary perquisites to executives.\nIn 2023, approximately 73% of our President and Chief Executive Officer’s total direct compensation and\napproximately 59% of the average of our NEOs’ total direct compensation consisted of variable compensation, including\nannual performance-based cash incentives, RSU awards and PSU awards (equity valued based on the closing stock price\non the date of grant). In line with our compensation objectives, including linking executive pay with performance, annual\nperformance-based incentives and PSU awards are dependent on our performance, aligning our executives’ interests with\nthose of our shareholders for both short- and long-term objectives. In addition, RSU awards have a time-based vesting\ncomponent so that the total potential value realized from RSU awards are dependent on our long-term share price\nperformance.\n(1) Excludes the $200,000 sign-on bonus received in accordance with the terms of Mr. Paulson’s employment agreement.\nOur Compensation Committee is responsible for overseeing the total compensation of our senior management team,\nwhich is comprised of our executive officers and certain other senior managers. In this capacity, our Compensation\nCommittee designs, implements, reviews and approves all compensation for our executive officers, except that in the case\nof our President and Chief Executive Officer, the Board approves all compensation-related matters based on the review\nand recommendation of our Compensation Committee.\nWe develop our compensation programs after reviewing publicly available compensation data and subscription\nsurvey data for our compensation peer group, provided by our Compensation Committee’s compensation consultant,\nCompensia. For setting 2023 compensation, our Compensation Committee engaged Compensia to advise on executive\ncompensation matters including: executive compensation philosophy, overall compensation program design,\ncompensation peer group development and updates, and competitive data for executive officer and director compensation\nprograms.\nOur Compensation Committee assessed the independence of Compensia consistent with the applicable Nasdaq\nListing Rules and SEC rules and concluded that the engagement of Compensia did not raise any conflict of interest. We\n63\npaid the cost for Compensia’s services; however, our Compensation Committee retained the sole authority to direct,\nterminate, or engage Compensia’s services and Compensia reported directly to our Compensation Committee.\nDefining and Comparing Compensation to Competitive Market Data\nIn evaluating the target total direct compensation opportunities of our NEOs, our Compensation Committee, using\nmarket data provided by Compensia, established a compensation peer group comprised of 20 companies selected\nprimarily on the basis of the following criteria:\n• U.S. based publicly-traded companies;\n• Primary operations in the biotechnology and pharmaceuticals industry, with a preference for a focus on\noncology and small molecule products;\n• Commercial-stage;\n• Revenue less than $500 million; and\n• Market capitalization between $125 million and $1.25 billion.\nIn September 2022, with input from senior management and Compensia, the Compensation Committee discussed,\nreviewed and approved an updated peer group based on the above criteria. Accordingly, the Compensation Committee\nconducted its 2023 executive compensation review utilizing the following peer group:\n2023 Peer Group\nAerie Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Deciphera Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Mirum Pharmaceuticals, Inc.*\nAgenus Inc. Esperion Therapeutics, Inc. Ocular Therapeutix., Inc.*\nAlbireo Pharma, Inc.* G1 Therapeutics, Inc.* Paratek Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\nAVEO Pharmaceuticals, Inc.* Heron Therapeutics, Inc.* Puma Biotechnology, Inc.\nClovis Oncology, Inc. ImmunoGen, Inc.* Urogen Pharma Ltd\nCollegium Pharmaceutical, Inc. Intercept Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Vanda Pharmaceuticals Inc.\nCTI BioPharma Corp.* MacroGenics, Inc.\n* Represents a new company for our 2023 peer group. These eight new companies replaced the following eight\npeer companies that were previously included in our 2022 peer group: Adamas Pharmaceuticals, Antares Pharma, Inc.,\nEpizyme, Inc., Flexion Therapeutics and Radius Health, Inc., each of which were acquired prior to the selection of our\n2023 peer group; Kala Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Omeros Corporation, both of which are no longer commercial-stage\ncompanies given the sales of their commercial products; and Akebia Therapeutics, Inc., which market capitalization fell\noutside of our range as described above.\nWe believe that the compensation practices of our 2023 peer group provided us with appropriate compensation\nmarket comparisons for evaluating the 2023 compensation for our NEOs. We strive to ensure that the total compensation\nlevels for our executives are competitive with peer companies so that we can attract and retain high performing key\nexecutive talent. Notwithstanding the similarities of the 2023 compensation peer group to our Company, due to the nature\nof our business, we compete for executive talent with larger public companies across our industry that are more\nestablished than we are or that possess greater resources than we do, and with smaller private companies that may be able\nto offer greater equity compensation potential. Therefore, in evaluating the compensation of our executive officers, the\nCompensation Committee uses the companies in our compensation peer group primarily as reference points to understand\nmarket practices among our peers and then assesses each individual executive’s compensation taking into consideration a\nnumber of subjective measures, such as individual and Company performance levels, contributions to the execution of our\nshort-term goals and long-term strategy, uniqueness of skillsets, demonstration of executive leadership, demand for\nparticular talent and internal parity.\n64\nElements of Executive Compensation and Pay for Performance Alignment\nWe believe our executive compensation program is effectively designed to implement a pay for performance culture\nthat aligns with the interests of our stockholders and our compensation philosophy as well as serves to enable us to attract,\nretain and motivate a strong, capable leadership team, which is essential to the execution of our strategic objectives. The\nthree primary elements of our executive compensation program include:\nCompensation Element Purpose Features\nBase salary To attract, retain and reward talented executives Fixed component of compensation to provide\nneeded to drive our business. financial stability, based on responsibilities,\nexperience, internal equity, performance and\ncompetitive market data.\nAnnual performance-based cash To promote and reward the achievement of key Variable component of compensation tied to\nincentive compensation short-term objectives and align executive and the achievement of pre-established quantitative\nstockholder interests. and qualitative corporate performance goals.\nBeginning in 2023, actual bonus payments are\ncapped at 200% of the executive officer’s target\nbonus amount.\nLong-term equity incentive To encourage executives to deliver long-term Variable components of compensation in the\ncompensation Company performance, align executive and form of RSU and PSU awards, and prior to\nstockholder interests and promote retention. 2023, option awards. PSU awards were\nintroduced in 2023 to further tie executive\ncompensation to our longer-term strategic\nimperatives, which in turn should lead to\nstockholder value creation. RSUs and PSUs are\nsubject to multi-year vesting based on\ncontinued service with value realized based\nupon the performance of our common stock\nprice, or in the case of PSU awards, which vest,\nif at all, upon achievement of pre-established\nperformance goals, including major clinical\ndevelopment, regulatory, commercial and/or\ntotal stockholder return (“TSR”) milestones.\nIn addition, our executive compensation program includes health and welfare benefits and other employee benefits\nand severance and change in control payments and benefits.\nWe have not had any formal or informal policy or target for allocating compensation between long-term and short-\nterm compensation, between cash and non-cash compensation, or among the different forms of non-cash compensation.\nInstead, the Compensation Committee, after reviewing competitive market information and our cash and equity resources,\ndetermines subjectively what it believes to be the appropriate level and mix of the various compensation elements.\nBase Salaries\nWe provide annual base salaries to our NEOs to compensate them with a fair and competitive base level of\ncompensation for services rendered during the year. Base salaries for our NEOs typically are established through arm’s-\nlength negotiation at the time the executive is hired, taking into account responsibilities, experience, internal parity and\ncompetitive market data. On an annual basis, our Compensation Committee reviews and evaluates, with input from our\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer for executives other than himself, the need for adjustment of the base salaries of our\nNEOs. When making this evaluation, our Compensation Committee considers compensation peer group data, market\ncompetitiveness, expected future contribution, and changes and expected changes in the NEO’s responsibilities. Our\nCompensation Committee also considers promotions, the individual contributions made by, and performance of, the\nexecutive during the prior year, the executive’s performance over a period of years, overall labor market conditions, the\nrelative ease or difficulty of replacing the executive with a well-qualified person, our overall growth and development as a\ncompany, general salary trends in our industry and among our compensation peer group and where the executive’s base\nsalary falls in the salary range presented by that data. We do not provide for any formulaic base salary increases for our\nNEOs and none of our executive officers is currently party to an employment agreement that provides for automatic or\nscheduled increases in base salary.\n65\nAs discussed above, merit-based increases in base salary are based on a number of factors reviewed by our\nCompensation Committee, or the Board in the case of our President and Chief Executive Officer, including comparative\npeer group data and market competitiveness considerations. In January 2023, our Compensation Committee approved\nmerit-based increases in base salary for each of our NEOs, other than Mr. Paulson, whose increase in base salary was\napproved by our Board in February 2023. The base salaries of our NEOs as of December 31, 2022 and 2023 were as\nfollows:\nBase Salary as of Base Salary as of Percent Change\nDecember 31, December 31, From 2022 Base\nName 2022($) 2023($) Salary\nRichard Paulson 696,800 740,000 6.2%\nMichael Mason 472,000 500,320 6.0%\nSohanya Cheng 472,000 525,000 (1) 11.2%\nStuart Poulton 450,000 477,000 6.0%\nReshma Rangwala 515,000 545,900 6.0%\n(1) In January 2023, Ms. Cheng received a merit-based salary adjustment to her December 31, 2022 base salary from\n$472,000 to $500,320 and in June 2023, she received an additional adjustment to her base salary from $500,320 to\n$525,000 in order to reflect an increased role and additional responsibilities related to our business development\ninitiatives.\nAnnual Performance-Based Cash Incentive Compensation\nOur Compensation Committee establishes an appropriate mix of cash payments and equity incentive awards to meet\nour short-term and long-term compensation goals and objectives. Annual performance-based cash incentive awards are\npaid to our employees, including our executive officers, under the Karyopharm Annual Bonus Plan (the “Annual Bonus\nPlan”), which was established to attract, motivate, and retain employees by promoting and rewarding the achievement of\nkey short-term corporate goals and objectives and other corporate value-driving accomplishments as well as individual\nperformance and to align the interests of employees and stockholders. In August 2023, our Board approved an amendment\nto our Annual Bonus Plan to provide a cap for bonus payments not to exceed 200% of an executive officer’s target bonus\namount.\nOur corporate goals and objectives for our annual performance-based cash incentive awards are typically\nestablished early in the year and are designed to be challenging and align with our strategic goals, including advancing our\ndevelopment programs, commercialization activities and certain corporate and financial goals, which we believe will\ncreate value for stockholders based on the information then available. During the course of the year, additional value-\ncreating milestones may be achieved which merit recognition. While our Board does not adjust goals during the course of\na year, it retains flexibility to recognize value creating achievements not anticipated or reflected in the goals established at\nthe start of a year through our annual bonus program, although it did not exercise such flexibility during 2023. The target\namount for the annual bonus opportunity for our executive officers, other than our President and Chief Executive Officer,\nis determined by each executive officer’s position as described in our Annual Bonus Plan. Prior to the beginning of a\nfiscal year, the Compensation Committee determines the weighting allocation to be applied to bonuses to be paid to our\nexecutive officers, other than our President and Chief Executive Officer, in connection with that fiscal year period. For\n2023, 85% of the annual bonus payment to each executive officer (other than our President and Chief Executive Officer)\nwas based on the level of achievement of pre-established corporate goals and objectives, as described below, and 15% of\nthe annual bonus payment to each executive officer was based on the level of achievement of the executive officer’s\nindividual goals. Pursuant to the terms of the Annual Bonus Plan, the 2023 annual bonus payment to our President and\nChief Executive Officer was based 100% on the Company’s achievement of its pre-established corporate goals and\nobjectives. Following the end of a plan year, our Compensation Committee determines the Company’s overall actual\ncorporate performance for that plan year as a cumulative percentage of the Company’s corporate goals and objectives\nachieved and in combination with the score for each executive officer’s individual goals, as applicable. The Compensation\nCommittee or Board may determine partial or excess achievement as compared to the original goal weighting, subject to\nthe 200% maximum overall cap.\n66\nFor each of the 2023 corporate goals, our Compensation Committee set both “target” performance levels, reflecting\nachievement of the goal at 100% of target for the period, and “aggressive” performance levels, reflecting exceptional\nperformance at 125% of target. No “threshold” level goals were established in our 2023 corporate goals.\nIn making its determination regarding our actual performance against the 2023 annual performance-based cash\nincentive award goals and objectives, in January 2024, our Compensation Committee evaluated and determined a score\nfor the 2023 corporate goals and objectives and recommended to the Board, and the Board approved, a score of 95%\nbased on the following conclusions:\nRelative Achievement\n2023 Corporate Goals and Objectives Weighting Rating 2023 Company Performance Assessment\nFinancial Results:\nAchieve target goal of U.S. XPOVIO net product 25.0% 20.0% Achieved performance at\nrevenue of $136.0 million or aggressive goal of approximately 82% of target based on\ngreater than $140.0 million. recording $112.0 million U.S.\nXPOVIO net product revenue in 2023.\nAchieve target license and other revenue goal of 5.0% 5.0% Achieved target goal by receiving\n$30.0 million or aggressive goal of greater than $34.0 million in license and other\n$35.0 million. revenue in 2023.\nAchieve target year-end cash and investments goal 5.0% 5.0% Achieved target goal by ending 2023\nof greater than or equal to $175.0 million or with cash, cash equivalents, restricted\naggressive goal of greater than $200.0 million. cash and investments of approximately\n$192.4 million.\nAdherence to latest Board-approved expense 5.0% 5.0% Achieved target goal.\nforecast.\nAchieve target compliance training rate goal of 5.0% 5.0% Achieved target goal by ending 2023\ngreater than 95% or aggressive goal of 100%. with a greater than 95% compliance\ntraining rate.\nPipeline:\nProgress in our various clinical development 35.0% 30.0% Achieved performance at\nprograms, including endometrial cancer, multiple approximately 86% of target based on\nmyeloma, myelofibrosis, and myelodysplastic (i) the achievement of our aggressive\nneoplasms as measured by initiation of clinical goal related to our ongoing Phase 3\ntrials, specified patient enrollment and site myelofibrosis trial and (ii) partial\nactivation goals, and dose optimization, as performance related to goals\napplicable.* established for our ongoing Phase 3\ntrials in endometrial cancer and\nmultiple myeloma and for our\nmyelodysplastic neoplasms program.\nAdvancement of research and development on the 5.0% 6.25% Achieved aggressive goal of advancing\neffectiveness of selinexor pre- and post-T-cell research and development, including\nredirecting therapies to enable a flexible position preclinical data and real-world\nfor selinexor in the treatment paradigm as a novel evidence on the role of selinexor in the\nmechanism of action. immune environment, including\npublications and presentation of\nfindings at medical conferences during\n2023.\nDrive research and development efficiency by 5.0% 6.25% Achieved aggressive goal of closing\nclosing out legacy studies. out all legacy studies by the end of the\nsecond quarter of 2023.\nPeople:\nAchieve three key organizational objectives: 10.0% 12.5% Achieved aggressive goals of retention\n(i) Target goal of greater than 85% or aggressive of over 90% of top talent, a greater\ngoal of greater than 90% retention of top talent; than 10% year over year improvement\n(ii) Target goal of 5% or aggressive goal of greater in our workplace experience score and\nthan 10% increase in employee engagement as less than 15% regrettable turnover in\nmeasured by improvement in year over year 2023.\nemployee survey score; and\n(iii) Target goal of less than 20% or aggressive\ngoal of less than 15% of regrettable turnover.\nApproved 2023 Corporate Performance Level 100.0% 95.0%\n67\n* These corporate performance goals include highly sensitive competitive data related to our clinical development\nprograms. We do not disclose the specific portions of these goals because we believe that such disclosure would result in\ncompetitive harm to us. We purposely set these goals at challenging levels. Revealing certain elements of these goals\ncould potentially reveal insights about our clinical plans or objectives that our competitors or potential collaborators could\nuse against us.\nWhen making a determination of individual performance levels, our Compensation Committee, with feedback\nprovided by our President and Chief Executive Officer, considered the level of achievement of each NEO’s individual\ngoals as well as his or her contributions to the execution of our short-term goals and long-term strategy, uniqueness of\nskillsets, demonstration of executive leadership, demand for particular talent as well as matters of internal parity. Our\nCompensation Committee determined that Mr. Mason achieved an individual performance score of 100%, and Ms.\nCheng, Mr. Poulton and Dr. Rangwala each achieved an individual performance score of 105% based on the following\n2023 accomplishments:\n• Mr. Mason’s accomplishments included contributions toward managing the Company’s overall finance,\naccounting, reporting, procurement, information technology, and investor relations functions, ensuring a\nstrong internal control environment, managing the relationship with the Company’s audit and tax advisors,\nand reducing operating expenses.\n• Ms. Cheng’s accomplishments included her strong leadership of our commercial function, including\noptimizing the sales force structure for greater focus and efficiency as well as strengthening our marketing\ncapabilities and physician engagement. Despite increased competition, demand in the community setting rose\nas compared to 2022 and the proportion of patients in earlier lines increased in 2023 as compared to 2022\nfrom 55% to 70%, extending the duration of therapy. She was also instrumental in the development of our\nlong-range plan and valuation of our clinical pipeline, including commercial launch planning for endometrial\ncancer, multiple myeloma and myelofibrosis. Beginning in mid-2023, Ms. Cheng assumed additional\nresponsibilities related to our business development initiatives, which resulted in, among other things, our\nentry into a clinical trial collaboration and supply agreement with Bristol-Myers Squibb Company.\n• Mr. Poulton’s accomplishments included transforming the development organization and reducing overall\ndepartmental headcount by approximately 30% while attracting new talent to the organization to enhance\ncapabilities and drive the efficient execution of our product portfolio. Among his other accomplishments were\ndriving efficiency in our overall product portfolio through the closure of historical signal seeking and legacy\nclinical studies, streamlining the team’s focus on the higher priority registrational programs and driving the\nsite activation and recruitment for these programs either directly for our endometrial cancer and myelofibrosis\nprograms, or in partnership with the European Myeloma Network, the sponsor for the multiple myeloma\nprogram.\n• Dr. Rangwala’s accomplishments included the substantial advancement, including trial design, FDA\nalignment, program initiation and patient enrollment, in our three ongoing pivotal Phase 3 clinical trials in\nendometrial cancer, multiple myeloma and myelofibrosis as well as the design and FDA alignment for a new\nPhase 2 monotherapy trial in myelofibrosis. She also made key contributions in managing multiple research\nprojects related to research and development of preclinical data and real-world evidence on the role of\nselinexor in the immune environment, including publications and presentations of findings at medical\nconferences during 2023. Further, Dr. Rangwala played a critical role in furthering our regulatory strategies as\nwell as in creating and developing relationships with internal and external stakeholders.\nOur Compensation Committee approved the 2023 performance-based cash incentive payments for Messrs. Mason,\nand Poulton, Ms. Cheng and Dr. Rangwala, and recommended to the Board, and the Board approved, the 2023\n68\nperformance-based cash incentive payment for Mr. Paulson, all of which were paid in February 2024, to each of the NEOs\nas follows:\n2023 2023\n2023 Target 2023 Target Company Individual\nBonus (as a Bonus Goal Goal 2023 Bonus Actual Bonus\n% of Base Amount Achievement Achievement Received (as a % of\nName Salary) ($) Score Score ($) Target)\nRichard Paulson 65% 481,000 95% N/A 456,950 95%\nMichael Mason 40% 200,128 95% 100% 191,623 95%\nSohanya Cheng 40% 210,000 95% 105% 202,650 97%\nStuart Poulton 40% 190,800 95% 105% 184,122 97%\nReshma Rangwala 40% 218,360 95% 105% 210,717 97%\nLong-Term Equity Incentive Compensation\nWe use our equity awards program to encourage our executives to deliver long-term Company performance, align\nexecutive and stockholder interests and promote retention. The market for qualified and talented executives in the\nbiopharmaceutical industry is highly competitive and we compete for talent with many companies that have greater\nresources than we do. Accordingly, we believe equity compensation is a crucial component of any competitive executive\ncompensation package we offer.\nEquity awards granted to our executive officers are approved by our Compensation Committee or the Board, with\nany equity awards granted to our President and Chief Executive Officer approved by the Board. Annual equity awards are\ngenerally granted at the beginning of each year and awards may vary among our executive officers based on their\npositions and annual performance assessments. In addition, our Compensation Committee reviews all elements of the\nexecutive’s compensation to ensure that his or her target total direct compensation opportunity is aligned with our overall\nphilosophy and objectives.\nBeginning in 2023, in an effort to improve the linkage between pay and performance and better align the interests of\nour executive officers and stockholders, our Compensation Committee introduced PSU awards as a component of the mix\nof equity awards granted to our NEOs and continued this practice for 2024. As such, approximately 50% of our President\nand Chief Executive Officer’s total target long-term equity incentive value was delivered as PSUs and 50% as RSUs. For\nour other NEOs, approximately 46% of the total target long-term equity incentive value was delivered as PSUs and 54%\nas RSUs.\nIn February 2023, the following RSU and PSU awards were granted to our NEOs:\nPSUs Granted\nRSUs Granted (at target)\nName (#) (#)\nRichard Paulson 252,000 252,000\nMichael Mason 95,000 80,000\nSohanya Cheng 100,000 85,000\nStuart Poulton 95,000 80,000\nReshma Rangwala 100,000 85,000\nTime-Based RSUs\nThe RSU awards granted in February 2023 vest in three equal annual installments beginning on the first anniversary\nof the grant date subject to each NEO’s continued service with the Company through each such vesting date. We believe\nRSU awards serve to align the interests of our NEOs with our stockholders given that the value of these awards ultimately\nrealized is directly tied to our stock price performance and that the time-based vesting feature of these awards promotes\nretention by incentivizing our NEOs to remain in our employment during the vesting period.\n69\nPerformance-Based RSUs (PSUs)\nThe PSU awards granted in February 2023 vest over a multi-year period upon the achievement of three equally\nweighted performance metrics related to strategic revenue, clinical development milestones, and relative TSR over a span\nof one to four years. No portion of the award is eligible to vest prior to the first anniversary of the grant date, and two-\nthirds of the award is subject to a three-year performance period. Thus, the PSUs are designed both to motivate executives\nto maximize progress against our clinical objectives, achieve sustained financial performance and to provide a long-term\nmotivation and retention incentive for the entire period covered by the award. Before any PSU is paid, the Compensation\nCommittee must certify that the performance target(s) have been satisfied. The Compensation Committee has discretion to\ndetermine the performance target(s) and any other restrictions or other limitations of PSUs and may reserve discretion to\nreduce payments below maximum award limits. The total number of PSUs that may vest will range from 0 to a maximum\nof 200% of the target number of PSUs granted and will be determined according to the Company’s level of achievement\nof the following metrics, with each objective weighted approximately 33%. We believe the following milestones are\naligned with key drivers of value creation for our stockholders:\n• Revenue Objective: The revenue objective is based on our total net revenue over a three-year period\nbeginning on January 1, 2023 and ending on December 31, 2025. Achievement of threshold, target and\nmaximum revenue levels will result in the vesting of 50%, 100% and 200%, respectively, of the target amount\nof shares allocated to the revenue objective (subject to linear interpolation between levels). We consider the\nmetrics for achievement of the revenue objective to be sensitive information and therefore the specific\nobjectives will not be disclosed until the end of the performance period due to the risk of competitive harm.\n• Clinical Milestones Objective: The clinical milestone objective is based on the achievement of the following\nthree clinical milestones over a four-year period beginning on the grant date and ending on the fourth\nanniversary of the grant date:\ni. First patient dosed in a pivotal clinical trial, excluding any trial that was initiated prior to the start of\nthe performance period;\nii. Complete enrollment in one pivotal clinical trial; and\niii. Acceptance of a New Drug Application or a supplemental New Drug Application filing by the U.S.\nFood & Drug Administration.\nThe achievement of one, two or three clinical milestones will result in the vesting of 50%, 100% or 200%,\nrespectively, of the target amount of shares allocated to the clinical milestone objective. None of the PSUs\nwith respect to the clinical milestone objective may vest prior to the first anniversary of the grant date.\n• Relative TSR Objective: The achievement of the relative TSR objective is based on our TSR relative to the\nTSR of the companies in the NASDAQ Biotechnology Index (“Relative TSR”) over a period beginning on\nthe grant date of the PSU award and ending on December 31, 2025. Achievement of threshold, target and\nmaximum levels based on the percentile ranking of our Relative TSR will result in the vesting of 50%, 100%\nand 200%, respectively, of the target amount of shares allocated to the Relative TSR objective (subject to\nlinear interpolation between levels). If our TSR percentile ranking for the performance period is less than the\nthreshold level of achievement, then the Relative TSR objective will not be achieved. As of December 31,\n2023, our TSR percentile ranking was below the threshold level.\nPotential achievements for the TSR objective are based on the following:\nTSR Percentile Ranking Level of Achievement\n25th Threshold\n50th Target\n75th Maximum\nIn determining the target level of achievement at the 50th TSR percentile ranking, the Compensation\nCommittee considered, among other things, the market norm in our industry and determined that the target\nlevel of achievement was a sufficiently rigorous target.\n70\nIn January 2024, our Compensation Committee certified that, based on the first patient dosed in our Phase 3\nmyelofibrosis clinical trial, the first clinical milestone under the 2023 PSU awards was achieved, which resulted in the\nvesting of 50% of the target amount of shares allocated to the clinical milestone objective; however, as the attainment of\nthis objective was prior to the one year anniversary of the grant date, the shares did not vest until February 28, 2024. The\nfollowing table sets forth the number of PSUs that vested for each NEO following the achievement of the first clinical\nmilestone under the 2023 PSU awards.\nPSU Shares Earned\nName (#)\nRichard Paulson 42,000\nMichael Mason 13,333\nSohanya Cheng 14,167\nStuart Poulton 13,333\nReshma Rangwala 14,167\nBenefits and Other Compensation\nHealth and Welfare Benefits\nOur NEOs are eligible to participate in all of our employee benefit plans, including our medical, dental, vision,\ngroup life and disability insurance plans, on the same terms as non-executive officer employees. We believe that these\nhealth and welfare benefits help ensure that we have a productive and focused workforce through reliable and competitive\nhealth and other benefits. Currently, we do not view perquisites or other personal benefits as a significant component of\nour executive compensation program.\nSection 401(k) Retirement Savings Plan\nWe maintain a Section 401(k) retirement savings plan (the “Section 401(k) Plan”) that is intended to be a tax-\nqualified defined contribution plan under the Code. In general, all of our U.S.-based employees aged 18 or older are\neligible to participate in the Section 401(k) Plan upon commencement of their employment.\nThe Section 401(k) Plan includes a salary deferral arrangement pursuant to which participants may elect to reduce\ntheir current compensation by up to the statutorily prescribed limit, equal to $22,500 in 2023 (an additional $7,500 in\ncontributions is allowed for participants aged 50 and over). We also match employee contributions to our Section 401(k)\nPlan, up to a maximum of 4% of an employee’s cash compensation during each pay period.\nSeverance and Change in Control Payments and Benefits\nUnder our employment arrangements with our NEOs, we have agreed to provide severance payments and other\nbenefits in the event of the termination of their employment under specified circumstances. We have provided more\ndetailed information about these payments and benefits, under the caption “Executive Compensation - Employment,\nSeverance and Change in Control Arrangements” below.\nWe believe providing severance and/or change in control payments and benefits as an element of our compensation\nstructure can help us compete for executive talent and attract and retain highly talented executive officers whose\ncontributions are critical to our long-term success. Further, we prefer to have certainty regarding the potential severance\namounts payable to our NEOs, rather than negotiating severance at the time that a NEO’s employment terminates. We\nbelieve that providing severance and change in control benefits will offer sufficient cash continuity protection such that\nour executives will focus their full time and attention on the requirements of the business rather than the potential\nimplications for their respective position in the event of a change in control. After consultation with Compensia, we\nbelieve that our severance and change in control payments and benefits are appropriate.\nWe do not offer defined benefit pension plans or non-qualified deferred compensation plans to our employees,\nincluding our executive officers.\n71\nTax and Accounting Considerations\nWhile our Compensation Committee generally considers the financial accounting and tax implications to us of its\nexecutive compensation decisions, neither element was a material consideration in the compensation awarded to our\nNEOs in 2023. We are generally entitled to a U.S. federal income tax deduction with respect to compensation income paid\nto our service providers, subject to limitation under Section 162(m) of the Code, with respect to compensation in excess of\n$1 million paid in any one year to each of certain of our current and former executive officers. Although the\nCompensation Committee will continue to consider tax implications as one factor in determining executive compensation,\nthe Compensation Committee also looks at other factors in making its decisions and retains the flexibility to provide\ncompensation for our NEOs in a manner consistent with the goals of our executive compensation program and the best\ninterests of the Company and its stockholders, which may include providing for compensation that is not deductible by the\nCompany due to the deduction limit under Section 162(m).\nHedging and Pledging Policy\nWe have an insider trading policy that is applicable to all of our employees and the non-employee members of the\nBoard. The policy prohibits those individuals and their related persons from engaging in any speculative transactions\ninvolving our common stock, including the following activities: short sales of our securities, including short sales “against\nthe box”; purchases or sales of puts, calls or other derivative securities based on our securities; standing orders with\nbrokers other than under an approved trading plan, purchases of financial instruments (including prepaid variable forward\ncontracts, equity swaps, collars and exchange funds) that are designed to hedge or offset any decrease in the market value\nof our securities; the purchase of our securities on margin; borrowing against our securities held in a margin account; or\npledging our securities as collateral for a loan. However, an exception may be granted where an employee or non-\nemployee director wishes to pledge our securities as collateral for a loan (other than a margin loan) and clearly\ndemonstrates the financial capacity to repay the loan without resort to the pledged securities. Any person who wishes to\npledge our securities as collateral for a loan must submit a request for approval to our principal financial officer. In\naddition, any such request by a director or executive officer must also be reviewed and approved by the Audit Committee.\nCompensation Recovery (“Clawback”) Policy\nIn August 2023, the Board adopted a new compensation recovery (clawback) policy, effective as of October 2,\n2023, which provides that, in the event we are required to prepare an accounting restatement due to our material non-\ncompliance with any financial reporting requirement under the U.S. federal securities laws as required by the Dodd-Frank\nAct and corresponding Nasdaq listing standards, we will attempt to recover any incentive-based compensation received by\nany current or former executive officer during the three completed fiscal years immediately preceding the date on which\nwe are required to prepare the restatement that is in excess of what otherwise would have been received by such executive\nofficer had the amount of incentive-based compensation been determined based on the restated amounts. We filed our\nrevised compensation recoupment policy as an exhibit to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended\nDecember 31, 2023, which was filed with the SEC on February 29, 2024.\nCompensation Committee Report\nOur Compensation Committee has reviewed the “Compensation Discussion and Analysis” section of this Proxy\nStatement required by Item 402(b) of Regulation S-K and discussed such section with management.

The\ngrant date fair value of PSUs is calculated based on the probable outcome of the performance measures as of the\ndate on which the PSUs were granted for accounting purposes. The grant date fair value for the TSR objective of the\nPSUs was calculated in accordance with ASC 718 using a Monte-Carlo simulation model since they are subject to a\nmarket condition. The clinical milestone and revenue objectives were not deemed probable on the grant date and\ntherefore no expense with respect to such objectives was recorded at that time. The following amounts represent the\naggregate grant date fair value of the PSU awards assuming achievement of maximum (200%) payout with respect\nto such PSU awards: Mr. Paulson - $1,454,880; Mr. Mason - $461,867; Ms. Cheng - $490,734; Mr. Poulton -\n$461,867; and Dr. Rangwala - $490,734. Assumptions used in the calculation of these amounts are set forth in Note\n9, Stock-based Compensation, included in our 2023 Annual Report.\n(2) Represents awards to our NEOs under our annual performance-based cash incentive program which were earned for\nperformance in 2023, 2022 and 2021, as applicable, and paid in February of the following year.

Dr. Rangwala was not a NEO prior to 2023, and therefore compensation information is not provided for\n2022 or 2021.\n(6) The reported amount of Mr. Poulton’s 2022 bonus payment has been amended to reflect a $15,399 payment made to\nMr. Poulton due to an administrative error in the original calculation of his 2022 bonus payment, which was\nidentified and corrected in June 2023.\n73\nGrants of Plan-Based Awards in 2023\nThe following table sets forth information regarding non-equity and equity awards granted to our NEOs during the\nyear ended December 31, 2023.

The values relating to the vesting of stock\noptions, RSU and PSU awards are based upon a per share fair market value of our common stock of $0.87, which was the\nclosing price of a share of our common stock as reported on the Nasdaq Global Select Market on December 29, 2023, the\nlast trading day in 2023.\n78\nSalary Conversion Health\nand Other Vesting of and and\nCash Stock Vesting of Vesting of Dental\nPayments Bonus Options RSUs PSUs Benefits Total\nName ($)(1) ($)(2) ($)(3) ($)(4) ($)(5) ($) ($)\nRichard Paulson\nTermination without cause or\nresignation for good reason other\nthan in the context of a change in\ncontrol 1,110,000 481,000 — — — 58,662 1,649,662\nTermination without cause or\nresignation for good reason within\n12 months following a change in\ncontrol 1,110,000 721,500 — 522,641 146,160 58,662 2,558,963\nMichael Mason\nTermination without cause or\nresignation for good reason other\nthan in the context of a change in\ncontrol 500,320 — — — — 37,752 538,072\nTermination without cause or\nresignation for good reason within\n12 months following a change in\ncontrol 500,320 200,128 — 172,309 46,400 37,752 956,909\nSohanya Cheng\nTermination without cause or\nresignation for good reason other\nthan in the context of a change in\ncontrol 525,000 — — — — — 525,000\nTermination without cause or\nresignation for good reason within\n12 months following a change in\ncontrol 525,000 210,000 — 154,860 49,300 — 939,160\nStuart Poulton\nTermination without cause or\nresignation for good reason other\nthan in the context of a change in\ncontrol 477,000 — — — — 39,108 516,108\nTermination without cause or\nresignation for good reason within\n12 months following a change in\ncontrol 477,000 190,800 — 128,325 46,400 39,108 881,633\nReshma Rangwala\nTermination without cause or\nresignation for good reason other\nthan in the context of a change in\ncontrol 545,900 — — — — 12,701 558,601\nTermination without cause or\nresignation for good reason within\n12 months following a change in\ncontrol 545,900 218,360 — 123,899 49,300 12,701 950,160\n(1) Amount represents the contractual amounts payable under the NEO’s employment agreement, as described above,\nassuming the NEO’s base salary in effect as of December 31, 2023.\n79\n(2) Amount represents the contractual amounts payable under the NEO’s employment agreement, as described above,\nassuming the NEO’s target bonus in effect as of December 31, 2023.\n(3) The amount shown in this column represents the difference, if any, between the exercise price of the accelerated\nunvested and outstanding options and the closing price assuming a $0.87 fair market value of a share of our\ncommon stock based on the reported closing price on the Nasdaq Global Select Market on December 29, 2023, the\nlast trading day in 2023. Any option with an exercise price of greater than $0.87 was assumed to be canceled for no\nconsideration and, therefore, had no intrinsic value.\n(4) The amount shown in this column was calculated by multiplying the NEO’s number of unvested RSU shares at\nDecember 31, 2023 scheduled to vest upon the specified event by $0.87, the fair market value of a share of our\ncommon stock on December 29, 2023.\n(5) The amount shown in this column was calculated by multiplying the NEO’s number of unvested PSU shares at\nDecember 31, 2023 scheduled to convert and vest upon the specified event by $0.87, the fair market value of a share\nof our common stock on December 29, 2023. For purposes of this table, we have assumed that the number of PSU\nshares that would convert and vest upon termination within 12 months of a change in control is the target amount\nfor the revenue and clinical milestone objectives. For the Relative TSR objective, we have assumed that no shares\nwould convert or vest upon the specified event based on the level of TSR achievement as of December 29, 2023.\nActual payments made at any future date will fluctuate based on various factors, including salary and bonus levels,\nthe vesting schedules of the various equity-based awards, and the price of our common stock at the time of termination or\nchange in control.\nCEO Pay Ratio\nWe are required by applicable SEC rules to disclose information about the relationship of the median of the annual\ntotal compensation of all our employees, excluding our President and Chief Executive Officer, and the annual total\ncompensation of Richard Paulson, our President and Chief Executive Officer.\nCEO Pay Ratio for 2023\n• The median of the annual total compensation of all our employees, excluding our President and Chief\nExecutive Officer, was $234,684;\n• The annual total compensation of our President and Chief Executive Officer was $2,626,288; and\n• The ratio of the annual total compensation of our President and Chief Executive Officer to the median of the\nannual total compensation of all other employees was 11 to 1.\nThis ratio is a reasonable estimate calculated in a manner consistent with SEC rules.\nMethodology\nThe methodology used to identify the employee with compensation at the median of the annual total compensation\nof all our employees was based on the following:\n• For purposes of identifying our median employee, we considered the individuals, excluding our President and\nChief Executive Officer, who were employed by us on December 31, 2023 (the “Determination Date”),\nwhether employed on a full-time, part-time, or temporary basis. We did not include any contractors or other\nnon-employee workers in our employee population. As of December 31, 2023, our global employee\npopulation consisted of 319 employees.\n• As permitted by SEC rules in identifying our median employee, we used the de minimis exemption. Pursuant\nto this exemption, we excluded 12 employees in the following jurisdictions (number of employees excluded\nin parentheses): Germany (2), Italy (1), and Israel (9) which represent in the aggregate 3.7% of our global\nemployee population. Thus, as of the Determination Date, our employee population consisted of 306\nemployees, excluding our President and Chief Executive Officer, with 306 located in the U.S.\n80\n• To identify our median employee, we used a consistently applied compensation measure consisting of the\nactual base salary of our employees for the 12-month period from January 1, 2023 through December 31,\n2023, actual bonus payouts for 2023 (including the corporate bonus plan and commissions paid under our\nsales incentive plan) and the grant date fair value of the equity awards granted to our employees during that\nperiod. We annualized the base salaries for all permanent employees who did not work for the entire\nmeasurement period.\nWe selected the foregoing compensation elements because they represented our principal broad-based compensation\nelements. Payments not made in U.S. dollars were converted to U.S. dollars using the applicable currency exchange rate\nin effect as of December 31, 2023. We did not make any cost-of-living adjustments.\nCalculation\nUsing this approach, we selected the individual at the median of our employee population, who was a full-time\nemployee based in the United States. We then calculated the actual annual total compensation for this individual using the\nsame methodology we use for our NEOs to calculate their annual total compensation as set forth in the Summary\nCompensation Table.\nThe pay ratio above is a reasonable estimate calculated in a manner consistent with the SEC rules. The SEC rules\nallow companies to adopt a variety of methodologies, apply certain exclusions, and make reasonable estimates and\nassumptions that reflect their employee population and compensation practices, and the pay ratio reported by other\ncompanies may not be comparable to our pay ratio.\nPay Versus Performance\nThe following tables and related disclosures provide information about (i) the “total compensation” of our principal\nexecutive officer (“PEO”) and our other named executive officers (the “Other NEOs”) as presented in the Summary\nCompensation Table on page 73 (the “SCT Amounts”), (ii) the “compensation actually paid” to our PEO and our Other\nNEOs, as calculated pursuant to the SEC’s pay-versus-performance rules (the “CAP Amounts”), (iii) certain financial and\nother performance measures, and (iv) the relationship of the CAP Amounts to those financial performance measures.\nThis disclosure has been prepared in accordance with Item 402(v) of Regulation S-K under the Exchange Act and\ndoes not necessarily reflect value actually realized by the executives or how our Compensation Committee evaluates\ncompensation decisions in light of company or individual performance. For discussion of how our Compensation\nCommittee seeks to align pay with performance when making compensation decisions, please review the “Compensation\nDiscussion and Analysis” section of this proxy statement beginning on page 60.\n81\necnamrofreP\nsusreV\nyaP\n001$\ndexiF\nlaitinI\nfo eulaV\n:nO\ndesaB\ntnemtsevnI\negarevA\negarevA\nyrammuS\nnoitasnepmoC\nnoitasnepmoC\nynapmoC\ndiaP yllautcA\nlatoT\nelbaT\nyrammuS\ndetceleS\npuorG\nreeP\nOEP-noN\not\nOEP-noN\nrof\nnoitasnepmoC\nnoitasnepmoC\nyrammuS\n:erusaeM\nlatoT\nlatoT\ndemaN\ndemaN\nyllautcA\nnoitasnepmoC\nlatoT\nelbaT\nnoitasnepmoC\ntcudorP\nteN\nteN\nredloherahS\nredloherahS\nevitucexE\nevitucexE\not diaP\ndiaP\nyllautcA\ndnoceS\nrof latoT elbaT\neuneveR\n)ssoL(\nemocnI\nnruteR\nnruteR\nsreciffO\nsreciffO\nOEP\ndnoceS\nOEP\ntsriF\not\nOEP\nOEP tsriF\nrof\n)$(\n)$(\n)$()4(\n)$(\n)$()2(\n)$()1(\n)$()2(\n)$(\n)$()1(\n)$()1(\nraeY\n703,110,211\n)385,890,341(\n78.811\n15.4\n254,774\n804,761,1\n247,53\nA/N\n882,626,2\nA/N\n3202\n039,444,021\n)560,192,561(\n56.311\n47.71\n)3(\n385,276,1\n)3( 142,498,2\n669,955,1\nA/N\n510,019,6\nA/N\n2202\n969,534,89\n)679,780,421(\n54.621\n45.33\n)930,503(\n641,400,2\n147,204,5\n)135,470,1(\n271,553,8\n985,960,3\n1202\n136,902,67\n)964,372,691(\n24.621\n57.08\n323,064,1\n058,869,2\nA/N\n710,397,1\nA/N\n930,739,3\n0202\nrehtO\nruo\ndna\n,)”OEP\ndnoceS“(\n1202\n,2\nyaM\nevitceffe\nreciffO\nevitucexE\nfeihC dna\ntnediserP\nruo\nsa detnioppa\nsaw\nohw\nnosluaP\n.rM\nsaw\nOEP ruo ,3202\nroF\n)1(\n.rM\n,gnehC\n.sM\n,nosaM\n.rM\nerew\nsOEN\nrehtO\nruo\ndna\nnosluaP\n.rM saw OEP\nruo ,2202\nroF\n.alawgnaR\n.rD\ndna\n,notluoP\n.rM\n,gnehC\n.sM\n,nosaM\n.rM erew\nsOEN\nruo\n,1202\nroF\n.reciffO\ncifitneicS\nfeihC\ndna\ntnediserP\nremrof\nruo ,mahcahS\n.rD dna\n,reciffO\ntnempoleveD\nfeihC\nremrof\nruo\n,leknerF\n.rM\n,notluoP .rM\n,onaM\n,nosaM\n.rM\nerew\nsOEN\nrehtO\nruo\ndna\n,nosluaP\n.rM\ndna\n,)”OEP\ntsriF“( 1202\n,3 yaM litnu\nreciffO\nevitucexE\nfeihC\nruo\nsa\ndevres\nohw ,namffuaK\n.rD erew\nsOEP\n.rD\ndna\nnosaM\n.rM\nerew\nsOEN\nrehtO\nruo\ndna\nnamffuaK\n.rD\nsaw\nOEP ruo\n,0202\nroF .reciffO\nlacideM\nfeihC\nremrof\nruo\n,hahS\n.rD\ndna ,mahcahS\n.rD ,leknerF\n.rM\n.mahcahS\nTCS\nehT\n.stnuomA\nTCS\neht\nmorf\nstnuomA\nPAC\neht\netaluclac\not ,selur\nCES yb debircserp\nsi hcihw\nfo\nhcae\n,stnemtsujda\neht\nsebircsed\nelbat gniwollof\nehT\n)2(\nstnuoma\nera\nrehtar\ntub\n,3202\ngnirud\nsevitucexe\nruo\not\ndiap\nro yb denrae\nnoitasnepmoc\nfo\ntnuoma\nlautca\neht\ntcelfer\nton\nod\nstnuomA\nPAC eht dna stnuomA\n.detnarg\nerew\nyeht\nraey\neht\nni\ndetsev\nsdrawa oN\n.tcA\negnahcxE\neht\nrednu\nK-S\nnoitalugeR\nfo\n204\nmetI\nhtiw ecnadrocca\nni denimreted\n3202\ndrahciR(\nOEP\ndnoceS\n*sOEN\nrehtO\n)nosluaP\nstnemtsujdA\n804,761,1\n882,626,2\nTCS morf noitasnepmoC\nlatoT\nelbacilppa\ntoN\n:snalp\nnoisnep\nlairautca\ndna\ntifeneb denifed rof\nstnemtsujdA\nsdrawa\nnoitpo\ndna kcots rof\nstnemtsujdA\n)945,834(\n)002,102,1(\nraey\nlacsif\nderevoc\neht\nrof\nTCS\nni\ndedulcni\nsdrawa\nnoitpo\ndna\nsdrawa\nkcots\nrof eulav etagerggA\n:)tcartbuS(\neht\nta detsevnu\ndna\ngnidnatstuo\nerew\ntaht\nraey\nlacsif\nderevoc\neht\ngnirud\ndetnarg\nsdrawa\nfo dne raey ta eulav\nriaF\n:ddA\n185,941\n072,714\ndne raey\nlacsif\nderevoc\nsdrawa\nfo\neulav riaf\nni\n)raey\nlacsif roirp\neht\nfo\ndne\neht morf(\nraey\nlacsif\nderevoc\neht\nfo dne\neht\nfo sa egnahC :)tcartbuS(\nddA\n)599,613(\n)463,784,1(\ndne raey\nlacsif\nderevoc\neht ta\ndetsevnu\ndna\ngnidnatstuo\nerew taht\nraey lacsif roirp\nyna\nni\ndetnarg\nyna\nni\ndetnarg sdrawa\nfo eulav riaf\nni\n)raey\nlacsif\nroirp\neht\nfo\ndne eht\nmorf(\netad\ngnitsev\neht\nfo sa egnahC :)tcartbuS(\nddA\n)399,38(\n)252,913(\nraey\nlacsif\nderevoc\neht\ngnirud\ndeifsitas\nerew\nsnoitidnoc\ngnitsev\nhcihw rof raey\nlacsif\nroirp\n254,774\n247,53\n)detaluclac sa(\nstnuomA\nPA\nC\n82\n* Amounts presented are averages for the entire group of Other NEOs in 2023.\nValuation assumptions used to calculate fair values did not materially differ from those used to calculate fair values\nat the time of grant as reflected in the SCT Amounts for all NEOs.\n(3) The Average Summary Compensation for Non-PEO NEOs for 2022 was amended to increase Mr. Poulton’s 2022\nbonus payment, as reported in last year’s proxy statement, to reflect a $15,399 payment made to Mr. Poulton due to\nan administrative error in the original calculation of his 2022 bonus payment, which was identified and corrected in\nJune 2023.\n(4) Reflects cumulative total shareholder return of the Nasdaq Biotechnology Index (“NBI”).

Of these measures, we have identified Net Product Revenue as\nthe most important of our financial performance measures used to link CAP Amounts for our executives for 2023 to\nCompany performance.\n2023 Performance Measures\nNet Product Revenue\nLicense and Other Revenue\nYear-end Cash\nAdherence to Budget\nClinical Trial Execution\nRelationships Between Compensation Actually Paid to our NEOs and Performance Measures\nThe following charts show the relationships over the past three years of the CAP Amounts for our PEOs and Other\nNEOs as compared to our cumulative TSR, NBI TSR, Net Income and Net Product Revenue, as well as the relationship\nbetween our TSR and NBI (or Peer Group) TSR:\n83\n84\nSECURITIES AUTHORIZED FOR ISSUANCE UNDER EQUITY COMPENSATION PLANS\nThe following table contains information as of December 31, 2023 regarding shares of common stock that may be\nissued under our equity compensation plans.\nEquity Compensation Plan Information\nNumber of Securities\nRemaining Available\nfor Future Issuance\nNumber of Securities under Equity\nto be Issued upon Weighted- Average Compensation Plans\nExercise of Exercise Price of (Excluding Securities\nOutstanding Options, Outstanding Options, Reflected in Column\nPlan Category Warrants and Rights Warrants and Rights (a))\n(a) (b) (c)\nEquity compensation plans approved by security\nholders(1) 13,026,953 $ 11.09 10,224,180\nEquity compensation plans not approved by\nsecurity holders(2) 3,260,283 $ 9.77 874,498\nTotal 16,287,236 (3) $ 10.79 11,098,678\n(1) Includes 13,026,953 shares to be issued pursuant to outstanding awards under the 2022 Plan and 2013 Plan. As of\nDecember 31, 2023, there were 8,591,362 shares available for issuance under the 2022 Plan and 1,632,818 shares\navailable for issuance under the ESPP. The 2013 Plan has expired and no further awards may be granted under the\n2013 Plan.\n(2) Includes shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of outstanding stock options and the vesting of RSU\nawards granted pursuant to the Nasdaq inducement grant exception as a component of employment compensation\nfor employees under our 2022 Inducement Plan and outside of our equity compensation plans. The inducement\ngrants were approved by our Compensation Committee and were made as an inducement material to employees\nentering into employment with us in accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5635(c)(4).\n(3) Includes 8,620,810 shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of outstanding options and 7,666,426 shares\nof common stock issuable upon the vesting of RSUs and PSUs (assuming 100% payout of PSUs at maximum\nachievement level). The weighted average exercise price for the outstanding options was $10.79 and the weighted\naverage remaining contractual term was 5.3 years.\nIn February 2022, we adopted the 2022 Inducement Plan, pursuant to which we may grant stock options, restricted\nstock, restricted stock units and other stock-based awards to persons who (a) were not previously an employee or director\nor (b) are commencing employment with us following a bona fide period of non-employment, in either case, as an\ninducement material to such person’s entry into employment with us and in accordance with the requirements of Nasdaq\nListing Rule 5635(c)(4). Neither consultants nor advisors are eligible to participate in the plan. The number of shares of\ncommon stock that may be issued under the plan is 2,900,000. Such plan was not adopted by our stockholders and is\nadministered by our Board.\n85\nCERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED PERSON TRANSACTIONS\nSince January 1, 2023, we have engaged in the following transactions with our directors and executive officers and\nholders of more than 5% of our voting securities and affiliates of our directors, executive officers and such 5%\nstockholders. We believe that all of the transactions described below were made on terms no less favorable to us than\ncould have been obtained from unaffiliated third parties.\nRelated Person Transactions\nSeverance and Change in Control Agreements\nSee the “Executive Compensation - Employment, Severance and Change in Control Arrangements” section of this\nproxy statement for a further discussion of these arrangements.\nIndemnification of Directors\nOur certificate of incorporation limits the personal liability of directors for breach of fiduciary duty to the maximum\nextent permitted by the DGCL and provides that no director will have personal liability to us or to our stockholders for\nmonetary damages for any breach of fiduciary duty as a director. In addition, we have entered into indemnification\nagreements with each of our directors that that require us, among other things, to indemnify each director for certain\nexpenses, including attorneys’ fees, judgments, fines and settlement amounts incurred by him or her in any action or\nproceeding arising out of his or her service as one of our directors. See the “Corporate Governance - Limitation of\nLiability and Indemnification” section of this proxy statement for a further discussion of these arrangements.\nPolicies and Procedures for Related Person Transactions\nOur Board has adopted a Related Person Transaction Policy for the review of any transaction, arrangement or\nrelationship in which we are a participant, the amount involved exceeds $120,000, and one of our executive officers,\ndirectors, director nominees or 5% stockholders (or their immediate family members), each of whom we refer to as a\n“related person,” has a direct or indirect material interest.\nIf a related person proposes to enter into such a transaction, arrangement or relationship, which we refer to as a\n“related person transaction,” the related person must report the proposed related person transaction to our principal\nfinancial officer. The policy calls for the proposed related person transaction to be identified, reviewed and, if deemed\nappropriate, approved by the Audit Committee of our Board. Whenever practicable, the reporting, review, and approval\nwill occur prior to effectiveness or consummation of the related person transaction. If advance review and approval is not\npracticable, the Audit Committee will review, and, in its discretion, may ratify the related person transaction. The policy\nalso permits the chairman of the Audit Committee to review and, if deemed appropriate, approve proposed related person\ntransactions that arise between Audit Committee meetings, subject to ratification by the Audit Committee at its next\nmeeting. Any related person transactions that are ongoing in nature will be reviewed annually.\nA related person transaction reviewed under the policy will be considered approved or ratified if it is authorized by\nthe Audit Committee after full disclosure of the related person’s interest in the transaction. As appropriate for the\ncircumstances, the Audit Committee will review and consider:\n• the related person’s interest in the related person transaction, including the related person’s position(s) or\nrelationship(s) with, or ownership in, a firm, corporation or other entity that is a party to, or has an interest in,\nthe related person transaction;\n• the approximate dollar value involved in the related person transaction;\n• the approximate dollar value of the related person’s interest in the related person transaction without regard to\nthe amount of any profit or loss;\n• whether the related person transaction was undertaken in the ordinary course of our business;\n• whether the terms of the related person transaction are no less favorable to us than terms that could have been\nreached with an unrelated third party;\n86\n• the purpose of, and the potential benefits to us of, the transaction; and\n• any other information regarding the related person transaction or the related person in the context of the\nproposed related person transaction that would be material to investors in light of the circumstances of the\nparticular transaction.\nThe Audit Committee may approve or ratify the related person transaction only if the Audit Committee determines\nthat, under all of the circumstances, the transaction is in, or is not inconsistent with, our best interests. The Audit\nCommittee may impose any conditions on the related person transaction that it deems appropriate. In addition to the\ntransactions that are excluded by the instructions to the SEC’s related person transaction disclosure rule, our Board has\ndetermined that the following transactions do not create a material direct or indirect interest on behalf of related persons\nand, therefore, are not related person transactions for purposes of this policy:\n• interests arising solely from the related person’s position as an executive officer of another entity (whether or\nnot the person is also a director of such entity), that is a participant in the transaction, where (a) the related\nperson and all other related persons own in the aggregate less than a 10% equity interest in such entity, (b) the\nrelated person and his or her immediate family members are not involved in the negotiation of the terms of the\ntransaction and do not receive any special benefits as a result of the transaction, and (c) the amount involved\nin the transaction equals less than the greater of $200,000 or 5% of the annual consolidated gross revenues of\nthe company receiving payment under the transaction; and\n• a transaction that is specifically contemplated by provisions of our certificate of incorporation or bylaws.\nThe policy provides that transactions involving compensation of executive officers or directors shall be reviewed\nand approved by the Compensation Committee in the manner specified in its charter.\n87\nPROPOSAL 6:\nRATIFICATION OF THE APPOINTMENT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING\nFIRM\nThe Audit Committee has selected Ernst & Young LLP as the Company’s independent registered public accounting\nfirm for the year ending December 31, 2024, and the Board has directed that management submit the appointment of the\nCompany’s independent registered public accounting firm for ratification by the stockholders at the Annual Meeting.\nRepresentatives of Ernst & Young LLP are expected to attend the Annual Meeting online, will have an opportunity to\nmake a statement if they so desire, and be available to respond to appropriate questions.\nStockholder ratification of the appointment of Ernst & Young LLP as the Company’s independent registered public\naccounting firm is not required by Delaware law or the Company’s certificate of incorporation or bylaws. However, the\nBoard is submitting this appointment to the stockholders for ratification as a matter of good corporate practice. If the\nstockholders fail to ratify the appointment of Ernst & Young LLP, the Audit Committee will reconsider whether to\ncontinue to retain that firm for future service. Even if the appointment is ratified, the Audit Committee in its discretion\nmay direct the appointment of a different independent registered public accounting firm at any time during the year if the\nAudit Committee determines that such a change would be in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders.\nIndependent Registered Public Accountant Fees\nThe following table summarizes the fees billed for professional services by Ernst & Young LLP for the years ended\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2023 2022\nAudit Fees(1) $ 1,405,520 $ 1,370,095\nTax Fees(2) 198,939 78,444\nTotal $ 1,604,459 $ 1,448,539\n(1) Audit Fees consist of fees billed for professional services performed by Ernst & Young LLP for the audit of our\nannual consolidated financial statements, the review of interim consolidated financial statements, and related\nservices that are normally provided in connection with registration statements. Included in the 2023 Audit Fees are\nfees billed in connection with our at-the-market offerings.

Based solely on our\nreview of copies of reports filed pursuant to Section 16(a), or written representations from reporting persons, we believe\nthat during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, all executive officers, directors and greater than 10% stockholders\ntimely complied with all applicable filing requirements of Section 16(a).\nSTOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS\nProposals of stockholders intended to be presented at our annual meeting of stockholders to be held in 2025 must be\nreceived by us no later than December 20, 2024, which is 120 calendar days prior to the one-year anniversary of the date\non which our proxy statement was released to stockholders in connection with this year’s Annual Meeting, in order to be\nincluded in our proxy statement and form of proxy relating to the 2025 annual meeting of stockholders, unless the date of\nthe 2025 annual meeting of stockholders is changed by more than 30 days from the anniversary of our 2024 Annual\nMeeting, in which case the deadline for such proposals will be a reasonable time before we begin to print and send our\nproxy materials. These proposals must comply with the requirements as to form and substance established by the SEC for\nsuch proposals in order to be included in the proxy statement.\nIn addition, our bylaws establish an advance notice procedure for nominations for election to our Board and other\nmatters that stockholders wish to present for action at an annual meeting of stockholders other than those to be included in\nour proxy statement. In general, notice must be received at our principal executive offices not less than 90 calendar days\nbefore nor more than 120 calendar days before the one-year anniversary of the previous year’s annual meeting of\nstockholders. Therefore, to be presented at our 2025 annual meeting of stockholders, such a proposal must be received by\nus no earlier than January 29, 2025 and no later than February 28, 2025. However, if the date of the 2025 annual meeting\nof stockholders is more than 20 days earlier or more than 60 days later than such anniversary date, notice must be received\nno earlier than the close of business 120 calendar days prior to such annual meeting of stockholders and no later than the\nclose of business on the later of (a) 90 days prior to such annual meeting of stockholders and (b) 10 days following the\nday on which notice of the date of such annual meeting of stockholders was mailed or public announcement of the date of\nsuch annual meeting of stockholders was first made, whichever first occurs.

This practice,\nknown as “householding,” is designed to reduce duplicate mailings and save significant printing and postage costs as well\nas natural resources. Stockholders sharing an address who have been previously notified by their bank, brokerage firm or\nother intermediary and have consented to householding will receive only one copy of our proxy statement and annual\nreport. If you would like to opt out of this practice for future mailings and receive separate proxy statements and annual\nreports for each stockholder sharing the same address, please contact your bank, brokerage firm or other intermediary\nfrom whom you received such mailing. We will promptly deliver a separate copy of the proxy statement and/or annual\nreport to you if you contact us at the following address or telephone number: Karyopharm Therapeutics Inc., 85 Wells\nAvenue, Newton, Massachusetts 02459, Attention: Corporate Secretary, (617) 658-0600. We will promptly send\nadditional copies of the proxy statement or annual report upon receipt of such request. Stockholders sharing an address\nthat are receiving multiple copies of the proxy statement or annual report can request delivery of a single copy of the\nproxy statement or annual report by contacting their bank, brokerage firm or other intermediary or by contacting us at the\naddress or telephone number above.\nINCORPORATION BY REFERENCE\nWe hereby incorporate by reference the following items into this proxy statement: Items 7, 7A and 8 of Part II\n(pages 99 to 106 and 112 to 143) of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, filed\nwith the SEC on February 29, 2024. Representatives of our auditors for the current year and the most recently completed\nfiscal year, Ernst & Young LLP, will be present at the Annual Meeting to respond to appropriate questions and to make a\nstatement if they so desire.\nOTHER MATTERS\nWe do not know of any business that will be presented for consideration or action by the stockholders at the Annual\nMeeting other than that described in this proxy statement. If, however, any other business is properly brought before the\nmeeting, shares represented by proxies will be voted in accordance with the best judgment of the persons named in the\nproxies or their substitutes.\n93\nAPPENDIX A\nKARYOPHARM THERAPEUTICS INC.\n2022 EQUITY INCENTIVE PLAN\n1.

Subject to adjustment under Section 10, Awards may be made under the\nPlan (any or all of which Awards may be in the form of Incentive Stock Options, as defined in Section 5(b)) for up to a\nnumber of shares of common stock, $0.0001 par value per share, of the Company (the “Common Stock”), as is equal to the\nsum of:\n(A) 4,100,000 shares of Common Stock; and\n(B) such additional number of shares of Common Stock (up to 14,231,243) as is equal to the sum of (x)\nthe number of shares of Common Stock reserved for issuance under the Company’s 2013 Stock Incentive Plan (the “Existing\nPlan”) that remain available for grant under the Existing Plan immediately prior to the date that the Plan is approved by the\nCompany’s stockholders (the “Effective Date”) and (y) the number of shares of Common Stock subject to awards granted\nunder the Existing Plan that are outstanding as of the Effective Date and which awards expire, terminate or are otherwise\nsurrendered, cancelled, forfeited or repurchased by the Company at their original issuance price pursuant to a contractual\nrepurchase right (subject, however, in the case of Incentive Stock Options to any limitations under the Code).\nShares of Common Stock issued under the Plan may consist in whole or in part of authorized but unissued shares or treasury\nshares.\n(2) Share Counting. For purposes of counting the number of shares available for the grant of Awards under\nthe Plan under this Section 4(a):\n(A) all shares of Common Stock covered by SARs shall be counted against the number of shares available\nfor the grant of Awards under the Plan; provided, however, that (i) SARs that may be settled only in cash shall not be so\ncounted and (ii) if the Company grants an SAR in tandem with an Option for the same number of shares of Common Stock\nand provides that only one such Award may be exercised (a “Tandem SAR”), only the shares covered by the Option, and\nnot the shares covered by the Tandem SAR, shall be so counted, and the expiration of one in connection with the other’s\nexercise will not restore shares to the Plan;\n(B) to the extent that a Restricted Stock Units (“RSU”) may be settled only in cash, no shares shall be\ncounted against the shares available for the grant of Awards under the Plan;\n(C) if any Award (i) expires or is terminated, surrendered or cancelled without having been fully exercised\nor is forfeited in whole or in part (including as the result of shares of Common Stock subject to such Award being\nA-2\nrepurchased by the Company at the original issuance price pursuant to a contractual repurchase right) or (ii) results in any\nCommon Stock not being issued (including as a result of an SAR or an RSU that was settleable either in cash or in stock\nactually being settled in cash), the unused Common Stock covered by such Award shall again be available for the grant of\nAwards; provided, however, that (1) in the case of Incentive Stock Options, the foregoing shall be subject to any limitations\nunder the Code, (2) in the case of the exercise of an SAR, the number of shares counted against the shares available under\nthe Plan shall be the full number of shares subject to the SAR multiplied by the percentage of the SAR actually exercised,\nregardless of the number of shares actually used to settle such SAR upon exercise and (3) the shares covered by a Tandem\nSAR shall not again become available for grant upon the expiration or termination of such Tandem SAR;\n(D) shares of Common Stock delivered (either by actual delivery, attestation or net exercise) to the\nCompany by a Participant to (i) purchase shares of Common Stock upon the exercise of an Award or (ii) satisfy tax\nwithholding obligations with respect to Awards (including shares retained from the Award creating the tax obligation) shall\nnot be added back to the number of shares available for the future grant of Awards; and\n(E) shares of Common Stock repurchased by the Company on the open market using the proceeds from\nthe exercise of an Award shall not increase the number of shares available for future grant of Awards.\n(b) Limit on Awards to Non-Employee Directors. The maximum aggregate amount of cash and value of Awards\n(calculated based on grant date fair value for financial reporting purposes) granted in any calendar year to any individual\nnon-employee director shall not exceed $750,000 in the case of an incumbent director; provided, however, that such\nmaximum aggregate amount shall not exceed $1,000,000 in any calendar year for any individual non-employee director in\nsuch non-employee director’s initial year of election or appointment; and provided, further, however, that fees paid by the\nCompany on behalf of any non-employee director in connection with regulatory compliance and any amounts paid to a non-\nemployee director as reimbursement of an expense shall not count against the foregoing limit. The Board may make\nexceptions to this limit for individual non-employee directors in extraordinary circumstances, as the Board may determine\nin its discretion, provided that the non-employee director receiving such additional compensation may not participate in the\ndecision to award such compensation. For the avoidance of doubt, this limitation shall not apply to cash or Awards granted\nto a non-employee director in his or her capacity as an advisor or consultant to the Company.\n(c) Substitute Awards. In connection with a merger or consolidation of an entity with the Company or the\nacquisition by the Company of property or stock of an entity, the Board may grant Awards in substitution for any options\nor other stock or stock-based awards granted by such entity or an affiliate thereof. Substitute Awards may be granted on\nsuch terms as the Board deems appropriate in the circumstances, notwithstanding any limitations on Awards contained in\nthe Plan. Substitute Awards shall not count against the overall share limit set forth in Section 4(a)(1), except as may be\nrequired by reason of Section 422 and related provisions of the Code.\n5. Stock Options\n(a) General. The Board may grant options to purchase Common Stock (each, an “Option”) and determine the\nnumber of shares of Common Stock to be covered by each Option, the exercise price of each Option and the conditions and\nlimitations applicable to the exercise of each Option, including conditions relating to applicable federal or state securities\nlaws, as the Board considers necessary or advisable.\n(b) Incentive Stock Options. An Option that the Board intends to be an “incentive stock option” as defined in\nSection 422 of the Code (an “Incentive Stock Option”) shall only be granted to employees of Karyopharm Therapeutics\nInc., any of Karyopharm Therapeutics Inc.’s present or future parent or subsidiary corporations as defined in Sections 424(e)\nor (f) of the Code, and any other entities the employees of which are eligible to receive Incentive Stock Options under the\nCode, and shall be subject to and shall be construed consistently with the requirements of Section 422 of the Code. An\nOption that is not intended to be an Incentive Stock Option shall be designated a “Nonstatutory Stock Option.” The\nCompany shall have no liability to a Participant, or any other person, if an Option (or any part thereof) that is intended to\nbe an Incentive Stock Option is not an Incentive Stock Option or if the Company converts an Incentive Stock Option to a\nNonstatutory Stock Option.\n(c) Exercise Price. The Board shall establish the exercise price of each Option or the formula by which such exercise\nprice will be determined. The exercise price shall be specified in the applicable Option agreement. The exercise price shall\nbe not less than 100% of the Grant Date Fair Market Value (as defined below) of the Common Stock on the date the Option\nA-3\nis granted; provided that if the Board approves the grant of an Option with an exercise price to be determined on a future\ndate, the exercise price shall be not less than 100% of the Grant Date Fair Market Value on such future date. “Grant Date\nFair Market Value” of a share of Common Stock for purposes of the Plan will be determined as follows:\n(1) if the Common Stock trades on a national securities exchange, the closing sale price (for the primary trading\nsession) on the date of grant; or\n(2) if the Common Stock does not trade on any such exchange, the average of the closing bid and asked prices\non the date of grant as reported by an over-the-counter marketplace designated by the Board; or\n(3) if the Common Stock is not publicly traded, the Board will determine the Grant Date Fair Market Value\nfor purposes of the Plan using any measure of value it determines to be appropriate (including, as it considers appropriate,\nrelying on appraisals) in a manner consistent with the valuation principles under Code Section 409A of the Code or any\nsuccessor provision thereto, and the regulations thereunder (“Section 409A”), except as the Board may expressly determine\notherwise.\nFor any date that is not a trading day, the Grant Date Fair Market Value of a share of Common Stock for such date will be\ndetermined by using the closing sale price or average of the bid and asked prices, as appropriate, for the immediately\npreceding trading day and with the timing in the formulas above adjusted accordingly. The Board can substitute a particular\ntime of day or other measure of “closing sale price” or “bid and asked prices” if appropriate because of exchange or market\nprocedures or can, use weighted averages either on a daily basis or such longer period, in each case to the extent permitted\nby Section 409A.\nThe Board shall determine the Grant Date Fair Market Value for purposes of the Plan, and all Awards are conditioned on\nthe Participant’s agreement that the Board’s determination is conclusive and binding even though others might make a\ndifferent determination.\n(d) Duration of Options. Each Option shall be exercisable at such times and subject to such terms and conditions\nas the Board may specify in the applicable Option agreement; provided, however, that no Option will be granted with a term\nin excess of 10 years.\n(e) Exercise of Options.

provided, however, that if\nthe consideration received as a result of the Reorganization Event is not solely common stock of the acquiring or succeeding\ncorporation (or an affiliate thereof), the Company may, with the consent of the acquiring or succeeding corporation, provide\nfor the consideration to be received upon the exercise or settlement of the Award to consist solely of such number of shares\nof common stock of the acquiring or succeeding corporation (or an affiliate thereof) that the Board determined to be\nequivalent in value (as of the date of such determination or another date specified by the Board) to the per share consideration\nreceived by holders of outstanding shares of Common Stock as a result of the Reorganization Event.\n(D) The Board may impose a limitation on the ability of Participants holding Options and/or SARs to\nexercise their Awards for the minimum number of days prior to the closing of the Reorganization Event as is reasonably\nnecessary to facilitate the orderly closing of the Reorganization Event.

The Board shall determine the effect on an Award of the disability, death, termination\nor other cessation of employment or service, authorized leave of absence or other change in the employment or other service\nstatus of a Participant and the extent to which, and the period during which, the Participant, or the Participant’s legal\nrepresentative, conservator, guardian or Designated Beneficiary, may exercise rights, or receive any benefits, under an\nAward. “Designated Beneficiary” means (i) the beneficiary designated, in a manner determined by the Board, by a\nParticipant to receive amounts due or exercise rights of the Participant in the event of the Participant’s death or (ii) in the\nabsence of an effective designation by a Participant, the Participant’s estate.\n(d) Withholding. The Participant must satisfy all applicable federal, state, and local or other income and employment\ntax withholding obligations before the Company will deliver stock certificates or otherwise recognize ownership of\nCommon Stock under an Award. The Company may elect to satisfy the withholding obligations through additional\nwithholding on salary or wages. If the Company elects not to or cannot withhold from other compensation, the Participant\nmust pay the Company the full amount, if any, required for withholding or have a broker tender to the Company cash equal\nto the withholding obligations. Payment of withholding obligations is due before the Company will issue any shares on\nexercise, vesting or release from forfeiture of an Award or at the same time as payment of the exercise or purchase price,\nunless the Company determines otherwise. If provided for in an Award or approved by the Board, a Participant may satisfy\nthe tax obligations in whole or in part by delivery (either by actual delivery or attestation) of shares of Common Stock,\nincluding shares retained from the Award creating the tax obligation, valued at their fair market value (valued in the manner\ndetermined or approved by the Company); provided, however, except as otherwise provided by the Board, that the total tax\nwithholding where stock is being used to satisfy such tax obligations cannot exceed the Company’s minimum statutory\nwithholding obligations (based on minimum statutory withholding rates for federal and state tax purposes, including payroll\ntaxes, that are applicable to such supplemental taxable income), except that, to the extent that the Company is able to retain\nshares of Common Stock having a fair market value (determined or approved by the Company) that exceeds the statutory\nminimum applicable withholding tax without financial accounting implications or the Company is withholding in a\njurisdiction that does not have a statutory minimum withholding tax, the Company may retain such number of shares of\nCommon Stock (up to the number of shares having a fair market value equal to the maximum individual statutory rate of\ntax (determined or approved by, the Company)) as the Company shall determine to be necessary to satisfy the tax liability\nassociated with any Award. Shares used to satisfy tax withholding requirements cannot be subject to any repurchase,\nforfeiture, unfulfilled vesting or other similar requirements.\n(e) Amendment of Award. Except as otherwise provided in Section 5(g) or 6(e) with respect to repricings or Section\n12(d) with respect to amendments to the Plan, the Board may amend, modify or terminate any outstanding Award, including\nbut not limited to, substituting therefor another Award of the same or a different type, changing the date of exercise or\nrealization, and converting an Incentive Stock Option to a Nonstatutory Stock Option. The Participant’s consent to such\naction shall be required unless (i) the Board determines that the action, taking into account any related action, does not\nmaterially and adversely affect the Participant’s rights under the Plan or (ii) the change is permitted under Section 10.\n(f) Conditions on Delivery of Stock. The Company will not be obligated to deliver any shares of Common Stock\npursuant to the Plan or to remove restrictions from shares previously issued or delivered under the Plan until (i) all conditions\nof the Award have been met or removed to the satisfaction of the Company, (ii) in the opinion of the Company’s counsel,\nA-12\nall other legal matters in connection with the issuance and delivery of such shares have been satisfied, including any\napplicable securities laws and regulations and any applicable stock exchange or stock market rules and regulations, and (iii)\nthe Participant has executed and delivered to the Company such representations or agreements as the Company may consider\nappropriate to satisfy the requirements of any applicable laws, rules or regulations.\n(g) Limitations on Vesting. Subject to Section 11(h), no Award shall vest earlier than the first anniversary of its\ndate of grant, unless such Award is granted in lieu of salary, bonus or other compensation otherwise earned by or payable\nto the Participant. The foregoing sentence shall not apply to Awards granted, in the aggregate, for up to 5% of the maximum\nnumber of authorized shares set forth in Section 4(a).\n(h) Acceleration. The Board may at any time provide that any Award shall become immediately exercisable in\nwhole or in part, free from some or all restrictions or conditions or otherwise realizable in whole or in part, as the case may\nbe.\n12. Miscellaneous\n(a) No Right To Employment or Other Status. No person shall have any claim or right to be granted an Award by\nvirtue of the adoption of the Plan, and the grant of an Award shall not be construed as giving a Participant the right to\ncontinued employment or any other relationship with the Company. The Company expressly reserves the right at any time\nto dismiss or otherwise terminate its relationship with a Participant free from any liability or claim under the Plan, except\nas expressly provided in the applicable Award.\n(b) No Rights As Stockholder; Clawback. Subject to the provisions of the applicable Award, no Participant or\nDesignated Beneficiary shall have any rights as a stockholder with respect to any shares of Common Stock to be issued with\nrespect to an Award until becoming the record holder of such shares. In accepting an Award under the Plan, the Participant\nagrees to be bound by any clawback policy that the Company has in effect or may adopt in the future.\n(c) Effective Date and Term of Plan. The Plan shall become effective on the Effective Date. No Awards shall be\ngranted under the Plan after the expiration of 10 years from the Effective Date, but Awards previously granted may extend\nbeyond that date.\n(d) Amendment of Plan. The Board may amend, suspend or terminate the Plan or any portion thereof at any time\nprovided that (i) neither Section 5(g) nor Section 6(e) requiring stockholder approval of any Option or SAR repricing may\nbe amended without stockholder approval; (ii) no amendment that would require stockholder approval under the rules of\nthe national securities exchange on which the Company then maintains its primary listing will be effective unless and until\nthe Company’s stockholders approve such amendment; and (iii) if the national securities exchange on which the Company\nthen maintains its primary listing does not have rules regarding when stockholder approval of amendments to equity\ncompensation plans is required (or if the Company’s Common Stock is not then listed on any national securities exchange),\nthen no amendment to the Plan (A) materially increasing the number of shares authorized under the Plan (other than pursuant\nto Section 4(c) or 10), (B) expanding the types of Awards that may be granted under the Plan, or (C) materially expanding\nthe class of participants eligible to participate in the Plan shall be effective unless and until the Company’s stockholders\napprove such amendment. In addition, if at any time the approval of the Company’s stockholders is required as to any other\nmodification or amendment under Section 422 of the Code or any successor provision with respect to Incentive Stock\nOptions, the Board may not effect such modification or amendment without such approval. Unless otherwise specified in\nthe amendment, any amendment to the Plan adopted in accordance with this Section 12(d) shall apply to, and be binding on\nthe holders of, all Awards outstanding under the Plan at the time the amendment is adopted, provided the Board determines\nthat such amendment, taking into account any related action, does not materially and adversely affect the rights of\nParticipants under the Plan. No Award shall be made that is conditioned upon stockholder approval of any amendment to\nthe Plan unless the Award provides that (i) it will terminate or be forfeited if stockholder approval of such amendment is\nnot obtained within no more than 12 months from the date of grant and (2) it may not be exercised or settled (or otherwise\nresult in the issuance of Common Stock) prior to such stockholder approval.\n(e) Authorization of Sub-Plans (including for Grants to non-U.S. Employees). The Board may from time to time\nestablish one or more sub-plans under the Plan for purposes of satisfying applicable securities, tax or other laws of various\njurisdictions. The Board shall establish such sub-plans by adopting supplements to the Plan containing (i) such limitations\non the Board’s discretion under the Plan as the Board deems necessary or desirable or (ii) such additional terms and\nA-13\nconditions not otherwise inconsistent with the Plan as the Board shall deem necessary or desirable. All supplements adopted\nby the Board shall be deemed to be part of the Plan, but each supplement shall apply only to Participants within the affected\njurisdiction and the Company shall not be required to provide copies of any supplement to Participants in any jurisdiction\nwhich is not the subject of such supplement.\n(f) Compliance with Section 409A. If and to the extent (i) any portion of any payment, compensation or other\nbenefit provided to a Participant in connection with his or her employment termination constitutes “nonqualified deferred\ncompensation” within the meaning of Section 409A and (ii) the Participant is a specified employee as defined in Section\n409A(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Code, in each case as determined by the Company in accordance with its procedures, by which\ndeterminations the Participant (through accepting the Award) agrees that to be bound, such portion of the payment,\ncompensation or other benefit shall not be paid before the day that is six months plus one day after the date of “separation\nfrom service” (as determined under Section 409A) (the “New Payment Date”), except as Section 409A may then permit.\nThe aggregate of any payments that otherwise would have been paid to the Participant during the period between the date\nof separation from service and the New Payment Date shall be paid to the Participant in a lump sum on such New Payment\nDate, and any remaining payments will be paid on their original schedule.\nThe Company makes no representations or warranty and shall have no liability to the Participant or any other person\nif any provisions of or payments, compensation or other benefits under the Plan are determined to constitute nonqualified\ndeferred compensation subject to Section 409A but do not to satisfy the conditions of that section.\n(g) Limitations on Liability. Notwithstanding any other provisions of the Plan, no individual acting as a director,\nofficer, employee or agent of the Company will be liable to any Participant, former Participant, spouse, beneficiary, or any\nother person for any claim, loss, liability, or expense incurred in connection with the Plan, nor will such individual be\npersonally liable with respect to the Plan because of any contract or other instrument such individual executes in his or her\ncapacity as a director, officer, employee or agent of the Company. The Company will indemnify and hold harmless each\ndirector, officer, employee or agent of the Company to whom any duty or power relating to the administration or\ninterpretation of the Plan has been or will be delegated, against any cost or expense (including attorneys’ fees) or liability\n(including any sum paid in settlement of a claim with the Board’s approval) arising out of any act or omission to act\nconcerning the Plan unless arising out of such person’s own fraud or bad faith.\n(h) Governing Law.

(the “Company”) and certain of its subsidiaries with opportunities to\npurchase shares of the Company’s common stock, $0.0001 par value (the “Common Stock”), commencing at such time as\nthe Board of Directors of the Company (the “Board”) shall determine. Subject to adjustment under Section 15 hereof,\n4,008,923 shares of Common Stock have been approved for this purpose.\nThis Plan is intended to qualify as an “employee stock purchase plan” as defined in Section 423 of the Internal\nRevenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), and the regulations issued thereunder, and shall be interpreted\nconsistent therewith.\n1. Administration. The Plan will be administered by the Board or by a Committee appointed by the Board (the\n“Committee”). The Board or the Committee has authority to make rules and regulations for the administration of the Plan\nand its interpretation and decisions with regard thereto shall be final and conclusive.\n2. Eligibility. All employees of the Company and all employees of any subsidiary of the Company (as defined in\nSection 424(f) of the Code) designated by the Board or the Committee from time to time (a “Designated Subsidiary”), are\neligible to participate in any one or more of the offerings of Options (as defined in Section 9) to purchase Common Stock\nunder the Plan provided that:\na) they are customarily employed by the Company or a Designated Subsidiary for more than 20 hours a\nweek and for more than five months in a calendar year;\nb) they have been employed by the Company or a Designated Subsidiary for at least 30 days prior to\nenrolling in the Plan; and\nc) they are employees of the Company or a Designated Subsidiary on the first day of the applicable Plan\nPeriod (as defined below).\nNo employee may be granted an Option hereunder if such employee, immediately after the Option is granted, owns\n5% or more of the total combined voting power or value of the stock of the Company or any subsidiary. For purposes of\nthe preceding sentence, the attribution rules of Section 424(d) of the Code shall apply in determining the stock ownership\nof an employee, and all stock that the employee has a contractual right to purchase shall be treated as stock owned by the\nemployee.\nThe Company retains the discretion to determine which eligible employees may participate in an offering pursuant\nto and consistent with Treasury Regulation Sections 1.423-2(e) and (f).\n3. Offerings. The Company will make one or more offerings (“Offerings”) to employees to purchase stock\nunder this Plan. Offerings will begin at such time as the Board shall determine. Each Offering will consist of a six-month\nperiod (a “Plan Period”) during which payroll deductions will be made and held for the purchase of Common Stock at the\nend of the Plan Period. The Board or the Committee may, at its discretion, choose a different Plan Period of not more than\ntwelve (12) months for Offerings.\n4. Participation. An employee eligible on the first day of a Plan Period of any Offering may participate in\nsuch Offering by completing and forwarding either a written or electronic payroll deduction authorization form to the\nemployee’s appropriate payroll office at least 15 days prior to the commencement of the applicable Plan Period. The form\nB-1\nwill authorize a regular payroll deduction from the Compensation received by the employee during the Plan Period.\nUnless an employee files a new form or withdraws from the Plan, his or her deductions and purchases will continue at the\nsame rate for future Offerings under the Plan as long as the Plan remains in effect. The term “Compensation” means the\namount of money reportable on the employee’s Federal Income Tax Withholding Statement (or analogous non-U.S.\nstatement), excluding overtime, shift premium, incentive or bonus awards, allowances and reimbursements for expenses\nsuch as relocation allowances for travel expenses, income or gains associated with the grant or vesting of restricted stock\nor restricted stock units, income or gains on the exercise of Company stock options or stock appreciation rights, and\nsimilar items, whether or not shown or separately identified on the employee’s Federal Income Tax Withholding\nStatement (or analogous non-U.S. statement), but including, in the case of salespersons, sales commissions to the extent\ndetermined by the Board or the Committee.\n5. Deductions. The Company will maintain payroll deduction accounts for all participating employees. With\nrespect to any Offering made under this Plan, an employee may authorize a payroll deduction in any percentage amount\n(in whole percentages) up to a maximum of 15% of the Compensation he or she receives during the Plan Period or such\nshorter period during which deductions from payroll are made. The Board or the Committee may, at its discretion,\ndesignate a lower maximum contribution rate. The minimum payroll deduction is such percentage of Compensation as\nmay be established from time to time by the Board or the Committee.\n6. Deduction Changes. An employee may decrease or discontinue his or her payroll deduction once during\nany Plan Period, by filing either a written or electronic new payroll deduction authorization form. However, an employee\nmay not increase his or her payroll deduction during a Plan Period. If an employee elects to discontinue his or her payroll\ndeductions during a Plan Period, but does not elect to withdraw his or her funds pursuant to Section 8 hereof, funds\ndeducted prior to his or her election to discontinue will be applied to the purchase of Common Stock on the Exercise Date\n(as defined below).\n7. Interest. Interest will not be paid on any employee accounts, except to the extent that the Board or the\nCommittee, in its sole discretion, elects to credit employee accounts with interest at such rate as it may from time to time\ndetermine.\n8. Withdrawal of Funds. An employee may at any time prior to the close of business on the fifteenth business\nday prior to the end of a Plan Period and for any reason permanently draw out the balance accumulated in the employee’s\naccount and thereby withdraw from participation in an Offering. Partial withdrawals are not permitted. The employee may\nnot begin participation again during the remainder of the Plan Period during which the employee withdrew his or her\nbalance. The employee may participate in any subsequent Offering in accordance with terms and conditions established\nby the Board or the Committee.\n9. Purchase of Shares.\n(a) Number of Shares. On the first trading day of each Plan Period, the Company will grant to each\neligible employee who is then a participant in the Plan an option (an “Option”) to purchase on the last trading day of such\nPlan Period (the “Exercise Date”) at the applicable purchase price (the “Option Price”) up to that number of shares of\nCommon Stock determined by multiplying $2,083 by the number of full months in the Plan Period and dividing the result\nby the closing price (as determined below) on the first trading day of such Plan Period; provided, however, that no\nemployee may be granted an Option which permits his or her rights to purchase Common Stock under this Plan and any\nother employee stock purchase plan (as defined in Section 423(b) of the Code) of the Company and its subsidiaries, to\naccrue at a rate which exceeds $25,000 of the fair market value of such Common Stock (determined at the date such\nOption is granted) for each calendar year in which the Option is outstanding at any time; and, provided, further, however,\nthat the Committee may, in its discretion, set a fixed maximum number of shares of Common Stock that each eligible\nemployee may purchase per Plan Period which number may not be greater than the number of shares of Common Stock\ndetermined by using the formula in the first clause of this Section 9(a) and which number shall be subject to the second\nclause of this Section 9(a).\n(b) Option Price. The Board or the Committee shall determine the Option Price for each Plan Period,\nincluding whether such Option Price shall be determined based on the lesser of the closing price of the Common Stock on\n(i) the first trading day of the Plan Period or (ii) the Exercise Date, or shall be based solely on the closing price of the\nCommon Stock on the Exercise Date; provided, however, that such Option Price shall be at least 85% of the applicable\nB-2\nclosing price. In the absence of a determination by the Board or the Committee, the Option Price will be 85% of the lesser\nof the closing price of the Common Stock on (i) the first trading day of the Plan Period or (ii) the Exercise Date. The\nclosing price shall be (a) the closing price (for the primary trading session) on any national securities exchange on which\nthe Common Stock is listed or (b) the average of the closing bid and asked prices in the over-the-counter-market,\nwhichever is applicable, as published in The Wall Street Journal or another source selected by the Board or the\nCommittee.\n(c) Exercise of Option. Each employee who continues to be a participant in the Plan on the Exercise\nDate shall be deemed to have exercised his or her Option at the Option Price on such date and shall be deemed to have\npurchased from the Company the number of whole shares of Common Stock reserved for the purpose of the Plan that his\nor her accumulated payroll deductions on such date will pay for, but not in excess of the maximum numbers determined in\nthe manner set forth above.\n(d) Return of Unused Payroll Deductions. Any balance remaining in an employee’s payroll deduction\naccount at the end of a Plan Period will be automatically refunded to the employee.\n10. Issuance of Certificates. Certificates representing shares of Common Stock purchased under the Plan may\nbe issued only in the name of the employee, in the name of the employee and another person of legal age as joint tenants\nwith rights of survivorship, or (in the Company’s sole discretion) in the name of a brokerage firm, bank, or other nominee\nholder designated by the employee. The Company may, in its sole discretion and in compliance with applicable laws,\nauthorize the use of book entry registration of shares in lieu of issuing stock certificates.\n11. Rights on Retirement, Death or Termination of Employment. If a participating employee’s employment\nends before the last business day of a Plan Period, no payroll deduction shall be taken from any pay then due and owing to\nthe employee and the balance in the employee’s account shall be paid to the employee. In the event of the employee’s\ndeath before the last business day of a Plan Period, the Company shall, upon notification of such death, pay the balance of\nthe employee’s account (a) to the executor or administrator of the employee’s estate or (b) if no such executor or\nadministrator has been appointed to the knowledge of the Company, to such other person(s) as the Company may, in its\ndiscretion, designate. If, before the last business day of the Plan Period, the Designated Subsidiary by which an employee\nis employed ceases to be a subsidiary of the Company, or if the employee is transferred to a subsidiary of the Company\nthat is not a Designated Subsidiary, the employee shall be deemed to have terminated employment for the purposes of this\nPlan.\n12. Optionees Not Stockholders. Neither the granting of an Option to an employee nor the deductions from his\nor her pay shall make such employee a stockholder of the shares of Common Stock covered by an Option under this Plan\nuntil he or she has purchased and received such shares.\n13. Options Not Transferable. Options under this Plan are not transferable by a participating employee other\nthan by will or the laws of descent and distribution, and are exercisable during the employee’s lifetime only by the\nemployee.\n14 Application of Funds. All funds received or held by the Company under this Plan may be combined with\nother corporate funds and may be used for any corporate purpose.\n15. Adjustment for Changes in Common Stock and Certain Other Events.\n(a) Changes in Capitalization. In the event of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend,\nrecapitalization, combination of shares, reclassification of shares, spin-off or other similar change in capitalization or\nevent, or any dividend or distribution to holders of Common Stock other than an ordinary cash dividend, (i) the number\nand class of securities available under this Plan, (ii) the share limitations set forth in Section 9, and (iii) the Option Price\nshall be equitably adjusted to the extent determined by the Board or the Committee.\n(b) Reorganization Events.\n(1) Definition. A “Reorganization Event” shall mean: (a) any merger or consolidation of the\nCompany with or into another entity as a result of which all of the Common Stock of the Company is converted into or\nB-3\nexchanged for the right to receive cash, securities or other property or is cancelled, (b) any transfer or disposition of all of\nthe Common Stock of the Company for cash, securities or other property pursuant to a share exchange or other transaction\nor (c) any liquidation or dissolution of the Company.\n(2) Consequences of a Reorganization Event on Options. In connection with a Reorganization\nEvent, the Board or the Committee may take any one or more of the following actions as to outstanding Options on such\nterms as the Board or the Committee determines: (i) provide that Options shall be assumed, or substantially equivalent\nOptions shall be substituted, by the acquiring or succeeding corporation (or an affiliate thereof), (ii) upon written notice to\nemployees, provide that all outstanding Options will be terminated immediately prior to the consummation of such\nReorganization Event and that all such outstanding Options will become exercisable to the extent of accumulated payroll\ndeductions as of a date specified by the Board or the Committee in such notice, which date shall not be less than ten (10)\ndays preceding the effective date of the Reorganization Event, (iii) upon written notice to employees, provide that all\noutstanding Options will be cancelled as of a date prior to the effective date of the Reorganization Event and that all\naccumulated payroll deductions will be returned to participating employees on such date, (iv) in the event of a\nReorganization Event under the terms of which holders of Common Stock will receive upon consummation thereof a cash\npayment for each share surrendered in the Reorganization Event (the “Acquisition Price”), change the last day of the Plan\nPeriod to be the date of the consummation of the Reorganization Event and make or provide for a cash payment to each\nemployee equal to (A) (1) the Acquisition Price times (2) the number of shares of Common Stock that the employee’s\naccumulated payroll deductions as of immediately prior to the Reorganization Event could purchase at the Option Price,\nwhere the Acquisition Price is treated as the fair market value of the Common Stock on the last day of the applicable Plan\nPeriod for purposes of determining the Option Price under Section 9(b) hereof, and where the number of shares that could\nbe purchased is subject to the limitations set forth in Section 9(a), minus (B) the result of multiplying such number of\nshares by such Option Price, (v) provide that, in connection with a liquidation or dissolution of the Company, Options\nshall convert into the right to receive liquidation proceeds (net of the Option Price thereof) and (vi) any combination of the\nforegoing.\nFor purposes of clause (i) above, an Option shall be considered assumed if, following consummation\nof the Reorganization Event, the Option confers the right to purchase, for each share of Common Stock subject to the\nOption immediately prior to the consummation of the Reorganization Event, the consideration (whether cash, securities or\nother property) received as a result of the Reorganization Event by holders of Common Stock for each share of Common\nStock held immediately prior to the consummation of the Reorganization Event (and if holders were offered a choice of\nconsideration, the type of consideration chosen by the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Common Stock);\nprovided, however, that if the consideration received as a result of the Reorganization Event is not solely common stock\nof the acquiring or succeeding corporation (or an affiliate thereof), the Company may, with the consent of the acquiring or\nsucceeding corporation, provide for the consideration to be received upon the exercise of Options to consist solely of such\nnumber of shares of common stock of the acquiring or succeeding corporation (or an affiliate thereof) that the Board\ndetermines to be equivalent in value (as of the date of such determination or another date specified by the Board) to the\nper share consideration received by holders of outstanding shares of Common Stock as a result of the Reorganization\nEvent.\n16.

The Company may add one or more appendices to this Plan\ndescribing the operation of the Plan in those foreign jurisdictions in which employees are excluded from participation or\ngranted less favorable Options.\n24.
