Yoni joined monday.com in 2017 as Vice President of Global Sales and Marketing. Over the years, he expanded his responsibilities to encompass all go-to-market functions, including marketing, partner channels, and customer success, before being promoted to CRO in 2022. Yoni has been instrumental in establishing the company’s sales, customer success, and partner channels, which have become key drivers of our go-to-market strategy. During his tenure, Yoni was pivotal in the company’s growth, helping to increase ARR from $10 million to over $1 billion. \n\n“We are deeply grateful for the invaluable contributions Yoni has made during his time at monday.com,” said co-founders and co-CEOs, Roy Mann and Eran Zinman. “Yoni’s leadership and vision have significantly shaped our growth and success. While we are saddened to see him go, we wish him the very best in his future endeavors and look forward to building on the strong foundation that he has created.” \n\n“I am incredibly grateful for my time at monday.com and proud of what we have accomplished together,” said Osherov. “It has been my privilege to work alongside such a talented team and to contribute to our shared vision. As I embark on to the next chapter of my career, I am excited to see how monday.com continues to thrive and innovate. I look forward to staying connected and cheering for the organization’s ongoing success.” \n\nA global search is currently underway to identify Yoni’s successor. He will continue to serve as an advisor to the CEOs until a new CRO is appointed. \n\n** Financial Outlook: **\n\nFor the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024, monday.com currently expects: \n\n  * Total revenue of $260 million to $262 million, representing year-over-year growth of 28% to 29%. \n  * Non-GAAP operating income of $29 million to $31 million and operating margin of 11% to 12%. \n  * Free cash flow of $63 million to $66 million and free cash flow margin of 24% to 25%. \n\n\n\nFor the full year 2024, monday.com currently expects: \n\n  * Total revenue of $964 million to $966 million, representing year-over-year growth of approximately 32%. \n  * Non-GAAP operating income of $121 million to $123 million and operating margin of 12% to 13%. \n  * Free cash flow of $286 million to $289 million and free cash flow margin of approximately 30%. \n\n\n\n** Non-GAAP Financial Measures: **\n\nThis press release and the accompanying tables contain the following non-GAAP financial measures: non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP sales and marketing expenses, non-GAAP research and development expenses, non-GAAP general and administrative expenses, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP net income per share, free cash flow, and free cash flow margin. Certain of these non-GAAP financial measures exclude share-based compensation. \n\nmonday.com believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to management and investors regarding certain financial and business trends relating to monday.com’s financial condition and results of operations. monday.com management uses these non-GAAP measures to compare monday.com performance to that of prior periods, for trend analysis and for budgeting and planning purposes. monday.com believes that the use of these non-GAAP financial measures provides an additional tool for investors to use in evaluating ongoing operating results and trends and in comparing monday.com financial results to the results of other software companies, many of which present similar non-GAAP financial measures to investors. The non-GAAP financial information is presented for supplemental informational purposes only and should not be considered a substitute for financial information presented in accordance with GAAP and may be different from similarly titled non-GAAP measures used by other companies. \n\nManagement does not consider these non-GAAP measures in isolation or as an alternative to financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP. The principal limitation of these non-GAAP financial measures is that they exclude significant expenses and income that are required by GAAP to be recorded in monday.com financial statements. In addition, they are subject to inherent limitations as they reflect the exercise of judgment by management about which expenses and income are excluded or included in determining these non-GAAP financial measures. \n\nReconciliation tables of the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures to the non-GAAP financial measures used in this press release are included with the financial tables at the end of this release. monday.com urges investors to review these reconciliation tables and not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate the monday.com business. Management is not able to forecast GAAP operating income (loss) on a forward-looking basis without unreasonable efforts due to the high variability and difficulty in predicting share-based compensation expense, the amounts of which may be significant in future periods. Management is not able to forecast GAAP net cash provided by operating activities on a forward-looking basis without unreasonable efforts due to the high variability and difficulty in predicting property and equipment purchases and capitalized software costs, the amounts of which may be significant in future periods. \n\n** Definitions of Business Key Performance Indicators **\n\n_Net Dollar Retention Rate_\n\nWe calculate Net Dollar Retention Rate as of a period end by starting with the ARR from customers as of the 12 months prior to such period end (“Prior Period ARR”). We then calculate the ARR from these customers as of the current period end (“Current Period ARR”). The calculation of Current Period ARR includes any upsells, contraction and attrition. We then divide the total Current Period ARR by the total Prior Period ARR to arrive at the Net Dollar Retention Rate. For the trailing 12-month calculation, we take a weighted average of this calculation of our quarterly Net Dollar Retention Rate for the four quarters ending with the most recent quarter. \n\n_Annual Recurring Revenue (“ARR”)_\n\nIs defined to mean, as of the measurement date, the annualized value of our customer subscription plans assuming that any contract that expires during the next 12 months is renewed on its existing terms. \n\n** Forward-Looking Statements: **\n\nThis press release contains “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the “safe harbor” provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including but not limited to, statements regarding our financial outlook and market positioning.

Appendix\nAppendix\nSupplementary materials\nDefinitions\n(1) Annual recurring revenue (“ARR”) is defined to mean, as of a measurement date, the annualized value of our\ncustomer subscription plans assuming that any contract that expires during the next 12 months is renewed on\nits existing terms.\n(2) We calculate Net Dollar Retention Rate as of a period end by starting with the ARR from customers as of the\n12 months prior to such period end (“Prior Period ARR”). We then calculate the ARR from these customers as of\nthe current period end (“Current Period ARR”). The calculation of Current Period ARR includes any upsells,\ncontraction and attrition. We then divide the total Current Period ARR by the total Prior Period ARR to arrive at\nthe net dollar retention rate. For the trailing 12-month calculation, we take a weighted average of this\ncalculation of our quarterly Net Dollar Retention Rate for the four quarters ending with the most recent quarter.\n(3) Free cash flow is defined as net cash provided by (used in) operating activities less cash used for\npurchases of property and equipment and capitalized software development costs.\n(4) Adjusted free cash flow is defined as net cash provided by (used in) operating activities less cash used for\npurchases of property and equipment and capitalized software development costs, plus non-recurring\nexpenditures, such as capital expenditures from the purchases of property and equipment associated with the\nbuild-out of our corporate headquarters.\nReconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures\nAdjusted free cash flow\n($ in millions) FY-20 FY-21 FY-22 FY-23\nNet cash provided by (used in) operating activities (37.2) 16.4 27.1 215.4\nPurchase of PP&E (4.4) (11.6) (16.0) (7.9)\nCapitalized software development costs (1.1) (2.2) (3.0) (2.6)\nPurchase of property and equipment related to build-\n2.0 7.3 -

We're fresh off another strong quarter in Q3, highlighted by improving retention\ntrends, strong financial performance and robust product development. This quarter also marked a significant milestone for monday.com as we\nsurpassed $1 billion in annual recurring revenue.\nReaching the $1 billion ARR milestone is not just a number, it's a pivotal moment in our company's journey, and we are ready to build on that\nmomentum. With a total addressable market of over $100 billion growing 14% annually across four markets: work management, CRM, service\nmanagement, and software development; there is a substantial opportunity ahead.\nTo drive our next stage growth, we remain committed to deepening and expanding our product offering and increasing our global presence. As\nthe landscape of work evolves, we are determined to stay ahead of the curve by continuously investing in technology, exploring new markets, and\nfostering a culture of agility. monday.com is not just keeping pace with the industry, we are shaping its future.\nBefore I turn it over to Eran, I'd like to cover a few changes in our management team. First, we are pleased to announce the appointment of Adi\nDar as Chief Operating Officer, with over 20 years of experience driving sustainable growth in global tech companies. Adi brings significant expertise\nto our executive team and has already made a strong impact since joining us a few months ago.\nOn a different note, we would like to share that our Chief Revenue Officer, Yoni Osherov, has informed us that he will depart the CRO role at the\nend of December. Since joining in 2017 as VP Global Sales and Marketing and becoming the CRO in 2022, Yoni has been instrumental in developing\nour sales and partner channels. During Yoni's tenure we have seen remarkable growth with ARR increasing from $10 million to over $1 billion. We\nare deeply grateful for his contribution and wish him all the best in his future endeavors. We are conducting a global search for Yoni's new successor,\nand he will continue to serve as an adviser until the CRO is appointed.\nLet me now turn it over to Eran to walk you through some of our product highlights for the quarter.\nEran Zinman - Monday.Com Ltd - Co-Founder & Co-Chief Executive Officer\nThank you, Roy.

We are excited to report initial strong adoption with a\nremarkable 150% increase in the use of AI blocks since Q2. Looking ahead, monday AI will be integrated throughout our entire product suite,\nenhancing functionality across the platform.\n3\nREFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us\n©2024 Refinitiv.

Upcoming features will include e-mail marketing functionality, enabling teams to manage their campaigns directly within\nmonday CRM.\nAdditionally, we're excited to demo our latest product, monday service at Elevate. Although still in beta, monday service has shown promising\ncross-sell potential, and it's on track for release by the end of 2024.\nAs we expand our product offerings and support our customers' growth, we are committed to building a robust platform for scalable work. With\nElevate, we announced the next iteration of mondayDB is now live. mondayDB 2.0 is all about scale and allows boards with up to 100,000 items\nand linked items and a dashboard with 0.5 million items.\nLastly, we are pleased to report that monday work management continues to gain significant traction with enterprise customers. In Q3, our second\nlargest customer, increased their seat count from 25,000 to 60,000 as part of their initiative to simplify and consolidate the technology stack. This\nrepresents a remarkable 24-fold increase in their seat count since 2022.\nWith that, I'll now turn it over to Eliran to cover our financial and guidance.\nEliran Glazer - Monday.Com Ltd - Chief Financial Officer\nThank you, Eran, and thank you to everyone for joining our call. Q3 was another strong quarter for monday.com, with solid revenue growth and\nprofitability and improving retention. We are pleased that fiscal year '24 is on target to be above our base case guidance outlined at our December\nInvestor Day.\nHaving surpassed $1 billion in ARR, we are now focused on leveraging our momentum to advance into the next stage of growth for the company.\nTotal revenue in Q3 '24 came in at $251 million, up 33% from the year-ago quarter. Overall, NDR increased to 111% in Q3 '24. We expect NDR to\nbe stable through the end of the year. As a reminder, our NDR is trailing four-quarter weighted average calculation.\nFor the reminder of the financial metrics disclosed, unless otherwise noted, I will be referencing non-GAAP financial measures. We have provided\na reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financials in our earnings release.\nThird-quarter gross margin was 90%. In the medium to long term, we continue to expect gross margin to remain in the high-80s range.\nResearch and development expense was $43 million in Q3 '24 or 17% of revenue, compared to 15% in Q3 '23. Sales and marketing expense was\n$130.3 million in Q3 '24 or 52% of revenue, compared to 54% in Q3 '23. General and administrative expense was $21.4 million in Q3 '24 or 9% of\nrevenue, compared to 8% in Q3 '23.\nNet income was $45 million in Q3 '24, up from $33 million in Q3 '23. Diluted net income per share was $0.85 in Q3 '24 based on 52.6 million fully\ndiluted shares outstanding.\nTotal employee head count was 2,305, an increase of 195 employees since Q2 '24. We expect to increase head count by mid-30% in fiscal year '24,\nwith continued focus on our R&D product and sales team as we build out our platform and product suite.\nMoving on to the balance sheet and cash flow. We ended the quarter with $1.34 billion in cash and cash equivalents, up from $1.29 billion at the\nend of Q4.\nFree cash flow for Q3 '24 was $82.4 million, and free cash flow margin as defined as free cash flow as a percentage of revenue was 33%. It should\nbe noted that free cash flow for the quarter was impacted by a onetime net cash incentive of approximately $11 million for our new London office\nrental agreement. Free cash flow is defined as net cash from operating activities less cash used for property and equipment and capitalized software\ncosts.\n4\nREFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us\n©2024 Refinitiv.

For the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024, we expect our revenue to be in the range of\n$260 million to $262 million, representing growth of 28% to 29% year over year.

We expect full year\nfree cash flow of $286 million to $289 million and free cash flow margin of approximately 30%.\nLet me now turn it over to the operator for your questions.\nQUESTIONS AND ANSWERS\nOperator\n(Operator Instructions) Gili Naftalovich, Goldman Sachs.\nGili Naftalovich - Goldman Sachs Group Inc - Analyst\nHey, team. It's Gili on for Kash. Congrats on reaching the $1 billion run rate mark. Two questions, if I may.\nAs we see your larger cohort supporting an inflection in NRR, we see a softening of your net new customer adds. Can you share how monday's\nengagement with customers is evolving, and whether you're seeing any changes in the broader demand or competitive environment?\nEran Zinman - Monday.Com Ltd - Co-Founder & Co-Chief Executive Officer\nYeah. Hi, Gili, it's Eran. First of all, as we mentioned, we see good retention results. Our NRR is improving and also our gross retention is at record\nlevel historically. So overall, we see better retention with small and larger customers.\nWe do see a little bit less customer adds, but that's part of our price increase and part of our strategy that we focus not just on SMBs, but also on\nlarge enterprises. So overall, if I take everything, we see demand to be steady, pretty similar to what we saw on previous quarters in terms of\nretention of customers and also in adding new customers.\nEliran Glazer - Monday.Com Ltd - Chief Financial Officer\nGili, this is Eliran. Maybe I will add one more thing, is that with the new product that we introduced, service, we see also with CRM and service, you\nsee cross sales in between our existing customers and new customers that continue to add additional potential momentum to our sales.\nGili Naftalovich - Goldman Sachs Group Inc - Analyst\nPerfect. Thanks. And when we think about your growth initiatives that you just mentioned as well as the hiring uptick that we saw in this quarter\nand what we're expecting in 4Q, how are you thinking about that expansion versus larger new land, especially in the backdrop of the second largest\ncustomer that you saw an expansion there?\n5\nREFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us\n©2024 Refinitiv.

So this is Eran again. So the fact that we hired more salespeople is basically because we see a lot of demand and a lot of opportunity within\nour own customer base. So it makes sense building towards growth for 2025. So we're pretty confident on that and our plans for 2025 as well.\nAnd again, like as we grow, more revenues coming from existing customers as they upgrade, buying more products and adding more seats. But\nour acquisition engine and bringing the customers remains a very strong part of the business. And we're investing a lot into that and growing that\nas well. So I would say that both in expanding existing customers and acquiring new customers, it's according to our original plan. And demand\nin the market looks very stable.\nOperator\nPinjalim Bora, JPMorgan.\nPinjalim Bora - JPMorgan Chase & Co - Analyst\nGreat. Thank you for taking the questions. It seems like you're seeing half of paying customers for service come from cross-sell. And I think the\nproduct is still in beta, right? So do you think service might have a much bigger cross-sell opportunity versus CRM and that you might actually\nrealize it faster than CRM?\nRoy Mann - Monday.Com Ltd - Co-Chief Executive Officer\nYeah, hi. It's Roy. So we do see a great opportunity to cross-sell with service. It is, like you mentioned, still in beta and very early stage. So like it's\nnot something we see as a significant part of our, let's say, revenue next year. But we do see it as a huge growth potential going forward. Too soon\nto tell how it will measure up compared to CRM.\nPinjalim Bora - JPMorgan Chase & Co - Analyst\nOkay. Understood. I wanted to ask you on net retention as well, just as a follow-up. It seems like you're seeing an uptick, but it seems like the uptick\nis largely in the large customer segments.\nMaybe talk about how much of that is due seat unlocks from mondayDB versus cross-sell? And maybe broadly, Eliran, has that metric turned the\ncorner as we look into the next several quarters?\nEliran Glazer - Monday.Com Ltd - Chief Financial Officer\nYeah. Hi, Pinjalim, it's Eliran. So again, we are pleased with our NDR. It increased to 111%, which is ahead of our expectations. And I think that we\nexpect it to be largely stable in Q4.\nTo your question if it's going to be a turning point going into next year, so we foresee opportunity for continued improvement in fiscal year 2025.\nThis is the result of the fact that we continue to go up market, potentially, the impact of the price increase around 100 to 200 basis points. And I\nwould say it's also broad-based across all customers with gross retention also getting to record high.\nPinjalim Bora - JPMorgan Chase & Co - Analyst\nUnderstood. Thank you very much.\n6\nREFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us\n©2024 Refinitiv. All rights reserved.

Good morning. I wanted to touch base on service again. What are the key kind of product milestones you're looking for that product\nto hit in order to GA? I know it's been a pretty successful beta. But what are the key last parameters that you'd like to see before that's released?\nAnd then one quick follow-up on guidance.\nEran Zinman - Monday.Com Ltd - Co-Founder & Co-Chief Executive Officer\nYeah. So, hi, Brent, this is Eran. So like Eliran mentioned, we're very excited about monday service. It feels like there's a huge opportunity there,\nespecially cross-selling that product to existing customers. Because of that and because we see them and also from our larger customers, we just\nwant to make sure that, one, the product is mature enough so that it can scale within our existing customers, not just the smaller ones but also the\nmidmarket enterprise customers.\nAnd then there's a bunch of features that we're planning to finalize before the official launch. One of them is the customer portal where people\ncan create tickets, and also some AI functionality that we added into the product. We feel that we're pretty close to launching the full release of\nthat product. And the feedback from customers is very good.\nSo overall, we're very excited. There seems to be strong demand in terms of go-to market, and also a great reception from customers who already\nuse the product.\nBrent Bracelin - Piper Sandler & Co - Analyst\nHelpful. And then, Eliran, the guidance here have been pretty consistent all year, 28% to 30% forward outlook here for four consecutive quarters\nnow. How would you frame just the demand going into kind of year-end here?\nEliran Glazer - Monday.Com Ltd - Chief Financial Officer\nSo demand development -- hey, Brent, it's Eliran. As Eran said, demand development has been very stable. It's broad-based. We still see strong\nmomentum coming from SMB and continue to move up market. I would expect it to be getting slightly better going into next year based on what\nwe heard from other companies. But there are still some signs of choppiness in some segments.\nSo I would say -- I don't want to tell you that there's going to be a dramatic change going into next year, but it's going to be a combination of we\nsee strong momentum on our business, but there is some choppiness in market.\nBrent Bracelin - Piper Sandler & Co - Analyst\nHelpful color. Thank you.\nOperator\nRyan MacWilliams, Barclays.\n7\nREFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us\n©2024 Refinitiv. All rights reserved.

Thanks for the question. Just a follow-up on Brent's question. As we think about our models for next year and building up to our estimates\nfor 2025, any early insight into the things to think about maybe as we continue all of the price increase into next year? Maybe should we look at\n4Q as a reasonable starting point? Just any bread crumbs we can use for our models for next year growth.\nEliran Glazer - Monday.Com Ltd - Chief Financial Officer\nHi. This is Eliran. so we will give our fiscal year '25 guidance as part of next year earnings call. But we remain optimistic that with monday service,\nwith the price increase that we did, with the cross-sell opportunities, with the fact that momentum continues to be good, we are going to see some\npotential upside also next year.\nRyan MacWilliams - Barclays Investment Bank - Analyst\nExcellent. And then you guys have seen really strong product development with the new product line releases. But any thoughts on M&A here?\nLike, would it make sense to maybe acquire some bolt-on AI capabilities? Just wanted to see if your thought process has changed around that at\nthis point.\nEran Zinman - Monday.Com Ltd - Co-Founder & Co-Chief Executive Officer\nYeah. Hi, Ryan, this is Eran. So yes, definitely, we have an M&A team. We're constantly monitoring the market and looking for opportunities. Once\nwe find the right one, we'll definitely try to explore that opportunity. But given the cash reserves that we have and the opportunity that we have\nas a company, we're definitely looking into that as well.\nOperator\nBrent Thill, Jefferies.\nBrent Thill - Jefferies Group LLC - Analyst\nThanks. With Yoni's leaving, can you just talk through the transition? And ultimately, in past sales transition, it takes some time to settle in. What\ngives you confidence maybe this isn't as big of a turbulence? Or perhaps it is, but give us a sense of how you're going to manage that?\nEran Zinman - Monday.Com Ltd - Co-Founder & Co-Chief Executive Officer\nYeah, Brent. So this is Eran. So basically, Yoni will stay in his role until the end of the year. And then he will remain in the company as an adviser\nuntil we find a replacement for CRO. We're pretty confident that we'll be able to find a new CRO of the company in the near future. We're looking\nfor candidates across the globe, and there's a lot of great talent out there.\nAnd we're doing an orderly transition plan. We've got everything covered and got great management as part of our leadership -- and leadership\nin our CRO organization. So we're pretty confident that things will remain stable, and we have ambitious plans for 2025.\n8\nREFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us\n©2024 Refinitiv. All rights reserved.

And then can you just give us a quick update on the CRM traction? What mile markers are you proud of? And what's kind of the next chapter\nas we head into next year that you're excited to cross with CRM? thanks.\nRoy Mann - Monday.Com Ltd - Co-Chief Executive Officer\nYeah, hi. It's Roy. So within CRM, we are always looking to like scale it up a notch in terms of the sizes of business we're approaching. Part of it is\nlike scaling the infrastructure like we announced to support large data sets, and also adding AI to many areas that really facilitate and make sales\nprocess much faster and robust. So we're super excited about CRM, it remains a very strong growth area for us, and keep investing in it.\nBrent Thill - Jefferies Group LLC - Analyst\nThanks.\nOperator\nJackson Ader, KeyBanc Capital Markets.\nJackson Ader - KeyBanc Capital Markets - Analyst\nGreat. Thanks for taking our questions. The first one is on the sales rep motion. Can we just kind of go over what that typical motion looks like? Are\nthey trying to sell into net new high-level purchasers? Is it rounding up kind of disparate teams that might be using monday across an organization\nand bringing them all together? And then I'm just curious like how this role might change with the leadership changes in that organization?\nEran Zinman - Monday.Com Ltd - Co-Founder & Co-Chief Executive Officer\nYeah. Jason, this is Eran. So very broadly, in general, the way our sales organization is built is that we have different teams that focus on different\ngo-to-market, meaning SMB, mid-market and enterprise customers.\nAnd then within each one of those segments, we have the AEs and AMs. AEs focus on acquiring and converting new businesses that sign up or\nhave interest in using platforms; and AMs, which is the most significant part of our sale organization, are focused on expanding the customers.\nWhat they usually do is either expand an existing use case or find new buyers within the organization to sell them additional use cases or additional\nproducts. We're planning to scale that.\nAs part of the CRM transition, I think this also presents an opportunity. We're also going up market and definitely opportunity to expand that\nmotion. We're going to bring more seasoned sales reps, and perhaps, leadership that have expertise in getting into the enterprise segment as well.\nSo all in all, this is how the team is built, and we're planning to scale that and invest more heavily into larger accounts.\nJackson Ader - KeyBanc Capital Markets - Analyst\nOkay. All right. Great. Understood. And then my second question is actually also on go-to-market, but it's more in down-market, that kind of the\nfunnel on the low end.\n9\nREFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us\n©2024 Refinitiv.

But I'm curious how that impacts the performance marketing spend. Thank you.\nRoy Mann - Monday.Com Ltd - Co-Chief Executive Officer\nHi. It's Roy. Our performance marketing, like always, is driven by results. And we did a test before the pricing and after. And obviously, what you\nsee is less pure number of customers, but higher quality ones that has more potential to scale upwards. And this is in line with the strategy we have\nin the sales team and like the whole company is geared towards like taking our sweet spot, if you like, higher.\nJackson Ader - KeyBanc Capital Markets - Analyst\nOkay, Roy. Thank you.\nOperator\nAlex Zukin, Wolfe Research.\nAleksandr Zukin - Wolfe Research LLC - Analyst\nHey, guys. Maybe just the very large customer expansion. Can you talk a bit about what they adopted? Was there a consolidation motion with\nrespect to that? And maybe just the pipeline for those types of deals as you kind of go into the end of the year? And then I have a quick follow-up.\nEran Zinman - Monday.Com Ltd - Co-Founder & Co-Chief Executive Officer\nYeah. Hi, Alex, this is Eran. So this company has grown a lot since 2023, over 24x increase. Just until recently they had 25,000 seats, and now we\nhave this additional upgrade.\nWhat basically happened is they got more departments using the product across the team. We now have departments from consulting, infrastructure,\nfinance, operations, and also the sales team. So all in all, it's become a very significant tool within the company.\nAnd also more room to grow. The physique is great. And if you add that to the other large customers that we announced in the previous quarter,\nwe see great traction in terms of not just landing larger accounts, but also extending them over time. So we see more and more of those deployments\nthat land within our platform.\nAleksandr Zukin - Wolfe Research LLC - Analyst\nPerfect. And then maybe just with the management changes, what does Adi bring to the table that you didn't have before? And maybe why was\nthat the right time after this addition? And as you think about Yoni's replacement, how important is kind of larger enterprise sales experience with\nrespect to that?\nEran Zinman - Monday.Com Ltd - Co-Founder & Co-Chief Executive Officer\nYeah. This is Eran. So first of all, we're very excited for Adi to join. I think it brings experience in two ways.\n10\nREFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us\n©2024 Refinitiv.

He had experience managing a very big organization with a lot of people, a lot of departments with\ncomplexity. And I think his expertise and knowledge can really help us scale the organization, not just in terms of management, but also in terms\nof processes, business processes, strategic processes that we have. So definitely, we already see great impact from that. That's definitely very helpful.\nAlso, we have a lot of technology expertise in different domains, but he really understands technology, understands the SaaS business, and he\nknows how to leverage and increase also sales org, and he brings a lot of expertise around those areas as well. So all in all, I think he will bring a lot\nto the table and will help us scale the company past this point.\nRoy Mann - Monday.Com Ltd - Co-Chief Executive Officer\nYeah. Hi. It's Roy. I can add that we -- Adi is someone we rely on a lot during this transition period and he helps us across the company.\nEliran Glazer - Monday.Com Ltd - Chief Financial Officer\nThere was a second part, this is Eliran, there was a second part of the question, I'll remind you, one about the CRO, how important it is to have\nexperience in going up market.\nEran Zinman - Monday.Com Ltd - Co-Founder & Co-Chief Executive Officer\nYeah. So definitely, in terms of the new CRO that we're looking for, we're looking for somebody that will help us go through this transition that\nwe're going through as a company. We're investing a lot into that. And as part of that, Yoni has been busy transitioning the sales team. And in this\nnew role, we also look to, as always, continue that momentum. We already made a lot of progress, great progress on that front. I'm sure that once\nwe find the right person to join the company, he or she will help us complete this transition.\nAleksandr Zukin - Wolfe Research LLC - Analyst\nPerfect.\nOperator\nArjun Bhatia, William Blair.\nArjun Bhatia - William Blair & Co LLC - Analyst\nHey, guys. I wanted to go back to monday CRM for a bit. I think you announced some pretty interesting new capabilities at Elevate. It sounds like\nthere's campaign management capabilities that are going to be now built in-house.\nCan you talk a little bit about what your long-term ambitions are for monday CRM? And could we, in the future, expect this to become a full-on\nkind of sales and marketing suite that lives inside monday? And if so, how do you think about kind of the build versus buy versus partner motion\nfor CRM in particular?\nRoy Mann - Monday.Com Ltd - Co-Chief Executive Officer\nHi. It's Roy. So CRM is essentially built on monday work OS, which gives us amazing capabilities in terms of flexibilities and the complexity it can\nmanage, and also the connectivity to the rest of the organization. So I think this is something that our customers really appreciate and want; the\nconnectivity across the organization, being able to build things connectively with other departments.\n11\nREFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us\n©2024 Refinitiv.

Understood. And then if I can just turn to the quarter for a second. Certainly, 32% growth is very strong. I think when I look at the sequential\ngrowth from Q2 to Q3, it looks a little bit lighter than we've seen historically. So can you just touch a little bit on what happened this quarter? What\ntrends you saw in the business and whether there's any timing elements from the move up market that we should consider as we're just thinking\nabout the financials this quarter and going forward?\nEliran Glazer - Monday.Com Ltd - Chief Financial Officer\nSure, Arjun. This is Eliran. First of all, we are pleased with Q3 performance. We are still a Rule of 50 company. We had an exceptional performance\nin Q2. It sets a high bar for Q3. And if you think about what we presented even in the Investor Day, we are going to be above our expectation in\nfiscal year '24.\nNevertheless, in Q3, we saw some continued choppiness in the macro, including pure enterprise customers, if you look at the total heads, which\nwas impacted in part by slower hiring in sales. As I said, we had a very strong Q2, an outlier, and a slower-than-expected growth in monday dev as\nwe pivot to focus on developers. So I would say all of the above created some light September, but we're seeing already strong momentum in\nOctober.\nArjun Bhatia - William Blair & Co LLC - Analyst\nOkay. Got it. That's helpful. Thank you, Eliran.\nOperator\nMichael Berg, Wells Fargo Securities.\nMichael Berg - Wells Fargo Securities LLC - Analyst\nHi. Thank you for taking the questions. Congrats on the quarter. I wanted to turn back to pricing real quick. There hasn't been much of an update\nin the last couple of quarters on contribution from pricing. Is there any incremental color there from the potential contribution in the quarter or\nfor the year or in the quarter, whether it be quantitative or directional?\nEran Zinman - Monday.Com Ltd - Co-Founder & Co-Chief Executive Officer\nYeah. So this is Eran. So just a quick update on pricing. The new pricing remains on target to be fully rolled out by July of 2025. So we're still kind\nof in the middle of the process.\nSo far, it's been rolled out to about 50% of our customers. We see about 30% impact -- $30 million, sorry, impact for fiscal 2024. And total impact\nfrom the price increase will be about $80 million between fiscal '24 and fiscal year '26. So those are kind of the updated figures.\nBut just to give you some more color, we are going really well with the price increase. Reception from customers is good. We don't see any kind of\nnegative feedback. So we continue to roll out the pricing as we planned.\n12\nREFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us\n©2024 Refinitiv. All rights reserved.

And then a quick follow-up on service. It looks like it's expected to be GA here in Q4. We had heard through the grapevine that there might\nhave been some delays. Anything to point to there? Any color versus potentially prior expectations around GA? Obviously, the feedback is incredibly\nstrong from the ecosystem as well as from Elevate. So anything to help point us in the right direction there would be helpful. Thanks.\nEran Zinman - Monday.Com Ltd - Co-Founder & Co-Chief Executive Officer\nYeah. So this is Eran. So there's no delay. Basically we planned to roll out at the end of the year, and this is largely when we release the full version.\nJust to remind you, it's already available for customers in beta, with great reception and feedback when they used the product.\nSo around the end of the year, beginning of next year, January, we'll announce the product to be GA, and then kind of open it up for our entire\ncustomer base. But the product is up and running and there's great feedback from customers, so it's pretty much on schedule.\nMichael Berg - Wells Fargo Securities LLC - Analyst\nThank you.\nOperator\nMike Funk, Bank of America.\nMichael Funk - Bank of America - Analyst\nYeah. Thank you for the questions. Just quick one, thinking about the revenue growth trajectory and the factors that go into that. We did see either\na flattening or a decline in the customer net additions across CRM and dev this quarter. You mentioned the price impact of $30 million for '24, a\nslight uptick from what you had before. And then not expecting a lot of contribution from service next year.\nSo maybe just help me think through those factors and how they're going to impact revenue growth, if I'm missing anything. And if maybe we are\nhitting a point when law of large numbers is catching up to us in terms of maintaining 30%-plus.\nEliran Glazer - Monday.Com Ltd - Chief Financial Officer\nHi, it's Eliran. So as we said in prior quarters, as part of the price increase, we said that we expect high single digits ahead of new customers compared\nto prior year. However, the ACV and the land is bigger. And this is something when we already finished the last year with 225,000 customers,\nobviously, in terms of percentage are going to be slightly lower than what you have seen in the past.\nWith regards to service, strong momentum, we expect it to continue to next year. This is in line with what we saw with CRM. Great adoption between\nour customers -- sorry, among our customers. So this is something that we think will contribute to next year.\nAnd price increase, as Eran mentioned, we continue to contribute by between 2024 and 2026 around $80 million. So nothing much has changed\nfrom what we have seen in the past other than what I mentioned earlier with regards to enterprise net adds in Q3, as well as some softness in dev.\n13\nREFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us\n©2024 Refinitiv.

And a large portion of our\nsales team is focused on increasing adoption within existing customers and also a product road map geared towards growth within existing\ncustomer, if that helps.\nMichael Funk - Bank of America - Analyst\nOkay. And just to confirm that my notes are correct, the $30 million impact for fiscal '24 from price, that was an increase from $25 million previously?\nEliran Glazer - Monday.Com Ltd - Chief Financial Officer\nYes, $25 million to $30 million, correct.\nMichael Funk - Bank of America - Analyst\nGreat. Okay, thank you all very much.\nOperator\nDerrick Wood, TD Cowen.\nDerrick Wood - TD Cowen - Analyst\nThanks, guys. So you've been pushing up market pretty aggressively in recent quarters. And I'm just wondering if this is having any impact to deal\ncycle time frames. I imagine, as you start doing more multi-thousand seat deals, there's more buyers involved and a longer sales cycle.\nSo just wondering if perhaps there's a little more seasonality coming into the model because of these bigger deals and perhaps a little less activity\nin Q3 and a little more of a flush of activity in Q4? Is that the right way to be thinking about it? And any comment of how you're seeing pipelines\nof large 1,000-seat-plus deals heading into Q4?\nEliran Glazer - Monday.Com Ltd - Chief Financial Officer\nYeah. Derrick, it's Eliran. So as I mentioned earlier, we came on a very strong -- we came on the back of a very strong Q2. And obviously, Q3, you\nhave July and August which are traditionally months of vacations in Europe and potentially in the US. But I don't want to kind of provide this as a\nseasonality kind of dramatic change that we have seen.\nAs I said, potentially with the fact that there is some still macro headwinds to a certain extent in some areas of the market, the macro is still choppy,\npotentially, this has contributed to some of the fact that we saw less enterprise customer adds. And as I mentioned also, the monday dev that was\nmore soft than we anticipated. But again, looking at October, we are seeing still momentum very positive. And I don't want to tell you that this was\na strong seasonality trend in Q3.\nDerrick Wood - TD Cowen - Analyst\nGot it. And then maybe just to touch on just the competitive landscape. I mean, I guess as you've pushed into new product areas, more up market,\nthere was some stats in the past on, like greenfield percentage of deals. Like has that changed much as your market positioning has evolved?\n14\nREFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us\n©2024 Refinitiv. All rights reserved.

It's Roy. So I think as we push towards larger deals, we see more competition on deals. If you look at the average, I'm not sure if it's changed or\nnot, but definitely within CRM, we are competing against other players. But while a lot of new adoption comes from greenfield still, but they are\ncomparing us to competitors.\nDerrick Wood - TD Cowen - Analyst\nYaah. That makes sense. Okay, thank you.\nOperator\nDJ Hynes, Canaccord.\nDJ Hynes - Canaccord Genuity Group Inc - Analyst\nHey, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Any updates on the partner ecosystem, especially as you go further upmarket, growth there, contribution\nof the business, your ability to monetize that activity? And any trends emerging that are worth calling out?\nEran Zinman - Monday.Com Ltd - Co-Founder & Co-Chief Executive Officer\nYeah. Hi, DJ, this is Eran. So no major update, but we continue to see great momentum with our partner ecosystem. What we see over time is more\nand more partners are also delivering services to our customers, not just helping them with the implementation, but also help them customize\nthe platform even more.\nWe're also starting to see more partners specialize in each one of our specific products, so more partners that focus on CRM, more partners that\nfocus on dev products. And I'm sure as we launch monday service, we're going to add more partners that have expertise in that.\nBut overall, we continue to see great momentum with the partner ecosystem. It remains a significant part of our revenue composition and in terms\nof helping larger customers onboard and use the platform.\nDJ Hynes - Canaccord Genuity Group Inc - Analyst\nGot it. And then maybe a follow-up on service. Just based on the beta usage you've seen to date, how much of the demand has been for internal\nticketing use cases versus customer-facing support? And do you see that kind of evolving over time with public availability here on the horizon?\nEran Zinman - Monday.Com Ltd - Co-Founder & Co-Chief Executive Officer\nYes. So maybe -- this is Eran. So maybe important to emphasize, we don't just see IT service. What we've seen currently from different use cases\nthat we have, we see, obviously, IT service, but we see a lot of ticketing around HR, around operations, all the way to finance, marketing teams and\ncustomer support, internal customer support ticketing.\nCurrently, we don't plan to position monday service as an outside-facing support platform, but mostly within the company. But given the current\nuse cases, it's very broad across the company, not just for IT, but across almost any department.\n15\nREFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us\n©2024 Refinitiv.

Thank you, guys. Appreciate the color.\nOperator\nSteve Enders, Citi.\nSteve Enders - Citigroup Inc - Analyst\nOkay. Great. Thanks for taking questions here. I guess I just want to ask on some of the choppiness that you're seeing and some of the impacts that\nyou saw this quarter. I guess, maybe, how is that being accounted for in the Q4 outlook? Is there maybe some incremental conservatism that's\nbeing baked in or accounted for here? Just can you also think about maybe some of the moving pieces that you're kind of incorporating in the\noutlook?\nEliran Glazer - Monday.Com Ltd - Chief Financial Officer\nYeah. Steve, hi, it's Eliran. So I think I spoke about this earlier, but I will repeat. I mean, no, we continue to see steady demand across our business\nsegments and its consistent growth rate. As we said, gross retention is at record levels. But there is some cautious spend environment with many\nof our customers. And in Q3, we saw some continued choppiness in the macro.\nSo again, we saw enterprise. Although it's the fastest-growing segment that we have, we saw fewer enterprise customer adds in Q3. As I said, it\nwas impacted in part by slower hiring in sales and on the back of a very strong Q2. So I don't want to tell you that we baked conservatism. As we\nalways said, when we provide guidance, we try to do it in a prudent way based on all the information that we know in the quarter. And we account\nfor all the things that we know today.\nIn addition, the company is growing and becoming more mature, and we wanted to make sure that we are providing the most accurate guidance\npossible while maintaining strong conviction in meeting our estimates.\nSteve Enders - Citigroup Inc - Analyst\nOkay. Perfect. That's helpful context there. And then, I guess just following up on that, I think you said the sales hires is maybe a little bit slower. I\nguess, I just want to clarify that comment. And I guess, secondly, just how are you guys thinking about future sales headcount growth and maybe\nhow that should kind of layer into the hiring plans going into next year?\nEliran Glazer - Monday.Com Ltd - Chief Financial Officer\nJust, Steven, the last part of the question about hiring? You broke up a little.\nSteve Enders - Citigroup Inc - Analyst\nYeah. Just how you're thinking about future sales headcount adds and I guess the case of that as we head into '25.\n16\nREFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us\n©2024 Refinitiv.

So Steve, this is Eliran, I will take it. So as we said, sales hiring was slower than what we anticipated, but we expect it to rebound in\nQ4. And we plan to ramp up hiring for sales quota carriers in Q4 and in fiscal year '25. The areas of investment will continue to be product R&D and\ngo-to-market.\nWorth mentioning that, if we look at the evolution of the business, with all the changes that we are doing in the CRO, so obviously, Eran mentioned\nearlier, we're going to hire people in the segment of account management, enterprise to continue to deepen within existing customer base. But\nmomentum will continue to be strong across hiring.\nSteve Enders - Citigroup Inc - Analyst\nOkay, perfect. Thanks for taking the questions.\nOperator\nScott Berg, Needham.\nScott Berg - Needham & Company LLC - Analyst\nHi, everyone. Thanks for taking me questions. First one I wanted to jump on was your R&D spend took kind of an abnormal increase quarter over\nquarter, especially relative to historical seasonality between Q2 and Q3. Can you help us maybe unpack and understand what's driving the big R&D\nincrease? Is there a specific product or something else in the strategy? Or is it just general hiring for R&D?\nEliran Glazer - Monday.Com Ltd - Chief Financial Officer\nYeah, hi, Scott. It's Eliran. So over the last few quarters, we continue to say that an area of investment for us is going to be R&D and product. Having\nin mind everything that we are doing, innovation is in the core of everything we do on monday, introducing new product, investing in existing\nproducts, mondayDB, AI capabilities, features and functionalities.\nAll of these things require talent, and this is something that we continue to do proactively. So we had strong overall hiring plans in Q3, and\nparticularly for product and R&D, and as well as operations. So all of that is contributing to the fact that R&D is becoming more significant quarter\nover quarter.\nScott Berg - Needham & Company LLC - Analyst\nHelpful, Eliran. And then as you think about your sales and marketing hiring, you've talked a couple of times how that was a little bit behind in the\nthird quarter. Do you catch up on the hiring there in the fourth quarter? Or is this going to be an item that persists into maybe early '25?\nEliran Glazer - Monday.Com Ltd - Chief Financial Officer\nYeah. So we expect it to rebound in Q4. Again, with all the changes that we are doing, obviously, we are looking at all the plans. And also, going\ninto fiscal year '25, we would like to make sure that we will ramp up hiring for sales quota carriers.\nScott Berg - Needham & Company LLC - Analyst\nGreat. Thanks for taking my questions.\n17\nREFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us\n©2024 Refinitiv. All rights reserved.

Can you maybe provide a little bit more\ncolor on how much of the upside came from outperformance on price in 3Q versus what you are expecting for 4Q? And just the reason why I ask\nis you've mentioned some of like the macro choppiness. Just curious if some of like the sales hiring or that macro choppiness was a bottleneck to\n3Q, and if there's any areas on that choppiness that you called in particular? Thanks.\nEliran Glazer - Monday.Com Ltd - Chief Financial Officer\nYeah. Taylor, it's Eliran. If you recall, when we did the price increase, it actually was launched at the end of February, early this year. And we said at\nthe time that we don't know what would be the impact, what would be -- because this is the first time we do it, what would be the churn of the\ncustomers in accordance with the price increase. Overall it became better than what we anticipated.\nFor most customers, it has been largely a nonevent. Gross retention has been improved. So I would say that the $5 million extra is the fact that the\nprofile of the customers and the momentum is better than what we anticipated. So this was a good surprise for us.\nTaylor McGinnis - UBS Group AG - Analyst\nPerfect. And then just as we think about the 1-point uptick in NRR, could you maybe like unpack that a little bit more? So was that largely due to\nprice? Or are you seeing cross-sell or seat expansions actually drive some of that upside? Is this more work management stable?\nAnd then, I know you're talking about expecting NRR to be stable and the outlook for 4Q. I think you made a comment earlier about seeing some\ngood momentum in October, so is that just really prudence? Or anything to keep in mind there from a seasonal perspective? Thanks.\nEliran Glazer - Monday.Com Ltd - Chief Financial Officer\nYeah. So I think it's all of the above. All of the above, meaning, pricing contributed around 100 to 200 basis points to the reported NDR in Q3. We\nexpect pricing, that will continue to positively contribute approximately 200 basis points for the reported NDR in fiscal year '24 as a whole. We said\nthat it's going to be stable in Q4, around 111%. There is potentially some upside in next year; too early to say, but so far we're seeing good momentum\ngoing also into October.\nOperator\nIttai Kidron, Oppenheimer.\nIttai Kidron - Oppenheimer & Co Inc - Analyst\nThanks. I made it. A couple of questions for me.\nFirst, on dev, it's been somewhat underwhelming since you've announced it. Can you talk about from either future or go-to-market standpoint,\nwhat needs to change in the product for you to get a better and more consistent contribution here?\n18\nREFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us\n©2024 Refinitiv.

Hi, Ittai, it's Eran. So first of all, we're happy with the progress with monday dev. It might not grow as fast as CRM, but the growth, we're very\npleased with it. With monday dev, we're very focused on software developers. So it might be just a part that takes a little bit longer to scale compared\nto CRM, which is kind of more of a broad use case.\nBut we're kind of now in the -- we finalized the kind of refocusing of our go-to-market. We're adding specific features that are more tailored towards\ndevelopers. It might be more slowdown in the net adds in the short term, but in the long term, we're pretty confident in the product. We see great\nfeedback about using the product, great use cases, and retention of the customers to do that.\nSo overall we're happy with the progress, and we continue to invest into that product.\nIttai Kidron - Oppenheimer & Co Inc - Analyst\nThat's great. And then for you, Roy, in your prepared remarks -- or I think it was Eran, I'm sorry, you talked about that AI blocks up quite significantly\nquarter over quarter. Can you talk about evolution here? How do we think about AI blocks?\nFirst of all, how would this change, let's say, a year from now? And what do you expect it to do to customer pattern in the context of expansion\nand moving up price tiers? How do you see this impacting that?\nEran Zinman - Monday.Com Ltd - Co-Founder & Co-Chief Executive Officer\nYeah. So yeah, the adoption -- we're very pleased with the adoption. Like I've mentioned, in terms of total AI actions, it grew for more than 250%\ncompared to Q2. And the AI blocks grew 150% from Q2.\nSo overall, we see more and more customers adopt those blocks. People incorporate them into their automation. They create a lot of processes\nwithin the product that involves AI within that. And over time, we are planning to roll out the monetization tied with AI, where we're going to\ngenerate clear and efficient value for our customers.\nSo definitely, we're very happy to see the progress with the AI features, the adoption of AI features, and over time, we're going to add the ability\nto monetize that as well.\nIttai Kidron - Oppenheimer & Co Inc - Analyst\nEran, is that a '25 time frame for monetization on AI?\nEran Zinman - Monday.Com Ltd - Co-Founder & Co-Chief Executive Officer\nYeah, we don't have a specific date, but it might be in 2025, but we can't commit to that.\nRoy Mann - Monday.Com Ltd - Co-Chief Executive Officer\nWe're not modeling for that in the plan for '25.\n19\nREFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us\n©2024 Refinitiv.
