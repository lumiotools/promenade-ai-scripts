(NASDAQ: WISA), which is in a definitive agreement to acquire AI, blockchain and Data Web 3.0 IP assets of Data Vault Holdings, Inc.® (“Data Vault”) to form a data technology & licensing company leveraging IP & proprietary HPC software, reported third quarter 2024 financial results in its Form 10-Q, which was filed on November 14, 2024. In its conference call and presentation today at 8:00 am PT / 11:00 am ET, WiSA CEO Brett Moyer will discuss the Company’s results and provide a general business update. \n\n“In Q3 2024, we delivered 240% sequential revenue growth, driven by both WiSA HT and our new WiSA E IP being in production with a multi-national licensee,” said Brett Moyer, CEO of WiSA Technologies. “With WiSA E TX intellectual property now shipping in media boxes with android OS and expected to be in stores for Christmas, we expect to further this momentum with additional design wins and production advancements in 2025. Further leveraging our WiSA E technology, we are expanding the addressable market by adapting this software for Linux implementations in 2025.” \n\n**WiSA Technologies Q3 2024 and Recent Operating Highlights**\n\n  * Hired Stanley Mbugua as Vice President of Finance, who will also assume the role of Chief Accounting Officer, effective November 30, 2024. \n  * Achieved WiSA E wireless milestone with immersive audio software embedded onto an Amlogic reference design, which became available for customer implementation and showcased the IBC show in Amsterdam. \n  * Executed licensing agreements with leading HDTV brands, covering 43% of the HDTV market that uses the Android operating system. \n\n\n\n**Q3 2024 and Subsequent Financial Highlights**\n\n  * Q3 2024 revenue was $1.2 million, up 52% from $0.8 million in Q3 2023. The increase in revenue was a result of an increase in Components sales of $0.7 million, partially offset by a decrease in Consumer Audio Product sales of $0.3 million. \n  * Q3 2024 gross margin as a percentage of sales was 19%, compared to negative 217% in Q3 2023. The improvement in gross margin compared to the prior period is mainly attributable to an increase of $0.4 million increase in revenue between comparison periods and due to the fact that Q3 2023 included a $1.4 million increase in inventory reserves whereas Q3 2024 had only a nominal increase in inventory reserves. \n  * Held $3.9 million cash at September 30, 2024. \n\n\n\n**WiSA Technologies Investor Conference Call**\n\nManagement will host its third quarter 2024 results conference call at 8:00 am PT / 11:00 am ET, on Friday, November 15, 2024. \n\nThe conference call will be available through a live webcast found here: [Webcast | Third Quarter 2024 Results](https://event.choruscall.com/mediaframe/webcast.html?webcastid=zL059EwY)\n\nThose without internet access or who wish to dial in may call: 1-833-366-1124 (domestic), or 1-412-317-0702 (international).

(NASDAQ: WISA), which is in a definitive agreement to acquire AI, blockchain and Data Web 3.0 IP assets of Data Vault Holdings, Inc.® (“Data Vault”) to form a data technology & licensing company leveraging IP & proprietary HPC software, reported third quarter 2024 financial results in its Form 10-Q, which was filed on November 14, 2024. In its conference call and presentation today at 8:00 am PT / 11:00 am ET, WiSA CEO Brett Moyer will discuss the Company’s results and provide a general business update. \n\n“In Q3 2024, we delivered 240% sequential revenue growth, driven by both WiSA HT and our new WiSA E IP being in production with a multi-national licensee,” said Brett Moyer, CEO of WiSA Technologies. “With WiSA E TX intellectual property now shipping in media boxes with android OS and expected to be in stores for Christmas, we expect to further this momentum with additional design wins and production advancements in 2025. Further leveraging our WiSA E technology, we are expanding the addressable market by adapting this software for Linux implementations in 2025.” \n\n**WiSA Technologies Q3 2024 and Recent Operating Highlights**\n\n  * Hired Stanley Mbugua as Vice President of Finance, who will also assume the role of Chief Accounting Officer, effective November 30, 2024. \n  * Achieved WiSA E wireless milestone with immersive audio software embedded onto an Amlogic reference design, which became available for customer implementation and showcased the IBC show in Amsterdam. \n  * Executed licensing agreements with leading HDTV brands, covering 43% of the HDTV market that uses the Android operating system. \n\n\n\n**Q3 2024 and Subsequent Financial Highlights**\n\n  * Q3 2024 revenue was $1.2 million, up 52% from $0.8 million in Q3 2023. The increase in revenue was a result of an increase in Components sales of $0.7 million, partially offset by a decrease in Consumer Audio Product sales of $0.3 million. \n  * Q3 2024 gross margin as a percentage of sales was 19%, compared to negative 217% in Q3 2023. The improvement in gross margin compared to the prior period is mainly attributable to an increase of $0.4 million increase in revenue between comparison periods and due to the fact that Q3 2023 included a $1.4 million increase in inventory reserves whereas Q3 2024 had only a nominal increase in inventory reserves. \n  * Held $3.9 million cash at September 30, 2024. \n\n\n\n**WiSA Technologies Investor Conference Call**\n\nManagement will host its third quarter 2024 results conference call at 8:00 am PT / 11:00 am ET, on Friday, November 15, 2024. \n\nThe conference call will be available through a live webcast found here: [Webcast | Third Quarter 2024 Results](https://event.choruscall.com/mediaframe/webcast.html?webcastid=zL059EwY)\n\nThose without internet access or who wish to dial in may call: 1-833-366-1124 (domestic), or 1-412-317-0702 (international).
