The distribution is payable June 19, 2024 to the\nshareholders of record at the close of business on May 23, 2024.\n“We had a solid start to 2024, producing operating and financial results in line with our expectations,” commented\nBrendan Cavanagh, President and Chief Executive Officer. “Carrier activity throughout our markets remained\nmeasured in response to continued macro-economic financial pressures and the high cost of capital, but\nnonetheless, we continued to see steady network investment across our portfolio. The consumer and competitive\npressures to provide high performing mobile broadband services persists both domestically and internationally,\nand our customers still have significant 4G and 5G deployment needs. As a result, we anticipate continued solid\norganic leasing growth for many years. During the first part of the year, we saw an increase in expectations for\ncontinued elevated interest rates. This environment has weighed on the valuations of public tower companies.\nGiven our historically low leverage levels, we took advantage of these valuations to opportunistically buy back\napproximately 935,000 shares of our stock for approximately $200 million. In addition, today we announced a\nquarterly dividend 15% higher than the dividend in the prior year period, but still less than 30% of our guided\n2024 AFFO. I believe the quality of our underlying business, the strength of our financial position and the long-\nterm market demands on our customers to invest in their networks positions SBA very well to continue allocating\ncapital for the benefit of our shareholders.”\n1\nOperating Results\nThe table below details select financial results for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and comparisons to the\nprior year period.\n% Change\nexcluding\nQ1 2024 Q1 2023 $ Change % Change FX (1)\nConsolidated ($ in millions, except per share amounts)\nSite leasing revenue $ 628.3 $ 617.3 $ 11.0 1.8% 1.5%\nSite development revenue 29.6 58.2 (28.6) (49.2%) (49.2%)\nTower cash flow (1) 506.0 491.0 15.0 3.0% 2.6%\nNet income 154.5 100.6 53.9 53.6% 146.2%\nEarnings per share - diluted 1.42 0.93 0.50 53.6% 145.6%\nAdjusted EBITDA (1) 465.4 459.3 6.1 1.3% 0.9%\nAFFO (1) 357.4 341.7 15.7 4.6% 4.0%\nAFFO per share (1) 3.29 3.13 0.16 5.1% 4.5%\n(1) See the reconciliations and other disclosures under “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” later in this press release.\nTotal revenues in the first quarter of 2024 were $657.9 million compared to $675.5 million in the prior year period,\na decrease of 2.6%.

Management believes that Adjusted EBITDA helps investors or other interested parties\nmeaningfully evaluate and compare the results of our operations (1) from period to period and (2) to our competitors,\nby excluding the impact of our capital structure (primarily interest charges from our outstanding debt) and asset\nbase (primarily depreciation, amortization and accretion) from our financial results. Management also believes\nAdjusted EBITDA is frequently used by investors or other interested parties in the evaluation of REITs. In addition,\nAdjusted EBITDA is similar to the measure of current financial performance generally used in our debt covenant\ncalculations. Adjusted EBITDA should be considered only as a supplement to net income computed in accordance\nwith GAAP as a measure of our performance;\n(3) FFO, AFFO and AFFO per share, which are metrics used by our public company peers in the\ncommunication site industry, provide investors useful indicators of the financial performance of our business and\npermit investors an additional tool to evaluate the performance of our business against those of our two principal\ncompetitors. FFO, AFFO, and AFFO per share are also used to address questions we receive from analysts and\ninvestors who routinely assess our operating performance on the basis of these performance measures, which are\nconsidered industry standards. We believe that FFO helps investors or other interested parties meaningfully evaluate\nfinancial performance by excluding the impact of our asset base (primarily depreciation, amortization and accretion\nand asset impairment and decommission costs). We believe that AFFO and AFFO per share help investors or other\ninterested parties meaningfully evaluate our financial performance as they include (1) the impact of our capital\nstructure (primarily interest expense on our outstanding debt) and (2) sustaining capital expenditures and exclude\nthe impact of (1) our asset base (primarily depreciation, amortization and accretion and asset impairment and\ndecommission costs) and (2) certain non-cash items, including straight-lined revenues and expenses related to fixed\nescalations and rent free periods and the non-cash portion of our reported tax provision. GAAP requires rental\nrevenues and expenses related to leases that contain specified rental increases over the life of the lease to be\nrecognized evenly over the life of the lease. In accordance with GAAP, if payment terms call for fixed escalations,\nor rent free periods, the revenue or expense is recognized on a straight-lined basis over the fixed, non-cancelable\nterm of the contract. We only use AFFO as a performance measure. AFFO should be considered only as a\nsupplement to net income computed in accordance with GAAP as a measure of our performance and should not be\nconsidered as an alternative to cash flows from operations or as residual cash flow available for discretionary\ninvestment. We believe our definition of FFO is consistent with how that term is defined by the National Association\nof Real Estate Investment Trusts (“NAREIT”) and that our definition and use of AFFO and AFFO per share is\nconsistent with those reported by the other communication site companies;\n(4) Our Non-GAAP Debt Measures provide investors a more complete understanding of our net debt and\nleverage position as they include the full principal amount of our debt which will be due at maturity and, to the\nextent that such measures are calculated on Net Debt are net of our cash and cash equivalents, short-term restricted\ncash, and short-term investments; and\n(5) Our Constant Currency Measures provide management and investors the ability to evaluate the performance\nof the business without the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.\nIn addition, Tower Cash Flow, Adjusted EBITDA, and our Non-GAAP Debt Measures are components of the\ncalculations used by our lenders to determine compliance with certain covenants under our Senior Credit Agreement\nand indentures relating to our 2020 Senior Notes and 2021 Senior Notes. These non-GAAP financial measures are\n12\nnot intended to be an alternative to any of the financial measures provided in our results of operations or our balance\nsheet as determined in accordance with GAAP.\nFinancial Metrics after Eliminating the Impact of Changes In Foreign Currency Exchange Rates\nWe eliminate the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates for each of the financial metrics listed in\nthe table below by dividing the current period’s financial results by the average monthly exchange rates of the prior\nyear period, and by eliminating the impact of the remeasurement of our intercompany loans. The table below\nprovides the reconciliation of the reported growth rate year-over-year of each of such measures to the growth rate\nafter eliminating the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates to such measure.\nFirst quarter\n2024 year Foreign Growth excluding\nover year currency foreign\ngrowth rate impact currency impact\nTotal site leasing revenue 1.8% 0.3% 1.5%\nTotal

Management believes that Adjusted EBITDA helps investors or other interested parties\nmeaningfully evaluate and compare the results of our operations (1) from period to period and (2) to our competitors,\nby excluding the impact of our capital structure (primarily interest charges from our outstanding debt) and asset\nbase (primarily depreciation, amortization and accretion) from our financial results. Management also believes\nAdjusted EBITDA is frequently used by investors or other interested parties in the evaluation of REITs. In addition,\nAdjusted EBITDA is similar to the measure of current financial performance generally used in our debt covenant\ncalculations. Adjusted EBITDA should be considered only as a supplement to net income computed in accordance\nwith GAAP as a measure of our performance;\n(3) FFO, AFFO and AFFO per share, which are metrics used by our public company peers in the\ncommunication site industry, provide investors useful indicators of the financial performance of our business and\npermit investors an additional tool to evaluate the performance of our business against those of our two principal\ncompetitors. FFO, AFFO, and AFFO per share are also used to address questions we receive from analysts and\ninvestors who routinely assess our operating performance on the basis of these performance measures, which are\nconsidered industry standards. We believe that FFO helps investors or other interested parties meaningfully evaluate\nfinancial performance by excluding the impact of our asset base (primarily depreciation, amortization and accretion\nand asset impairment and decommission costs). We believe that AFFO and AFFO per share help investors or other\ninterested parties meaningfully evaluate our financial performance as they include (1) the impact of our capital\nstructure (primarily interest expense on our outstanding debt) and (2) sustaining capital expenditures and exclude\nthe impact of (1) our asset base (primarily depreciation, amortization and accretion and asset impairment and\ndecommission costs) and (2) certain non-cash items, including straight-lined revenues and expenses related to fixed\nescalations and rent free periods and the non-cash portion of our reported tax provision. GAAP requires rental\nrevenues and expenses related to leases that contain specified rental increases over the life of the lease to be\nrecognized evenly over the life of the lease. In accordance with GAAP, if payment terms call for fixed escalations,\nor rent free periods, the revenue or expense is recognized on a straight-lined basis over the fixed, non-cancelable\nterm of the contract. We only use AFFO as a performance measure. AFFO should be considered only as a\nsupplement to net income computed in accordance with GAAP as a measure of our performance and should not be\nconsidered as an alternative to cash flows from operations or as residual cash flow available for discretionary\ninvestment. We believe our definition of FFO is consistent with how that term is defined by the National Association\nof Real Estate Investment Trusts (“NAREIT”) and that our definition and use of AFFO and AFFO per share is\nconsistent with those reported by the other communication site companies;\n(4) Our Non-GAAP Debt Measures provide investors a more complete understanding of our net debt and\nleverage position as they include the full principal amount of our debt which will be due at maturity and, to the\nextent that such measures are calculated on Net Debt are net of our cash and cash equivalents, short-term restricted\ncash, and short-term investments; and\n(5) Our Constant Currency Measures provide management and investors the ability to evaluate the performance\nof the business without the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.\nIn addition, Tower Cash Flow, Adjusted EBITDA, and our Non-GAAP Debt Measures are components of the\ncalculations used by our lenders to determine compliance with certain covenants under our Senior Credit Agreement\nand indentures relating to our 2020 Senior Notes and 2021 Senior Notes. These non-GAAP financial measures are\n11\nnot intended to be an alternative to any of the financial measures provided in our results of operations or our balance\nsheet as determined in accordance with GAAP.\nFinancial Metrics after Eliminating the Impact of Changes In Foreign Currency Exchange Rates\nWe eliminate the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates for each of the financial metrics listed in\nthe table below by dividing the current period’s financial results by the average monthly exchange rates of the prior\nyear period, and by eliminating the impact of the remeasurement of our intercompany loans. The table below\nprovides the reconciliation of the reported growth rate year-over-year of each of such measures to the growth rate\nafter eliminating the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates to such measure.\nSecond quarter\n2024 year Foreign Growth excluding\nover year currency foreign\ngrowth rate impact currency impact\nTotal site leasing revenue 0.1% (1.1%) 1.2%\nTotal

(“Millicom”) for approximately $975.0 million\nin cash. These sites are located in Guatemala, Honduras, Panama, El Salvador, and Nicaragua, with significantly\nall cash flows denominated in USD. The sites to be acquired in this transaction are anticipated to produce\napproximately $129.0 million of revenues and $89.0 million of tower cash flow during their first full year of\noperations after closing. Upon closing, Millicom will enter into country-specific Master Lease Agreements\n(“MLAs”) to lease back space on all acquired sites for an initial term of 15 years. The MLAs will also incorporate\nan extension to SBA’s approximately 1,500 existing site leases with Millicom for a new 15-year term. Additionally,\nas part of the purchase agreement, SBA and Millicom have agreed to a seven-year exclusivity right for SBA to build\nup to 2,500 build-to-suit sites in Central America for Millicom with new leases on any sites built having an initial\nlease term of 15 years.

Leasing results across our international markets also remained\nvery solid during the quarter, and our services business had its strongest quarter of the year in terms of both revenue\nand gross profit. Our positive results and momentum have allowed us to increase our full year outlook for all key\nfinancial metrics. During the quarter, we also made significant progress with regard to our balance sheet,\nrefinancing $1.8 billion in upcoming debt maturities at rates well below our estimates from just a few months ago,\nrepricing our $2.3 billion Term Loan B to reduce our interest rate by 25 basis points, and locking in a new forward\nstarting interest rate hedge in order to minimize exposure under our floating rate debt. These accomplishments\ndemonstrate our access to attractively priced capital and our position as a preferred issuer across the various debt\n1\nmarkets in which we participate. In addition, in support of our stated desire to secure our position as a leader in each\nmarket where we operate and to align ourselves with the leading carriers in each market, subsequent to quarter-end\nwe entered into a purchase agreement with Millicom for over 7,000 sites throughout Central America. As a result\nof this transaction and the strength of our existing portfolio in the region, we will be the leading tower company\nacross all of Central America. We are excited to support Millicom in advancing their network goals, as well as\nbroadly growing access to wireless services throughout these markets. We are well situated to continue\nopportunistically taking advantage of value enhancing investments in new assets and stock repurchases, as well as\nto capture growth from our customers’ accelerating network investments.”\nOperating Results\nThe table below details select financial results for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and comparisons to\nthe prior year period.\n% Change\nexcluding\nQ3 2024 Q3 2023 $ Change % Change FX (1)\nConsolidated ($ in millions, except per share amounts)\nSite leasing revenue $ 625.7 $ 637.4 $ (11.7) (1.8%) 0.3%\nSite development revenue 41.9 45.1 (3.2) (7.1%) (7.1%)\nTower cash flow (1) 507.6 511.7 (4.1) (0.8%) 1.1%\nNet income 255.9 85.4 170.5 199.6% 106.9%\nEarnings per share - diluted 2.40 0.80 1.59 198.4% 109.3%\nAdjusted EBITDA (1) 472.6 482.1 (9.5) (2.0%) (0.2%)\nAFFO (1) 358.3 364.1 (5.8) (1.6%) 0.7%\nAFFO per share (1) 3.32 3.34 (0.02) (0.6%) 1.8%\n(1) See the reconciliations and other disclosures under “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” later in this press release.\nTotal revenues in the third quarter of 2024 were $667.6 million compared to $682.5 million in the prior year period,\na decrease of 2.2%.

The calculation of\nSegment operating profit for each of our segments is set forth below.\nDomestic Site Leasing Int'l Site Leasing Site Development\nFor the three months For the three months For the three months\nended September 30, ended September 30, ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023 2024 2023\n(in thousands)\nSegment revenue $ 464,860 $ 468,371 $ 160,837 $ 169,069 $ 41,898 $ 45,104\nSegment cost of revenues (excluding\ndepreciation, accretion, and amort.)

Management believes that Adjusted EBITDA helps investors or other interested parties\nmeaningfully evaluate and compare the results of our operations (1) from period to period and (2) to our competitors,\nby excluding the impact of our capital structure (primarily interest charges from our outstanding debt) and asset\nbase (primarily depreciation, amortization and accretion) from our financial results. Management also believes\nAdjusted EBITDA is frequently used by investors or other interested parties in the evaluation of REITs. In addition,\nAdjusted EBITDA is similar to the measure of current financial performance generally used in our debt covenant\ncalculations. Adjusted EBITDA should be considered only as a supplement to net income computed in accordance\nwith GAAP as a measure of our performance;\n(3) FFO, AFFO and AFFO per share, which are metrics used by our public company peers in the\ncommunication site industry, provide investors useful indicators of the financial performance of our business and\npermit investors an additional tool to evaluate the performance of our business against those of our two principal\ncompetitors. FFO, AFFO, and AFFO per share are also used to address questions we receive from analysts and\ninvestors who routinely assess our operating performance on the basis of these performance measures, which are\nconsidered industry standards. We believe that FFO helps investors or other interested parties meaningfully evaluate\nfinancial performance by excluding the impact of our asset base (primarily depreciation, amortization and accretion\nand asset impairment and decommission costs). We believe that AFFO and AFFO per share help investors or other\ninterested parties meaningfully evaluate our financial performance as they include (1) the impact of our capital\nstructure (primarily interest expense on our outstanding debt) and (2) sustaining capital expenditures and exclude\nthe impact of (1) our asset base (primarily depreciation, amortization and accretion and asset impairment and\ndecommission costs) and (2) certain non-cash items, including straight-lined revenues and expenses related to fixed\nescalations and rent free periods and the non-cash portion of our reported tax provision. GAAP requires rental\nrevenues and expenses related to leases that contain specified rental increases over the life of the lease to be\nrecognized evenly over the life of the lease. In accordance with GAAP, if payment terms call for fixed escalations,\nor rent free periods, the revenue or expense is recognized on a straight-lined basis over the fixed, non-cancelable\nterm of the contract. We only use AFFO as a performance measure. AFFO should be considered only as a\nsupplement to net income computed in accordance with GAAP as a measure of our performance and should not be\nconsidered as an alternative to cash flows from operations or as residual cash flow available for discretionary\ninvestment. We believe our definition of FFO is consistent with how that term is defined by the National Association\nof Real Estate Investment Trusts (“NAREIT”) and that our definition and use of AFFO and AFFO per share is\nconsistent with those reported by the other communication site companies;\n(4) Our Non-GAAP Debt Measures provide investors a more complete understanding of our net debt and\nleverage position as they include the full principal amount of our debt which will be due at maturity and, to the\nextent that such measures are calculated on Net Debt are net of our cash and cash equivalents, short-term restricted\ncash, and short-term investments; and\n(5) Our Constant Currency Measures provide management and investors the ability to evaluate the performance\nof the business without the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.\nIn addition, Tower Cash Flow, Adjusted EBITDA, and our Non-GAAP Debt Measures are components of the\ncalculations used by our lenders to determine compliance with certain covenants under our Senior Credit Agreement\nand indentures relating to our 2020 Senior Notes and 2021 Senior Notes. These non-GAAP financial measures are\n12\nnot intended to be an alternative to any of the financial measures provided in our results of operations or our balance\nsheet as determined in accordance with GAAP.\nFinancial Metrics after Eliminating the Impact of Changes In Foreign Currency Exchange Rates\nWe eliminate the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates for each of the financial metrics listed in\nthe table below by dividing the current period’s financial results by the average monthly exchange rates of the prior\nyear period, and by eliminating the impact of the remeasurement of our intercompany loans. The table below\nprovides the reconciliation of the reported growth rate year-over-year of each of such measures to the growth rate\nafter eliminating the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates to such measure.\nThird quarter\n2024 year Foreign Growth excluding\nover year currency foreign\ngrowth rate impact currency impact\nTotal site leasing revenue (1.8%) (2.1%) 0.3%\nTotal cash site leasing revenue (0.9%) (2.1%) 1.2%\nInt'l cash site leasing revenue (5.1%) (7.9%) 2.8%\nTotal site leasing segment operating profit (2.2%) (1.8%) (0.4%)\nInt'l site leasing segment operating profit (4.9%) (7.9%) 3.0%\nTotal site leasing tower cash flow (0.8%) (1.9%) 1.1%\nInt'l site leasing tower cash flow (4.2%) (8.0%) 3.8%\nNet income 199.6% 92.7% 106.9%\nEarnings per share — diluted 198.4% 89.1% 109.3%\nAdjusted EBITDA (2.0%) (1.8%) (0.2%)\nAFFO (1.6%) (2.3%) 0.7%\nAFFO per share (0.6%) (2.4%) 1.8%\nCash Site Leasing Revenue, Tower Cash Flow, and Tower Cash Flow Margin\nThe table below sets forth the reconciliation of Cash Site Leasing Revenue and Tower Cash Flow to their most\ncomparable GAAP measurement and Tower Cash Flow Margin, which is calculated by dividing Tower Cash Flow\nby Cash Site Leasing Revenue.\nDomestic S it e Leasing Int'l Sit e L easing Total Si te L easing\nFor the three months For the three months For the three months\nended September 30, ended September 30, ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023 2024 2023\n(in thousands)\nSite leasing revenue $ 464,860 $ 468,371 $ 160,837 $ 169,069 $ 625,697 $ 637,440\nNon-cash straight-line leasing revenue (1,004) (7,371) (61) 323 (1,065) (7,048)\nCash site leasing revenue 463,856 461,000 160,776 169,392 624,632 630,392\nSite leasing cost of revenues (excluding\ndepreciation, accretion, and amortization) (68,908) (66,768) (49,040) (51,509) (117,948) (118,277)\nNon-cash straight-line ground lease (873) (1,062) 1,818 634 945 (428)\nexpTeonwsee r Cash Flow $ 394,075 $ 393,170 $ 113,554 $ 118,517 $ 507,629 $ 511,687\nTower Cash Flow Margin 85.0% 85.3% 70.6% 70.0% 81.3% 81.2%\n13\nForecasted Tower Cash Flow for Full Year 2024\nThe table below sets forth the reconciliation of forecasted Tower Cash Flow set forth in the Outlook section to its\nmost comparable GAAP measurement for the full year 2024:\nFull Year 2024\n(in millions)\nSite leasing revenue $ 2,520.0 to $ 2,530.0\nNon-cash straight-line leasing revenue (11.5) to (6.5)\nCash site leasing revenue 2,508.5 to 2,523.5\nSite leasing cost of revenues (excluding\ndepreciation, accretion, and amortization) (457.0) to (467.0)\nNon-cash straight-line ground lease expense (11.5) to (6.5)\nTower Cash Flow $ 2,040.0 to $ 2,050.0\nAdjusted EBITDA, Annualized Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA Margin\nThe table below sets forth the reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to its most comparable GAAP measurement.\nFor the three months\nended September 30,\n2024 2023\n(in thousands)\nNet income $ 255,891 $ 85,362\nNon-cash straight-line leasing revenue (1,065) (7,048)\nNon-cash straight-line ground lease expense 945 (428)\nNon-cash compensation 16,373 21,374\nOther (income) expense, net (23,700) 48,330\nAcquisition and new business initiatives related adjustments and expenses 5,388 5,612\nAsset impairment and decommission costs 12,670 33,063\nInterest income (6,999) (5,266)\nTotal interest expense (1) 108,088 112,317\nDepreciation, accretion, and amortization 63,515 180,674\nProvision for taxes (2) 41,514 8,141\nAdjusted EBITDA $ 472,620 $ 482,131\nAnnualized Adjusted EBITDA (3) $ 1,890,480 $ 1,928,524\n(1) Total interest expense includes interest expense, non-cash interest expense, and amortization of deferred financing fees.\n(2) For the three months ended September 30, 2024 this amount includes $0.8 million of benefit from franchise and gross\nreceipts taxes reflected in the Statements of Operations in selling, general and administrative expenses.

The calculation of\nSegment operating profit for each of our segments is set forth below.\nDomestic Site Leasing Int'l Site Leasing Site Development\nFor the three months For the three months For the three months\nended March 31, ended March 31, ended March 31,\n2023 2022 2023 2022 2023 2022\n(in thousands)\nSegment revenue $ 454,833 $ 432,986 $ 162,435 $ 126,446 $ 58,248 $ 60,338\nSegment cost of revenues (excluding\ndepreciation, accretion, and amort.)

Management believes that Adjusted EBITDA helps investors or other interested parties\nmeaningfully evaluate and compare the results of our operations (1) from period to period and (2) to our competitors,\nby excluding the impact of our capital structure (primarily interest charges from our outstanding debt) and asset\nbase (primarily depreciation, amortization and accretion) from our financial results. Management also believes\nAdjusted EBITDA is frequently used by investors or other interested parties in the evaluation of REITs. In addition,\nAdjusted EBITDA is similar to the measure of current financial performance generally used in our debt covenant\ncalculations. Adjusted EBITDA should be considered only as a supplement to net income computed in accordance\nwith GAAP as a measure of our performance;\n(3) FFO, AFFO and AFFO per share, which are metrics used by our public company peers in the\ncommunication site industry, provide investors useful indicators of the financial performance of our business and\npermit investors an additional tool to evaluate the performance of our business against those of our two principal\ncompetitors. FFO, AFFO, and AFFO per share are also used to address questions we receive from analysts and\ninvestors who routinely assess our operating performance on the basis of these performance measures, which are\nconsidered industry standards. We believe that FFO helps investors or other interested parties meaningfully evaluate\nfinancial performance by excluding the impact of our asset base (primarily depreciation, amortization and accretion\nand asset impairment and decommission costs). We believe that AFFO and AFFO per share help investors or other\ninterested parties meaningfully evaluate our financial performance as they include (1) the impact of our capital\nstructure (primarily interest expense on our outstanding debt) and (2) sustaining capital expenditures and exclude\nthe impact of (1) our asset base (primarily depreciation, amortization and accretion and asset impairment and\ndecommission costs) and (2) certain non-cash items, including straight-lined revenues and expenses related to fixed\nescalations and rent free periods and the non-cash portion of our reported tax provision. GAAP requires rental\nrevenues and expenses related to leases that contain specified rental increases over the life of the lease to be\nrecognized evenly over the life of the lease. In accordance with GAAP, if payment terms call for fixed escalations,\nor rent free periods, the revenue or expense is recognized on a straight-lined basis over the fixed, non-cancelable\nterm of the contract. We only use AFFO as a performance measure. AFFO should be considered only as a\nsupplement to net income computed in accordance with GAAP as a measure of our performance and should not be\nconsidered as an alternative to cash flows from operations or as residual cash flow available for discretionary\ninvestment. We believe our definition of FFO is consistent with how that term is defined by the National Association\nof Real Estate Investment Trusts (“NAREIT”) and that our definition and use of AFFO and AFFO per share is\nconsistent with those reported by the other communication site companies;\n(4) Our Non-GAAP Debt Measures provide investors a more complete understanding of our net debt and\nleverage position as they include the full principal amount of our debt which will be due at maturity and, to the\nextent that such measures are calculated on Net Debt are net of our cash and cash equivalents, short-term restricted\ncash, and short-term investments; and\n(5) Our Constant Currency Measures provide management and investors the ability to evaluate the performance\nof the business without the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.\nIn addition, Tower Cash Flow, Adjusted EBITDA, and our Non-GAAP Debt Measures are components of the\ncalculations used by our lenders to determine compliance with certain covenants under our Senior Credit Agreement\nand indentures relating to our 2020 Senior Notes and 2021 Senior Notes. These non-GAAP financial measures are\n11\nnot intended to be an alternative to any of the financial measures provided in our results of operations or our balance\nsheet as determined in accordance with GAAP.\nFinancial Metrics after Eliminating the Impact of Changes In Foreign Currency Exchange Rates\nWe eliminate the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates for each of the financial metrics listed in\nthe table below by dividing the current period’s financial results by the average monthly exchange rates of the prior\nyear period, and by eliminating the impact of the remeasurement of our intercompany loans. The table below\nprovides the reconciliation of the reported growth rate year-over-year of each of such measures to the growth rate\nafter eliminating the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates to such measure.\nFirst quarter\n2023 year Foreign Growth excluding\nover year currency foreign\ngrowth rate impact currency impact\nTotal site leasing revenue 10.3% (0.5%) 10.8%\nTotal

The comprehensive MLA will streamline AT&T’s deployment of 5G and other next\ngeneration technology across SBA’s extensive US tower portfolio, mutually benefitting both companies through\nsecuring a committed operating relationship for years into the future.\n“We posted good financial results for the second quarter, exceeding estimates and our own expectations,” stated\nJeffrey A. Stoops, President and Chief Executive Officer. “Customer activity varied by region, with US customers\na little less active in the aggregate with their wireless networks than we expected, and international customers a\nlittle more active in the aggregate than we expected. Combined, we posted solid growth in site leasing revenue\nand Tower Cash Flow. We continue to execute very well, growing both our Tower Cash Flow and Adjusted\nEBITDA margins on a year-over-year basis. We generated solid AFFO in the quarter, providing ample cash for\ndiscretionary spending. During the quarter, we dedicated the majority of our discretionary spending to retire\nfloating-rate indebtedness, resulting in quarter-end net debt to Adjusted EBITDA of 6.6x, our lowest leverage\nratio in decades. We are also very pleased to announce our newly signed master lease agreement with AT&T.\nThis agreement serves to expand upon our existing strong relationship with AT&T, providing for future leasing\ngrowth from AT&T at our tower sites and enhancing efficiencies in the day-to-day operations between our two\ncompanies. We are excited about this next phase in our relationship. Based on second quarter results, our current\nexpectations for the remainder of 2023 and our new MLA with AT&T, we have adjusted our full year outlook in a\nnumber of areas, including increases to Site Leasing Revenue, Tower Cash Flow, Adjusted EBITDA, AFFO and\nAFFO per share.”\n1\nOperating Results\nThe table below details select financial results for the three months ended June 30, 2023 and comparisons to the\nprior year period.\n% Change\nexcluding\nQ2 2023 Q2 2022 $ Change % Change FX (1)\nConsolidated ($ in millions, except per share amounts)\nSite leasing revenue $ 626.1 $ 580.2 $ 45.9 7.9% 8.6%\nSite development revenue 52.4 71.8 (19.4) (27.1%) (27.1%)\nTower cash flow (1) 503.5 459.6 43.9 9.6% 10.2%\nNet income 202.0 69.2 132.8 191.9% 57.1%\nEarnings per share - diluted 1.87 0.64 1.23 194.2% 58.3%\nAdjusted EBITDA (1) 471.7 437.8 33.9 7.8% 8.4%\nAFFO (1) 352.7 335.3 17.4 5.2% 6.0%\nAFFO per share (1) 3.24 3.07 0.17 5.5% 6.2%\n(1) See the reconciliations and other disclosures under “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” later in this press release.\nTotal revenues in the second quarter of 2023 were $678.5 million compared to $652.0 million in the prior year\nperiod, an increase of 4.1%.

Segment\noperating profit is a key business metric and one of our two measures of segment profitability. The calculation of\nSegment operating profit for each of our segments is set forth below.\nDomestic Site Leasing Int'l Site Leasing Site Development\nFor the three months For the three months For the three months\nended June 30, ended June 30, ended June 30,\n2023 2022 2023 2022 2023 2022\n(in thousands)\nSegment revenue $ 456,754 $ 442,084 $ 169,389 $ 138,149 $ 52,357 $ 71,773\nSegment cost of revenues (excluding\ndepreciation, accretion, and amort.)

Management believes that Adjusted EBITDA helps investors or other interested parties\nmeaningfully evaluate and compare the results of our operations (1) from period to period and (2) to our competitors,\nby excluding the impact of our capital structure (primarily interest charges from our outstanding debt) and asset\nbase (primarily depreciation, amortization and accretion) from our financial results. Management also believes\nAdjusted EBITDA is frequently used by investors or other interested parties in the evaluation of REITs. In addition,\nAdjusted EBITDA is similar to the measure of current financial performance generally used in our debt covenant\ncalculations. Adjusted EBITDA should be considered only as a supplement to net income computed in accordance\nwith GAAP as a measure of our performance;\n(3) FFO, AFFO and AFFO per share, which are metrics used by our public company peers in the\ncommunication site industry, provide investors useful indicators of the financial performance of our business and\npermit investors an additional tool to evaluate the performance of our business against those of our two principal\ncompetitors. FFO, AFFO, and AFFO per share are also used to address questions we receive from analysts and\ninvestors who routinely assess our operating performance on the basis of these performance measures, which are\nconsidered industry standards. We believe that FFO helps investors or other interested parties meaningfully evaluate\nfinancial performance by excluding the impact of our asset base (primarily depreciation, amortization and accretion\nand asset impairment and decommission costs). We believe that AFFO and AFFO per share help investors or other\ninterested parties meaningfully evaluate our financial performance as they include (1) the impact of our capital\nstructure (primarily interest expense on our outstanding debt) and (2) sustaining capital expenditures and exclude\nthe impact of (1) our asset base (primarily depreciation, amortization and accretion and asset impairment and\ndecommission costs) and (2) certain non-cash items, including straight-lined revenues and expenses related to fixed\nescalations and rent free periods and the non-cash portion of our reported tax provision. GAAP requires rental\nrevenues and expenses related to leases that contain specified rental increases over the life of the lease to be\nrecognized evenly over the life of the lease. In accordance with GAAP, if payment terms call for fixed escalations,\nor rent free periods, the revenue or expense is recognized on a straight-lined basis over the fixed, non-cancelable\nterm of the contract. We only use AFFO as a performance measure. AFFO should be considered only as a\nsupplement to net income computed in accordance with GAAP as a measure of our performance and should not be\nconsidered as an alternative to cash flows from operations or as residual cash flow available for discretionary\ninvestment. We believe our definition of FFO is consistent with how that term is defined by the National Association\nof Real Estate Investment Trusts (“NAREIT”) and that our definition and use of AFFO and AFFO per share is\nconsistent with those reported by the other communication site companies;\n(4) Our Non-GAAP Debt Measures provide investors a more complete understanding of our net debt and\nleverage position as they include the full principal amount of our debt which will be due at maturity and, to the\nextent that such measures are calculated on Net Debt are net of our cash and cash equivalents, short-term restricted\ncash, and short-term investments; and\n(5) Our Constant Currency Measures provide management and investors the ability to evaluate the performance\nof the business without the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.\nIn addition, Tower Cash Flow, Adjusted EBITDA, and our Non-GAAP Debt Measures are components of the\ncalculations used by our lenders to determine compliance with certain covenants under our Senior Credit Agreement\nand indentures relating to our 2020 Senior Notes and 2021 Senior Notes. These non-GAAP financial measures are\n11\nnot intended to be an alternative to any of the financial measures provided in our results of operations or our balance\nsheet as determined in accordance with GAAP.\nFinancial Metrics after Eliminating the Impact of Changes In Foreign Currency Exchange Rates\nWe eliminate the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates for each of the financial metrics listed in\nthe table below by dividing the current period’s financial results by the average monthly exchange rates of the prior\nyear period, and by eliminating the impact of the remeasurement of our intercompany loans. The table below\nprovides the reconciliation of the reported growth rate year-over-year of each of such measures to the growth rate\nafter eliminating the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates to such measure.\nSecond quarter\n2023 year Foreign Growth excluding\nover year currency foreign\ngrowth rate impact currency impact\nTotal site leasing revenue 7.9% (0.7%) 8.6%\nTotal

We repurchased $100 million of our common stock. We dedicated the remainder of our\ndiscretionary spending to portfolio growth and to retire floating-rate indebtedness. We posted quarter-end net debt\nto Adjusted EBITDA of 6.4x, our lowest leverage ratio in decades. Based on third quarter results and our current\nexpectations for the remainder of 2023, we have adjusted our full year outlook in a number of areas, including\nincreases to Site Leasing Revenue, Tower Cash Flow, Adjusted EBITDA, AFFO and AFFO per share\nnotwithstanding anticipated less favorable foreign currency exchange rates.

Segment\noperating profit is a key business metric and one of our two measures of segment profitability. The calculation of\nSegment operating profit for each of our segments is set forth below.\nDomestic Site Leasing Int'l Site Leasing Site Development\nFor the three months For the three months For the three months\nended September 30, ended September 30, ended September 30,\n2023 2022 2023 2022 2023 2022\n(in thousands)\nSegment revenue $ 468,371 $ 449,595 $ 169,069 $ 137,707 $ 45,104 $ 88,282\nSegment cost of revenues (excluding\ndepreciation, accretion, and amort.)

Management believes that Adjusted EBITDA helps investors or other interested parties\nmeaningfully evaluate and compare the results of our operations (1) from period to period and (2) to our competitors,\nby excluding the impact of our capital structure (primarily interest charges from our outstanding debt) and asset\nbase (primarily depreciation, amortization and accretion) from our financial results. Management also believes\nAdjusted EBITDA is frequently used by investors or other interested parties in the evaluation of REITs. In addition,\nAdjusted EBITDA is similar to the measure of current financial performance generally used in our debt covenant\ncalculations. Adjusted EBITDA should be considered only as a supplement to net income computed in accordance\nwith GAAP as a measure of our performance;\n(3) FFO, AFFO and AFFO per share, which are metrics used by our public company peers in the\ncommunication site industry, provide investors useful indicators of the financial performance of our business and\npermit investors an additional tool to evaluate the performance of our business against those of our two principal\ncompetitors. FFO, AFFO, and AFFO per share are also used to address questions we receive from analysts and\ninvestors who routinely assess our operating performance on the basis of these performance measures, which are\nconsidered industry standards. We believe that FFO helps investors or other interested parties meaningfully evaluate\nfinancial performance by excluding the impact of our asset base (primarily depreciation, amortization and accretion\nand asset impairment and decommission costs). We believe that AFFO and AFFO per share help investors or other\ninterested parties meaningfully evaluate our financial performance as they include (1) the impact of our capital\nstructure (primarily interest expense on our outstanding debt) and (2) sustaining capital expenditures and exclude\nthe impact of (1) our asset base (primarily depreciation, amortization and accretion and asset impairment and\ndecommission costs) and (2) certain non-cash items, including straight-lined revenues and expenses related to fixed\nescalations and rent free periods and the non-cash portion of our reported tax provision. GAAP requires rental\nrevenues and expenses related to leases that contain specified rental increases over the life of the lease to be\nrecognized evenly over the life of the lease. In accordance with GAAP, if payment terms call for fixed escalations,\nor rent free periods, the revenue or expense is recognized on a straight-lined basis over the fixed, non-cancelable\nterm of the contract. We only use AFFO as a performance measure. AFFO should be considered only as a\nsupplement to net income computed in accordance with GAAP as a measure of our performance and should not be\nconsidered as an alternative to cash flows from operations or as residual cash flow available for discretionary\ninvestment. We believe our definition of FFO is consistent with how that term is defined by the National Association\nof Real Estate Investment Trusts (“NAREIT”) and that our definition and use of AFFO and AFFO per share is\nconsistent with those reported by the other communication site companies;\n(4) Our Non-GAAP Debt Measures provide investors a more complete understanding of our net debt and\nleverage position as they include the full principal amount of our debt which will be due at maturity and, to the\nextent that such measures are calculated on Net Debt are net of our cash and cash equivalents, short-term restricted\ncash, and short-term investments; and\n(5) Our Constant Currency Measures provide management and investors the ability to evaluate the performance\nof the business without the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.\nIn addition, Tower Cash Flow, Adjusted EBITDA, and our Non-GAAP Debt Measures are components of the\ncalculations used by our lenders to determine compliance with certain covenants under our Senior Credit Agreement\nand indentures relating to our 2020 Senior Notes and 2021 Senior Notes. These non-GAAP financial measures are\n11\nnot intended to be an alternative to any of the financial measures provided in our results of operations or our balance\nsheet as determined in accordance with GAAP.\nFinancial Metrics after Eliminating the Impact of Changes In Foreign Currency Exchange Rates\nWe eliminate the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates for each of the financial metrics listed in\nthe table below by dividing the current period’s financial results by the average monthly exchange rates of the prior\nyear period, and by eliminating the impact of the remeasurement of our intercompany loans. The table below\nprovides the reconciliation of the reported growth rate year-over-year of each of such measures to the growth rate\nafter eliminating the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates to such measure.\nThird quarter\n2023 year Foreign Growth excluding\nover year currency foreign\ngrowth rate impact currency impact\nTotal site leasing revenue 8.5% 0.8% 7.7%\nTotal

The distribution is payable March 28, 2024 to the shareholders of record at the close of\nbusiness on March 14, 2024.\n“We had a strong finish to 2023, exceeding our outlook for Site Leasing Revenue, Tower Cash Flow, Adjusted\nEBITDA and AFFO,” commented Brendan Cavanagh, President and Chief Executive Officer. “While domestic\ncarrier activity was at a low level by historical standards during 2023, a significant percentage of our sites still\nrequire 5G related upgrades, and with the growing success of products such as Fixed Wireless Access, the\ndemand for improved speeds, lower latency and greater network capacity continues to advance. This dynamic\nbodes well for solid organic leasing growth on our U.S. assets for years to come. Internationally, we continued to\nexperience strong demand for our towers across many of our markets and have become a trusted partner to our\ninternational carrier customers. 2023 was a year marked by higher interest rates than we have seen throughout\nmuch of our history. As a result, we directed a significant portion of our allocable capital into reducing some of\nour highest cost debt, and we ended the year with a net debt to Adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio of 6.3x, the\nlowest level in decades. Notwithstanding the higher cost of borrowing and the slower pace of organic leasing\nactivity, we still produced fourth quarter AFFO/share growth of 8.0% over the fourth quarter of 2022. Our\nbusiness remains steady, and we continue to produce significant free cash flow. As a result, today we announced\nan increase in our quarterly dividend of 15%. While a sizeable increase, this dividend on an annual basis\nrepresents less than 30% of our AFFO in our 2024 Outlook, meaning that we still have significant capital\navailable for potential portfolio growth and stock repurchases. The strength and quality of our core business gives\nme great confidence about our prospects to create increased value for our shareholders for years into the future.”\n1\nOperating Results\nThe table below details select financial results for the three months ended December 31, 2023 and comparisons to\nthe prior year period.\n% Change\nexcluding\nQ4 2023 Q4 2022 $ Change % Change FX (1)\nConsolidated ($ in millions, except per share amounts)\nSite leasing revenue $ 636.1 $ 609.6 $ 26.5 4.3% 3.7%\nSite development revenue 39.0 76.5 (37.5) (49.1%) (49.1%)\nTower cash flow (1) 512.2 485.9 26.3 5.4% 4.7%\nNet income 109.5 102.6 6.9 6.7% (14.4%)\nEarnings per share - diluted 1.01 0.94 0.06 6.7% (14.8%)\nAdjusted EBITDA (1) 480.7 460.7 20.0 4.3% 3.6%\nAFFO (1) 365.7 340.7 25.0 7.3% 6.4%\nAFFO per share (1) 3.37 3.12 0.25 8.0% 7.1%\n(1) See the reconciliations and other disclosures under “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” later in this press release.\nTotal revenues in the fourth quarter of 2023 were $675.1 million compared to $686.1 million in the prior year\nperiod, a decrease of 1.6%.

Information\nregarding potential risks that could cause the actual results to differ from these forward-looking statements is set\nforth below and in the Company’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nThe Company’s full year 2024 Outlook assumes the acquisitions of only those communication sites under contract\nand anticipated to close at the time of this press release. The Company may spend additional capital in 2024 on\nacquiring revenue producing assets not yet identified or under contract, the impact of which is not reflected in the\n2024 guidance. The Outlook also assumes the refinancing of the $620.0 million 2014-2C Tower Securities (which\nhave an anticipated repayment date of October 8, 2024) on July 1, 2024, at a fixed rate of 6.000%. The Outlook\nalso does not contemplate any repurchases of the Company’s stock or new debt financings during 2024 (other than\nthe refinancing of the 2014-2C Tower Securities), although the Company may ultimately spend capital to repurchase\nstock or issue new debt during the remainder of the year.\nThe Company’s Outlook assumes an average foreign currency exchange rate of 5.00 Brazilian Reais to 1.0 U.S.\nDollar, 1.34 Canadian Dollars to 1.0 U.S. Dollar, 2,515 Tanzanian shillings to 1.0 U.S. Dollar, and 19.00 South\nAfrican Rand to 1.0 U.S. Dollar for the full year 2024. When compared to 2023 actual foreign currency exchange\nrates, these 2024 foreign currency rate assumptions negatively impacted the 2024 full year Outlook by\napproximately $6.0 million for leasing revenue, $3.1 million for Tower Cash Flow, $2.8 million for Adjusted\nEBITDA, and $2.6 million for AFFO.\n(in millions, except per share amounts) Full Year 2024\nSite leasing revenue (1) $ 2,529.0 to $ 2,549.0\nSite development revenue $ 140.0 to $ 160.0\nTotal revenues $ 2,669.0 to $ 2,709.0\nTower Cash Flow (2) $ 2,046.0 to $ 2,066.0\nAdjusted EBITDA (2) $ 1,894.0 to $ 1,914.0\nNet cash interest expense (3) $ 356.0 to $ 361.0\nNon-discretionary cash capital expenditures (4) $ 51.0 to $ 61.0\nAFFO (2) $ 1,433.0 to $ 1,473.0\nAFFO per share (2) (5) $ 13.15 to $ 13.51\nDiscretionary cash capital expenditures (6) $ 320.0 to $ 340.0\n(1) The Company’s Outlook for site leasing revenue includes revenue associated with pass through reimbursable expenses.\n4\n(2) See the reconciliation of this non-GAAP financial measure presented below under “Non-GAAP Financial Measures.”\n(3) Net cash interest expense is defined as interest expense less interest income. Net cash interest expense does not include\namortization of deferred financing fees or non-cash interest expense.\n(4) Consists of tower maintenance and general corporate capital expenditures.\n(5) Outlook for AFFO per share is calculated by dividing the Company’s outlook for AFFO by an assumed weighted average\nnumber of diluted common shares of 109.0 million. Outlook does not include the impact of any potential future repurchases\nof the Company’s stock during 2024.\n(6) Consists of new tower builds, tower augmentations, communication site acquisitions and ground lease purchases. Does\nnot include easements or payments to extend lease terms and expenditures for acquisitions of revenue producing assets not\nunder contract at the date of this press release.\nConference Call Information\nSBA Communications Corporation will host a conference call on Monday, February 26, 2024 at 5:00 PM (EST) to\ndiscuss the quarterly results.

Segment\noperating profit is a key business metric and one of our two measures of segment profitability. The calculation of\nSegment operating profit for each of our segments is set forth below.\nDomestic Site Leasing Int'l Site Leasing Site Development\nFor the three months For the three months For the three months\nended December 31, ended December 31, ended December 31,\n2023 2022 2023 2022 2023 2022\n(in thousands)\nSegment revenue $ 466,595 $ 452,928 $ 169,489 $ 156,680 $ 38,940 $ 76,486\nSegment cost of revenues (excluding\ndepreciation, accretion, and amort.)

Management believes that Adjusted EBITDA helps investors or other interested parties\nmeaningfully evaluate and compare the results of our operations (1) from period to period and (2) to our competitors,\nby excluding the impact of our capital structure (primarily interest charges from our outstanding debt) and asset\nbase (primarily depreciation, amortization and accretion) from our financial results. Management also believes\nAdjusted EBITDA is frequently used by investors or other interested parties in the evaluation of REITs. In addition,\nAdjusted EBITDA is similar to the measure of current financial performance generally used in our debt covenant\ncalculations. Adjusted EBITDA should be considered only as a supplement to net income computed in accordance\nwith GAAP as a measure of our performance;\n(3) FFO, AFFO and AFFO per share, which are metrics used by our public company peers in the\ncommunication site industry, provide investors useful indicators of the financial performance of our business and\npermit investors an additional tool to evaluate the performance of our business against those of our two principal\ncompetitors. FFO, AFFO, and AFFO per share are also used to address questions we receive from analysts and\ninvestors who routinely assess our operating performance on the basis of these performance measures, which are\nconsidered industry standards. We believe that FFO helps investors or other interested parties meaningfully evaluate\nfinancial performance by excluding the impact of our asset base (primarily depreciation, amortization and accretion\nand asset impairment and decommission costs). We believe that AFFO and AFFO per share help investors or other\ninterested parties meaningfully evaluate our financial performance as they include (1) the impact of our capital\nstructure (primarily interest expense on our outstanding debt) and (2) sustaining capital expenditures and exclude\nthe impact of (1) our asset base (primarily depreciation, amortization and accretion and asset impairment and\ndecommission costs) and (2) certain non-cash items, including straight-lined revenues and expenses related to fixed\nescalations and rent free periods and the non-cash portion of our reported tax provision. GAAP requires rental\nrevenues and expenses related to leases that contain specified rental increases over the life of the lease to be\nrecognized evenly over the life of the lease. In accordance with GAAP, if payment terms call for fixed escalations,\nor rent free periods, the revenue or expense is recognized on a straight-lined basis over the fixed, non-cancelable\nterm of the contract. We only use AFFO as a performance measure. AFFO should be considered only as a\nsupplement to net income computed in accordance with GAAP as a measure of our performance and should not be\nconsidered as an alternative to cash flows from operations or as residual cash flow available for discretionary\ninvestment. We believe our definition of FFO is consistent with how that term is defined by the National Association\nof Real Estate Investment Trusts (“NAREIT”) and that our definition and use of AFFO and AFFO per share is\nconsistent with those reported by the other communication site companies;\n(4) Our Non-GAAP Debt Measures provide investors a more complete understanding of our net debt and\nleverage position as they include the full principal amount of our debt which will be due at maturity and, to the\nextent that such measures are calculated on Net Debt are net of our cash and cash equivalents, short-term restricted\ncash, and short-term investments; and\n(5) Our Constant Currency Measures provide management and investors the ability to evaluate the performance\nof the business without the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.\nIn addition, Tower Cash Flow, Adjusted EBITDA, and our Non-GAAP Debt Measures are components of the\ncalculations used by our lenders to determine compliance with certain covenants under our Senior Credit Agreement\nand indentures relating to our 2020 Senior Notes and 2021 Senior Notes. These non-GAAP financial measures are\n12\nnot intended to be an alternative to any of the financial measures provided in our results of operations or our balance\nsheet as determined in accordance with GAAP.\nFinancial Metrics after Eliminating the Impact of Changes In Foreign Currency Exchange Rates\nWe eliminate the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates for each of the financial metrics listed in\nthe table below by dividing the current period’s financial results by the average monthly exchange rates of the prior\nyear period, and by eliminating the impact of the remeasurement of our intercompany loans. The table below\nprovides the reconciliation of the reported growth rate year-over-year of each of such measures to the growth rate\nafter eliminating the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates to such measure.\nFourth quarter\n2023 year Foreign Growth excluding\nover year currency foreign\ngrowth rate impact currency impact\nTotal site leasing revenue 4.3% 0.6% 3.7%\nTotal

          "content": "FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE\nSBA Communications Corporation Reports Fourth Quarter 2022 Results;\nProvides Full Year 2023 Outlook; and Declares Quarterly Cash Dividend\nBoca Raton, Florida, February 21, 2023 (BUSINESS NEWSWIRE) -- SBA Communications Corporation (Nasdaq:\nSBAC) (\"SBA\" or the \"Company\") today reported results for the quarter ended December 31, 2022.\nHighlights of the fourth quarter include:\n Net income of $102.6 million or $0.94 per share\n AFFO per share increased 11.0% over the prior year period\n Total revenue of $686.1 million, representing a 15.3% growth over the prior year period\n Portfolio growth of 15.0% for the year, including 2,792 sites added during the quarter\n Refinanced the 2018-1C Tower Securities making the next scheduled debt maturity October 2024\nIn addition, the Company announced today that its Board of Directors has declared a quarterly cash dividend of\n$0.85 per share of the Company’s Class A Common Stock, an increase of approximately 20% over the dividend\npaid in the fourth quarter. The distribution is payable March 24, 2023 to the shareholders of record at the close of\nbusiness on March 10, 2023.\n“We had a very solid finish to 2022, producing record annual results on a number of metrics and positioning us\nwell for 2023,” commented Jeffrey A. Stoops, President and Chief Executive Officer. “The US market remains\nactive, with our largest US customers expected to all stay relatively busy with additional network deployment in\n2023. We believe domestic activity will remain solid through 2023 and perhaps beyond, given the size and scope\nof our customers’ 5G deployment plans and our belief that much 5G work remains to be done on our assets.\nInternational results were strong as well in the fourth quarter, and gross leasing demand is expected to remain\nsolid internationally. Last year was a remarkable year in terms of portfolio growth and balance sheet management.\nWe grew our portfolio materially by 15%, providing us with additional growth assets in several markets. We were\nstill able to end the year with our balance sheet in great shape, below the low end of our target net debt/Adjusted\nEBITDA leverage ratio as we used AFFO to reduce floating-rate debt in a materially higher interest rate\nenvironment. All of these favorable results allowed us to increase AFFO per share by double-digit percentages in\nthe fourth quarter and for the full 2022 fiscal year over comparable prior periods. We are extremely confident and\nexcited about our future, so much so that we have just approved an increase to our quarterly dividend of\napproximately 20%. While a substantial increase, this dividend on an annual basis represents only approximately\n27% of our AFFO in our 2023 Outlook, leaving us substantial capital for additional investment in portfolio\ngrowth and stock repurchases and/or additional floating-rate leverage reduction while interest rates remain higher.\nWe believe we offer our shareholders very favorable prospects for additional value creation.”\n1\nOperating Results\nThe table below details select financial results for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and comparisons to\nthe prior year period.\n% Change\nexcluding\nQ4 2022 Q4 2021 $ Change % Change FX (1)\nConsolidated ($ in millions, except per share amounts)\nSite leasing revenue $ 609.6 $ 539.4 $ 70.2 13.0% 12.6%\nSite development revenue 76.5 55.9 20.6 36.9% 36.9%\nTower cash flow (1) 485.9 434.1 51.8 11.9% 11.5%\nNet income 102.6 48.9 53.7 109.8% 47.2%\nEarnings per share - diluted 0.94 0.44 0.50 113.6% 49.2%\nAdjusted EBITDA (1) 460.7 409.1 51.6 12.6% 12.2%\nAFFO (1) 340.7 310.8 29.9 9.6% 8.9%\nAFFO per share (1) 3.12 2.81 0.31 11.0% 10.3%\n(1) See the reconciliations and other disclosures under “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” later in this press release.\nTotal revenues in the fourth quarter of 2022 were $686.1 million compared to $595.3 million in the prior year\nperiod, an increase of 15.3%.

The Company may spend additional capital in 2023 on\n3\nacquiring revenue producing assets not yet identified or under contract, the impact of which is not reflected in the\n2023 guidance.

When compared to 2022 actual foreign currency exchange\nrates, these 2023 foreign currency rate assumptions negatively impacted the 2023 full year Outlook by\napproximately $11.0 million for leasing revenue, $7.7 million for Tower Cash Flow, $6.7 million for Adjusted\nEBITDA, and $6.0 million for AFFO.\n(in millions, except per share amounts) Full Year 2023\nSite leasing revenue (1) $ 2,469.0 to $ 2,489.0\nSite development revenue $ 205.0 to $ 225.0\nTotal revenues $ 2,674.0 to $ 2,714.0\nTower Cash Flow (2) $ 1,971.0 to $ 1,991.0\nAdjusted EBITDA (2) $ 1,845.0 to $ 1,865.0\nNet cash interest expense (3) $ 377.0 to $ 382.0\nNon-discretionary cash capital expenditures (4) $ 53.0 to $ 63.0\nAFFO (2) $ 1,366.0 to $ 1,406.0\nAFFO per share (2) (5) $ 12.46 to $ 12.83\nDiscretionary cash capital expenditures (6) $ 283.0 to $ 303.0\n(1) The Company’s Outlook for site leasing revenue includes revenue associated with pass through reimbursable expenses.\n(2) See the reconciliation of this non-GAAP financial measure presented below under “Non-GAAP Financial Measures.”\n(3) Net cash interest expense is defined as interest expense less interest income. Net cash interest expense does not include\namortization of deferred financing fees or non-cash interest expense.\n(4) Consists of tower maintenance and general corporate capital expenditures.\n(5) Outlook for AFFO per share is calculated by dividing the Company’s outlook for AFFO by an assumed weighted average\nnumber of diluted common shares of 109.6 million. Outlook does not include the impact of any potential future repurchases\nof the Company’s stock during 2023.\n(6) Consists of new tower builds, tower augmentations, communication site acquisitions and ground lease purchases.

The calculation of\nSegment operating profit for each of our segments is set forth below.\nDomestic Site Leasing Int'l Site Leasing Site Development\nFor the three months For the three months For the three months\nended December 31, ended December 31, ended December 31,\n2022 2021 2022 2021 2022 2021\n(in thousands)\nSegment revenue $ 452,928 $ 432,205 $ 156,680 $ 107,191 $ 76,486 $ 55,866\nSegment cost of revenues (excluding\ndepreciation, accretion, and amort.)

Management believes that Adjusted EBITDA helps investors or other interested parties\nmeaningfully evaluate and compare the results of our operations (1) from period to period and (2) to our competitors,\nby excluding the impact of our capital structure (primarily interest charges from our outstanding debt) and asset\nbase (primarily depreciation, amortization and accretion) from our financial results. Management also believes\nAdjusted EBITDA is frequently used by investors or other interested parties in the evaluation of REITs. In addition,\nAdjusted EBITDA is similar to the measure of current financial performance generally used in our debt covenant\ncalculations. Adjusted EBITDA should be considered only as a supplement to net income computed in accordance\nwith GAAP as a measure of our performance;\n(3) FFO, AFFO and AFFO per share, which are metrics used by our public company peers in the\ncommunication site industry, provide investors useful indicators of the financial performance of our business and\npermit investors an additional tool to evaluate the performance of our business against those of our two principal\ncompetitors. FFO, AFFO, and AFFO per share are also used to address questions we receive from analysts and\ninvestors who routinely assess our operating performance on the basis of these performance measures, which are\nconsidered industry standards. We believe that FFO helps investors or other interested parties meaningfully evaluate\nfinancial performance by excluding the impact of our asset base (primarily depreciation, amortization and accretion\nand asset impairment and decommission costs). We believe that AFFO and AFFO per share help investors or other\ninterested parties meaningfully evaluate our financial performance as they include (1) the impact of our capital\nstructure (primarily interest expense on our outstanding debt) and (2) sustaining capital expenditures and exclude\nthe impact of (1) our asset base (primarily depreciation, amortization and accretion and asset impairment and\ndecommission costs) and (2) certain non-cash items, including straight-lined revenues and expenses related to fixed\nescalations and rent free periods and the non-cash portion of our reported tax provision. GAAP requires rental\nrevenues and expenses related to leases that contain specified rental increases over the life of the lease to be\nrecognized evenly over the life of the lease. In accordance with GAAP, if payment terms call for fixed escalations,\nor rent free periods, the revenue or expense is recognized on a straight-lined basis over the fixed, non-cancelable\nterm of the contract. We only use AFFO as a performance measure. AFFO should be considered only as a\nsupplement to net income computed in accordance with GAAP as a measure of our performance and should not be\nconsidered as an alternative to cash flows from operations or as residual cash flow available for discretionary\ninvestment. We believe our definition of FFO is consistent with how that term is defined by the National Association\nof Real Estate Investment Trusts (“NAREIT”) and that our definition and use of AFFO and AFFO per share is\nconsistent with those reported by the other communication site companies;\n(4) Our Non-GAAP Debt Measures provide investors a more complete understanding of our net debt and\nleverage position as they include the full principal amount of our debt which will be due at maturity and, to the\nextent that such measures are calculated on Net Debt are net of our cash and cash equivalents, short-term restricted\ncash, and short-term investments; and\n(5) Our Constant Currency Measures provide management and investors the ability to evaluate the performance\nof the business without the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.\nIn addition, Tower Cash Flow, Adjusted EBITDA, and our Non-GAAP Debt Measures are components of the\ncalculations used by our lenders to determine compliance with certain covenants under our Senior Credit Agreement\nand indentures relating to our 2020 Senior Notes and 2021 Senior Notes. These non-GAAP financial measures are\n11\nnot intended to be an alternative to any of the financial measures provided in our results of operations or our balance\nsheet as determined in accordance with GAAP.\nFinancial Metrics after Eliminating the Impact of Changes In Foreign Currency Exchange Rates\nWe eliminate the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates for each of the financial metrics listed in\nthe table below by dividing the current period’s financial results by the average monthly exchange rates of the prior\nyear period, and by eliminating the impact of the remeasurement of our intercompany loans. The table below\nprovides the reconciliation of the reported growth rate year-over-year of each of such measures to the growth rate\nafter eliminating the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates to such measure.\nFourth quarter\n2022 year Foreign Growth excluding\nover year currency foreign\ngrowth rate impact currency impact\nTotal site leasing revenue 13.0% 0.4% 12.6%\nTotal

Estimates translated at foreign currency exchange rates based on guidance issued April 29, 2024.\n2. Non-cash straight-line revenue represents the difference between the revenue that we are required to recognize in accordance with GAAP for the period presented and the cash that we receive under the relevant lease for the\nperiod presented. For purposes of calculating 2024 and 2025 projections above, we assume only those escalators that are currently in place. For a more detailed discussion of our revenue recognition policy, please review our\n“Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” in our Form 10-K.\n3. Non-cash straight-line ground lease expense represents the difference between the ground lease expense that we are required to recognize in accordance with GAAP for the period presented and the cash that we actually pay\nunder the relevant ground lease for the period presented.

The table below provides the\nreconciliation of the reported growth rate year-over-year, of each of the measures included in the table, to the growth rate after eliminating the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates to\nsuch measure.\nWe believe that our Constant Currency Measures provide management and investors the ability to evaluate the performance of the business without the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations.\nFirst quarter Growth excluding\n2024 year over Foreign currency foreign currency\nyear growth rate impact impact\nTotal site leasing revenue 1.8% 0.3% 1.5%\nTotal cash site leasing revenue 2.3% 0.4% 1.9%\nInt'l cash site leasing revenue 2.8% 1.3% 1.5%\nTotal site leasing segment oper. profit 3.3% 0.4% 2.9%\nInt'l site leasing segment oper. profit 5.2% 1.7% 3.5%\nTotal site leasing tower cash flow 3.0% 0.4% 2.6%\nInt'l site leasing tower cash flow 4.3% 1.8% 2.5%\nNet income 53.6% (92.6%) 146.2%\nEarnings per share - diluted 53.6% (92.0%) 145.6%\nAdjusted EBITDA 1.3% 0.4% 0.9%\nAFFO 4.6% 0.6% 4.0%\nAFFO per share 5.1% 0.6% 4.5%\n17\nCash Site Leasing Revenue, Tower Cash Flow and\nTower Cash Flow Margin\nCash Site Leasing Revenue is defined as site leasing revenue less non-cash straight-line site leasing revenue. Tower Cash Flow is defined as Cash Site Leasing Revenue less site leasing cost of\nrevenues net of non-cash straight-line ground lease expense and Tower Cash Flow Margin is defined as Tower Cash Flow divided by Cash Site Leasing Revenue. We discuss these non-GAAP\nfinancial measures because we believe these items are indicators of performance of our site leasing operations. In addition, Tower Cash Flow is a component of the calculation used by our\nlenders to determine compliance with certain covenants under our Senior Credit Agreement. Neither Cash Site Leasing Revenue, Tower Cash Flow nor Tower Cash Flow Margin are intended to\nbe alternative measures of site leasing gross profit nor of site leasing gross profit margin as determined in accordance with GAAP.\nThe quarterly reconciliation of Cash Site Leasing Revenue and Tower Cash Flow and the calculation of Tower Cash Flow Margin is as follows:\n18\nS\nN\nS\nN\nite le

Annualized Adjusted EBITDA and\nAdjusted EBITDA Margin\nAdjusted EBITDA is defined as net income (loss) excluding the impact of interest expense, interest income, provision for or benefit from taxes, depreciation, accretion and amortization, asset\nimpairment and decommission costs, non-cash compensation, loss from extinguishment of debt, net, other (income) and expense, acquisition and new business initiatives related adjustments and\nexpenses, non-cash straight-line leasing revenue, and non-cash straight-line ground lease expense. Adjusted EBITDA excludes acquisition related costs which, pursuant to the adoption of new\nbusiness combination accounting guidance, are expensed and included within operating expenses. Annualized Adjusted EBITDA is calculated as Adjusted EBITDA for the most recent quarter\nmultiplied by four. Adjusted EBITDA Margin is defined as Adjusted EBITDA divided by the difference of total revenue minus non-cash straight-line leasing revenue.\nAdjusted EBITDA is useful to investors or other interested parties in evaluating our financial performance. Adjusted EBITDA is the primary measure used by management (1) to evaluate the\neconomic productivity of our operations and (2) for purposes of making decisions about allocating resources to, and assessing the performance of, our operations. Management believes that\nAdjusted EBITDA helps investors or other interested parties meaningfully evaluate and compare the results of our operations (1) from period to period and (2) to our competitors, by excluding the\nimpact of our capital structure (primarily interest charges from our outstanding debt) and asset base (primarily depreciation, amortization and accretion) from our financial results. Management also\nbelieves Adjusted EBITDA is frequently used by investors or other interested parties in the evaluation of REITs. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA is similar to the measure of current financial\nperformance generally used in our debt covenant calculations. Adjusted EBITDA should be considered only as a supplement to net income computed in accordance with GAAP as a measure of our\nperformance.\n23\nAdjusted EBITDA and Annualized Adjusted EBITDA\nThe quarterly reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA and the calculation of Annualized Adjusted EBITDA are as follows:\n3/31/2024 12/31/2023 9/30/2023 6/30/2023 3/31/2023 12/31/2022 9/30/2022 6/30/2022\n(in thousands)\nNet income $ 154,543 $ 109,528 $ 85,362 $ 201,970 $ 100,554 $ 102,580 $ 99,762 $ 69,151\nNon-cash straight-line leasing revenue (4,092) (3,828) (7,048) (7,480) (6,849) (9,133) (11,686) (9,846)\nNon-cash straight-line ground lease expense (3,383) (821) (428) (160) 723 401 478 721\nNon-cash compensation 21,469 22,089 21,374 18,252 26,206 25,769 25,492 23,900\nLoss from extinguishment of debt, net 4,428 — — — — 437 — —\nOther (income ) / expense 44,652 (33,090) 48,330 (40,732) (37,558) (8,207) 39,756 66,141\nAcquisition and new business initiatives related adjustments and\n7,417 5,049 5,612 4,953 6,057 8,031 6,844 6,829\nexpenses\nAsset impairment and decommission costs 43,648 77,067 33,063 32,867 26,390 17,596 8,532 8,521\nInterest income (7,314) (5,541) (5,266) (4,683) (2,816) (3,255) (2,858) (1,517)\nTotal interest expense (1) 110,122 109,894 112,317 113,850 120,453 116,861 103,444 100,766\nDepreciation, accretion and amortization 76,750 171,400 180,674 181,820 182,415 183,036 173,825 176,392\nProvision (benefit) for taxes (2) 17,172 28,914 8,141 (28,937) 43,765 26,604 3,170 (3,302)\nAdjusted EBITDA $ 465,412 $ 480,661 $ 482,131 $ 471,720 $ 459,340 $ 460,720 $ 446,759 $ 437,756\nAnnualized Adjusted EBITDA (3) $ 1,861,648 $ 1,922,644 $ 1,928,524 $ 1,886,880 $ 1,837,360 $ 1,842,880 $ 1,787,036 $ 1,751,024\n1.

Adjusted Funds From Operations, or AFFO, is defined as FFO adjusted to remove the impact of non-cash straight-line leasing revenue, non-cash straight-line ground\nlease expense, non-cash compensation, changes in the non-cash portion of our reported tax position, non-real estate related depreciation, amortization and accretion, amortization of deferred\nfinancing costs and debt discounts, loss from extinguishment of debt, net, other (income) and expense, acquisition and new business initiatives related adjustments and expenses, non-discretionary\ncash capital expenditures, and adjustments for unconsolidated joint ventures. AFFO Per Share is defined as AFFO divided by the weighted number of shares outstanding, adjusted to include the\ndilutive effect of stock options and restricted stock units.\nFFO, AFFO and AFFO per share, which are metrics used by our public company peers in the communication site industry, provide investors useful indicators of the financial performance of our\nbusiness and permit investors an additional tool to evaluate the performance of our business against those of our two principal competitors. FFO, AFFO, and AFFO per share are also used to\naddress questions we receive from analysts and investors who routinely assess our operating performance on the basis of these performance measures, which are considered industry standards.\nWe believe that FFO helps investors or other interested parties meaningfully evaluate financial performance by excluding the impact of our asset base (primarily depreciation, amortization and\naccretion). We believe that AFFO and AFFO per share help investors or other interested parties meaningfully evaluate our financial performance as they include (1) the impact of our capital structure\n(primarily interest expense on our outstanding debt) and (2) sustaining capital expenditures and exclude the impact of our (1) asset base (primarily depreciation, amortization and accretion) and (2)\ncertain non-cash items, including straight-lined revenues and expenses related to fixed escalations and rent free periods and the non-cash portion of our reported tax provision. GAAP requires rental\nrevenues and expenses related to leases that contain specified rental increases over the life of the lease to be recognized evenly over the life of the lease. In accordance with GAAP, if payment\nterms call for fixed escalations, or rent free periods, the revenue or expense is recognized on a straight-lined basis over the fixed, non-cancelable term of the contract. We only use AFFO as a\nperformance measure. AFFO should be considered only as a supplement to net income computed in accordance with GAAP as a measure of our performance and should not be considered as an\nalternative to cash flows from operations or as residual cash flow available for discretionary investment. We believe our definition of FFO is consistent with how that term is defined by the National\nAssociation of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“NAREIT”) and that our definition and use of AFFO and AFFO per share is consistent with those reported by the other communication site companies.\n29\nFunds From Operations, Adjusted Funds From Operations\nand Adjusted Funds From Operations Per Share\nThe annual calculation of Funds From Operations, Adjusted Funds From Operations and Adjusted Funds From Operations Per Share is as follows:\nFor the year ended\nDecember 31,\n2023 2022\n(in thousands) ($ per share) (in thousands) ($ per share)\nNet income $ 497,415 $ 4.57 $ 459,799 $ 4.20\nReal estate related depreciation, amortization, and accretion 709,832 6.52 702,937 6.44\nAsset impairment and decommission costs 169,387 1.56 43,160 0.39\nFFO $ 1,376,634 $ 12.65 $ 1,205,896 $ 11.03\nAdjustments to FFO:\nNon-cash straight-line leasing revenue (25,206) (0.24) (38,675) (0.34)\nNon-cash straight-line ground lease expense (686) (0.01) 2,653 0.02\nNon-cash compensation 87,919 0.81 99,909 0.91\nAdjustment for non-cash portion of tax provision (1) 20,354 0.19 32,901 0.30\nNon-real estate related depreciation, amortization, and accretion 6,477 0.06 4,639 0.04\nAmortization of deferred financing costs and debt discounts 56,141 0.52 65,944 0.60\nInterest deemed paid upon conversion of convertible notes — —\nLoss from extinguishment of debt, net — — 437 0.00\nOther (Income) Expense, Net (63,053) (0.58) (10,467) (0.10)\nAcquisition and new business initiatives related adjustments and\nexpenses 21,671 0.20 26,807 0.25\nNon-discretionary cash capital expenditures (56,078) (0.51) (50,327) (0.46)\nAFFO / AFFO per share $ 1,424,173 $ 13.08 $ 1,339,717 $ 12.25\nDiluted Weighted average number of common shares 108,907 109,386\nAFFO per share $ 13.08 $ 12.25\nNote: Annual numbers may not add up due to rounding\n1.

Net Secured Debt is defined as\nthe notional principal amount of outstanding secured debt minus cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and short-term restricted cash. Under GAAP policies, the notional principal\namount of the Company’s outstanding debt is not necessarily reflected on the face of the Company’s financial statements. Leverage Ratio is defined as Net Debt divided by Annualized Adjusted\nEBITDA. Secured Leverage Ratio is defined as Net Secured Debt divided by Annualized Adjusted EBITDA. Net cash interest coverage ratio is defined as Adjusted EBITDA divided by Net Cash\nInterest Expense. We believe that by including the full amount of the notional principal amount due at maturity for purposes of calculating net debt, and, to the extent that such measures are\ncalculated on net debt, by excluding cash and cash equivalents, it will provide investors a more complete understanding of our net debt and leverage position. We have included these non-GAAP\nfinancial measures because we believe these items are indicators of our financial condition, and they are used by our lenders to determine compliance with certain covenants under our Senior\nCredit Agreement, 2020 Senior Notes, and 2021 Senior Notes.\n33\nNet Debt and Leverage Ratio\nThe calculations of Net Debt and Leverage Ratio are as follows:\n3/31/2024\n(in thousands)\n2014-2C Tower Securities 620,000\n2019-1C Tower Securities 1 ,165,000\n2020-1C Tower Securities 750,000\n2020-2C Tower Securities 600,000\n2021-1C Tower Securities 1 ,165,000\n2021-2C Tower Securities 895,000\n2021-3C Tower Securities 895,000\n2022-1C Tower Securities 850,000\nRevolving Credit Facility 195,000\n2024 Term Loan 2 ,300,000\nTotal secured debt $ 9,435,000\n2020 Senior Notes 1 ,500,000\n2021 Senior Notes 1 ,500,000\nTotal unsecured debt $ 3,000,000\nTotal debt $ 12,435,000\nLess: Cash and cash equivalents, short-term restricted\ncash and short-term investments ( 261,786)\nNet debt $ 12,173,214\nDivided by: Annualized Adjusted EBITDA $ 1,861,648\nLeverage Ratio 6.5x\n34\nNet Debt and Leverage Ratio\nThe quarterly calculations of Net Debt and Leverage Ratio are as follows:\n35\nT\nL\na\nN\nD\nL\no ta l D e b t ( n o tio\ne s s : C a s h a n d\nn d s h o r t- te r m r\ne t D e b t\niv id e d b y : A n n u\ne v e r a g e R a tio\nn\nc\ne\na\na l)\na s h e q\ns tr ic te d\nliz e d A\nu iv\nc a\nd ju\na\ns\ns\nle\nh\nte\nn\nd\nts\nE\n, s h\nB IT\no\nD\nr\nA\nt- te r m in v e s tm e n ts\n3\n$ 1 2\n(\n$ 1 2\n$ 1\n/3\n,4\n2 6\n,1\n,8\n1\n3\n1\n7\n6\n/2 0 2\n5 ,0 0\n,7 8 6\n3 ,2 1\n1 ,6 4\n6 .5\n4\n0\n)\n4\n8\nx\n1 2\n$ 1 2\n(\n$ 1 2\n$ 1\n/3\n,3\n2 4\n,1\n,9\n1\n8\n7\n4\n2\n/2 0 2\n8 ,0 0\n,7 2 2\n0 ,2 7\n2 ,6 4\n6 .3\n3\n0\n)\n8\n4\nx\n9\n$ 1 2\n(\n$ 1 2\n$ 1\n/3\n,5\n2 2\n,3\n,9\n0\n8\n8\n5\n2\n/2 0 2\n4 ,0 0\n,9 0 7\n5 ,0 9\n8 ,5 2\n6 .4\n3\n0\n)\n3\n4\nx\n6\n$ 1 2\n(\n$ 1 2\n$ 1\n/3\n,6\n2 7\n,3\n,8\n0\n7\n3\n9\n8\n/2 0 2 3\n( in t h o\n0 ,0 0 0\n,6 2 5 )\n6 ,3 7 5\n6 ,8 8 0\n6 .6 x\n3\nu s a n d s\n$ 1 2\n(\n$ 1 2\n$ 1\n/3\n)\n,9\n1 9\n,7\n,8\n1\n0\n1\n0\n3\n/2 0 2\n1 ,0 0\n,2 5 1\n9 ,7 4\n7 ,3 6\n6 .9\n3\n0\n)\n9\n0\nx\n1 2\n$ 1 2\n(\n$ 1 2\n$ 1\n/3\n,9\n1 8\n,7\n,8\n1\n5\n6\n6\n4\n/2 0 2\n2 ,0 0\n,9 9 8\n5 ,0 0\n2 ,8 8\n6 .9\n2\n0\n)\n2\n0\nx\n9\n$ 1 2\n(\n$ 1 2\n$ 1\n/3\n,4\n2 9\n,1\n,7\n0\n3\n7\n4\n8\n/2 0 2\n8 ,0 0\n,5 1 6\n0 ,4 8\n7 ,0 3\n6 .8\n2\n0\n)\n4\n6\nx\n6\n$ 1 2\n(\n$ 1 2\n$ 1\n/3\n,5\n2 8\n,2\n,7\n0\n6\n8\n7\n5\n/2 0 2\n4 ,0 0\n,3 6 0\n5 ,6 4\n1 ,0 2\n7 .0\n2\n0\n)\n0\n4\nx\nNet Debt and Leverage Ratio\nThe quarterly calculations of Net Debt and Leverage Ratio are as follows:\n36\nT\nL\na\nN\nD\nL\no\ne\nn\ne\ni\ne\nt a l D\ns s : C\nd s h\nt D e\nv i d e d\nv e r a\ne b\na\no r\nb t\nb\ng e\nt (\ns h\nt -

Estimates translated at foreign currency exchange rates based on guidance issued July 29, 2024.\n2. Non-cash straight-line revenue represents the difference between the revenue that we are required to recognize in accordance with GAAP for the period presented and the cash that we receive under the relevant lease for the\nperiod presented. For purposes of calculating 2024 and 2025 projections above, we assume only those escalators that are currently in place. For a more detailed discussion of our revenue recognition policy, please review our\n“Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” in our Form 10-K.\n3. Non-cash straight-line ground lease expense represents the difference between the ground lease expense that we are required to recognize in accordance with GAAP for the period presented and the cash that we actually pay\nunder the relevant ground lease for the period presented. For purposes of calculating the 2024 and 2025 projections above, we assume only those escalators that are currently in place.

The table below provides the\nreconciliation of the reported growth rate year-over-year, of each of the measures included in the table, to the growth rate after eliminating the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates to\nsuch measure.\nWe believe that our Constant Currency Measures provide management and investors the ability to evaluate the performance of the business without the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations.\nSecond quarter Growth excluding\n2024 year over Foreign currency foreign currency\nyear growth rate impact impact\nTotal site leasing revenue 0.1% (1.1%) 1.2%\nTotal cash site leasing revenue 0.4% (1.1%) 1.5%\nInt'l cash site leasing revenue (2.9%) (4.2%) 1.3%\nTotal site leasing segment oper. profit 0.2% (0.9%) 1.1%\nInt'l site leasing segment oper. profit (3.5%) (3.8%) 0.3%\nTotal site leasing tower cash flow 0.1% (0.9%) 1.0%\nInt'l site leasing tower cash flow (2.4%) (3.9%) 1.5%\nNet income (21.0%) (51.4%) 30.4%\nEarnings per share - diluted (19.1%) (51.4%) 32.3%\nAdjusted EBITDA (1.0%) (0.9%) (0.1%)\nAFFO 0.4% (1.1%) 1.5%\nAFFO per share 1.5% (1.3%) 2.8%\n17\nCash Site Leasing Revenue, Tower Cash Flow and\nTower Cash Flow Margin\nCash Site Leasing Revenue is defined as site leasing revenue less non-cash straight-line site leasing revenue. Tower Cash Flow is defined as Cash Site Leasing Revenue less site leasing cost of\nrevenues net of non-cash straight-line ground lease expense and Tower Cash Flow Margin is defined as Tower Cash Flow divided by Cash Site Leasing Revenue. We discuss these non-GAAP\nfinancial measures because we believe these items are indicators of performance of our site leasing operations. In addition, Tower Cash Flow is a component of the calculation used by our\nlenders to determine compliance with certain covenants under our Senior Credit Agreement.

the impact of interest expense, interest income, provision for or benefit from taxes, depreciation, accretion and amortization, asset\nimpairment and decommission costs, non-cash compensation, loss from extinguishment of debt, net, other (income) and expense, acquisition and new business initiatives related adjustments and\nexpenses, non-cash straight-line leasing revenue, and non-cash straight-line ground lease expense. Adjusted EBITDA excludes acquisition related costs which, pursuant to the adoption of new\nbusiness combination accounting guidance, are expensed and included within operating expenses. Annualized Adjusted EBITDA is calculated as Adjusted EBITDA for the most recent quarter\nmultiplied by four. Adjusted EBITDA Margin is defined as Adjusted EBITDA divided by the difference of total revenue minus non-cash straight-line leasing revenue.\nAdjusted EBITDA is useful to investors or other interested parties in evaluating our financial performance. Adjusted EBITDA is the primary measure used by management (1) to evaluate the\neconomic productivity of our operations and (2) for purposes of making decisions about allocating resources to, and assessing the performance of, our operations. Management believes that\nAdjusted EBITDA helps investors or other interested parties meaningfully evaluate and compare the results of our operations (1) from period to period and (2) to our competitors, by excluding the\nimpact of our capital structure (primarily interest charges from our outstanding debt) and asset base (primarily depreciation, amortization and accretion) from our financial results. Management also\nbelieves Adjusted EBITDA is frequently used by investors or other interested parties in the evaluation of REITs. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA is similar to the measure of current financial\nperformance generally used in our debt covenant calculations.

Adjusted Funds From Operations, or AFFO, is defined as FFO adjusted to remove the impact of non-cash straight-line leasing revenue, non-cash straight-line ground\nlease expense, non-cash compensation, changes in the non-cash portion of our reported tax position, non-real estate related depreciation, amortization and accretion, amortization of deferred\nfinancing costs and debt discounts, loss from extinguishment of debt, net, other (income) and expense, acquisition and new business initiatives related adjustments and expenses, non-discretionary\ncash capital expenditures, and adjustments for unconsolidated joint ventures. AFFO Per Share is defined as AFFO divided by the weighted number of shares outstanding, adjusted to include the\ndilutive effect of stock options and restricted stock units.\nFFO, AFFO and AFFO per share, which are metrics used by our public company peers in the communication site industry, provide investors useful indicators of the financial performance of our\nbusiness and permit investors an additional tool to evaluate the performance of our business against those of our two principal competitors. FFO, AFFO, and AFFO per share are also used to\naddress questions we receive from analysts and investors who routinely assess our operating performance on the basis of these performance measures, which are considered industry standards.\nWe believe that FFO helps investors or other interested parties meaningfully evaluate financial performance by excluding the impact of our asset base (primarily depreciation, amortization and\naccretion). We believe that AFFO and AFFO per share help investors or other interested parties meaningfully evaluate our financial performance as they include (1) the impact of our capital structure\n(primarily interest expense on our outstanding debt) and (2) sustaining capital expenditures and exclude the impact of our (1) asset base (primarily depreciation, amortization and accretion) and (2)\ncertain non-cash items, including straight-lined revenues and expenses related to fixed escalations and rent free periods and the non-cash portion of our reported tax provision. GAAP requires rental\nrevenues and expenses related to leases that contain specified rental increases over the life of the lease to be recognized evenly over the life of the lease. In accordance with GAAP, if payment\nterms call for fixed escalations, or rent free periods, the revenue or expense is recognized on a straight-lined basis over the fixed, non-cancelable term of the contract. We only use AFFO as a\nperformance measure. AFFO should be considered only as a supplement to net income computed in accordance with GAAP as a measure of our performance and should not be considered as an\nalternative to cash flows from operations or as residual cash flow available for discretionary investment.

Net Secured Debt is defined as\nthe notional principal amount of outstanding secured debt minus cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and short-term restricted cash. Under GAAP policies, the notional principal\namount of the Company’s outstanding debt is not necessarily reflected on the face of the Company’s financial statements. Leverage Ratio is defined as Net Debt divided by Annualized Adjusted\nEBITDA. Secured Leverage Ratio is defined as Net Secured Debt divided by Annualized Adjusted EBITDA. Net cash interest coverage ratio is defined as Adjusted EBITDA divided by Net Cash\nInterest Expense. We believe that by including the full amount of the notional principal amount due at maturity for purposes of calculating net debt, and, to the extent that such measures are\ncalculated on net debt, by excluding cash and cash equivalents, it will provide investors a more complete understanding of our net debt and leverage position. We have included these non-GAAP\nfinancial measures because we believe these items are indicators of our financial condition, and they are used by our lenders to determine compliance with certain covenants under our Senior\nCredit Agreement, 2020 Senior Notes, and 2021 Senior Notes.\n33\nNet Debt and Leverage Ratio\nThe calculations of Net Debt and Leverage Ratio are as follows:\n6/30/2024\n(in thousands)\n2014-2C Tower Securities 620,000\n2019-1C Tower Securities 1 ,165,000\n2020-1C Tower Securities 750,000\n2020-2C Tower Securities 600,000\n2021-1C Tower Securities 1 ,165,000\n2021-2C Tower Securities 895,000\n2021-3C Tower Securities 895,000\n2022-1C Tower Securities 850,000\nRevolving Credit Facility 120,000\n2024 Term Loan 2 ,294,250\nTotal secured debt $ 9,354,250\n2020 Senior Notes 1 ,500,000\n2021 Senior Notes 1 ,500,000\nTotal unsecured debt $ 3,000,000\nTotal debt $ 12,354,250\nLess: Cash and cash equivalents, short-term restricted\ncash and short-term investments ( 309,382)\nNet debt $ 12,044,868\nDivided by: Annualized Adjusted EBITDA $ 1,868,256\nLeverage Ratio 6.4x\n34\nNet Debt and Leverage Ratio\nThe quarterly calculations of Net Debt and Leverage Ratio are as follows:\n35\nT\nL\ns\nN\nD\nL\no ta l D e b\ne s s : C a\nh o r t- te r m\ne t D e b t\niv id e d b\ne v e r a g e\nt ( n o tio n a l)\ns h a n d c a s h e q\nr e s tr ic te d c a s\ny : A n n u a liz e d A\nR a tio\nu\nh\nd\niv\nju\na\ns\nle\nte\nn\nd\nts\nE\n, s h\nB IT\no\nD\nr\nA\nt- te r m in v e s tm e n ts a n d\n6\n$ 1 2\n(\n$ 1 2\n$ 1\n/3\n,3\n3 0\n,0\n,8\n0\n5\n9\n4\n6\n/2 0 2\n4 ,2 5\n,3 8 2\n4 ,8 6\n8 ,2 5\n6 .4\n4\n0\n)\n8\n6\nx\n3\n$ 1 2\n(\n$ 1 2\n$ 1\n/3\n,4\n2 6\n,1\n,8\n1\n3\n1\n7\n6\n/2 0 2\n5 ,0 0\n,7 8 6\n3 ,2 1\n1 ,6 4\n6 .5\n4\n0\n)\n4\n8\nx\n1 2\n$ 1 2\n(\n$ 1 2\n$ 1\n/3\n,3\n2 4\n,1\n,9\n1\n8\n7\n4\n2\n/2 0 2\n8 ,0 0\n,7 2 2\n0 ,2 7\n2 ,6 4\n6 .3\n3\n0\n)\n8\n4\nx\n9\n$ 1 2\n(\n$ 1 2\n$ 1\n/3\n,5\n2 2\n,3\n,9\n0\n8\n8\n5\n2\n/2 0 2 3\n( in t h o\n4 ,0 0 0\n,9 0 7 )\n5 ,0 9 3\n8 ,5 2 4\n6 .4 x\n6\nu s a n d s\n$ 1 2\n(\n$ 1 2\n$ 1\n/3\n)\n,6\n2 7\n,3\n,8\n0\n7\n3\n9\n8\n/2 0 2\n0 ,0 0\n,6 2 5\n6 ,3 7\n6 ,8 8\n6 .6\n3\n0\n)\n5\n0\nx\n3\n$ 1 2\n(\n$ 1 2\n$ 1\n/3\n,9\n1 9\n,7\n,8\n1\n0\n1\n0\n3\n/2 0 2\n1 ,0 0\n,2 5 1\n9 ,7 4\n7 ,3 6\n6 .9\n3\n0\n)\n9\n0\nx\n1 2\n$ 1 2\n(\n$ 1 2\n$ 1\n/3\n,9\n1 8\n,7\n,8\n1\n5\n6\n6\n4\n/2 0 2\n2 ,0 0\n,9 9 8\n5 ,0 0\n2 ,8 8\n6 .9\n2\n0\n)\n2\n0\nx\n9\n$ 1 2\n(\n$ 1 2\n$ 1\n/3\n,4\n2 9\n,1\n,7\n0\n3\n7\n4\n8\n/2 0 2\n8 ,0 0\n,5 1 6\n0 ,4 8\n7 ,0 3\n6 .8\n2\n0\n)\n4\n6\nx\nNet Debt and Leverage Ratio\nThe quarterly calculations of Net Debt and Leverage Ratio are as follows:\n36\nT\nL\ns\nN\nD\nL\no\ne\nh\ne\ni\ne\nt a l D e b\ns s : C a\no r t -

Estimates translated at foreign currency exchange rates based on guidance issued October 28, 2024.\n2. Non-cash straight-line revenue represents the difference between the revenue that we are required to recognize in accordance with GAAP for the period presented and the cash that we receive under the relevant lease for the\nperiod presented. For purposes of calculating 2024 and 2025 projections above, we assume only those escalators that are currently in place. For a more detailed discussion of our revenue recognition policy, please review our\n“Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” in our Form 10-K.\n3. Non-cash straight-line ground lease expense represents the difference between the ground lease expense that we are required to recognize in accordance with GAAP for the period presented and the cash that we actually pay\nunder the relevant ground lease for the period presented. For purposes of calculating the 2024 and 2025 projections above, we assume only those escalators that are currently in place.For a more detailed discussion of our revenue\nrecognition policy, please review our “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” in our Form 10-K.\n14\nC\nN\nN\nD\nN\nN\nIn\nN\nN\no\no\no\no\no\no\nt\no\no\nn\nn\nn\nm\nn\nn\ne\nn\nn\ns o lid a t e\n- c a s h s tr\n- c a s h s tr\ne s t ic\n- c a s h s tr\n- c a s h s tr\nr n a t io n a\n- c a s h s tr\n- c a s h s tr\nd\na\na\na\na\nl\na\na\nig\nig\nig\nig\nig\nig\nh\nh\nh\nh\nh\nh\nt-\nt-\nt-\nt-\nt-\nt-\nlin\nlin\nlin\nlin\nlin\nlin\ne\ne\ne\ne\ne\ne\nr\ng\nr\ng\nr\ng\ne\nr\ne\nr\ne\nr\nv\no\nv\no\nv\no\ne\nu\ne\nu\ne\nu\nn\nn\nn\nn\nn\nn\nu\nd\nu\nd\nu\nd\ne\nle\ne\nle\ne\nle\n(2\na\n(2\na\n(2\na\n)\ns\n)\ns\n)\ns\ne\ne\ne\ne\ne\ne\nx\nx\nx\np\np\np\ne\ne\ne\nn\nn\nn\ns\ns\ns\ne\ne\ne\n(3\n(3\n(3\n)\n)\n)\n$\n$\n$\n2 0 2 5 E\n( 1 1\n( 1 6\n( 1 6\n( 1 6\n4\n(1\n,7\n,6\n,3\n,5\n,6\n( 1\n)\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n)\n)\n)\n)\n)\n$\n$\n$\n2 0 2 4 E\n9\n( 8\n9\n( 1 1\n3\n(1\n,1\n,7\n,9\n,7\n( 8\n,0\n)\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n)\n)\n)\n$\n$\n$\nF\n2 0 2 3\n2 5 ,2\n( 6\n2 7 ,0\n( 3 ,7\n( 1 ,8\n3 ,0\no\n0\n8\n2\n0\n2\n1\nr\nD\n6\n6\n6\n5\n0\n9\n)\n)\n)\nt\ne\nh e y e a r\nc e m b e\n2 0 2 2\n(in th o u s a n\n$ 3 8 ,2\n2 ,4\n$ 4 1 ,7\n7\n$ ( 3 ,5\n1 ,6\ne\nr\nd\n0\n1\n6\n7\n5\n4\n3\ns\n6\n9\n3\n9\n7\n0\nn\n1\n)\n)\nd e d\n,\n2 0 2\n$ 3\n$ 3\n$ (\n1\n0\n7\n3\n6\n3\n1\n,1\n,7\n,8\n,1\n,6\n,5\n1\n6\n1\n7\n9\n8\n7\n6\n4\n8\n7\n8\n)\n$\n$\n$\n2 0 2 0\n3 ,4\n1 3 ,9\n5 ,7\n1 2 ,0\n( 2 ,2\n1 ,8\n7\n5\n3\n7\n5\n8\n5\n4\n3\n1\n8\n4\n)\n$\n$\n$\n2 0 1 9\n2 ,6\n6 ,0\n1 ,6\n5 ,6\n1 ,0\n4\n4\n8\n0\n6\n4\n2\n5\n9\n3\n3\n2\n6\nSegment Profitability\nSegment Operating Profit and Segment Operating Profit Margin for the Three Months are as follows:\n15\nS\nS\ne g m\ne g m\nd e p\na m\nS\nS\ne n t r e v e n u e\ne n t c o s t o f r\nr e c ia tio n , a c\no r tiz a tio n )\ne g m e n t o p e r\ne g m e n t o p e r\ne\nc\na\na\nv e\nr e\ntin\ntin\nn u e s ( e x\ntio n , a n d\ng p r o fit\ng p r o fit m\nc lu\na r\nd\ng\nin\nin\ng\n$\n$\nD o m e s t ic S\nF o r t h e t h r\ne n d e d S e p\n2 0 2 4\n4 6 4 ,8 6 0\n( 6 8 ,9 0 8 )\n3 9 5 ,9 5 2\n8 5 .2 %\nit e\ne e\nt e\n$\nL\nm\nm b\n$\ne a s in g\no n t h s\ne r 3 0 ,\n2 0 2 3\n4 6 8 ,3 7\n( 6 6 ,7 6\n4 0 1 ,6 0\n8 5 .7\n1\n8\n3\n%\n)\n$\n$\nIn t 'l S it e L e a\nF o r t h e t h r e e m\ne n d e d S e p t e m\n2 0 2 4\n1 6 0 ,8 3 7 $\n( 4 9 ,0 4 0 )\n1 1 1 ,7 9 7 $\n6 9 .5 %\ns in g\no n t h s\nb e r 3 0 ,\n2 0 2 3\n( in t\n1 6 9 ,0 6\n( 5 1 ,5 0\n1 1 7 ,5 6\n6 9 .5\nh\n9\n9\n0\n%\no\n)\nu s a\n$\n$\nn\nT\nF o\ne n\n2 0\nd s )\n6\n( 1\n5\no t a l S it e\nr t h e t h r\nd e d S e p\n2 4\n2 5 ,6 9 7\n1 7 ,9 4 8 )\n0 7 ,7 4 9\n8 1 .1 %\nL e a s in\ne e m o n\nt e m b e r\n2 0\n$ 6\n( 1\n$ 5\ng\nt h\n3\n2\n3\n1\n1\ns\n0\n3\n7\n8\n9\n8\n,\n,4 4\n,2 7\n,1 6\n1 .4\n0\n7\n3\n%\n)\n$\n$\nS it e D e v e\nF o r t h e t h r e\ne n d e d S e p t\n2 0 2 4\n4 1 ,8 9 8\n( 3 2 ,3 9 1 )\n9 ,5 0 7\n2 2 .7 %\nlo p\ne m\ne m\n$\n$\nm e n t\no n t h s\nb e r 3 0 ,\n2 0 2 3\n4 5 ,1 0\n( 3 1 ,4 9\n1 3 ,6 1\n3 0 .2\n4\n3\n1\n%\n)\nAPPENDIX OF NON-GAAP\nRECONCILIATIONS\nConstant Currency Measures\nWe eliminate the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates for each of the following financial metrics (collectively, our “Constant Currency Measures”) by dividing the current period’s\nfinancial results by the average monthly exchange rates of the prior year period and by eliminating the impact of the remeasurement of our intercompany loans. The table below provides the\nreconciliation of the reported growth rate year-over-year, of each of the measures included in the table, to the growth rate after eliminating the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates to\nsuch measure.\nWe believe that our Constant Currency Measures provide management and investors the ability to evaluate the performance of the business without the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations.\nThird quarter Growth excluding\n2024 year over Foreign currency foreign currency\nyear growth rate impact impact\nTotal site leasing revenue (1.8%) (2.1%) 0.3%\nTotal cash site leasing revenue (0.9%) (2.1%) 1.2%\nInt'l cash site leasing revenue (5.1%) (7.9%) 2.8%\nTotal site leasing segment oper. profit (2.2%) (1.8%) (0.4%)\nInt'l site leasing segment oper. profit (4.9%) (7.9%) 3.0%\nTotal site leasing tower cash flow (0.8%) (1.9%) 1.1%\nInt'l site leasing tower cash flow (4.2%) (8.0%) 3.8%\nNet income 199.6% 92.7% 106.9%\nEarnings per share - diluted 198.4% 89.1% 109.3%\nAdjusted EBITDA (2.0%) (1.8%) (0.2%)\nAFFO (1.6%) (2.3%) 0.7%\nAFFO per share (0.6%) (2.4%) 1.8%\n17\nCash Site Leasing Revenue, Tower Cash Flow and\nTower Cash Flow Margin\nCash Site Leasing Revenue is defined as site leasing revenue less non-cash straight-line site leasing revenue. Tower Cash Flow is defined as Cash Site Leasing Revenue less site leasing cost of\nrevenues net of non-cash straight-line ground lease expense and Tower Cash Flow Margin is defined as Tower Cash Flow divided by Cash Site Leasing Revenue. We discuss these non-GAAP\nfinancial measures because we believe these items are indicators of performance of our site leasing operations. In addition, Tower Cash Flow is a component of the calculation used by our\nlenders to determine compliance with certain covenants under our Senior Credit Agreement. Neither Cash Site Leasing Revenue, Tower Cash Flow nor Tower Cash Flow Margin are intended to\nbe alternative measures of site leasing gross profit nor of site leasing gross profit margin as determined in accordance with GAAP.\nThe quarterly reconciliation of Cash Site Leasing Revenue and Tower Cash Flow and the calculation of Tower Cash Flow Margin is as follows:\nDomestic Site Leasing

Annualized Adjusted EBITDA is calculated as Adjusted EBITDA for the most recent quarter\nmultiplied by four. Adjusted EBITDA Margin is defined as Adjusted EBITDA divided by the difference of total revenue minus non-cash straight-line leasing revenue.\nAdjusted EBITDA is useful to investors or other interested parties in evaluating our financial performance. Adjusted EBITDA is the primary measure used by management (1) to evaluate the\neconomic productivity of our operations and (2) for purposes of making decisions about allocating resources to, and assessing the performance of, our operations. Management believes that\nAdjusted EBITDA helps investors or other interested parties meaningfully evaluate and compare the results of our operations (1) from period to period and (2) to our competitors, by excluding the\nimpact of our capital structure (primarily interest charges from our outstanding debt) and asset base (primarily depreciation, amortization and accretion) from our financial results. Management also\nbelieves Adjusted EBITDA is frequently used by investors or other interested parties in the evaluation of REITs. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA is similar to the measure of current financial\nperformance generally used in our debt covenant calculations. Adjusted EBITDA should be considered only as a supplement to net income computed in accordance with GAAP as a measure of our\nperformance.\n23\nAdjusted EBITDA and Annualized Adjusted EBITDA\nThe quarterly reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA and the calculation of Annualized Adjusted EBITDA are as follows:\n1. Total interest expense includes interest expense, non-cash interest expense, and amortization of deferred financing fees\n2. These amounts include Franchise and Gross receipt taxes which are reflected in the Statements of Operations in selling, general and administrative expenses\n3. Annualized Adjusted EBITDA is calculated as Adjusted EBITDA for the most recent quarter multiplied by four\n24\nN\nN\nN\nN\nL\nO\nA\nA\nIn\nT\nD\nP\nA\nA\ne t in c o m e\no n - c a s h s tr a ig h t- lin e le a s in g r e v e n u\no n - c a s h s tr a ig h t- lin e g r o u n d le a s e e\no n - c a s h c o m p e n s a tio n\no s s fr o m e x tin g u is h m e n t o f d e b t, n e\nth e r ( in c o m e ) / e x p e n s e\nc q u is itio n a n d n e w b u s in e s s in itia tiv\ns s e t im p a ir m e n t a n d d e c o m m is s io n\nte r e s t in c o m e\n(1 )o ta l in te r e s t e x p e n s e\ne p r e c ia tio n , a c c r e tio n a n d a m o r tiz a\n(2 )r o v is io n ( b e n e fit) fo r ta x e s\nd ju s te d E B IT D A\n(3 )n n u a liz e d A d ju s te d E B IT D A\ne\nx p\nt\ne s\nc\ntio\ne n\nr e\no s\nn\ns\nla\nts\ne\nte d a d ju s tm e n ts a n d e x p e n s e s\n9 /3 0 /2 0 2 4\n$ 2 5 5 ,8 9\n( 1 ,0 6 5\n9 4\n1 6 ,3 7\n—\n( 2 3 ,7 0 0\n5 ,3 8\n1 2 ,6 7\n( 6 ,9 9 9\n1 0 8 ,0 8\n6 3 ,5 1\n4 1 ,5 1\n$ 4 7 2 ,6 2\n$ 1 ,8 9 0 ,4 8\n1\n)\n5\n3\n)\n8\n0\n)\n8\n5\n4\n0\n0\n6 /3 0 /2 0 2 4\n$ 1 5 9 ,4 5\n( 5 ,4 6 6\n( 2 ,9 8 8\n1 8 ,5 9\n—\n1 0 4 ,8 5\n6 ,5 7\n3 1 ,6 1\n( 7 ,0 4 6\n1 0 9 ,5 4\n6 4 ,1 7\n( 1 2 ,2 5 0\n$ 4 6 7 ,0 6\n$ 1 ,8 6 8 ,2 5\n2\n)\n)\n8\n9\n4\n0\n)\n2\n9\n)\n4\n6\n3 /3 1 /2 0 2 4\n$ 1 5 4 ,5\n( 4 ,0 9\n( 3 ,3 8\n2 1 ,4\n4 ,4\n4 4 ,6\n7 ,4\n4 3 ,6\n( 7 ,3 1\n1 1 0 ,1\n7 6 ,7\n1 7 ,1\n$ 4 6 5 ,4\n$ 1 ,8 6 1 ,6\n4\n2\n3\n6\n2\n5\n1\n4\n4\n2\n5\n7\n1\n4\n3\n)\n)\n9\n8\n2\n7\n8\n)\n2\n0\n2\n2\n8\n1 2 /3 1 /2 0 2 3\n( in t h\n$ 1 0 9 ,5 2\n( 3 ,8 2 8\n( 8 2 1\n2 2 ,0 8\n—\n( 3 3 ,0 9 0\n5 ,0 4\n7 7 ,0 6\n( 5 ,5 4 1\n1 0 9 ,8 9\n1 7 1 ,4 0\n2 8 ,9 1\n$ 4 8 0 ,6 6\n$ 1 ,9 2 2 ,6 4\no\n8\n)\n)\n9\n)\n9\n7\n)\n4\n0\n4\n1\n4\n9 /3 0 /2 0 2 3\nu s a n d s )\n$ 8 5 ,3 6\n( 7 ,0 4 8\n( 4 2 8\n2 1 ,3 7\n—\n4 8 ,3 3\n5 ,6 1\n3 3 ,0 6\n( 5 ,2 6 6\n1 1 2 ,3 1\n1 8 0 ,6 7\n8 ,1 4\n$ 4 8 2 ,1 3\n$ 1 ,9 2 8 ,5 2\n2\n)\n)\n4\n0\n2\n3\n)\n7\n4\n1\n1\n4\n6 /3 0 /2 0 2 3\n$ 2 0 1 ,9 7\n( 7 ,4 8 0\n( 1 6 0\n1 8 ,2 5\n—\n( 4 0 ,7 3 2\n4 ,9 5\n3 2 ,8 6\n( 4 ,6 8 3\n1 1 3 ,8 5\n1 8 1 ,8 2\n( 2 8 ,9 3 7\n$ 4 7 1 ,7 2\n$ 1 ,8 8 6 ,8 8\n0\n)\n)\n2\n)\n3\n7\n)\n0\n0\n)\n0\n0\n3 /3 1 /2 0 2 3\n$ 1 0 0 ,5 5\n( 6 ,8 4 9\n7 2\n2 6 ,2 0\n—\n( 3 7 ,5 5 8\n6 ,0 5\n2 6 ,3 9\n( 2 ,8 1 6\n1 2 0 ,4 5\n1 8 2 ,4 1\n4 3 ,7 6\n$ 4 5 9 ,3 4\n$ 1 ,8 3 7 ,3 6\n4\n)\n3\n6\n)\n7\n0\n)\n3\n5\n5\n0\n0\n1 2 /3 1 /2 0 2 2\n$ 1 0 2 ,5\n( 9 ,1 3\n4\n2 5 ,7\n4\n( 8 ,2 0\n8 ,0\n1 7 ,5\n( 3 ,2 5\n1 1 6 ,8\n1 8 3 ,0\n2 6 ,6\n$ 4 6 0 ,7\n$ 1 ,8 4 2 ,8\n8\n3\n0\n6\n3\n7\n3\n9\n5\n6\n3\n0\n2\n8\n0\n)\n1\n9\n7\n)\n1\n6\n)\n1\n6\n4\n0\n0\nAdjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin\nThe quarterly calculation of Adjusted EBITDA Margin is as follows:\n9/30/2024 6/30/2024 3/31/2024 12/31/2023 9/30/2023 6/30/2023 3/31/2023 12/31/2022\n(in thousands)\nTotal revenues $ 667,595 $ 660,477 $ 657,862 $ 675,024 $ 682,544 $ 678,500 $ 675,516 $ 686,094\nNon-cash straight-line leasing revenue (1,065) (5,466) (4,092) (3,828) (7,048) (7,480) (6,849) (9,133)\nTotal revenues minus non-cash\nstraight-line leasing revenue $ 666,530 $ 655,011 $ 653,770 $ 671,196 $ 675,496 $ 671,020 $ 668,667 $ 676,961\nAdjusted EBITDA $ 472,620 $ 467,064 $ 465,412 $ 480,661 $ 482,131 $ 471,720 $ 459,340 $ 460,720\nAdjusted EBITDA Margin 70.9% 71.3% 71.2% 71.6% 71.4% 70.3% 68.7% 68.1%\nPass-through reimbursable expenses $ 45,631 $ 45,959 $ 46,983 $ 49,140 $ 48,939 $ 49,386 $ 48,196 $ 46,395\nTotal revenues minus non-cash straight-line leasing revenue minus pass-\n$ 620,899 $ 609,052 $ 606,787 $ 622,056 $ 626,557 $ 621,634 $ 620,471 $ 630,566\nthrough reimbursable expenses\nAdjusted EBITDA Margin minus pass-through reimbursable expenses 76.1% 76.7% 76.7% 77.3% 76.9% 75.9% 74.0% 73.1%\n25\nAdjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin\nThe annual reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA is as follows:\nFor the year ended\nDecember 31,\n2023 2022 2021 2020 2019\n(in thousands)\nNet income $ 497,415 $ 459,799 $ 237,624 $ 24,047 $ 147,284\nNon-cash straight-line leasing revenue (25,206) (38,675) (30,117) (3,475) (12,368)\nNon-cash straight-line ground lease expense (686) 2,653 7,766 13,955 19,944\nNon-cash compensation 87,919 99,909 84,402 68,890 73,214\nLoss from extinguishment of debt, net — 437 39,502 19,463 457\nOther (income ) / expense (63,053) (10,467) 74,284 222,159 (14,053)\nAcquisition and new business initiatives related adjustments and expenses 21,671 26,807 27,621 16,582 15,228\nAsset impairment and decommission costs 169,387 43,160 33,044 40,097 33,103\nInterest income (18,305) (10,133) (3,448) (2,981) (5,500)\nTotal interest expense (1) 456,514 419,728 419,593 412,802 415,695\nDepreciation, accretion and amortization 716,309 707,576 700,161 721,970 697,078\nProvision (benefit) for taxes (2) 51,885 68,183 15,847 (40,895) 40,548\nAdjusted EBITDA $ 1,893,850 $ 1,768,977 $ 1,606,279 $ 1,492,614 $ 1,410,630\nNote: Annual numbers may not add up due to rounding\n1.

Adjusted Funds From Operations, or AFFO, is defined as FFO adjusted to remove the impact of non-cash straight-line leasing revenue, non-cash straight-line ground\nlease expense, non-cash compensation, changes in the non-cash portion of our reported tax position, non-real estate related depreciation, amortization and accretion, amortization of deferred\nfinancing costs and debt discounts, loss from extinguishment of debt, net, other (income) and expense, acquisition and new business initiatives related adjustments and expenses, non-discretionary\ncash capital expenditures, and adjustments for unconsolidated joint ventures. AFFO Per Share is defined as AFFO divided by the weighted number of shares outstanding, adjusted to include the\ndilutive effect of stock options and restricted stock units.\nFFO, AFFO and AFFO per share, which are metrics used by our public company peers in the communication site industry, provide investors useful indicators of the financial performance of our\nbusiness and permit investors an additional tool to evaluate the performance of our business against those of our two principal competitors. FFO, AFFO, and AFFO per share are also used to\naddress questions we receive from analysts and investors who routinely assess our operating performance on the basis of these performance measures, which are considered industry standards.\nWe believe that FFO helps investors or other interested parties meaningfully evaluate financial performance by excluding the impact of our asset base (primarily depreciation, amortization and\naccretion). We believe that AFFO and AFFO per share help investors or other interested parties meaningfully evaluate our financial performance as they include (1) the impact of our capital structure\n(primarily interest expense on our outstanding debt) and (2) sustaining capital expenditures and exclude the impact of our (1) asset base (primarily depreciation, amortization and accretion) and (2)\ncertain non-cash items, including straight-lined revenues and expenses related to fixed escalations and rent free periods and the non-cash portion of our reported tax provision. GAAP requires rental\nrevenues and expenses related to leases that contain specified rental increases over the life of the lease to be recognized evenly over the life of the lease. In accordance with GAAP, if payment\nterms call for fixed escalations, or rent free periods, the revenue or expense is recognized on a straight-lined basis over the fixed, non-cancelable term of the contract. We only use AFFO as a\nperformance measure. AFFO should be considered only as a supplement to net income computed in accordance with GAAP as a measure of our performance and should not be considered as an\nalternative to cash flows from operations or as residual cash flow available for discretionary investment. We believe our definition of FFO is consistent with how that term is defined by the National\nAssociation of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“NAREIT”) and that our definition and use of AFFO and AFFO per share is consistent with those reported by the other communication site companies.\n29\nFunds From Operations, Adjusted Funds From Operations\nand Adjusted Funds From Operations Per Share\nThe annual calculation of Funds From Operations, Adjusted Funds From Operations and Adjusted Funds From Operations Per Share is as follows:\nFor the year ended\nDecember 31,\n2023 2022\n(in thousands) ($ per share) (in thousands) ($ per share)\nNet income $ 497,415 $ 4.57 $ 459,799 $ 4.20\nReal estate related depreciation, amortization, and accretion 709,832 6.52 702,937 6.44\nAsset impairment and decommission costs 169,387 1.56 43,160 0.39\nFFO $ 1,376,634 $ 12.65 $ 1,205,896 $ 11.03\nAdjustments to FFO:\nNon-cash straight-line leasing revenue (25,206) (0.24) (38,675) (0.34)\nNon-cash straight-line ground lease expense (686) (0.01) 2,653 0.02\nNon-cash compensation 87,919 0.81 99,909 0.91\nAdjustment for non-cash portion of tax provision (1) 20,354 0.19 32,901 0.30\nNon-real estate related depreciation, amortization, and accretion 6,477 0.06 4,639 0.04\nAmortization of deferred financing costs and debt discounts 56,141 0.52 65,944 0.60\nInterest deemed paid upon conversion of convertible notes — —\nLoss from extinguishment of debt, net — — 437 0.00\nOther (Income) Expense, Net (63,053) (0.58) (10,467) (0.10)\nAcquisition and new business initiatives related adjustments and\nexpenses 21,671 0.20 26,807 0.25\nNon-discretionary cash capital expenditures (56,078) (0.51) (50,327) (0.46)\nAFFO / AFFO per share $ 1,424,173 $ 13.08 $ 1,339,717 $ 12.25\nDiluted Weighted average number of common shares 108,907 109,386\nNote: Annual numbers may not add up due to rounding\n1.

Net Secured Debt is defined as\nthe notional principal amount of outstanding secured debt minus cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and short-term restricted cash. Under GAAP policies, the notional principal\namount of the Company’s outstanding debt is not necessarily reflected on the face of the Company’s financial statements. Leverage Ratio is defined as Net Debt divided by Annualized Adjusted\nEBITDA. Secured Leverage Ratio is defined as Net Secured Debt divided by Annualized Adjusted EBITDA. Net cash interest coverage ratio is defined as Adjusted EBITDA divided by Net Cash\nInterest Expense. We believe that by including the full amount of the notional principal amount due at maturity for purposes of calculating net debt, and, to the extent that such measures are\ncalculated on net debt, by excluding cash and cash equivalents, it will provide investors a more complete understanding of our net debt and leverage position. We have included these non-GAAP\nfinancial measures because we believe these items are indicators of our financial condition, and they are used by our lenders to determine compliance with certain covenants under our Senior\nCredit Agreement, 2020 Senior Notes, and 2021 Senior Notes.\n33\nNet Debt and Leverage Ratio\nThe calculations of Net Debt and Leverage Ratio are as follows:\n9/30/2024\n(in thousands)\n2014-2C Tower Securities 620,000\n2019-1C Tower Securities 1,165,000\n2020-1C Tower Securities 750,000\n2020-2C Tower Securities 600,000\n2021-1C Tower Securities 1,165,000\n2021-2C Tower Securities 895,000\n2021-3C Tower Securities 895,000\n2022-1C Tower Securities 850,000\nRevolving Credit Facility 160,000\n2024 Term Loan 2,288,500\nTotal secured debt $ 9,388,500\n2020 Senior Notes 1,500,000\n2021 Senior Notes 1,500,000\nTotal unsecured debt $ 3,000,000\nTotal debt $ 12,388,500\nLess: Cash and cash equivalents, short-term restricted cash\nand short-term investments (263,603)\nNet debt $ 12,124,897\nDivided by: Annualized Adjusted EBITDA $ 1,890,480\nLeverage Ratio 6.4x\n34\nNet Debt and Leverage Ratio\nThe quarterly calculations of Net Debt and Leverage Ratio are as follows:\n35\nT o ta l D e b t ( n o tio n\nL e s s : C a s h a n d cte\nr m r e s tr ic te d c a\nN e t D e b t\nD iv id e d b y : A n n u a\nL e v e r a g e R a tio\na l)\na s hs\nh\nliz e\ne q\nd A\nu\nd\niv\nju\na\ns\nle\nte\nn\nd\nts\nE\n, s\nB\nh\nIT\no\nD\nr t-\nA\nte r m in v e s tm e n ts a n d s h o r t-\n9\n$ 1 2\n(\n$ 1 2\n$ 1\n/3\n,3\n2 6\n,1\n,8\n0\n8\n3\n2\n9\n/2 0 2\n8 ,5 0\n,6 0 3\n4 ,8 9\n0 ,4 8\n6 .4\n4\n0\n)\n7\n0\nx\n6\n$ 1 2\n(\n$ 1 2\n$ 1\n/3\n,3\n3 0\n,0\n,8\n0\n5\n9\n4\n6\n/2 0 2\n4 ,2 5\n,3 8 2\n4 ,8 6\n8 ,2 5\n6 .4\n4\n0\n)\n8\n6\nx\n3\n$ 1 2\n(\n$ 1 2\n$ 1\n/3\n,4\n2 6\n,1\n,8\n1\n3\n1\n7\n6\n/2 0 2\n5 ,0 0\n,7 8 6\n3 ,2 1\n1 ,6 4\n6 .5\n4\n0\n)\n4\n8\nx\n1 2\n$ 1 2\n(\n$ 1 2\n$ 1\n/3\n,3\n2 4\n,1\n,9\n1 /2 0 2 3\n( in t h o\n8 8 ,0 0 0\n7 ,7 2 2 )\n4 0 ,2 7 8\n2 2 ,6 4 4\n6 .3 x\n9\nu s a n d s )\n$ 1 2\n(\n$ 1 2\n$ 1\n/3\n,5\n2 2\n,3\n,9\n0\n8\n8\n5\n2\n/2 0 2\n4 ,0 0\n,9 0 7\n5 ,0 9\n8 ,5 2\n6 .4\n3\n0\n)\n3\n4\nx\n6\n$ 1 2\n(\n$ 1 2\n$ 1\n/3\n,6\n2 7\n,3\n,8\n0\n7\n3\n9\n8\n/2 0 2\n0 ,0 0\n,6 2 5\n6 ,3 7\n6 ,8 8\n6 .6\n3\n0\n)\n5\n0\nx\n3\n$ 1 2\n(\n$ 1 2\n$ 1\n/3\n,9\n1 9\n,7\n,8\n1\n0\n1\n0\n3\n/2 0 2\n1 ,0 0\n,2 5 1\n9 ,7 4\n7 ,3 6\n6 .9\n3\n0\n)\n9\n0\nx\n1 2\n$ 1 2\n(\n$ 1 2\n$ 1\n/3\n,9\n1 8\n,7\n,8\n1\n5\n6\n6\n4\n/2 0 2\n2 ,0 0\n,9 9 8\n5 ,0 0\n2 ,8 8\n6 .9\n2\n0\n)\n2\n0\nx\nNet Debt and Leverage Ratio\nThe quarterly calculations of Net Debt and Leverage Ratio are as follows:\n12/31/2023 12/31/2022 12/31/2021 12/31/2020 12/31/2019\n(in thousands)\nTotal Debt (notional) $ 12,388,000 $ 12,952,000 $ 12,396,000 $ 11,180,000 $ 10,414,000\nLess: Cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and short-\nterm restricted cash (247,722) (186,998) (433,617) (340,908) (139,086)\nNet Debt $ 12,140,278 $ 12,765,002 $ 11,962,383 $ 10,839,092 $ 10,274,914\nDivided by: Annualized Adjusted EBITDA $ 1,922,644 $ 1,837,360 $ 1,636,212 $ 1,522,384 $ 1,449,572\nLeverage Ratio 6.3x 6.9x 7.3x 7.1x 7.1x\n36\nNet Cash Interest Coverage Ratio\nThe quarterly calculation of Net Cash Interest Coverage Ratio is as follows:\n37\nA\nIn\nIn\nN\nN\nd\nt\nt\ne\ne\nju s\ne r e\ne r e\nt c\nt C\nt e d E B IT D\ns t e x p e n s\ns t in c o m e\na s h in t e r e\na s h In t e r e\nA\ne\ns t e\ns t C\nx p\no\ne\nv\nn\ne\ns\nr a\ne\ng e R a t io\n9 / 3 0\n$ 4 7\n9\n( 6\n$ 8\n/ 2 0 2\n2 , 6 2\n5 , 7 1\n, 9 9 9\n8 , 7 1\n5 . 3\n4\n0\n1\n)\n2\nx\n6 / 3 0\n$ 4 6\n9\n( 7\n$ 9\n/ 2 0 2\n7 , 0 6\n7 , 5 3\n, 0 4 6\n0 , 4 8\n5 . 2\n4\n4\n0\n)\n4\nx\n3 / 3 1\n$ 4 6\n9\n( 7\n$ 8\n/ 2 0 2\n5 , 4 1\n6 , 3 9\n, 3 1 4\n9 , 0 7\n5 . 2\nF\n4\n2\n0\n)\n6\nx\no r t h e t h r e e\n1 2 / 3 1 / 2 0 2\n( i n t h o\n$ 4 8 0 , 6 6\n9 8 , 5 3\n( 5 , 5 4 1\n$ 9 2 , 9 9\n5 . 2\nm\n3\nu\n1\n7\n)\n6\nx\no n t h s e n d e\n9 / 3 0 / 2 0 2 3\ns a n d s )\n$ 4 8 2 , 1 3 1\n9 9 , 3 2 2\n( 5 , 2 6 6 )\n$ 9 4 , 0 5 6\n5 . 1 x\nd\n6 / 3 0\n$ 4 7\n1 0\n( 4\n$ 9\n/ 2 0 2\n1 , 7 2\n1 , 2 8\n, 6 8 3\n6 , 6 0\n4 . 9\n3\n0\n8\n)\n5\nx\n3 / 3 1\n$ 4 5\n1 0\n( 2\n$ 9\n/ 2 0 2\n9 , 3 4\n1 , 2 2\n, 8 1 6\n8 , 4 1\n4 . 7\n3\n0\n6\n)\n0\nx\n1 2 / 3 1\n$ 4 6\n1 0\n( 3\n$ 9\n/ 2 0 2\n0 , 7 2\n0 , 2 5\n, 2 5 5\n7 , 0 0\n4 . 7\n2\n0\n6\n)\n1\nx\nNet Secured Debt and Secured Leverage Ratio\nThe calculations of Net Secured Debt and Secured Leverage Ratio are as follows:\n(1) Notional principal amount of outstanding debt\n38\nT\nL\nS\nL\ns\nN\nD\nS\n(1 )o t a l d e b t\ne s s :\n(1 )U n s e c u r e d d e b t\n(1 )e c u r e d d e b t\ne s s : C a s h a n d c a s\nh o r t -

is defined as net income (loss) excluding the impact of interest expense, interest income, provision for or benefit from taxes, depreciation, accretion and amortization, asset\nimpairment and decommission costs, non-cash compensation, loss from extinguishment of debt, net, other (income) and expense, acquisition and new business initiatives related adjustments and\nexpenses, non-cash straight-line leasing revenue, and non-cash straight-line ground lease expense. Adjusted EBITDA excludes acquisition related costs which, pursuant to the adoption of new\nbusiness combination accounting guidance, are expensed and included within operating expenses. Annualized Adjusted EBITDA is calculated as Adjusted EBITDA for the most recent quarter\nmultipliedbyfour.AdjustedEBITDAMarginisdefinedasAdjustedEBITDAdividedbythedifferenceoftotalrevenueminusnon-cashstraight-lineleasingrevenue.\nAdjusted EBITDA is useful to investors or other interested parties in evaluating our financial performance. Adjusted EBITDA is the primary measure used by management (1) to evaluate the\neconomic productivity of our operations and (2) for purposes of making decisions about allocating resources to, and assessing the performance of, our operations. Management believes that\nAdjusted EBITDA helps investors or other interested parties meaningfully evaluate and compare the results of our operations (1) from period to period and (2) to our competitors, byexcluding the\nimpactof ourcapitalstructure (primarilyinterest chargesfrom our outstandingdebt) andassetbase(primarilydepreciation, amortizationandaccretion) from ourfinancialresults.Management also\nbelieves Adjusted EBITDA is frequently used by investors or other interested parties in the evaluation of REITs.

AdjustedFunds From Operations, or AFFO, is defined as FFO adjustedtoremove theimpact of non-cash straight-line leasingrevenue, non-cashstraight-line ground\nlease expense, non-cash compensation, changes in the non-cash portion of our reported tax position, non-real estate related depreciation, amortization and accretion, amortization of deferred\nfinancing costs and debt discounts, lossfrom extinguishment of debt, net, other (income) andexpense, acquisition and newbusiness initiatives related adjustments andexpenses, non-discretionary\ncash capital expenditures, and adjustments for unconsolidated joint ventures. AFFO Per Share is defined as AFFO divided by the weighted number of shares outstanding, adjusted to include the\ndilutive effectofstockoptionsandrestrictedstockunits.\nFFO, AFFO and AFFO per share, which are metrics used by our public company peers in the communication site industry, provide investors useful indicators of the financial performance of our\nbusiness and permit investors an additional tool to evaluate the performance of our business against those of our two principal competitors. FFO, AFFO, and AFFO per share are also used to\naddress questions we receive from analysts and investors who routinely assess our operating performance on the basis of these performance measures, which are considered industry standards.\nWe believe that FFO helps investors or other interested parties meaningfully evaluate financial performance by excluding the impact of our asset base (primarily depreciation, amortization and\naccretion).WebelievethatAFFOandAFFOpersharehelpinvestorsorotherinterestedpartiesmeaningfullyevaluateourfinancialperformanceastheyinclude(1)theimpactofourcapitalstructure\n(primarily interest expense on our outstanding debt) and (2) sustaining capital expenditures and exclude theimpact of our (1) asset base (primarilydepreciation, amortization and accretion) and (2)\ncertainnon-cashitems,includingstraight-linedrevenuesandexpensesrelatedtofixedescalationsandrentfreeperiodsandthenon-cashportionofourreportedtaxprovision.GAAPrequiresrental\nrevenues and expenses related to leases that contain specified rental increases over the life of the lease to be recognized evenly over the life of the lease. In accordance with GAAP, if payment\nterms call for fixed escalations, or rent free periods, the revenue or expense is recognized on a straight-lined basis over the fixed, non-cancelable term of the contract. We only use AFFO as a\nperformance measure. AFFO should be considered only as a supplement to net income computed in accordance with GAAP as a measure of our performance and should not be considered as an\nalternative to cash flows from operations or as residual cash flow available for discretionary investment.Webelieve our definition of FFO is consistent with how that term is defined bythe National\nAssociationofRealEstateInvestmentTrusts(“NAREIT”)andthatourdefinitionanduseofAFFOandAFFOpershareisconsistentwiththosereportedbytheothercommunicationsitecompanies.\n29\nFunds From Operations, Adjusted Funds From Operations\nand Adjusted Funds From Operations Per Share\nThe annual calculation of Funds From Operations, Adjusted Funds From Operations and Adjusted Funds From Operations Per Share is as follows:\nFor the year ended\nDecember 31,\nNote:Annualnumbersmaynotaddupduetorounding\n1.

Adjusted EBITDA is the primary measure used by management (1) to evaluate the\neconomic productivity of our operations and (2) for purposes of making decisions about allocating resources to, and assessing the performance of, our operations. Management believes that\nAdjusted EBITDA helps investors or other interested parties meaningfully evaluate and compare the results of our operations (1) from period to period and (2) to our competitors, byexcluding the\nimpactof ourcapitalstructure (primarilyinterest chargesfrom our outstandingdebt) andassetbase(primarilydepreciation, amortizationandaccretion) from ourfinancialresults.Management also\nbelieves Adjusted EBITDA is frequently used by investors or other interested parties in the evaluation of REITs.

AdjustedFunds From Operations, or AFFO, is definedas FFO adjusted toremove theimpact of non-cash straight-line leasingrevenue, non-cashstraight-line ground\nlease expense, non-cash compensation, changes in the non-cash portion of our reported tax position, non-real estate related depreciation, amortization and accretion, amortization of deferred\nfinancing costs and debt discounts, lossfrom extinguishment of debt, net, other (income) andexpense, acquisition and newbusiness initiatives related adjustments andexpenses, non-discretionary\ncash capital expenditures, and adjustments for unconsolidated joint ventures. AFFO Per Share is defined as AFFO divided by the weighted number of shares outstanding, adjusted to include the\ndilutive effectofstockoptionsandrestrictedstockunits.\nFFO, AFFO and AFFO per share, which are metrics used by our public company peers in the communication site industry, provide investors useful indicators of the financial performance of our\nbusiness and permit investors an additional tool to evaluate the performance of our business against those of our two principal competitors. FFO, AFFO, and AFFO per share are also used to\naddress questions we receive from analysts and investors who routinely assess our operating performance on the basis of these performance measures, which are considered industry standards.\nWe believe that FFO helps investors or other interested parties meaningfully evaluate financial performance by excluding the impact of our asset base (primarily depreciation, amortization and\naccretion).WebelievethatAFFOandAFFOpersharehelpinvestorsorotherinterestedpartiesmeaningfullyevaluateourfinancialperformanceastheyinclude(1)theimpactofourcapitalstructure\n(primarily interest expense on our outstanding debt) and (2) sustaining capital expenditures and exclude theimpact of our (1) asset base (primarily depreciation, amortization and accretion) and (2)\ncertainnon-cashitems,includingstraight-linedrevenuesandexpensesrelatedtofixedescalationsandrentfreeperiodsandthenon-cashportionofourreportedtaxprovision.GAAPrequiresrental\nrevenues and expenses related to leases that contain specified rental increases over the life of the lease to be recognized evenly over the life of the lease. In accordance with GAAP, if payment\nterms call for fixed escalations, or rent free periods, the revenue or expense is recognized on a straight-lined basis over the fixed, non-cancelable term of the contract.

Adjusted EBITDA is the primary measure used by management (1) to evaluate the\neconomic productivity of our operations and (2) for purposes of making decisions about allocating resources to, and assessing the performance of, our operations. Management believes that\nAdjusted EBITDA helps investors or other interested parties meaningfully evaluate and compare the results of our operations (1) from period to period and (2) to our competitors, byexcluding the\nimpactof ourcapitalstructure (primarilyinterest chargesfrom our outstandingdebt) andassetbase(primarilydepreciation, amortizationandaccretion) from ourfinancialresults.Management also\nbelieves Adjusted EBITDA is frequently used by investors or other interested parties in the evaluation of REITs.

AdjustedFunds From Operations, or AFFO, is defined as FFO adjustedtoremove theimpact of non-cash straight-line leasingrevenue, non-cashstraight-line ground\nlease expense, non-cash compensation, changes in the non-cash portion of our reported tax position, non-real estate related depreciation, amortization and accretion, amortization of deferred\nfinancing costs and debt discounts, lossfrom extinguishment of debt, net, other (income) andexpense, acquisition and newbusiness initiatives related adjustments andexpenses, non-discretionary\ncash capital expenditures, and adjustments for unconsolidated joint ventures. AFFO Per Share is defined as AFFO divided by the weighted number of shares outstanding, adjusted to include the\ndilutive effectofstockoptionsandrestrictedstockunits.\nFFO, AFFO and AFFO per share, which are metrics used by our public company peers in the communication site industry, provide investors useful indicators of the financial performance of our\nbusiness and permit investors an additional tool to evaluate the performance of our business against those of our two principal competitors. FFO, AFFO, and AFFO per share are also used to\naddress questions we receive from analysts and investors who routinely assess our operating performance on the basis of these performance measures, which are considered industry standards.\nWe believe that FFO helps investors or other interested parties meaningfully evaluate financial performance by excluding the impact of our asset base (primarily depreciation, amortization and\naccretion).WebelievethatAFFOandAFFOpersharehelpinvestorsorotherinterestedpartiesmeaningfullyevaluateourfinancialperformanceastheyinclude(1)theimpactofourcapitalstructure\n(primarily interest expense on our outstanding debt) and (2) sustaining capital expenditures and exclude theimpact of our (1) asset base (primarilydepreciation, amortization and accretion) and (2)\ncertainnon-cashitems,includingstraight-linedrevenuesandexpensesrelatedtofixedescalationsandrentfreeperiodsandthenon-cashportionofourreportedtaxprovision.GAAPrequiresrental\nrevenues and expenses related to leases that contain specified rental increases over the life of the lease to be recognized evenly over the life of the lease. In accordance with GAAP, if payment\nterms call for fixed escalations, or rent free periods, the revenue or expense is recognized on a straight-lined basis over the fixed, non-cancelable term of the contract. We only use AFFO as a\nperformance measure. AFFO should be considered only as a supplement to net income computed in accordance with GAAP as a measure of our performance and should not be considered as an\nalternative to cash flows from operations or as residual cash flow available for discretionary investment.Webelieve our definition of FFO is consistent with how that term is defined bythe National\nAssociationofRealEstateInvestmentTrusts(“NAREIT”)andthatourdefinitionanduseofAFFOandAFFOpershareisconsistentwiththosereportedbytheothercommunicationsitecompanies.\n29\nFunds From Operations, Adjusted Funds From Operations\nand Adjusted Funds From Operations Per Share\nThe annual calculation of Funds From Operations, Adjusted Funds From Operations and Adjusted Funds From Operations Per Share is as follows:\nFor the year ended\nDecember 31,\n2022 2021\n(in thousands) ($ per share) (in thousands) ($ per share)\nNet income $ 459,799 $ 4.20 $ 237,624 $ 2.14\nReal estate related depreciation, amortization, and accretion 702,937 6.44 696,020 6.26\nAsset impairment and decommission costs 43,160 0.39 33,044 0.30\nFFO $ 1,205,896 $ 11.03 $ 966,688 $ 8.70\nAdjustments to FFO:\nNon-cash straight-line leasing revenue (38,675) (0.34) (30,117) (0.27)\nNon-cash straight-line ground lease expense 2,653 0.02 7,766 0.07\nNon-cash compensation 99,909 0.91 84,402 0.75\nAdjustment for non-cash portion of tax provision (1) 32,901 0.30 (8,510) (0.08)\nNon-real estate related depreciation, amortization, and accretion 4,639 0.04 4,141 0.04\nAmortization of deferred financing costs and debt discounts 65,944 0.60 66,674 0.60\nLoss from extinguishment of debt, net 437 0.00 39,502 0.36\nOther expense (10,467) (0.10) 74,284 0.67\nAcquisition and new business initiatives related adjustments and\nexpenses 26,807 0.25 27,621 0.25\nNon-discretionary cash capital expenditures (50,327) (0.46) (39,389) (0.35)\nAFFO $ 1,339,717 $ 12.25 $ 1,193,062 $ 10.74\nDiluted Weighted average number of common shares 109,386 111,177\nNote:Annualnumbersmaynotaddupduetorounding\n1.

The table below provides the\nreconciliation of the reported growth rate year-over-year, of each of the measures included in the table, to the growth rate after eliminating the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates to\nsuch measure.\nWe believe that our Constant Currency Measures provide management and investors the ability to evaluate the performance of the business without the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations.\nFourth quarter Growth excluding\n2023 year over Foreign currency foreign currency\nyear growth rate impact impact\nTotal site leasing revenue 4.3% 0.6% 3.7%\nTotal cash site leasing revenue 5.3% 0.7% 4.6%\nInt'l cash site leasing revenue 8.8% 2.6% 6.2%\nTotal site leasing segment oper. profit 4.5% 0.6% 3.9%\nInt'l site leasing segment oper. profit 9.3% 2.9% 6.4%\nTotal site leasing tower cash flow 5.4% 0.7% 4.7%\nInt'l site leasing tower cash flow 10.0% 3.1% 6.9%\nNet income 6.7% 21.1% (14.4%)\nEarnings per share - diluted 6.7% 21.5% (14.8%)\nAdjusted EBITDA 4.3% 0.7% 3.6%\nAFFO 7.3% 0.9% 6.4%\nAFFO per share 8.0% 0.9% 7.1%\n18\nCash Site Leasing Revenue, Tower Cash Flow and\nTower Cash Flow Margin\nCash Site Leasing Revenue is defined as site leasing revenue less non-cash straight-line site leasing revenue. Tower Cash Flow is defined as Cash Site Leasing Revenue less site leasing cost of\nrevenues net of non-cash straight-line ground lease expense and Tower Cash Flow Margin is defined as Tower Cash Flow divided by Cash Site Leasing Revenue. We discuss these non-GAAP\nfinancial measures because we believe these items are indicators of performance of our site leasing operations. In addition, Tower Cash Flow is a component of the calculation used by our\nlenders to determine compliance with certain covenants under our Senior Credit Agreement. Neither Cash Site Leasing Revenue, Tower Cash Flow nor Tower Cash Flow Margin are intended to\nbe alternative measures of site leasing gross profit nor of site leasing gross profit margin as determined in accordance with GAAP.\nThe quarterly reconciliation of Cash Site Leasing Revenue and Tower Cash Flow and the calculation of Tower Cash Flow Margin is as follows:\n19\nS\nN\nS\nN\nite le

Annualized Adjusted EBITDA and\nAdjusted EBITDA Margin\nAdjusted EBITDA is defined as net income (loss) excluding the impact of interest expense, interest income, provision for or benefit from taxes, depreciation, accretion and amortization, asset\nimpairment and decommission costs, non-cash compensation, loss from extinguishment of debt, net, other (income) and expense, acquisition and new business initiatives related adjustments and\nexpenses, non-cash straight-line leasing revenue, and non-cash straight-line ground lease expense. Adjusted EBITDA excludes acquisition related costs which, pursuant to the adoption of new\nbusiness combination accounting guidance, are expensed and included within operating expenses. Annualized Adjusted EBITDA is calculated as Adjusted EBITDA for the most recent quarter\nmultiplied by four. Adjusted EBITDA Margin is defined as Adjusted EBITDA divided by the difference of total revenue minus non-cash straight-line leasing revenue.\nAdjusted EBITDA is useful to investors or other interested parties in evaluating our financial performance. Adjusted EBITDA is the primary measure used by management (1) to evaluate the\neconomic productivity of our operations and (2) for purposes of making decisions about allocating resources to, and assessing the performance of, our operations. Management believes that\nAdjusted EBITDA helps investors or other interested parties meaningfully evaluate and compare the results of our operations (1) from period to period and (2) to our competitors, by excluding the\nimpact of our capital structure (primarily interest charges from our outstanding debt) and asset base (primarily depreciation, amortization and accretion) from our financial results. Management also\nbelieves Adjusted EBITDA is frequently used by investors or other interested parties in the evaluation of REITs. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA is similar to the measure of current financial\nperformance generally used in our debt covenant calculations. Adjusted EBITDA should be considered only as a supplement to net income computed in accordance with GAAP as a measure of our\nperformance.\n24\nAdjusted EBITDA and Annualized Adjusted EBITDA\nThe quarterly reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA and the calculation of Annualized Adjusted EBITDA are as follows:\n12/31/2023 9/30/2023 6/30/2023 3/31/2023 12/31/2022 9/30/2022 6/30/2022 3/31/2022\n(in thousands)\nNet income $ 109,528 $ 85,362 $ 201,970 $ 100,554 $ 102,580 $ 99,762 $ 69,151 $ 188,306\nNon-cash straight-line leasing revenue (3,828) (7,048) (7,480) (6,849) (9,133) (11,686) (9,846) (8,001)\nNon-cash straight-line ground lease expense (821) (428) (160) 723 401 478 721 1,053\nNon-cash compensation 22,089 21,374 18,252 26,206 25,769 25,492 23,900 24,747\nLoss from extinguishment of debt, net — — — — 437 — — —\nOther (income ) / expense (33,090) 48,330 (40,732) (37,558) (8,207) 39,756 66,141 (108,161)\nAcquisition and new business initiatives related adjustments and\n5,049 5,612 4,953 6,057 8,031 6,844 6,829 5,104\nexpenses\nAsset impairment and decommission costs 77,067 33,063 32,867 26,390 17,596 8,532 8,521 8,512\nInterest income (5,541) (5,266) (4,683) (2,816) (3,255) (2,858) (1,517) (2,502)\nTotal interest expense (1) 109,894 112,317 113,850 120,453 116,861 103,444 100,766 98,659\nDepreciation, accretion and amortization 171,400 180,674 181,820 182,415 183,036 173,825 176,392 174,323\nProvision (benefit) for taxes (2) 28,914 8,141 (28,937) 43,765 26,604 3,170 (3,302) 41,711\nAdjusted EBITDA $ 480,661 $ 482,131 $ 471,720 $ 459,340 $ 460,720 $ 446,759 $ 437,756 $ 423,751\nAnnualized Adjusted EBITDA (3) $ 1,922,644 $ 1,928,524 $ 1,886,880 $ 1,837,360 $ 1,842,880 $ 1,787,036 $ 1,751,024 $ 1,695,004\n1.

Adjusted Funds From Operations, or AFFO, is defined as FFO adjusted to remove the impact of non-cash straight-line leasing revenue, non-cash straight-line ground\nlease expense, non-cash compensation, changes in the non-cash portion of our reported tax position, non-real estate related depreciation, amortization and accretion, amortization of deferred\nfinancing costs and debt discounts, loss from extinguishment of debt, net, other (income) and expense, acquisition and new business initiatives related adjustments and expenses, non-discretionary\ncash capital expenditures, and adjustments for unconsolidated joint ventures. AFFO Per Share is defined as AFFO divided by the weighted number of shares outstanding, adjusted to include the\ndilutive effect of stock options and restricted stock units.\nFFO, AFFO and AFFO per share, which are metrics used by our public company peers in the communication site industry, provide investors useful indicators of the financial performance of our\nbusiness and permit investors an additional tool to evaluate the performance of our business against those of our two principal competitors. FFO, AFFO, and AFFO per share are also used to\naddress questions we receive from analysts and investors who routinely assess our operating performance on the basis of these performance measures, which are considered industry standards.\nWe believe that FFO helps investors or other interested parties meaningfully evaluate financial performance by excluding the impact of our asset base (primarily depreciation, amortization and\naccretion). We believe that AFFO and AFFO per share help investors or other interested parties meaningfully evaluate our financial performance as they include (1) the impact of our capital structure\n(primarily interest expense on our outstanding debt) and (2) sustaining capital expenditures and exclude the impact of our (1) asset base (primarily depreciation, amortization and accretion) and (2)\ncertain non-cash items, including straight-lined revenues and expenses related to fixed escalations and rent free periods and the non-cash portion of our reported tax provision. GAAP requires rental\nrevenues and expenses related to leases that contain specified rental increases over the life of the lease to be recognized evenly over the life of the lease. In accordance with GAAP, if payment\nterms call for fixed escalations, or rent free periods, the revenue or expense is recognized on a straight-lined basis over the fixed, non-cancelable term of the contract. We only use AFFO as a\nperformance measure. AFFO should be considered only as a supplement to net income computed in accordance with GAAP as a measure of our performance and should not be considered as an\nalternative to cash flows from operations or as residual cash flow available for discretionary investment. We believe our definition of FFO is consistent with how that term is defined by the National\nAssociation of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“NAREIT”) and that our definition and use of AFFO and AFFO per share is consistent with those reported by the other communication site companies.\n30\nFunds From Operations, Adjusted Funds From Operations\nand Adjusted Funds From Operations Per Share\nThe annual calculation of Funds From Operations, Adjusted Funds From Operations and Adjusted Funds From Operations Per Share is as follows:\nFor the year ended\nDecember 31,\n2023 2022\n(in thousands) ($ per share) (in thousands) ($ per share)\nNet income $ 497,415 $ 4.57 $ 459,799 $ 4.20\nReal estate related depreciation, amortization, and accretion 709,832 6.52 702,937 6.44\nAsset impairment and decommission costs 169,387 1.56 43,160 0.39\nFFO $ 1,376,634 $ 12.65 $ 1,205,896 $ 11.03\nAdjustments to FFO:\nNon-cash straight-line leasing revenue (25,206) (0.24) (38,675) (0.34)\nNon-cash straight-line ground lease expense (686) (0.01) 2,653 0.02\nNon-cash compensation 87,919 0.81 99,909 0.91\nAdjustment for non-cash portion of tax provision (1) 20,354 0.19 32,901 0.30\nNon-real estate related depreciation, amortization, and accretion 6,477 0.06 4,639 0.04\nAmortization of deferred financing costs and debt discounts 56,141 0.52 65,944 0.60\nInterest deemed paid upon conversion of convertible notes — —\nLoss from extinguishment of debt, net — — 437 0.00\nOther (Income) Expense, Net (63,053) (0.58) (10,467) (0.10)\nAcquisition and new business initiatives related adjustments and\nexpenses 21,671 0.20 26,807 0.25\nNon-discretionary cash capital expenditures (56,078) (0.51) (50,327) (0.46)\nAFFO $ 1,424,173 $ 13.08 $ 1,339,717 $ 12.25\nDiluted Weighted average number of common shares 108,907 109,386\nAFFO per share $ 13.08 $ 12.25\nNote: Annual numbers may not add up due to rounding\n1.

Net Secured Debt is defined as\nthe notional principal amount of outstanding secured debt minus cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and short-term restricted cash. Under GAAP policies, the notional principal\namount of the Company’s outstanding debt is not necessarily reflected on the face of the Company’s financial statements. Leverage Ratio is defined as Net Debt divided by Annualized Adjusted\nEBITDA. Secured Leverage Ratio is defined as Net Secured Debt divided by Annualized Adjusted EBITDA. Net cash interest coverage ratio is defined as Adjusted EBITDA divided by Net Cash\nInterest Expense. We believe that by including the full amount of the notional principal amount due at maturity for purposes of calculating net debt, and, to the extent that such measures are\ncalculated on net debt, by excluding cash and cash equivalents, it will provide investors a more complete understanding of our net debt and leverage position. We have included these non-GAAP\nfinancial measures because we believe these items are indicators of our financial condition, and they are used by our lenders to determine compliance with certain covenants under our Senior\nCredit Agreement, 2020 Senior Notes, and 2021 Senior Notes.\n34\nNet Debt and Leverage Ratio\nThe calculations of Net Debt and Leverage Ratio are as follows:\n12/31/2023\n(in thousands)\n2014-2C Tower Securities 620,000\n2019-1C Tower Securities 1 ,165,000\n2020-1C Tower Securities 750,000\n2020-2C Tower Securities 600,000\n2021-1C Tower Securities 1 ,165,000\n2021-2C Tower Securities 895,000\n2021-3C Tower Securities 895,000\n2022-1C Tower Securities 850,000\nRevolving Credit Facility 180,000\n2018 Term Loan 2 ,268,000\nTotal secured debt $ 9,388,000\n2020 Senior Notes 1 ,500,000\n2021 Senior Notes 1 ,500,000\nTotal unsecured debt $ 3,000,000\nTotal debt $ 12,388,000\nLess: Cash and cash equivalents, short-term restricted\ncash and short-term investments ( 247,722)\nNet debt $ 12,140,278\nDivided by: Annualized Adjusted EBITDA $ 1,922,644\nLeverage Ratio 6.3x\n35\nNet Debt and Leverage Ratio\nThe quarterly calculations of Net Debt and Leverage Ratio are as follows:\n36\nT\nL\na\nN\nD\nL\no ta l D e b t ( n o tio\ne s s : C a s h a n d\nn d s h o r t- te r m r\ne t D e b t\niv id e d b y : A n n u\ne v e r a g e R a tio\nn\nc\ne\na\na l)\na s h e q\ns tr ic te d\nliz e d A\nu iv\nc a\nd ju\na\ns\ns\nle\nh\nte\nn\nd\nts\nE\n, s h\nB IT\no\nD\nr\nA\nt- te r m in v e s tm e n ts\n1 2\n$ 1 2\n(\n$ 1 2\n$ 1\n/3\n,3\n2 4\n,1\n,9\n1\n8\n7\n4\n2\n/2 0 2\n8 ,0 0\n,7 2 2\n0 ,2 7\n2 ,6 4\n6 .3\n3\n0\n)\n8\n4\nx\n9\n$ 1 2\n(\n$ 1 2\n$ 1\n/3\n,5\n2 2\n,3\n,9\n0\n8\n8\n5\n2\n/2 0 2\n4 ,0 0\n,9 0 7\n5 ,0 9\n8 ,5 2\n6 .4\n3\n0\n)\n3\n4\nx\n6\n$ 1 2\n(\n$ 1 2\n$ 1\n/3\n,6\n2 7\n,3\n,8\n0\n7\n3\n9\n8\n/2 0 2\n0 ,0 0\n,6 2 5\n6 ,3 7\n6 ,8 8\n6 .6\n3\n0\n)\n5\n0\nx\n3\n$ 1 2\n(\n$ 1 2\n$ 1\n/3\n,9\n1 9\n,7\n,8\n1\n0\n1\n0\n3\n/2 0 2 3\n( in t h o\n1 ,0 0 0\n,2 5 1 )\n9 ,7 4 9\n7 ,3 6 0\n6 .9 x\n1 2\nu s a n d s\n$ 1 2\n(\n$ 1 2\n$ 1\n/3\n)\n,9\n1 8\n,7\n,8\n1\n5\n6\n6\n4\n/2 0 2\n2 ,0 0\n,9 9 8\n5 ,0 0\n2 ,8 8\n6 .9\n2\n0\n)\n2\n0\nx\n9\n$ 1 2\n(\n$ 1 2\n$ 1\n/3\n,4\n2 9\n,1\n,7\n0\n3\n7\n4\n8\n/2 0 2\n8 ,0 0\n,5 1 6\n0 ,4 8\n7 ,0 3\n6 .8\n2\n0\n)\n4\n6\nx\n6\n$ 1 2\n(\n$ 1 2\n$ 1\n/3\n,5\n2 8\n,2\n,7\n0\n6\n8\n7\n5\n/2 0 2\n4 ,0 0\n,3 6 0\n5 ,6 4\n1 ,0 2\n7 .0\n2\n0\n)\n0\n4\nx\n3\n$ 1 2\n(\n$ 1 2\n$ 1\n/3\n,7\n3 3\n,3\n,6\n1\n2\n4\n8\n9\n/2 0 2\n0 ,0 0\n,1 0 3\n5 ,8 9\n5 ,0 0\n7 .3\n2\n0\n)\n7\n4\nx\nNet Debt and Leverage Ratio\nThe quarterly calculations of Net Debt and Leverage Ratio are as follows:\n37\nT\nL\na\nN\nD\nL\no\ne\nn\ne\ni\ne\nt a l D\ns s : C\nd s h\nt D e\nv i d e d\nv e r a\ne b\na\no r\nb t\nb\ng e\nt (\ns h\nt -

BASIS OF PRESENTATION\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Annual Report on Form 10-K for\nthe fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 for SBA Communications Corporation and its subsidiaries (the “Company”). These financial\nstatements have been prepared in accordance with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X and, therefore, omit\nor condense certain footnotes and other information normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting\nprinciples generally accepted in the United States. In the opinion of the Company’s management, all adjustments (consisting of normal\nrecurring accruals and deferrals) considered necessary for fair financial statement presentation have been made. The results of\noperations for an interim period may not give a true indication of the results for the year. Certain reclassifications have been made to\nprior year amounts or balances to conform to the presentation adopted in the current year.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make\nestimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. The\nsignificant estimates made by management relate to the allowance for doubtful accounts, the costs and revenue relating to the\nCompany’s construction contracts, stock-based compensation assumptions, valuation allowance related to deferred tax assets, fair value\nof long-lived assets, the useful lives of towers and intangible assets, anticipated property tax assessments, incremental borrowing rate\nfor lease accounting, fair value of investments, and asset retirement obligations. Management develops estimates based on historical\nexperience and on various assumptions about the future that are believed to be reasonable based on the information available. These\nestimates ultimately may differ from actual results and such differences could be material.\nDuring the first quarter of 2024, the Company completed its assessment on the remaining estimated useful lives of its towers\nand intangible assets. The Company concluded through its assessment that it should modify its current estimates for asset lives based on\nits historical operating experience and the findings obtained by its independent consultant. The Company previously depreciated its\ntowers on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the term of the underlying ground lease (including renewal options) taking into\naccount residual value or the estimated useful life of the tower, which the Company had historically estimated to be 15 years. Based on\nits assessment, the Company revised the estimated useful lives of its towers and certain related intangible assets (which are amortized\non a similar basis to its tower assets, as their useful lives correlate to the useful life of the towers) from 15 years to 30 years, effective\nJanuary 1, 2024. The Company accounted for the change in estimated useful lives as a change in estimate under ASC 250 “Accounting\nChanges and Error Corrections.” The impact of the change in estimate was accounted for prospectively effective January 1, 2024,\nresulting in a reduction in depreciation and amortization expense of approximately $102.7 million ($93.0 million after tax, or an\nincrease of $0.86 per diluted share) for the three months ended March 31, 2024. The change in useful lives is expected to reduce\ndepreciation expense by approximately $411.5 million ($372.5 million after tax, or an increase of $3.43 per diluted share) for the year\nended December 31, 2024.\nForeign Currency Translation\nAll assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries that do not utilize the U.S. dollar as its functional currency are translated at\nperiod-end exchange rates, while revenues and expenses are translated at monthly average exchange rates during the period. Unrealized\ntranslation gains and losses are reported as foreign currency translation adjustments through Accumulated other comprehensive loss, net\nin the Consolidated Statement of Shareholders’ Deficit.\nFor foreign subsidiaries where the U.S. dollar is the functional currency, monetary assets and liabilities of such subsidiaries,\nwhich are not denominated in U.S. dollars, are remeasured at exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date, and revenues and\nexpenses are remeasured at monthly average rates prevailing during the year. Remeasurement gains and losses are reported as Other\n(expense) income, net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nIntercompany Loans Subject to Remeasurement\nIn accordance with ASC 830, the Company remeasures foreign denominated intercompany loans with the corresponding\nchange in the balance being recorded in Other (expense) income, net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations as settlement is\nanticipated or planned in the foreseeable future. The Company recorded a $28.5 million loss and a $27.4 million gain, net of taxes, on\nthe remeasurement of intercompany loans for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. During the three months\nended March 31, 2024, the Company funded $8.3 million and repaid $50.7 million under its intercompany loan agreements. As of\n7\nTable of Contents\nMarch 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the aggregate amount outstanding under the intercompany loan agreements subject to\nremeasurement with the Company’s foreign subsidiaries was $1.2 billion and $1.3 billion, respectively.\n2. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS\nItems Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis— The Company’s asset retirement obligations are measured at fair value\non a recurring basis using Level 3 inputs and are recorded in Other long-term liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The fair\nvalue of the asset retirement obligations is calculated using a discounted cash flow model.\nRefer to Note 16 for discussion of the Company’s redeemable noncontrolling interests.\nItems Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis— The Company estimates the fair value of assets subject to\nimpairment using a discounted cash flow (“DCF”) (Level 3 input) analysis. Determining fair value requires the exercise of significant\njudgments, including the amount and timing of expected future cash flows, long-term growth rates, discount rates and relevant\ncomparable earnings and trading multiples. The cash flows employed in the DCF analysis are based on estimates of future revenues,\nearnings, and cash flows after considering factors such as tower location demographics, timing of additions of new tenants, lease rates,\nrate and term of renewal, attrition, ongoing cash requirements, and market multiples. Each of the assumptions are applied based on the\nspecific facts and circumstances of the identified assets at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows. The DCF analysis used an average\ndiscount rate ranging from 7.8% - 8.8%.\nAsset impairment and decommission costs for all periods presented and the related impaired assets primarily relate to the\nCompany’s site leasing operating segment. The following summarizes the activity of asset impairment and decommission costs:\nFor the three months\nended March 31,\n2024 2023\n(in thousands)\nAsset impairment (1) $ 34,552 $ 22,332\nWrite-off of carrying value of decommissioned towers 4,102 1,954\nOther (including tower and equipment decommission costs) 4,994 2,104\nTotal asset impairment and decommission costs $ 43,648 $ 26,390\n(1) Represents impairment charges resulting from the Company’s regular analysis of whether the anticipated future cash flows\nfrom certain towers are sufficient to recover the carrying value of the investment in those towers. As a result of increased\nchurn, the Company experienced increased asset impairment charges for the three months ended March 31, 2024.\nThe Company’s long-term investments were $22.0 million and $24.5 million as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023,\nrespectively, and are recorded in Other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The estimation of the fair value of the investment\ninvolves the use of Level 3 inputs. The Company evaluates these investments for indicators of impairment. The Company considers\nimpairment indicators such as negative changes in industry and market conditions, financial performance, business prospects, and other\nrelevant events and factors. If indicators exist and the fair value of the investment is less than the carrying amount, an impairment\ncharge will be recorded. The Company did not recognize any impairment loss associated with its investments during the three months\nended March 31, 2024 and 2023.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments— The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, restricted cash,\naccounts payable, and short-term investments approximate their estimated fair values due to the short maturity of these instruments.\nThe Company’s estimate of its short-term investments is based primarily upon Level 1 reported market values. As of March 31, 2024\nand December 31, 2023, the Company had $1.6 million and $1.0 million of short-term investments, respectively. For the three months\nended March 31, 2024, the Company purchased and sold $0.3 billion of short-term investments. For the three months ended March 31,\n2023, the Company purchased and sold $0.2 billion of short-term investments.\nThe Company determines fair value of its debt instruments utilizing various Level 2 sources including quoted prices and\nindicative quotes (non-binding quotes) from brokers that require judgment to interpret market information including implied credit\nspreads for similar borrowings on recent trades or bid/ask prices. The fair value of the Revolving Credit Facility is considered to\napproximate the carrying value because the Company does not believe its credit risk has changed materially from the date the\napplicable spread to the Eurodollar Rate and Term SOFR Rate was set for the Revolving Credit Facility (112.5 to 150.0 basis points).\nRefer to Note 10 for the fair values, principal balances, and carrying values of the Company’s debt instruments.\n8\nTable of Contents\nFor discussion of the Company’s derivatives and hedging activities, refer to Note 17.\n3.

These restricted cash amounts are used to fund reserve accounts for the payment of (1) debt service\ncosts, (2) ground rents, real estate and personal property taxes and insurance premiums related to towers, (3) trustee and servicing\nexpenses, and (4) management fees. The restricted cash in the securitization escrow account in excess of required reserve balances is\nsubsequently released to the Borrowers (as defined in Note 10) monthly, provided that the Borrowers are in compliance with their debt\nservice coverage ratio and that no event of default has occurred. All monies held by the indenture trustee are classified as restricted cash\non the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nPayment and performance bonds relate primarily to collateral requirements for tower construction currently in process by the\nCompany. Other restricted cash includes $6.1 million held in escrow as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023 related to the\nCompany’s acquisition activities. Cash is pledged as collateral related to surety bonds issued for the benefit of the Company or its\naffiliates in the ordinary course of business and primarily related to the Company’s tower removal obligations.

Refer to Note 17 for more\ninformation on the Company’s interest rate swap.\nTerms of the Senior Credit Agreement\nOn January 25, 2024, the Company, through its wholly owned subsidiary, SBA Senior Finance II LLC (“SBA Senior Finance\nII”), amended and restated its Senior Credit Agreement to (1) issue a new $2.3 billion Term Loan and retire the 2018 Term Loan, (2)\nincrease the total commitments under its Revolving Credit Facility from $1.5 billion to $1.75 billion, (3) extend the maturity date of its\nRevolving Credit Facility to January 25, 2029, and (4) amend certain other terms and conditions under the Senior Credit Agreement.\nOn February 23, 2024 the Company, through its wholly owned subsidiary, SBA Senior Finance II, further increased the total\ncommitments under the Revolving Credit Facility from $1.75 billion to $2.0 billion.\nAs of March 31, 2024, SBA Senior Finance II was in compliance with the financial covenants contained in the Senior Credit\nAgreement.\nRevolving Credit Facility under the Senior Credit Agreement\nThe Revolving Credit Facility consists of a revolving loan under which up to $2.0 billion aggregate principal amount may be\nborrowed, repaid and redrawn, based upon specific financial ratios and subject to the satisfaction of other customary conditions to\nborrowing through the maturity date of January 25, 2029. Amounts borrowed under the Revolving Credit Facility accrue interest, at\nSBA Senior Finance II’s election, at either (1) the Eurodollar Rate or Term SOFR Rate plus a margin that ranges from 112.5 basis\npoints to 150.0 basis points or (2) the Base Rate plus a margin that ranges from 12.5 basis points to 50.0 basis points, in each case based\non the ratio of Consolidated Net Debt to Annualized Borrower EBITDA, calculated in accordance with the Senior Credit Agreement. In\naddition, SBA Senior Finance II is required to pay a commitment fee of between 0.15% and 0.25% per annum on the amount of unused\ncommitment. Furthermore, the Revolving Credit Facility incorporates sustainability-linked targets which will adjust the Revolving\nCredit Facility’s applicable interest and commitment fee rates upward or downward based on how the Company performs against those\ntargets. Borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility may be used for general corporate purposes. SBA Senior Finance II may, from\ntime to time, borrow from and repay the Revolving Credit Facility. Consequently, the amount outstanding under the Revolving Credit\nFacility at the end of the period may not be reflective of the total amounts outstanding during such period.\n13\nTable of Contents\nThe key terms of the Revolving Credit Facility are as follows:\nUnused\nInterest Rate Commitment\nas of Fee as of\nMarch 31, 2024 (1) March 31, 2024 (2)\nRevolving Credit Facility 6.395% 0.140%\n(1) The rate reflected includes a 0.050% reduction in the applicable spread as a result of meeting certain sustainability-linked\ntargets as of December 31, 2023.\n(2) The rate reflected includes a 0.010% reduction in the applicable commitment fee as a result of meeting certain sustainability-\nlinked targets as of December 31, 2023.\nThe table below summarizes the Company’s Revolving Credit Facility activity during the three months ended March 31, 2024\nand 2023 (in thousands):\nFor the three months\nended March 31,\n2024 2023\nBeginning outstanding balance $ 180,000 $ 720,000\nBorrowings 125,000 140,000\nRepayments (110,000) (185,000)\nEnding outstanding balance $ 195,000 $ 675,000\nSubsequent to March 31, 2024, the Company repaid $50.0 million and borrowed $50.0 million under the Revolving Credit\nFacility, and as of the date of this filing, $195.0 million was outstanding.\nTerm Loan under the Senior Credit Agreement\n2024 Term Loan\nOn January 25, 2024, the Company, through its wholly owned subsidiary, SBA Senior Finance II, issued a term loan under the\namended and restated Senior Credit Agreement. The 2024 Term Loan consists of a senior secured term loan with an initial aggregate\nprincipal amount of $2.3 billion that matures on January 25, 2031. The 2024 Term Loan accrues interest, at SBA Senior Finance II's\nelection, at either the Base Rate plus 100 basis points (with a zero Base Rate floor) or at Term SOFR plus 200 basis points (with a floor\nof 0%). The 2024 Term Loan was issued at 99.75% of par value. The proceeds from the 2024 Term Loan were used to retire the 2018\nTerm Loan and to pay related fees and expenses. In connection with the repayment, the Company expensed $3.3 million of net deferred\nfinancing fees and $1.2 million of discount related to the debt.\nPrincipal payments on the 2024 Term Loan will be made in quarterly installments on the last day of each March, June,\nSeptember, and December in an amount equal to $5.75 million beginning on June 30, 2024. The Company incurred financing fees of\napproximately $19.4 million in relation to this transaction, which are being amortized through the maturity date.\nSecured Tower Revenue Securities\nAs of March 31, 2024, the entities that are borrowers on the mortgage loan (the “Borrowers”) met the debt service coverage\nratio required by the mortgage loan agreement and were in compliance with all other covenants as set forth in the agreement. The sole\nasset of the Trust consists of a non-recourse mortgage loan made in favor of the Borrowers.\n11. SHAREHOLDERS’ EQUITY\nCommon Stock Equivalents\nThe Company has outstanding stock options, time-based restricted stock units (“RSUs”), and performance-based restricted\nstock units (“PSUs”) which were considered in the Company’s diluted earnings per share calculation (see Note 15).\n14\nTable of Contents\nRegistration of Additional Shares\nOn February 29, 2024, the Company filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission an automatic shelf registration\nstatement for well-known seasoned issuers on Form S-3ASR, which enables the Company to issue shares of its Class A common stock,\npreferred stock, debt securities, warrants, or depositary shares as well as units that include any of these securities. The Company will\nfile a prospectus supplement containing the amount and type of securities each time it issues securities under its automatic shelf\nregistration statement on Form S-3ASR. During the three months ended March 31, 2024, the Company did not issue any securities\nunder this automatic shelf registration statement.\nStock Repurchases\nThe Company’s Board of Directors authorizes the Company to purchase, from time to time, outstanding Class A common\nstock through open market repurchases in compliance with Rule 10b-18 under the Exchange Act, and/or in privately negotiated\ntransactions at management’s discretion based on market and business conditions, applicable legal requirements, and other factors.\nOnce authorized, the repurchase plan has no time deadline and will continue until otherwise modified or terminated by the Company’s\nBoard of Directors at any time in its sole discretion. Shares repurchased are retired. On October 28, 2021, the Company’s Board of\nDirectors authorized a $1.0 billion stock repurchase plan. As of the date of this filing, the Company had $204.7 million of authorization\nremaining under this plan.\nThe following is a summary of the Company’s share repurchases:\nFor the three months\nended March 31,\n2024 2023\nTotal number of shares purchased (in millions) (1) 0.5 —\nAverage price per share (1) $ 214.33 $ —\nTotal purchase price (in millions) (1) $ 106.1 $ —\nSubsequent to March 31, 2024, the Company made the following share repurchases:\nTotal number of shares purchased (in millions) (1) 0.4\nAverage price per share (1) $ 213.30\nTotal purchase price (in millions) (1) $ 93.9\n(1) Amounts reflected are based on the trade date and may differ from the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows which reflects\nshare repurchases based on the settlement date.\nDividends\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2024, the Company paid the following cash dividends:\nPayable to Shareholders\nof Record at the Close Cash Paid Aggregate Amount\nDate Declared of Business on Per Share Paid Date Paid\nFebruary 26, 2024 March 14, 2024 $0.98 $108.1 million March 28, 2024\nDividends paid in 2024 were ordinary taxable dividends.\nSubsequent to March 31, 2024, the Company declared the following cash dividends:\nPayable to Shareholders Cash to\nof Record at the Close be Paid\nDate Declared of Business on Per Share Date to be Paid\nApril 29, 2024 May 23, 2024 $0.98 June 19, 2024\n15\nTable of Contents\n12.

Fair value\nfor a portion of the PSUs was calculated using a Monte Carlo simulation model.\n(2) PSU adjustment represents the net PSUs awarded above or below their target grants resulting from the achievement of\nperformance targets established at the grant date.\n13. INCOME TAXES\nThe primary reason for the difference between the Company’s effective tax rate and the U.S. statutory rate is the Company’s\nREIT election. A tax provision is recognized because U.S. taxable REIT subsidiary and certain foreign subsidiaries of the Company\nhave profitable operations or are in a net deferred tax liability position.\nThe Company elected to be taxed as a REIT commencing with its taxable year ended December 31, 2016. As a REIT, the\nCompany generally will be entitled to a deduction for dividends that it pays, and therefore, not subject to U.S. federal corporate income\ntax on that portion of its net income that it distributes to its shareholders. As a REIT, the Company will continue to pay U.S. federal\nincome tax on earnings, if any, from assets and operations held through its TRS. These assets and operations currently consist primarily\nof the Company’s site development services and its international operations. The Company’s international operations would continue to\nbe subject, as applicable, to foreign taxes in the jurisdictions in which those operations are located. The Company may also be subject\nto a variety of taxes, including payroll taxes and state, local, and foreign income, property, and other taxes on its assets and operations.\nThe Company’s determination as to the timing and amount of future dividend distributions will be based on a number of factors,\nincluding REIT distribution requirements, its existing federal net operating losses (“NOLs”) of approximately $382.3 million as of\nDecember 31, 2023, the Company’s financial condition, earnings, debt covenants, and other possible uses of such funds. The Company\nmay use these NOLs to offset its REIT taxable income, and thus any required distributions to shareholders may be reduced or\neliminated until such time as the NOLs have been fully utilized.\n16\nTable of Contents\nThe Company is subject to income tax and other taxes in the geographic areas where it holds assets or operates, and the\nCompany periodically receives notifications of audits, assessments, or other actions by taxing authorities. In certain jurisdictions, taxing\nauthorities may issue notices and assessments that may not be reflective of the actual tax liability for which the Company will\nultimately be liable. In the process of responding to assessments of taxes that the Company believes are not reflective of the Company’s\nactual tax liability, the Company avails itself of both administrative and judicial remedies. The Company evaluates the circumstances of\neach notification or assessment based on the information available and, in those instances in which the Company does not anticipate a\nsuccessful defense of positions taken in its tax filings, a liability is recorded in the appropriate amount based on the underlying\nassessment.\nIn connection with a current assessment in Brazil, the taxing authorities have issued income tax deficiencies related to\npurchase accounting adjustments for tax years 2016 through 2019. The Company disagrees with the assessment and has filed an appeal\nwith the higher appellate taxing authorities. The Company estimates that there is a more likely than not probability that the Company’s\nposition will be sustained upon appeal. Accordingly, no liability has been recorded. The Company will continue to vigorously contest\nthe adjustments and expects to exhaust all administrative and judicial remedies necessary to resolve the matters, which could be a\nlengthy process. There can be no assurance that these matters will be resolved in the Company’s favor, and an adverse outcome, or any\nfuture tax examinations involving similar assertions, could have a material effect on the Company’s results of operations or cash flows\nin any one period. As of March 31, 2024, the Company estimates the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses in excess of\namounts accrued to be between zero and $94.6 million. This range excludes penalties and interest, which as of such date would have\nbeen $103.7 million.\n14. SEGMENT DATA\nThe Company operates principally in two business segments: site leasing and site development. The Company’s site leasing\nbusiness includes two reportable segments, domestic site leasing and international site leasing. The Company’s business segments are\nstrategic business units that offer different services. They are managed separately based on the fundamental differences in their\noperations. The site leasing segment includes results of the managed and sublease businesses. The site development segment includes\nthe results of both consulting and construction related activities. The Company’s Chief Operating Decision Maker utilizes segment\noperating profit and operating income as his two measures of segment profit in assessing performance and allocating resources at the\nreportable segment level. The Company has applied the aggregation criteria to operations within the international site leasing segment\non a basis that is consistent with management’s review of information and performance evaluations of the individual markets in this\nregion.\n17\nTable of Contents\nRevenues, cost of revenues (exclusive of depreciation, accretion and amortization), capital expenditures (including assets\nacquired through the issuance of shares of the Company’s Class A common stock) and identifiable assets pertaining to the segments in\nwhich the Company continues to operate are presented below.\nDomestic Site Int'l Site Site\nLeasing Leasing Development Other Total\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2024 (in thousands)\nRevenues (1) $ 461,499 $ 166,777 $ 29,586 $ — $ 657,862\nCost of revenues (2) 65,970 48,843 23,178 — 137,991\nOperating profit 395,529 117,934 6,408 — 519,871\nSelling, general, and administrative expenses 34,348 15,708 4,426 14,216 68,698\nAcquisition and new business initiatives\nrelated adjustments and expenses 5,298 2,119 — — 7,417\nAsset impairment and decommission costs 29,913 13,735 — — 43,648\nDepreciation, amortization and accretion 40,345 33,829 834 1,742 76,750\nOperating income (loss) 285,625 52,543 1,148 (15,958) 323,358\nOther expense, net (principally interest\nexpense and other income) (151,888) (151,888)\nIncome before income taxes 171,470\nCash capital expenditures (3) 41,021 35,602 59 594 77,276\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2023\nRevenues (1) $ 454,833 $ 162,435 $ 58,248 $ — $ 675,516\nCost of revenues (2) 69,750 50,369 44,185 — 164,304\nOperating profit 385,083 112,066 14,063 — 511,212\nSelling, general, and administrative expenses 31,743 16,730 6,077 17,659 72,209\nAcquisition and new business initiatives\nrelated adjustments and expenses 3,232 2,825 — — 6,057\nAsset impairment and decommission costs 19,435 4,886 — 2,069 26,390\nDepreciation, amortization and accretion 119,487 60,412 916 1,600 182,415\nOperating income (loss) 211,186 27,213 7,070 (21,328) 224,141\nOther expense, net (principally interest\nexpense and other income) (80,079) (80,079)\nIncome before income taxes 144,062\nCash capital expenditures (3) 44,636 23,033 395 1,256 69,320\nDomestic Site Int'l Site Site\nLeasing Leasing Development Other (4) Total\nAssets (in thousands)\nAs of March 31, 2024 $ 5,832,986 $ 3,743,958 $ 42,665 $ 375,657 $ 9,995,266\nAs of December 31, 2023 $ 5,876,648 $ 3,871,164 $ 66,001 $ 364,628 $ 10,178,441\n(1) For the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, site leasing revenue in Brazil was $97.5 million and $93.8 million,\nrespectively.

EARNINGS PER SHARE\nBasic earnings per share was computed by dividing net income attributable to SBA Communications Corporation by the\nweighted-average number of shares of Class A common stock outstanding for each respective period. Diluted earnings per share was\ncalculated by dividing net income attributable to SBA Communications Corporation by the weighted-average number of shares of Class\nA common stock outstanding adjusted for any dilutive Class A common stock equivalents, including unvested RSUs, PSUs, and shares\nissuable upon exercise of stock options as determined under the “Treasury Stock” method.\nThe following table sets forth basic and diluted net income per common share attributable to common shareholders for the\nthree months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023 (in thousands, except per share data):\nFor the three months\nended March 31,\n2024 2023\nNumerator:\nNet income attributable to SBA\nCommunications Corporation $ 154,543 $ 101,217\nDenominator:\nBasic weighted-average shares outstanding 108,102 108,132\nDilutive impact of stock options, RSUs, and PSUs 514 1,139\nDiluted weighted-average shares outstanding 108,616 109,271\nNet income per common share attributable to SBA\nCommunications Corporation:\nBasic $ 1.43 $ 0.94\nDiluted $ 1.42 $ 0.93\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, the diluted weighted-average number of common shares outstanding\nexcluded an immaterial number of shares issuable upon exercise of the Company’s stock options because the impact would be anti-\ndilutive.\n16. REDEEMABLE NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS\nThe Company allocates income and losses to its redeemable noncontrolling interest holders based on the applicable\nmembership interest percentage. At each reporting period, the redeemable noncontrolling interest is recognized at the greater of (1) the\ninitial carrying amount of the noncontrolling interest as adjusted for accumulated income or loss attributable to the noncontrolling\ninterest holder or (2) the redemption value as of the balance sheet date. Adjustments to the carrying amount of redeemable\nnoncontrolling interest are charged against retained earnings (or additional paid-in capital if there are no retained earnings). The fair\nvalue of the redeemable noncontrolling interest is estimated using Level 3 inputs.\nThe components of redeemable noncontrolling interests as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023 are as follows (in\nthousands):\nMarch 31, December 31,\n2024 2023\nBeginning balance $ 35,047 $ 31,735\nNet loss attributable to noncontrolling interests — (4,397)\nForeign currency translation adjustments — (899)\nContribution from joint venture partner 1,530 1,200\nAdjustment to redemption amount — 7,408\nEnding balance $ 36,577 $ 35,047\n17. DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES\nThe Company enters into interest rate swaps to hedge the future interest expense from variable rate debt and reduce the\nCompany’s exposure to fluctuations in interest rates. As of March 31, 2024, the Company has an interest rate swap agreement on\nits 2024 Term Loan which swaps $1.95 billion of notional value accruing interest at one month Term SOFR plus 200 basis points for\nan all-in fixed rate of 2.050% per annum through March 31, 2025. Additionally, the Company has a forward-starting interest rate\n19\nTable of Contents\nswap agreement which will swap $1.0 billion of notional value accruing interest at one month Term SOFR plus 200 basis points for an\nall-in fixed rate of 5.830% per annum. The forward-starting swap has an effective start date of March 31, 2025 and a maturity date of\nApril 11, 2028.\nAs of March 31, 2024, the hedges remain highly effective; therefore, changes in fair value are recorded in Accumulated other\ncomprehensive loss, net. The table below outlines the effects of the Company’s interest rate swaps on the Consolidated Balance Sheets\nas of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023.\nFair Value as of\nBalance Sheet March 31, December 31,\nLocation 2024 2023\nDerivatives Designated as Hedging Instruments (in thousands)\nInterest rate swap agreements in a fair value asset position Other assets $ 93,514 $ 104,674\nOther long-term\nInterest rate swap agreement in a fair value liability position liabilities $ 4,125 $ 19,573\nAccumulated other comprehensive loss, net includes an aggregate $62.3 million gain and a $51.5 million gain as of March\n31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.\nThe Company is exposed to counterparty credit risk to the extent that a counterparty fails to meet the terms of a contract.\nThe Company’s exposure is limited to the current value of the contract at the time the counterparty fails to perform.\nThe cash flows associated with these activities are reported in Net cash provided by operating activities on the Consolidated\nStatements of Cash Flows.\nThe table below outlines the effects of the Company’s derivatives on the Consolidated Statements of Operations and\nConsolidated Statements of Shareholders’ Deficit for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023.\nFor the three months\nended March 31,\n2024 2023\nCash Flow Hedge - Interest Rate Swap Agreement (in thousands)\nChange in fair value recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss, net $ 4,289 $ (31,396)\nDerivatives Not Designated as Hedges - Interest Rate Swap Agreements\nAmount reclassified from Accumulated other comprehensive\nloss, net into Non-cash interest expense $ 6,579 $ 9,007\nITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF\nOPERATIONS\nWe are a leading independent owner and operator of wireless communications infrastructure, including tower structures,\nrooftops, and other structures that support antennas used for wireless communications, which we collectively refer to as “towers” or\n“sites.” Our principal operations are in the United States and its territories. In addition, we own and operate towers in South America,\nCentral America, Canada, South Africa, the Philippines, and Tanzania. Our primary business line is our site leasing business, which\ncontributed 98.8% of our total segment operating profit for the three months ended March 31, 2024. In our site leasing business, we (1)\nlease space to wireless service providers and other customers on assets that we own or operate and (2) manage rooftop and tower sites\nfor property owners under various contractual arrangements. As of March 31, 2024, we owned 39,638 towers, a substantial portion of\nwhich have been built by us or built by other tower owners or operators who, like us, have built such towers to lease space to multiple\nwireless service providers. Our other business line is our site development business, through which we assist wireless service providers\nin developing and maintaining their own wireless service networks.\nSite Leasing\nOur primary focus is the leasing of antenna space on our multi-tenant towers to a variety of wireless service providers under\nlong-term lease contracts in the United States, South America, Central America, Canada, South Africa, the Philippines, and Tanzania.\nAs of March 31, 2024, no U.S. state or territory accounted for more than 10% of our total tower portfolio by tower count, and no U.S.\nstate or territory accounted for more than 10% of our total revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2024. In addition, as of\n20\nTable of Contents\nMarch 31, 2024, approximately 30% of our total towers are located in Brazil and no other international market (each country is\nconsidered a market) represented more than 5% of our total towers.\nWe derive site leasing revenues primarily from wireless service provider tenants. Wireless service providers enter into (1)\nindividual tenant site leases with us, each of which relates to the lease or use of space at an individual site or (2) master lease\nagreements with us, which provide for the material terms and conditions that will apply to multiple sites; although, in most cases, each\nindividual site under a master lease agreement is also governed by its own site leasing agreement which sets forth pricing and other site\nspecific terms. Our tenant leases are generally for an initial term of five years to fifteen years with multiple renewal periods at the\noption of the tenant. Our tenant leases typically either (1) contain specific annual rent escalators, (2) escalate annually in accordance\nwith an inflationary index, or (3) escalate using a combination of fixed and inflation adjusted escalators. In addition, our international\nsite leases may include pass-through charges, such as rent related to ground leases and other property interests, utilities, property taxes,\nand fuel.\nCost of site leasing revenue primarily consists of:\n(cid:0) Cash and non-cash rental expense on ground leases, right-of-use, and other underlying property interests;\n(cid:0) Property taxes;\n(cid:0) Site maintenance and monitoring costs (exclusive of employee related costs);\n(cid:0) Utilities;\n(cid:0) Property insurance;\n(cid:0) Fuel (in those international markets that do not have an available electric grid at our tower sites); and\n(cid:0) Lease initial direct cost amortization.\nGround leases and other property interests are generally for an initial term of five years or more with multiple renewal periods,\nwhich are at our option. Our ground leases either (1) contain specific annual rent escalators or (2) escalate annually in accordance with\nan inflationary index. As of March 31, 2024, approximately 71% of our tower structures were located on parcels of land that we own,\nland subject to perpetual easements, or parcels of land in which we have a leasehold interest that extends beyond 20 years. For any\ngiven tower, costs are relatively fixed over a monthly or an annual time period. As such, operating costs for owned towers do not\ngenerally increase as a result of adding additional customers to the tower. The amount of property taxes varies from site to site\ndepending on the taxing jurisdiction and the height and age of the tower. The ongoing maintenance requirements are typically minimal\nand include replacing lighting systems, painting a tower, or upgrading or repairing an access road or fencing.\nIn Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Nicaragua, and Panama, significantly all of our revenue, expenses, and capital\nexpenditures arising from our activities are denominated in U.S. dollars. Specifically, most of our ground leases and other property\ninterests, tenant leases, and tower-related expenses are paid in U.S. dollars. In our Central American markets, our local currency\nobligations are principally limited to (1) permitting and other local fees, (2) utilities, and (3) taxes. In Brazil, Canada, Chile, South\nAfrica, and the Philippines, significantly all of our revenue, expenses, and capital expenditures, including tenant leases, ground leases\nand other property interests, and other tower-related expenses are denominated in local currency. In Colombia, Costa Rica, Peru, and\nTanzania, our revenue, expenses, and capital expenditures, including tenant leases, ground leases and other property interests, and other\ntower-related expenses are denominated in a mix of local currency and U.S. dollars.\nAs indicated in the table below, our site leasing business generates substantially all of our total segment operating profit. For\ninformation regarding our operating segments, see Note 14 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this quarterly report.\nFor the three months ended\nSegment operating profit as a percentage of March 31,\ntotal operating profit 2024 2023\nDomestic site leasing 76.1% 75.3%\nInternational site leasing 22.7% 21.9%\nTotal site leasing 98.8% 97.2%\nWe believe that the site leasing business continues to be attractive due to its long-term contracts, built-in rent escalators, high\noperating margins, and low customer churn (which refers to a lease that is non-renewed, cancelled, or discounted prior to the end of its\nterm) other than in connection with customer consolidation or cessations of specific technology. We believe that over the long-term, site\nleasing revenues will continue to grow as wireless service providers lease additional antenna space on our towers due to increasing\nminutes of network use and data transfer, network expansion, and network coverage requirements.\nDuring the remainder of 2024, we expect organic site leasing revenue in both our domestic and international segments to\nincrease over 2023 levels due in part to wireless carriers deploying unused spectrum. We believe our site leasing business is\n21\nTable of Contents\ncharacterized by stable and long-term recurring revenues, predictable operating costs, and minimal non-discretionary capital\nexpenditures. Due to the relatively young age and mix of our tower portfolio, we expect future expenditures required to maintain these\ntowers to be minimal. Consequently, we expect to grow our cash flows by (1) adding tenants to our towers at minimal incremental costs\nby using existing tower capacity or requiring wireless service providers to bear all or a portion of the cost of tower modifications and\n(2) executing monetary amendments as wireless service providers add or upgrade their equipment. Furthermore, because our towers are\nstrategically positioned, we have historically experienced low tenant lease terminations as a percentage of revenue other than in\nconnection with customer consolidation or cessations of a specific technology.\nSite Development\nOur site development business, which is conducted in the United States only, is complementary to our site leasing business and\nprovides us the ability to keep in close contact with the wireless service providers who generate substantially all of our site leasing\nrevenue and to capture ancillary revenues that are generated by our site leasing activities, such as antenna and equipment installation at\nour tower locations. Site development revenues are earned primarily from providing a full range of end-to-end services to wireless\nservice providers or companies providing development or project management services to wireless service providers. Our services\ninclude: (1) network pre-design; (2) site audits; (3) identification of potential locations for towers and antennas on existing\ninfrastructure; (4) support in leasing of the location; (5) assistance in obtaining zoning approvals and permits; (6) tower and related site\nconstruction; (7) antenna installation; and (8) radio equipment installation, commissioning, and maintenance. We provide site\ndevelopment services at our towers and at towers owned by others on a local basis, through regional, market, and project offices. The\nmarket offices are responsible for all site development operations.\nFor information regarding our operating segments, see Note 14 to our Consolidated Financial Statements in this quarterly\nreport.\nCapital Allocation Strategy\nOur capital allocation strategy is aimed at increasing shareholder value through investment in quality assets that meet our\nreturn criteria, stock repurchases when we believe our stock price is below its intrinsic value, and by returning cash generated by our\noperations in the form of cash dividends. In addition, in a high interest rate environment and when we believe interest rates may stay\nhigher for longer, we believe that debt repayments, especially of our variable rate debt, may be an accretive use of our excess capital.\nWhile the addition of cash dividends and debt repayments have provided us with additional tools to return value to our shareholders, we\ncontinue to believe that our priority is to make investments focused on increasing Adjusted Funds From Operations per share. Key\nelements of our capital allocation strategy include:\nPortfolio Growth. We intend to continue to grow our asset portfolio, domestically and internationally, primarily through tower\nacquisitions and the construction of new towers that meet our internal return on invested capital criteria.\nStock Repurchase Program. We currently utilize stock repurchases as part of our capital allocation policy when we believe our\nshare price is below its intrinsic value. We believe that share repurchases, when purchased at the right price, will facilitate our goal of\nincreasing our Adjusted Funds From Operations per share.\nDividend. Cash dividends are an additional component of our strategy of returning value to shareholders. We do not expect our\ndividend to require any changes in our leverage and believe that, due to our low dividend payout ratio, we can continue to focus on\nbuilding and buying quality assets and opportunistically buying back our stock. While the timing and amount of future dividends will\nbe subject to approval by our Board of Directors, we believe that our future cash flow generation will permit us to grow our cash\ndividend in the future.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nWe have identified the policies and significant estimation processes listed below and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K as\ncritical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations. The listing is not intended to be a comprehensive\nlist. In many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by accounting principles generally\naccepted in the United States, with no need for management’s judgment in their application. In other cases, management is required to\nexercise judgment in the application of accounting principles with respect to particular transactions. The impact and any associated\nrisks related to these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial\nCondition and Results of Operations” where such policies affect reported and expected financial results. For a detailed discussion on\nthe application of these and other accounting policies, see Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements contained in our Annual\nReport on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Our preparation of our financial statements requires us to make\n22\nTable of Contents\nestimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the\ndate of our financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. Management bases its\nestimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. There\ncan be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates and such differences could be significant.\nDuring the first quarter of 2024, we completed our assessment on the remaining estimated useful lives of our towers and\nintangible assets. We concluded through our assessment that we should modify our current estimates for asset lives based on our\nhistorical operating experience and the findings obtained by our independent consultant. We previously depreciated our towers on a\nstraight-line basis over the shorter of the term of the underlying ground lease (including renewal options) taking into account residual\nvalue or the estimated useful life of the tower, which we had historically estimated to be 15 years. Based on our assessment, we revised\nthe estimated useful lives of our towers and certain related intangible assets (which are amortized on a similar basis to our tower assets,\nas their useful lives correlate to the useful life of the towers) from 15 years to 30 years, effective January 1, 2024. We accounted for the\nchange in estimated useful lives as a change in estimate under ASC 250 “Accounting Changes and Error Corrections.” The impact of\nthe change in estimate was accounted for prospectively effective January 1, 2024, resulting in a reduction in depreciation and\namortization expense of approximately $102.7 million ($93.0 million after tax, or an increase of $0.86 per diluted share) for the three\nmonths ended March 31, 2024. The change in useful lives is expected to reduce depreciation expense by approximately $411.5 million\n($372.5 million after tax, or an increase of $3.43 per diluted share) for the year ended December 31, 2024.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThis report presents our financial results and other financial metrics on a GAAP basis and, with respect to our international\nand consolidated results, after eliminating the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. We believe that providing these\nfinancial results and metrics on a constant currency basis, which are non-GAAP measures, gives management and investors the ability\nto evaluate the performance of our business without the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. We eliminate the impact\nof changes in foreign currency exchange rates by dividing the current period’s financial results by the average monthly exchange rates\nof the prior year period, as well as by eliminating the impact of realized and unrealized gains and losses on our intercompany loans.\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2024 Compared to Three Months Ended March 31, 2023\nRevenues and Segment Operating Profit:\nFor the three months ended Constant\nMarch 31, Foreign Constant Currency\n2024 2023 Currency Impact Currency Change % Change\nRevenues (in thousands)\nDomestic site leasing $ 461,499 $ 454,833 $ — $ 6,666 1.5%\nInternational site leasing 166,777 162,435 1,944 2,398 1.5%\nSite development 29,586 58,248 — (28,662) (49.2%)\nTotal $ 657,862 $ 675,516 $ 1,944 $ (19,598) (2.9%)\nCost of Revenues\nDomestic site leasing $ 65,970 $ 69,750 $ — $ (3,780) (5.4%)\nInternational site leasing 48,843 50,369 1 (1,527) (3.0%)\nSite development 23,178 44,185 — (21,007) (47.5%)\nTotal $ 137,991 $ 164,304 $ 1 $ (26,314) (16.0%)\nOperating Profit\nDomestic site leasing $ 395,529 $ 385,083 $ — $ 10,446 2.7%\nInternational site leasing 117,934 112,066 1,943 3,925 3.5%\nSite development 6,408 14,063 — (7,655) (54.4%)\nRevenues\nDomestic site leasing revenues increased $6.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024, as compared to the prior\nyear, primarily due to (1) organic site leasing growth, primarily from monetary lease amendments (due in part to our 2023 master lease\nagreement with AT&T) and additional equipment added to our towers as well as new leases and contractual rent escalators and (2)\nrevenues from 81 towers acquired and 17 towers built since January 1, 2023, partially offset by lease non-renewals.\nInternational site leasing revenues increased $4.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024, as compared to the prior\nyear.

This change\nwas primarily due to a lower average principal amount of cash-interest bearing debt outstanding accruing interest, partially offset by a\nhigher interest rate on said debt as compared to the prior year.\nNon-cash interest expense decreased $5.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024, as compared to the prior year.\nThis change was primarily due to lower amortization of accumulated losses related to our interest rate swaps de-designated as cash flow\nhedges which reached their term end date in 2023.\nLoss from extinguishment of debt, net was $4.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024 due to the write-off of the\noriginal issuance discount and unamortized financing fees associated with the repayment of the 2018 Term Loan in January 2024.\nOther (expense) income, net includes a $42.3 million loss on the remeasurement of U.S. dollar denominated intercompany\nloans with foreign subsidiaries for the three months ended March 31, 2024, while the prior year period included a $41.9 million gain.\nProvision for Income Taxes:\nFor the three months ended Constant\nMarch 31, Foreign Constant Currency\n2024 2023 Currency Impact Currency Change % Change\n(in thousands)\nProvision for income taxes $ (16,927) $ (43,508) $ 28,088 $ (1,507) 5.1%\nProvision for income taxes decreased $26.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024, as compared to the prior year\nprimarily due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and a decrease in foreign current taxes.\nNet Income:\nFor the three months ended Constant\nMarch 31, Foreign Constant Currency\n2024 2023 Currency Impact Currency Change % Change\n(in thousands)\nNet income $ 154,543 $ 100,554 $ (54,024) $ 108,013 146.2%\nNet income increased $54.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024, as compared to the prior year. On a constant\ncurrency basis, net income increased $108.0 million. These changes were primarily due to increases in site leasing operating income\n(inclusive of a $93.0 million benefit related to our revision of the estimated useful lives of our towers and certain intangible assets),\ninterest income, and other (expense) income, net and decreases in non-cash interest expense and interest expense, partially offset by\nincreases in loss from extinguishment of debt and provision for income taxes.\n26\nTable of Contents\nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\nThis report contains information regarding Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure. We have provided below a description\nof Adjusted EBITDA, a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to its most directly comparable GAAP measure and an explanation as to\nwhy management utilizes this measure. This report also presents our financial results and other financial metrics after eliminating the\nimpact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. We believe that providing these financial results and metrics on a constant\ncurrency basis, which are non-GAAP measures, gives management and investors the ability to evaluate the performance of our business\nwithout the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. We eliminate the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange\nrates by dividing the current period’s financial results by the average monthly exchange rates of the prior year period, as well as by\neliminating the impact of the remeasurement of our intercompany loans.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nWe define Adjusted EBITDA as net income excluding the impact of non-cash straight-line leasing revenue, non-cash straight-\nline ground lease expense, non-cash compensation, net loss from extinguishment of debt, other income and expenses, acquisition and\nnew business initiatives related adjustments and expenses, asset impairment and decommission costs, interest income, interest\nexpenses, depreciation, accretion, and amortization, and income taxes.\nWe believe that Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors or other interested parties in evaluating our financial performance.\nAdjusted EBITDA is the primary measure used by management (1) to evaluate the economic productivity of our operations and (2) for\npurposes of making decisions about allocating resources to, and assessing the performance of, our operations. Management believes\nthat Adjusted EBITDA helps investors or other interested parties to meaningfully evaluate and compare the results of our operations (1)\nfrom period to period and (2) to our competitors, by excluding the impact of our capital structure (primarily interest charges from our\noutstanding debt) and asset base (primarily depreciation, amortization, and accretion) from our financial results. Management also\nbelieves Adjusted EBITDA is frequently used by investors or other interested parties in the evaluation of REITs. In addition, Adjusted\nEBITDA is similar to the measure of current financial performance generally used by our lenders to determine compliance with certain\ncovenants under our Senior Credit Agreement and the indentures relating to the 2020 Senior Notes and 2021 Senior Notes. Adjusted\nEBITDA should be considered only as a supplement to net income computed in accordance with GAAP as a measure of our\nperformance.\nFor the three months ended Constant\nMarch 31, Foreign Constant Currency\n2024 2023 Currency Impact Currency Change % Change\n(in thousands)\nNet income $ 154,543 $ 100,554 $ (54,024) $ 108,013 146.2%\nNon-cash straight-line leasing revenue (4,092) (6,849) 90 2,667 (38.9%)\nNon-cash straight-line ground lease expense (3,383) 723 (13) (4,093) (566.1%)\nNon-cash compensation 21,469 26,206 24 (4,761) (18.2%)\nLoss from extinguishment of debt, net 4,428 — — 4,428 —%\nOther expense (income), net 44,652 (37,558) 83,863 (1,653) (49.2%)\nAcquisition and new business initiatives\nrelated adjustments and expenses 7,417 6,057 — 1,360 22.5%\nAsset impairment and decommission costs 43,648 26,390 (124) 17,382 65.9%\nInterest income (7,314) (2,816) (107) (4,391) 155.9%\nInterest expense (1) 110,122 120,453 (71) (10,260) (8.5%)\nDepreciation, accretion, and amortization 76,750 182,415 401 (106,066) (58.1%)\nProvision for income taxes (2) 17,172 43,765 (28,085) 1,492 5.1%\nAdjusted EBITDA $ 465,412 $ 459,340 $ 1,954 $ 4,118 0.9%\n(1) Total interest expense includes interest expense, non-cash interest expense, and amortization of deferred financing fees.\n(2) Provision for income taxes includes $0.2 million and $0.3 million of franchise taxes for the three months ended March 31,\n2024 and 2023, respectively, reflected in selling, general, and administrative expenses on the Consolidated Statements of\nOperations.\nAdjusted EBITDA increased $6.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024, as compared to the prior year period.\nOn a constant currency basis, Adjusted EBITDA increased $4.1 million. These changes were primarily due to an increase in site\n27\nTable of Contents\nleasing segment operating profit, partially offset by a decrease in site development segment operating profit and an increase in cash\nselling, general, and administrative expenses.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nSBA Communications Corporation (“SBAC”) is a holding company with no business operations of its own. SBAC’s only\nsignificant asset is 100% of the outstanding capital stock of SBA Telecommunications, LLC (“Telecommunications”), which is also a\nholding company that owns equity interests in entities that directly or indirectly own all of our domestic and international towers and\nassets. We conduct all of our business operations through Telecommunications’ subsidiaries. Accordingly, our only source of cash to\npay our obligations, other than financings, is distributions with respect to our ownership interest in our subsidiaries from the net\nearnings and cash flow generated by these subsidiaries.\nA summary of our cash flows is as follows:\nFor the three months ended March 31,\n2024 2023\n(in thousands)\nCash provided by operating activities $ 294,453 $ 311,168\nCash used in investing activities (85,310) (146,761)\nCash used in financing activities (191,412) (160,728)\nChange in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash 17,731 3,679\nEffect of exchange rate changes on cash, cash equiv., and restricted cash (4,345) 220\nCash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash, beginning of period 250,946 189,283\nCash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash, end of period $ 264,332 $ 193,182\nOperating Activities\nCash provided by operating activities was $294.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024 as compared to $311.2\nmillion for the three months ended March 31, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to increases in cash outflows associated with\nworking capital changes related to the timing of customer payments and cash asset impairment and decommission costs as well as a\ndecrease in site development segment operating profit, partially offset by an increase in site leasing segment operating profit and\ninterest income and a decrease in interest expense.\nInvesting Activities\nA detail of our cash capital expenditures is as follows:\nFor the three months ended March 31,\n2024 2023\n(in thousands)\nAcquisitions of towers and related assets $ (10,295) $ (12,780)\nLand buyouts and other assets (1) (9,110) (7,149)\nConstruction and related costs (34,782) (21,566)\nAugmentation and tower upgrades (13,064) (15,791)\nTower maintenance (8,858) (10,743)\nGeneral corporate (1,167) (1,035)\nOther investing activities (2)(3) (8,034) (77,697)\nNet cash used in investing activities $ (85,310) $ (146,761)\n(1) Excludes $4.6 million and $5.1 million spent to extend ground lease terms for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and\n2023, respectively.\n(2) Includes amounts paid for the purchase of and received from the sale of short-term investments during the three months ended\nMarch 31, 2024 and 2023.\n(3) The three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023 includes a $5.5 million and $78.0 million loan to an unconsolidated joint\nventure, respectively.\n28\nTable of Contents\nAdditionally, subsequent to March 31, 2024, we purchased or are under contract to purchase 271 communication sites for an\naggregate consideration of $84.5 million in cash. We anticipate that these acquisitions will be consummated by the end of the third\nquarter of 2024.\nFor 2024, we expect to incur non-discretionary cash capital expenditures associated with tower maintenance and general\ncorporate expenditures of $51.0 million to $61.0 million and discretionary cash capital expenditures, based on current or potential\nacquisition obligations, planned new tower construction, forecasted tower augmentations, and forecasted ground lease purchases, of\n$335.0 million to $355.0 million. We expect to fund these cash capital expenditures from cash on hand, cash flow from operations, and\nborrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility or new financings. The exact amount of our future cash capital expenditures will\ndepend on a number of factors, including amounts necessary to support our tower portfolio, our new tower build and acquisition\nprograms, and our ground lease purchase program.\nFinancing Activities\nA detail of our financing activities is as follows:\nFor the three months ended March 31,\n2024 2023\n(in thousands)\nNet borrowings (repayments) under Revolving Credit Facility (1) $ 15,000 $ (45,000)\nProceeds from issuance of Term Loans, net of fees (1) 2,274,825 —\nRepayment of Term Loans (1) (2,268,000) (6,000)\nRepurchase and retirement of common stock (2) (106,157) —\nPayment of dividends on common stock (108,135) (93,933)\nProceeds from employee stock purchase/stock option plans 17,091 11,942\nPayments related to taxes on stock options and restricted stock units (17,800) (26,658)\nOther financing activities 1,764 (1,079)\nNet cash used in financing activities $ (191,412) $ (160,728)\n(1) For additional information regarding our debt instruments and financings, refer to “Debt Instruments and Debt Service\nRequirements” below.\n(2) For additional information regarding our share repurchase activity, refer to Part II Item 2 under “Issuer Purchases of Equity\nSecurities” below.\nDividends\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2024, we paid the following cash dividends:\nPayable to Shareholders\nof Record at the Close Cash Paid Aggregate Amount\nDate Declared of Business on Per Share Paid Date Paid\nFebruary 26, 2024 March 14, 2024 $0.98 $108.1 million March 28, 2024\nDividends paid in 2024 were ordinary taxable dividends.\nSubsequent to March 31, 2024, we declared the following cash dividends:\nPayable to Shareholders Cash to\nof Record at the Close be Paid\nDate Declared of Business on Per Share Date to be Paid\nApril 29, 2024 May 23, 2024 $0.98 June 19, 2024\nThe amount of future distributions will be determined, from time to time, by our Board of Directors to balance our goal of\nincreasing long-term shareholder value and retaining sufficient cash to implement our current capital allocation policy, which prioritizes\ninvestment in quality assets that meet our return criteria, and then stock repurchases when we believe our stock price is below its\nintrinsic value. The actual amount, timing, and frequency of future dividends will be at the sole discretion of our Board of Directors and\nwill be declared based upon various factors, many of which are beyond our control.\n29\nTable of Contents\nRegistration Statements\nWe have on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “Commission”) a shelf registration statement on Form S-4\nregistering shares of Class A common stock that we may issue in connection with the acquisition of wireless communication towers or\nantenna sites and related assets or companies who own wireless communication towers, antenna sites, or related assets. During the three\nmonths ended March 31, 2024, we did not issue any shares of Class A common stock under this registration statement. As of March 31,\n2024, we had approximately 1.2 million shares of Class A common stock remaining under this registration statement.\nOn February 29, 2024, we filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission an automatic shelf registration statement for\nwell-known seasoned issuers on Form S-3ASR, which enables us to issue shares of its Class A common stock, preferred stock, debt\nsecurities, warrants, or depositary shares as well as units that include any of these securities. We will file a prospectus supplement\ncontaining the amount and type of securities each time we issue securities under our automatic shelf registration statement on Form S-\n3ASR. During the three months ended March 31, 2024, we did not issue any securities under this automatic shelf registration statement.\nDebt Instruments and Debt Service Requirements\nTerms of the Senior Credit Agreement\nOn January 25, 2024, we, through our wholly owned subsidiary SBA Senior Finance II LLC (“SBA Senior Finance II”),\namended and restated our Senior Credit Agreement to (1) issue a new $2.3 billion Term Loan and retire the 2018 Term Loan, (2)\nincrease the total commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility from $1.5 billion to $1.75 billion, (3) extend the maturity date of\nthe Revolving Credit Facility to January 25, 2029, and (4) amend certain other terms and conditions under the Senior Credit Agreement.\nThe proceeds from the 2024 Term Loan were used to retire our 2018 Term Loan and to pay related fees and expenses.\nOn February 23, 2024, we, through our wholly owned subsidiary, SBA Senior Finance II, further increased the total\ncommitments under the Revolving Credit Facility from $1.75 billion to $2.0 billion.\nAs of March 31, 2024, SBA Senior Finance II was in compliance with the financial covenants contained in the Senior Credit\nAgreement.\nRevolving Credit Facility under the Senior Credit Agreement\nThe Revolving Credit Facility consists of a revolving loan under which up to $2.0 billion aggregate principal amount may be\nborrowed, repaid and redrawn, based upon specific financial ratios and subject to the satisfaction of other customary conditions to\nborrowing through the maturity date of January 25, 2029. Amounts borrowed under the Revolving Credit Facility accrue interest, at\nSBA Senior Finance II’s election, at either (1) the Eurodollar Rate or Term SOFR Rate plus a margin that ranges from 112.5 basis\npoints to 150.0 basis points or (2) the Base Rate plus a margin that ranges from 12.5 basis points to 50.0 basis points, in each case based\non the ratio of Consolidated Net Debt to Annualized Borrower EBITDA, calculated in accordance with the Senior Credit Agreement. In\naddition, SBA Senior Finance II, is required to pay a commitment fee of between 0.15% and 0.25% per annum on the amount of unused\ncommitment. Furthermore, the Revolving Credit Facility incorporates sustainability-linked targets which will adjust the Revolving\nCredit Facility’s applicable interest and commitment fee rates upward or downward based on how we perform against those targets.\nBorrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility may be used for general corporate purposes. SBA Senior Finance II may, from time to\ntime, borrow from and repay the Revolving Credit Facility. Consequently, the amount outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility\nat the end of the period may not be reflective of the total amounts outstanding during such period.\nThe key terms of the Revolving Credit Facility are as follows:\nUnused\nInterest Rate Commitment\nas of Fee as of\nMarch 31, 2024 (1) March 31, 2024 (2)\nRevolving Credit Facility 6.395% 0.140%\n(1) The rate reflected includes a 0.050% reduction in the applicable spread as a result of meeting certain sustainability-linked\ntargets as of December 31, 2023.\n(2) The rate reflected includes a 0.010% reduction in the applicable commitment fee as a result of meeting certain sustainability-\nlinked targets as of December 31, 2023.\n30\nTable of Contents\nThe table below summarizes our Revolving Credit Facility activity during the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023\n(in thousands):\nFor the three months\nended March 31,\n2024 2023\nBeginning outstanding balance $ 180,000 $ 720,000\nBorrowings 125,000 140,000\nRepayments (110,000) (185,000)\nEnding outstanding balance $ 195,000 $ 675,000\nSubsequent to March 31, 2024, we repaid $50.0 million and borrowed $50.0 million under the Revolving Credit Facility, and\nas of the date of this filing, $195.0 million was outstanding.\nTerm Loan under the Senior Credit Agreement\n2024 Term Loan\nOn January 25, 2024, we, through our wholly owned subsidiary, SBA Senior Finance II, issued a term loan (the “2024 Term\nLoan”) under the amended and restated Senior Credit Agreement. The 2024 Term Loan consists of a senior secured term loan with an\ninitial aggregate principal amount of $2.3 billion that matures on January 25, 2031. The 2024 Term Loan accrues interest, at SBA\nSenior Finance II's election, at either the Base Rate plus 100 basis points (with a zero Base Rate floor) or at Term SOFR plus 200 basis\npoints (with a floor of 0%). The 2024 Term Loan was issued at 99.75% of par value. The proceeds from the 2024 Term Loan were used\nto retire the 2018 Term Loan and to pay related fees and expenses. In connection with the repayment, we expensed $3.3 million of net\ndeferred financing fees and $1.2 million of discount related to the debt. As of March 31, 2024, the 2024 Term Loan was accruing\ninterest at 7.340% per annum.\nPrincipal payments on the 2024 Term Loan will be made in quarterly installments on the last day of each March, June,\nSeptember, and December in an amount equal to $5.75 million beginning on June 30, 2024. We incurred financing fees of\napproximately $19.4 million in relation to this transaction, which are being amortized through the maturity date.\nSecured Tower Revenue Securities\nTower Revenue Securities Terms\nAs of March 31, 2024, we, through a New York common law trust (the “Trust”), had issued and outstanding an aggregate of\n$6.9 billion of Secured Tower Revenue Securities (“Tower Securities”). The sole asset of the Trust consists of a non-recourse mortgage\nloan made in favor of certain of our subsidiaries that are borrowers on the mortgage loan (the “Borrowers”) under which there is a loan\ntranche for each Tower Security outstanding with the same interest rate and maturity date as the corresponding Tower Security. The\nmortgage loan will be paid from the operating cash flows from the aggregate 9,889 tower sites owned by the Borrowers as of March 31,\n2024. The mortgage loan is secured by (1) mortgages, deeds of trust, and deeds to secure debt on a substantial portion of the tower\nsites, (2) a security interest in the tower sites and substantially all of the Borrowers’ personal property and fixtures, (3) the Borrowers’\nrights under certain tenant leases, and (4) all of the proceeds of the foregoing. For each calendar month, SBA Network Management,\nInc., an indirect subsidiary (“Network Management”), is entitled to receive a management fee equal to 4.5% of the Borrowers’\noperating revenues for the immediately preceding calendar month.\n31\nTable of Contents\nThe table below sets forth the material terms of our outstanding Tower Securities as of March 31, 2024:\nAmount\nOutstanding Interest Anticipated Final Maturity\nSecurity Issue Date (in millions) Rate (1) Repayment Date Date\n2014-2C Tower Securities Oct. 15, 2014 $620.0 3.869% Oct. 8, 2024 Oct. 8, 2049\n2019-1C Tower Securities Sep. 13, 2019 $1,165.0 2.836% Jan. 12, 2025 Jan. 12, 2050\n2020-1C Tower Securities Jul. 14, 2020 $750.0 1.884% Jan. 9, 2026 Jul. 11, 2050\n2020-2C Tower Securities Jul. 14, 2020 $600.0 2.328% Jan. 11, 2028 Jul. 9, 2052\n2021-1C Tower Securities May 14, 2021 $1,165.0 1.631% Nov. 9, 2026 May 9, 2051\n2021-2C Tower Securities Oct. 27, 2021 $895.0 1.840% Apr. 9, 2027 Oct. 10, 2051\n2021-3C Tower Securities Oct. 27, 2021 $895.0 2.593% Oct. 9, 2031 Oct. 10, 2056\n2022-1C Tower Securities Nov. 23, 2022 $850.0 6.599% Jan. 11, 2028 Nov. 9, 2052\n(1) Interest paid monthly.\nRisk Retention Tower Securities\nThe table below sets forth the material terms of our outstanding Risk Retention Tower Securities as of March 31, 2024:\nAmount\nInterest\nOutstanding Anticipated Final Maturity\nSecurity Issue Date (in millions) Rate (1) Repayment Date Date\n2019-1R Tower Securities Sep. 13, 2019 $61.4 4.213% Jan. 12, 2025 Jan. 12, 2050\n2020-2R Tower Securities Jul. 14, 2020 $71.1 4.336% Jan. 11, 2028 Jul. 9, 2052\n2021-1R Tower Securities May 14, 2021 $61.4 3.598% Nov. 9, 2026 May 9, 2051\n2021-3R Tower Securities Oct. 27, 2021 $94.3 4.090% Oct. 9, 2031 Oct. 10, 2056\n2022-1R Tower Securities Nov. 23, 2022 $44.8 7.870% Jan. 11, 2028 Nov. 9, 2052\n(1) Interest paid monthly.\nTo satisfy certain risk retention requirements of Regulation RR promulgated under the Exchange Act, SBA Guarantor, LLC, a\nwholly owned subsidiary, purchased the Risk Retention Tower Securities.

Subsequent to March 31, 2024, we\nrepaid $50.0 million and borrowed $50.0 million under the Revolving Credit Facility, and as of the date of this filing, $195.0\nmillion was outstanding.\n(2) Total debt service on the 2024 Term Loan includes the impact of the interest rate swap which swaps $1.95 billion of notional\nvalue accruing interest at Term SOFR plus 200 basis points for an all-in fixed rate of 2.050% per annum through March 31,\n2025.\nInflation\nThe impact of inflation on our operations has not been material to date. However, the impact of rising interest rates, due to\nactions by the Federal Reserve to combat inflation, has impacted, and is expected to continue to impact, our growth rate and future\noperating results. Increasing interest rates has impacted, and is expected to continue to impact, the ability and willingness of wireless\nservice providers to incur capital expenditures at prior levels to expand their networks, which could adversely affect our future revenue\ngrowth rates. In addition, increased interest rates may adversely affect our costs to refinance our indebtedness at maturity. In addition,\npersistent high rates of inflation could adversely affect our future operating results particularly in light of the fact that our site leasing\nrevenues are governed by long-term contracts with pre-determined pricing that we will not be able to increase in response to increases\nin inflation other than our contracts in South America, South Africa, the Philippines, and Tanzania which have inflationary index based\nrent escalators.\nITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nWe are exposed to certain market risks that are inherent in our financial instruments. These instruments arise from transactions\nentered into in the normal course of business.\n33\nTable of Contents\nThe following table presents the future principal payment obligations and fair values associated with our long-term debt\ninstruments assuming our actual level of long-term indebtedness as of March 31, 2024:\n2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 Thereafter Total Fair Value\n(in thousands)\nRevolving Credit Facility $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ 195,000 $ 195,000 $ 195,000\n2024 Term Loan 17,250 23,000 23,000 23,000 23,000 2,190,750 2,300,000 2,305,750\n2014-2C Tower Securities (1) 620,000 — — — — — 620,000 612,560\n2019-1C Tower Securities (1) — 1,165,000 — — — — 1,165,000 1,115,779\n2020-1C Tower Securities (1) — — 750,000 — — — 750,000 680,753\n2020-2C Tower Securities (1) — — — — 600,000 — 600,000 520,776\n2021-1C Tower Securities (1) — — 1,165,000 — — — 1,165,000 1,016,987\n2021-2C Tower Securities (1) — — — 895,000 — — 895,000 770,318\n2021-3C Tower Securities (1) — — — — — 895,000 895,000 684,979\n2022-1C Tower Securities (1) — — — — 850,000 — 850,000 870,655\n2020 Senior Notes — — — 1,500,000 — — 1,500,000 1,425,690\n2021 Senior Notes — — — — — 1,500,000 1,500,000 1,327,500\nTotal debt obligation $ 637,250 $ 1,188,000 $ 1,938,000 $ 2,418,000 $ 1,473,000 $ 4,780,750 $ 12,435,000 $ 11,526,747\n(1) For information on the anticipated repayment date and final maturity date for each Tower Security, refer to “Debt Instruments\nand Debt Service Requirements” above.\nOur current primary market risk exposure is (1) interest rate risk relating to our ability to refinance our debt at commercially\nreasonable rates, if at all, and (2) interest rate risk relating to the impact of interest rate movements on the variable portion of our 2024\nTerm Loan and any borrowings that we may incur under our Revolving Credit Facility, which are at floating rates. We manage the\ninterest rate risk on our outstanding debt through our large percentage of fixed rate debt, including interest rate swaps. While we cannot\npredict our ability to refinance existing debt or the impact interest rate movements will have on our existing debt, we continue to\nevaluate our financial position on an ongoing basis.\nWe have performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical 1% increase in our variable interest rates as of March 31,\n2024. As of March 31, 2024, the analysis indicated that such an adverse movement would have caused our interest expense to increase\nby approximately 4.7% for the three months ended March 31, 2024.\nWe are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates in connection with our operations in Brazil,\nCanada, Chile, Peru, Colombia, South Africa, the Philippines, Tanzania, and to a lesser extent, our markets in Central America. In each\nof these countries, we pay most of our selling, general, and administrative expenses and a portion of our operating expenses, such as\ntaxes and utilities incurred in the country in local currency. In addition, in Brazil, Canada, Chile, South Africa, and the Philippines, we\nreceive significantly all of our revenue and pay significantly all of our operating expenses in local currency. In Colombia, Costa Rica,\nPeru, and Tanzania, we receive our revenue and pay our operating expenses in a mix of local currency and U.S. dollars. All transactions\ndenominated in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar are reported in U.S. Dollars at the applicable exchange rate. All assets and\nliabilities are translated into U.S. Dollars at exchange rates in effect at the end of the applicable fiscal reporting period, and all revenues\nand expenses are translated at average rates for the period. The cumulative translation effect is included in equity as a component of\nAccumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net. For the three months ended March 31, 2024, approximately 22.3% of our\nrevenues and approximately 29.7% of our total operating expenses were denominated in foreign currencies.\nWe have performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical 10% adverse movement in the Brazilian Real from the\nquoted foreign currency exchange rates at March 31, 2024. As of March 31, 2024, the analysis indicated that such an adverse\nmovement would have caused our revenues and operating income to decline by approximately 1.3% and 1.1%, respectively, for the\nthree months ended March 31, 2024.\nAs of March 31, 2024, we had intercompany debt, which is denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of\nthe subsidiary in which it is recorded. As settlement of this debt is anticipated or planned in the foreseeable future, any changes in the\nforeign currency exchange rates will result in unrealized gains or losses, which will be included in our determination of net income. A\nchange of 10% in the underlying exchange rates of our unsettled intercompany debt at March 31, 2024 would have resulted in\napproximately $125.5 million of unrealized gains or losses that would have been included in Other (expense) income, net in our\nConsolidated Statements of Operations for the three months ended March 31, 2024.\n34\nTable of Contents\nSpecial Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\nThis quarterly report contains “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933,\nas amended, and Section 21E of the Exchange Act.

(UNAUDITED)\n1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended\nDecember 31, 2023 for SBA Communications Corporation and its subsidiaries (the “Company”). These financial statements have been prepared in accordance\nwith the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X and, therefore, omit or condense certain footnotes and other information normally included\nin financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. In the opinion of the Company’s\nmanagement, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals and deferrals) considered necessary for fair financial statement presentation have been\nmade. The results of operations for an interim period may not give a true indication of the results for the year. Certain reclassifications have been made to prior\nyear amounts or balances to conform to the presentation adopted in the current year.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that\naffect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. The significant estimates made by management relate to the\nallowance for doubtful accounts, the costs and revenue relating to the Company’s construction contracts, stock-based compensation assumptions, valuation\nallowance related to deferred tax assets, fair value of long-lived assets, the useful lives of towers and intangible assets, anticipated property tax assessments,\nincremental borrowing rate for lease accounting, fair value of investments, and asset retirement obligations. Management develops estimates based on historical\nexperience and on various assumptions about the future that are believed to be reasonable based on the information available. These estimates ultimately may\ndiffer from actual results and such differences could be material.\nDuring the first quarter of 2024, the Company completed its assessment on the remaining estimated useful lives of its towers and intangible assets. The\nCompany concluded through its assessment that, for U.S. GAAP purposes, it should modify its current estimates for asset lives based on its historical operating\nexperience and the findings obtained by its independent consultant. The Company previously depreciated its towers on a straight-line basis over the shorter of\nthe (i) term of the underlying ground lease (including renewal options) taking into account residual value or (ii) estimated useful life of a tower, which the\nCompany had historically estimated to be 15 years. Based on its assessment, the Company revised the estimated useful lives of its towers and certain related\nintangible assets (which are amortized on a similar basis to its tower assets, as their useful lives correlate to the useful life of the towers) from 15 years to 30\nyears, effective January 1, 2024. The Company accounted for the change in estimated useful lives as a change in estimate under ASC 250 “Accounting Changes\nand Error Corrections.” The impact of the change in estimate was accounted for prospectively effective January 1, 2024, resulting in a reduction in depreciation\nand amortization expense of approximately $102.7 million ($93.0 million after tax, or an increase of $0.86 per diluted share) and $205.4 million ($186.0 million\nafter tax, or an increase of $1.72 per diluted share) for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, respectively. This change in useful lives is expected to\nreduce depreciation and amortization expense by approximately $411.5 million ($372.5 million after tax, or an increase of $3.44 per diluted share) for the year\nended December 31, 2024.\nForeign Currency Translation\nAll assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries that do not utilize the U.S. dollar as its functional currency are translated at period-end exchange rates,\nwhile revenues and expenses are translated at monthly average exchange rates during the period. Unrealized translation gains and losses are reported as foreign\ncurrency translation adjustments through Accumulated other comprehensive loss, net in the Consolidated Statements of Shareholders’ Deficit.\nFor foreign subsidiaries where the U.S. dollar is the functional currency, monetary assets and liabilities of such subsidiaries, which are not\ndenominated in U.S. dollars, are remeasured at exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date, and revenues and expenses are remeasured at monthly average\nrates prevailing during the year. Remeasurement gains and losses are reported as Other (expense) income, net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nIntercompany Loans Subject to Remeasurement\nIn accordance with ASC 830, the Company remeasures foreign denominated intercompany loans with the corresponding change in the balance being\nrecorded in Other (expense) income, net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations as settlement is anticipated or planned in the foreseeable future. The\nCompany recorded a $66.2 million loss and a $27.8 million gain, net of taxes, on the remeasurement of intercompany loans for the three months ended June 30,\n2024 and 2023, respectively, and a $94.7 million loss\n8\nTable of Contents\nand a $55.2 million gain, net of taxes, on the remeasurement of intercompany loans for the six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. During the\nsix months ended June 30, 2024, the Company funded $9.3 million and $79.7 million was repaid under its intercompany loan agreements. As of June 30, 2024\nand December 31, 2023, the aggregate amount outstanding under the intercompany loan agreements subject to remeasurement with the Company’s foreign\nsubsidiaries was $1.2 billion and $1.3 billion, respectively.\n2. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS\nItems Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis — The Company’s asset retirement obligations are measured at fair value on a recurring basis\nusing Level 3 inputs and are recorded in Other long-term liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The fair value of the asset retirement obligations is\ncalculated using a discounted cash flow model.\nRefer to Note 16 for discussion of the Company’s redeemable noncontrolling interests.\nItems Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis — The Company estimates the fair value of assets subject to impairment using a discounted\ncash flow (“DCF”) (Level 3 input) analysis. Determining fair value requires the exercise of significant judgments, including the amount and timing of expected\nfuture cash flows, long-term growth rates, discount rates and relevant comparable earnings and trading multiples. The cash flows employed in the DCF analysis\nare based on estimates of future revenues, earnings, and cash flows after considering factors such as tower location demographics, timing of additions of new\ntenants, lease rates, rate and term of renewal, attrition, ongoing cash requirements, and market multiples. Each of the assumptions are applied based on the\nspecific facts and circumstances of the identified assets at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows. The DCF analysis used an average discount rate ranging\nfrom 7.8% - 8.8%.\nAsset impairment and decommission costs for all periods presented and the related impaired assets primarily relate to the Company’s site leasing\noperating segment. The following summarizes the activity of asset impairment and decommission costs:\nFor the three months For the six months\nended June 30, ended June 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\n(in thousands)\nAsset impairment (1) $ 18,491 $ 24,363 $ 53,043 $ 46,696\nWrite-off of carrying value of decommissioned towers 7,440 849 11,545 2,802\nOther (including tower and equipment decommission costs) 5,679 7,655 10,670 9,759\nTotal asset impairment and decommission costs $ 31,610 $ 32,867 $ 75,258 $ 59,257\n(1) Represents impairment charges resulting from the Company’s regular analysis of whether the anticipated future cash flows from certain towers are\nsufficient to recover the carrying value of the investment in those towers.\nThe Company’s long-term investments were $19.2 million and $24.5 million as of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, and are\nrecorded in Other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The estimation of the fair value of the investment involves the use of Level 3 inputs. The\nCompany evaluates these investments for indicators of impairment. The Company considers impairment indicators such as negative changes in industry and\nmarket conditions, financial performance, business prospects, and other relevant events and factors. If indicators exist and the fair value of the investment is less\nthan the carrying amount, an impairment charge will be recorded. The Company did not recognize any impairment loss associated with its investments during\nthe three and six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments — The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, restricted cash, accounts payable, and\nshort-term investments approximate their estimated fair values due to the short maturity of these instruments. The Company’s estimate of its short-term\ninvestments is based primarily upon Level 1 reported market values. As of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had $30.4 million and $1.0\nmillion of short-term investments, respectively. For the six months ended June 30, 2024, the Company purchased and sold $0.7 billion of short-term\ninvestments. For the six months ended June 30, 2023, the Company purchased and sold $0.6 billion of short-term investments.\nThe Company determines fair value of its debt instruments utilizing various Level 2 sources including quoted prices and indicative quotes (non-\nbinding quotes) from brokers that require judgment to interpret market information including implied credit spreads for similar borrowings on recent trades or\nbid/ask prices. The fair value of the Revolving Credit Facility is considered to approximate the carrying value because the Company does not believe its credit\nrisk has changed materially from the date the\n9\nTable of Contents\napplicable spread to the Eurodollar Rate and Term SOFR Rate was set for the Revolving Credit Facility (112.5 to 150.0 basis points). Refer to Note 10 for the\nfair values, principal balances, and carrying values of the Company’s debt instruments.\nFor discussion of the Company’s derivatives and hedging activities, refer to Note 17.\n3. CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS, AND RESTRICTED CASH\nThe cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash balances on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows consist of the following:\nAs of As of\nJune 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Included on Balance Sheet\n(in thousands)\nCash and cash equivalents $ 220,508 $ 208,547 Cash and cash equivalents\nSecuritization escrow accounts 51,790 31,852 Restricted cash - current asset\nPayment, performance bonds, and other 6,684 6,277 Restricted cash - current asset\nSurety bonds and workers compensation 4,162 4,270 Other assets - noncurrent\nTotal cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash $ 283,144 $ 250,946\nPursuant to the terms of the Tower Securities (see Note 10), the Company is required to establish a securitization escrow account, held by the indenture\ntrustee, into which all rents and other sums due on the towers that secure the Tower Securities are directly deposited by the lessees. These restricted cash\namounts are used to fund reserve accounts for the payment of (1) debt service costs, (2) ground rents, real estate and personal property taxes and insurance\npremiums related to towers, (3) trustee and servicing expenses, and (4) management fees. The restricted cash in the securitization escrow account in excess of\nrequired reserve balances is subsequently released to the Borrowers (as defined in Note 10) monthly, provided that the Borrowers are in compliance with their\ndebt service coverage ratio and that no event of default has occurred. All monies held by the indenture trustee are classified as restricted cash on the Company’s\nConsolidated Balance Sheets.\nPayment and performance bonds relate primarily to collateral requirements for tower construction currently in process by the Company. Other\nrestricted cash includes $6.5 million and $6.1 million held in escrow as of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 related to the Company’s acquisition activities.\nCash is pledged as collateral for surety bonds issued for the benefit of the Company or its affiliates in the ordinary course of business and primarily\nrelated to the Company’s tower removal obligations. As of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had $41.7 million and $42.0 million in surety\nand payment and performance bonds, respectively, for which no collateral was required to be posted. The Company periodically evaluates the collateral posted\nfor its bonds to ensure that it meets the minimum requirements.

INCOME TAXES\nThe primary reason for the difference between the Company’s effective tax rate and the U.S. statutory rate is the Company’s REIT election. A tax\nprovision is recognized because U.S. taxable REIT subsidiary and certain foreign subsidiaries of the Company have profitable operations or are in a net\ndeferred tax liability position.\nThe Company elected to be taxed as a REIT commencing with its taxable year ended December 31, 2016. As a REIT, the Company generally will be\nentitled to a deduction for dividends that it pays, and therefore, not subject to U.S. federal corporate income tax on that portion of its net income that it\ndistributes to its shareholders. As a REIT, the Company will continue to pay U.S. federal income tax on earnings, if any, from assets and operations held\nthrough its U.S. taxable REIT subsidiary. These assets and operations currently consist primarily of the Company’s site development services and its\ninternational operations. The Company’s international operations would continue to be subject, as applicable, to foreign taxes in the jurisdictions in which those\noperations are located. The Company may also be subject to a variety of taxes, including payroll taxes and state, local, and foreign income, property, and other\ntaxes on its assets and operations. The Company’s determination as to the timing and amount of future dividend distributions will be based on a number of\nfactors, including REIT distribution requirements, its existing federal net operating losses (“NOLs”) of approximately $382.3 million as of December 31, 2023,\nthe Company’s financial condition, earnings, debt covenants,\n17\nTable of Contents\nand other possible uses of such funds. The Company may use these NOLs to offset its REIT taxable income, and thus any required distributions to shareholders\nmay be reduced or eliminated until such time as the NOLs have been fully utilized.\nThe Company is subject to income tax and other taxes in the geographic areas where it holds assets or operates, and the Company periodically receives\nnotifications of audits, assessments, or other actions by taxing authorities. In certain jurisdictions, taxing authorities may issue notices and assessments that may\nnot be reflective of the actual tax liability for which the Company will ultimately be liable. In the process of responding to assessments of taxes that the\nCompany believes are not reflective of the Company’s actual tax liability, the Company avails itself of both administrative and judicial remedies. The Company\nevaluates the circumstances of each notification or assessment based on the information available and, in those instances in which the Company does not\nanticipate a successful defense of positions taken in its tax filings, a liability is recorded in the appropriate amount based on the underlying assessment.\nIn connection with a current assessment in Brazil, the taxing authorities have issued income tax deficiencies related to purchase accounting\nadjustments for tax years 2017 through 2019. The Company disagrees with the assessment and has filed an appeal with the higher appellate taxing authorities.\nThe Company estimates that there is a more likely than not probability that the Company’s position will be sustained upon appeal. Accordingly, no liability has\nbeen recorded. The Company will continue to vigorously contest the adjustments and expects to exhaust all administrative and judicial remedies necessary to\nresolve the matters, which could be a lengthy process. There can be no assurance that these matters will be resolved in the Company’s favor, and an adverse\noutcome, or any future tax examinations involving similar assertions, could have a material effect on the Company’s results of operations or cash flows in any\none period. As of June 30, 2024, the Company estimates the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses in excess of amounts accrued to be between zero and\n$66.8 million. This range excludes penalties and interest, which as of such date would have been $80.7 million.\n14. SEGMENT DATA\nThe Company operates principally in two business segments: site leasing and site development. The Company’s site leasing business includes two\nreportable segments, domestic site leasing and international site leasing. The Company’s business segments are strategic business units that offer different\nservices. They are managed separately based on the fundamental differences in their operations. The site leasing segment includes results of the managed and\nsublease businesses. The site development segment includes the results of both consulting and construction related activities. The Company’s Chief Operating\nDecision Maker utilizes segment operating profit and operating income as his two measures of segment profit in assessing performance and allocating resources\nat the reportable segment level. The Company has applied the aggregation criteria to operations within the international site leasing segment on a basis that is\nconsistent with management’s review of information and performance evaluations of the individual markets in this region.\n18\nTable of Contents\nRevenues, cost of revenues (exclusive of depreciation, accretion and amortization), capital expenditures (including assets acquired through the\nissuance of shares of the Company’s Class A common stock) and identifiable assets pertaining to the segments in which the Company continues to operate are\npresented below.\nDomestic Site Int'l Site Site\nLeasing Leasing Development Other Total\nFor the three months ended June 30, 2024 (in thousands)\nRevenues (1) $ 463,204 $ 163,253 $ 34,020 $ — $ 660,477\nCost of revenues (2) 65,489 48,642 27,137 — 141,268\nOperating profit 397,715 114,611 6,883 — 519,209\nSelling, general, and administrative expenses 33,608 15,775 2,944 10,049 62,376\nAcquisition and new business initiatives\nrelated adjustments and expenses 3,089 3,485 — — 6,574\nAsset impairment and decommission costs 13,825 17,362 — 423 31,610\nDepreciation, amortization and accretion 33,870 27,457 1,038 1,814 64,179\nOperating income (loss) 313,323 50,532 2,901 (12,286) 354,470\nOther expense, net (principally interest\nexpense and other income) (207,355) (207,355)\nIncome before income taxes 147,115\nCash capital expenditures (3) 48,603 41,687 123 1,177 91,590\nFor the three months ended June 30, 2023\nRevenues (1) $ 456,754 $ 169,389 $ 52,357 $ — $ 678,500\nCost of revenues (2) 64,434 50,580 39,236 — 154,250\nOperating profit 392,320 118,809 13,121 — 524,250\nSelling, general, and administrative expenses 28,445 18,413 4,471 12,054 63,383\nAcquisition and new business initiatives\nrelated adjustments and expenses 2,573 2,380 — — 4,953\nAsset impairment and decommission costs 30,465 2,244 — 158 32,867\nDepreciation, amortization and accretion 117,353 61,892 936 1,639 181,820\nOperating income (loss) 213,484 33,880 7,714 (13,851) 241,227\nOther expense, net (principally interest\nexpense and other income) (68,435) (68,435)\nIncome before income taxes 172,792\nCash capital expenditures (3) 50,943 32,079 675 335 84,032\n19\nTable of Contents\nDomestic Site Int'l Site Site\nLeasing Leasing Development Other Total\nFor the six months ended June 30, 2024 (in thousands)\nRevenues (1) $ 924,703 $ 330,030 $ 63,606 $ — $ 1,318,339\nCost of revenues (2) 131,459 97,485 50,315 — 279,259\nOperating profit 793,244 232,545 13,291 — 1,039,080\nSelling, general, and administrative expenses 67,956 31,483 7,370 24,265 131,074\nAcquisition and new business initiatives\nrelated adjustments and expenses 8,387 5,604 — — 13,991\nAsset impairment and decommission costs 43,738 31,097 — 423 75,258\nDepreciation, amortization and accretion 74,215 61,286 1,872 3,556 140,929\nOperating income (loss) 598,948 103,075 4,049 (28,244) 677,828\nOther expense, net (principally interest\nexpense and other income) (359,244) (359,244)\nIncome before income taxes 318,584\nCash capital expenditures (3) 89,624 77,289 182 1,771 168,866\nFor the six months ended June 30, 2023\nRevenues (1) $ 911,588 $ 331,823 $ 110,605 $ — $ 1,354,016\nCost of revenues (2) 134,183 100,950 83,421 — 318,554\nOperating profit 777,405 230,873 27,184 — 1,035,462\nSelling, general, and administrative expenses 60,188 35,143 10,548 29,713 135,592\nAcquisition and new business initiatives\nrelated adjustments and expenses 5,805 5,205 — — 11,010\nAsset impairment and decommission costs 49,900 7,130 — 2,227 59,257\nDepreciation, amortization and accretion 236,840 122,304 1,852 3,239 364,235\nOperating income (loss) 424,672 61,091 14,784 (35,179) 465,368\nOther expense, net (principally interest\nexpense and other income) (148,512) (148,512)\nIncome before income taxes 316,856\nCash capital expenditures (3) 95,578 55,112 1,070 1,591 153,351\nDomestic Site Int'l Site Site\nLeasing Leasing Development Other (4) Total\nAssets (in thousands)\nAs of June 30, 2024 $ 5,860,164 $ 3,502,379 $ 44,447 $ 379,188 $ 9,786,178\nAs of December 31, 2023 $ 5,876,648 $ 3,871,164 $ 66,001 $ 364,628 $ 10,178,441\n(1) For the three months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, site leasing revenue in Brazil was $93.1 million and $99.7 million, respectively.

EARNINGS PER SHARE\nBasic earnings per share was computed by dividing net income attributable to SBA Communications Corporation by the weighted-average number of\nshares of Class A common stock outstanding for each respective period. Diluted earnings per share was calculated by dividing net income attributable to SBA\nCommunications Corporation by the weighted-average number of shares of\n20\nTable of Contents\nClass A common stock outstanding adjusted for any dilutive Class A common stock equivalents, including unvested RSUs, PSUs, and shares issuable upon\nexercise of stock options as determined under the “Treasury Stock” method.\nThe following table sets forth basic and diluted net income per common share attributable to common shareholders for the three and six months ended\nJune 30, 2024 and 2023 (in thousands, except per share data):\nFor the three months For the six months\nended June 30, ended June 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nNumerator:\nNet income attributable to SBA\nCommunications Corporation $ 162,830 $ 203,648 $ 317,372 $ 304,865\nDenominator:\nBasic weighted-average shares outstanding 107,462 108,355 107,782 108,244\nDilutive impact of stock options, RSUs, and PSUs 217 529 366 834\nDiluted weighted-average shares outstanding 107,679 108,884 108,148 109,078\nNet income per common share attributable to SBA\nCommunications Corporation:\nBasic $ 1.52 $ 1.88 $ 2.94 $ 2.82\nDiluted $ 1.51 $ 1.87 $ 2.93 $ 2.79\nFor the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, the diluted weighted-average number of common shares outstanding excluded an\nimmaterial number of shares issuable upon exercise of the Company’s stock options because the impact would be anti-dilutive.\n16. REDEEMABLE NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS\nThe Company allocates income and losses to its redeemable noncontrolling interest holders based on the applicable membership interest percentage. At\neach reporting period, the redeemable noncontrolling interest is recognized at the greater of (1) the initial carrying amount of the noncontrolling interest as\nadjusted for accumulated income or loss attributable to the noncontrolling interest holder or (2) the redemption value as of the balance sheet date. Adjustments\nto the carrying amount of redeemable noncontrolling interest are charged against retained earnings (or additional paid-in capital if there are no retained\nearnings). The fair value of the redeemable noncontrolling interest is estimated using Level 3 inputs.\nThe components of redeemable noncontrolling interests as of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 are as follows (in thousands):\nJune 30, December 31,\n2024 2023\nBeginning balance $ 35,047 $ 31,735\nNet loss attributable to noncontrolling interests (3,378) (4,397)\nForeign currency translation adjustments (324) (899)\nContribution from joint venture partner 1,530 1,200\nAdjustment to redemption amount 7,942 7,408\nEnding balance $ 40,817 $ 35,047\n17. DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES\nThe Company enters into interest rate swaps to hedge the future interest expense from variable rate debt and reduce the Company’s exposure to\nfluctuations in interest rates. As of June 30, 2024, the Company has an interest rate swap agreement on its 2024 Term Loan which swaps $1.95 billion of\nnotional value accruing interest at one month Term SOFR plus 200 basis points for an all-in fixed rate of 2.050% per annum through March 31, 2025.\nAdditionally, the Company has a forward-starting interest rate swap agreement which will swap $1.0 billion of notional value accruing interest at one\nmonth Term SOFR plus 200 basis points for an all-in fixed rate of 5.830% per annum. The forward-starting swap has an effective start date of March 31,\n2025 and a maturity date of April 11, 2028.\n21\nTable of Contents\nAs of June 30, 2024, the hedges remain highly effective; therefore, changes in fair value are recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss, net.\nThe table below outlines the effects of the Company’s interest rate swaps on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.\nFair Value as of\nBalance Sheet June 30, December 31,\nLocation 2024 2023\nDerivatives Designated as Hedging Instruments (in thousands)\nInterest rate swap agreements in a fair value asset position Other assets $ 74,573 $ 104,674\nOther long-term\nInterest rate swap agreement in a fair value liability position liabilities $ — $ 19,573\nAccumulated other comprehensive loss, net includes an aggregate $54.1 million gain and a $51.5 million gain as of June 30, 2024 and December 31,\n2023, respectively.\nThe Company is exposed to counterparty credit risk to the extent that a counterparty fails to meet the terms of a contract.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nWe are a leading independent owner and operator of wireless communications infrastructure, including tower structures, rooftops, and other structures\nthat support antennas used for wireless communications, which we collectively refer to as “towers” or “sites.” Our principal operations are in the United States\nand its territories. In addition, we own and operate towers in South America, Central America, Canada, South Africa, the Philippines, and Tanzania. Our primary\nbusiness line is our site leasing business, which contributed 98.7% of our total segment operating profit for the six months ended June 30, 2024. In our site\nleasing business, we (1) lease space to wireless service providers and other customers on assets that we own or operate and (2) manage rooftop and tower sites\nfor property owners under various contractual arrangements. As of June 30, 2024, we owned 39,744 towers, a substantial portion of which have been built by us\nor built by other tower owners or operators who, like us, have built such towers to lease space to multiple wireless service providers. Our other business line is\nour site development business, through which we assist wireless service providers in developing and maintaining their own wireless service networks.\nSite Leasing\nOur primary focus is the leasing of antenna space on our multi-tenant towers to a variety of wireless service providers under long-term lease contracts\nin the United States, South America, Central America, Canada, South Africa, the Philippines, and Tanzania. As of June 30, 2024, no U.S. state or territory\naccounted for more than 10% of our total tower portfolio by tower count, and no U.S. state or territory accounted for more than 10% of our total revenues for\nthe six months ended June 30, 2024. In addition, as of June 30, 2024, approximately 30% of our total towers are located in Brazil and no other international\nmarket (each country is considered a market) represented more than 5% of our total towers.\n22\nTable of Contents\nWe derive site leasing revenues primarily from wireless service provider tenants. Wireless service providers enter into (1) individual tenant site leases\nwith us, each of which relates to the lease or use of space at an individual site or (2) master lease agreements (“MLA”) with us, which provide for the material\nterms and conditions that will apply to multiple sites; although, in most cases, each individual site under a MLA is also governed by its own site leasing\nagreement which sets forth pricing and other site specific terms. Our tenant leases are generally for an initial term of five years to fifteen years with multiple\nrenewal periods at the option of the tenant. Our tenant leases typically either (1) contain specific annual rent escalators, (2) escalate annually in accordance with\nan inflationary index, or (3) escalate using a combination of fixed and inflation adjusted escalators. In addition, our international site leases may include pass-\nthrough charges, such as rent related to ground leases and other property interests, utilities, property taxes, and fuel.\nCost of site leasing revenue primarily consists of:\n· Cash and non-cash rental expense on ground leases, right-of-use, and other underlying property interests;\n· Property taxes;\n· Site maintenance and monitoring costs (exclusive of employee related costs);\n· Utilities;\n· Property insurance;\n· Fuel (in those international markets that do not have an available electric grid at our tower sites); and\n· Lease initial direct cost amortization.\nGround leases and other property interests are generally for an initial term of five years or more with multiple renewal periods, which are at our option.\nOur ground leases either (1) contain specific annual rent escalators or (2) escalate annually in accordance with an inflationary index. As of June 30, 2024,\napproximately 71% of our tower structures were located on parcels of land that we own, land subject to perpetual easements, or parcels of land in which we\nhave a leasehold interest that extends beyond 20 years. For any given tower, costs are relatively fixed over a monthly or an annual time period. As such,\noperating costs for owned towers do not generally increase as a result of adding additional customers to the tower. The amount of property taxes varies from site\nto site depending on the taxing jurisdiction and the height and age of the tower. The ongoing maintenance requirements are typically minimal and include\nreplacing lighting systems, painting a tower, or upgrading or repairing an access road or fencing.\nIn Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Nicaragua, and Panama, significantly all of our revenue, expenses, and capital expenditures arising from our\nactivities are denominated in U.S. dollars. Specifically, most of our ground leases and other property interests, tenant leases, and tower-related expenses are paid\nin U.S. dollars. In our Central American markets, our local currency obligations are principally limited to (1) permitting and other local fees, (2) utilities, and\n(3) taxes. In Brazil, Canada, Chile, South Africa, and the Philippines, significantly all of our revenue, expenses, and capital expenditures, including tenant\nleases, ground leases and other property interests, and other tower-related expenses are denominated in local currency. In Colombia, Costa Rica, Peru, and\nTanzania, our revenue, expenses, and capital expenditures, including tenant leases, ground leases and other property interests, and other tower-related expenses\nare denominated in a mix of local currency and U.S. dollars.\nAs indicated in the table below, our site leasing business generates substantially all of our total segment operating profit. For information regarding our\noperating segments, see Note 14 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this quarterly report.\nFor the three months ended For the six months ended\nSegment operating profit as a percentage of June 30, June 30,\ntotal operating profit 2024 2023 2024 2023\nDomestic site leasing 76.6% 74.8% 76.3% 75.0%\nInternational site leasing 22.1% 22.7% 22.4% 22.4%\nTotal site leasing 98.7% 97.5% 98.7% 97.4%\nWe believe that the site leasing business continues to be attractive due to its long-term contracts, built-in rent escalators, high operating margins, and\nlow customer churn (which refers to a lease that is non-renewed, cancelled, or discounted prior to the end of its term) other than in connection with customer\nconsolidation or cessations of specific technology. We believe that over the long-term, site leasing revenues will continue to grow as wireless service providers\nlease additional antenna space on our towers due to increasing minutes of network use and data transfer, network expansion, and network coverage\nrequirements.\nDuring the remainder of 2024, we expect organic site leasing revenue in both our domestic and international segments to increase over 2023 levels, on\na currency neutral basis, due in part to wireless carriers deploying unused spectrum. We believe our site leasing business is characterized by stable and long-\nterm recurring revenues, predictable operating costs, and minimal non-discretionary capital expenditures. Due to the relatively young age and mix of our tower\nportfolio, we expect future expenditures required to maintain these towers to be minimal. Consequently, we expect to grow our cash flows by (1) adding tenants\nto our towers at minimal incremental costs by using existing tower capacity or requiring wireless service providers to bear all or a portion of the cost\n23\nTable of Contents\nof tower modifications and (2) executing monetary amendments as wireless service providers add or upgrade their equipment. Furthermore, because our towers\nare strategically positioned, we have historically experienced low tenant lease terminations as a percentage of revenue other than in connection with customer\nconsolidation or cessations of a specific technology.\nSite Development\nOur site development business, which is conducted in the United States only, is complementary to our site leasing business and provides us the ability\nto keep in close contact with the wireless service providers who generate substantially all of our site leasing revenue and to capture ancillary revenues that are\ngenerated by our site leasing activities, such as antenna and equipment installation at our tower locations. Site development revenues are earned primarily from\nproviding a full range of end-to-end services to wireless service providers or companies providing development or project management services to wireless\nservice providers. Our services include: (1) network pre-design; (2) site audits; (3) identification of potential locations for towers and antennas on existing\ninfrastructure; (4) support in leasing of the location; (5) assistance in obtaining zoning approvals and permits; (6) tower and related site construction; (7)\nantenna installation; and (8) radio equipment installation, commissioning, and maintenance. We provide site development services at our towers and at towers\nowned by others on a local basis, through regional, market, and project offices. The market offices are responsible for all site development operations.\nFor information regarding our operating segments, see Note 14 to our Consolidated Financial Statements in this quarterly report.\nCapital Allocation Strategy\nOur capital allocation strategy is aimed at increasing shareholder value through investment in quality assets that meet our return criteria, stock\nrepurchases when we believe our stock price is below its intrinsic value, and by returning cash generated by our operations in the form of cash dividends. In\naddition, in a high interest rate environment and when we believe interest rates may stay higher for longer, we believe that debt repayments, especially of our\nvariable rate debt, may be an accretive use of our excess capital. While the addition of cash dividends and debt repayments have provided us with additional\ntools to return value to our shareholders, we continue to believe that our priority is to make investments focused on increasing Adjusted Funds From Operations\nper share. Key elements of our capital allocation strategy include:\nPortfolio Growth. We intend to continue to grow our asset portfolio, domestically and internationally, primarily through tower acquisitions and the\nconstruction of new towers that meet our internal return on invested capital criteria.\nStock Repurchase Program. We currently utilize stock repurchases as part of our capital allocation policy when we believe our share price is below its\nintrinsic value. We believe that share repurchases, when purchased at the right price, will facilitate our goal of increasing our Adjusted Funds From Operations\nper share.\nDividend. Cash dividends are an additional component of our strategy of returning value to shareholders. We do not expect our dividend to require any\nchanges in our leverage and believe that, due to our low dividend payout ratio, we can continue to focus on building and buying quality assets and\nopportunistically buying back our stock. While the timing and amount of future dividends will be subject to approval by our Board of Directors, we believe that\nour future cash flow generation will permit us to grow our cash dividend in the future.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nWe have identified the policies and significant estimation processes listed below and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K as critical to our business\noperations and the understanding of our results of operations. The listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list. In many cases, the accounting treatment of a\nparticular transaction is specifically dictated by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, with no need for management’s judgment in their\napplication. In other cases, management is required to exercise judgment in the application of accounting principles with respect to particular transactions. The\nimpact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations” where such policies affect reported and expected financial results. For a detailed discussion on the application\nof these and other accounting policies, see Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023. Our preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and\nliabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the\nreporting periods. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the\ncircumstances. There can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates and such differences could be significant.\n24\nTable of Contents\nDuring the first quarter of 2024, we completed our assessment on the remaining estimated useful lives of our towers and intangible assets. We\nconcluded through our assessment that, for U.S. GAAP purposes, we should modify our current estimates for asset lives based on our historical operating\nexperience and the findings obtained by our independent consultant. We previously depreciated our towers on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the (i)\nterm of the underlying ground lease (including renewal options) taking into account residual value or (ii) estimated useful life of a tower, which we had\nhistorically estimated to be 15 years. Based on our assessment, we revised the estimated useful lives of our towers and certain related intangible assets (which\nare amortized on a similar basis to our tower assets, as their useful lives correlate to the useful life of the towers) from 15 years to 30 years, effective January 1,\n2024. We accounted for the change in estimated useful lives as a change in estimate under ASC 250 “Accounting Changes and Error Corrections.” The impact\nof the change in estimate was accounted for prospectively effective January 1, 2024, resulting in a reduction in depreciation and amortization expense of\napproximately $102.7 million ($93.0 million after tax, or an increase of $0.86 per diluted share) and $205.4 million ($186.0 million after tax, or an increase of\n$1.72 per diluted share) for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, respectively. This change in useful lives is expected to reduce depreciation and\namortization expense by approximately $411.5 million ($372.5 million after tax, or an increase of $3.44 per diluted share) for the year ended December 31,\n2024.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThis report presents our financial results and other financial metrics on a GAAP basis and, with respect to our international and consolidated results,\nafter eliminating the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. We believe that providing these financial results and metrics on a constant currency\nbasis, which are non-GAAP measures, gives management and investors the ability to evaluate the performance of our business without the impact of foreign\ncurrency exchange rate fluctuations. We eliminate the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates by dividing the current period’s financial results by\nthe average monthly exchange rates of the prior year period, as well as by eliminating the impact of realized and unrealized gains and losses on our\nintercompany loans.\nThree Months Ended June 30, 2024 Compared to Three Months Ended June 30, 2023\nRevenues and Segment Operating Profit:\nFor the three months ended Constant\nJune 30, Foreign Constant Currency\n2024 2023 Currency Impact Currency Change % Change\nRevenues (in thousands)\nDomestic site leasing $ 463,204 $ 456,754 $ — $ 6,450 1.4%\nInternational site leasing 163,253 169,389 (7,011) 875 0.5%\nSite development 34,020 52,357 — (18,337) (35.0%)\nTotal $ 660,477 $ 678,500 $ (7,011) $ (11,012) (1.6%)\nCost of Revenues\nDomestic site leasing $ 65,489 $ 64,434 $ — $ 1,055 1.6%\nInternational site leasing 48,642 50,580 (2,443) 505 1.0%\nSite development 27,137 39,236 — (12,099) (30.8%)\nTotal $ 141,268 $ 154,250 $ (2,443) $ (10,539) (6.8%)\nOperating Profit\nDomestic site leasing $ 397,715 $ 392,320 $ — $ 5,395 1.4%\nInternational site leasing 114,611 118,809 (4,568) 370 0.3%\nSite development 6,883 13,121 — (6,238) (47.5%)\nRevenues\nDomestic site leasing revenues increased $6.5 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024, as compared to the prior year, primarily due to (1)\norganic site leasing growth, primarily from monetary lease amendments, (due in part to our 2023 MLA with AT&T) and additional equipment added to our\ntowers as well as new leases and contractual rent escalators and (2) revenues from 87 towers acquired and 19 towers built since April 1, 2023, partially offset by\nlease non-renewals.\nInternational site leasing revenues decreased $6.1 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024, as compared to the prior year.

We have provided below a description of Adjusted EBITDA, a\nreconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to its most directly comparable GAAP measure and an explanation as to why management utilizes this measure. This report\nalso presents our financial results and other financial metrics after eliminating the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. We believe that\nproviding these financial results and metrics on a constant currency basis, which are non-GAAP measures, gives management and investors the ability to\nevaluate the performance of our business without the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. We eliminate the impact of changes in foreign\ncurrency exchange rates by dividing the current period’s financial results by the average monthly exchange rates of the prior year period, as well as by\neliminating the impact of the remeasurement of our intercompany loans.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nWe define Adjusted EBITDA as net income excluding the impact of non-cash straight-line leasing revenue, non-cash straight-line ground lease\nexpense, non-cash compensation, net loss from extinguishment of debt, other income and expenses, acquisition and new business initiatives related adjustments\nand expenses, asset impairment and decommission costs, interest income, interest expenses, depreciation, accretion, and amortization, and income taxes.\nWe believe that Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors or other interested parties in evaluating our financial performance. Adjusted EBITDA is the\nprimary measure used by management (1) to evaluate the economic productivity of our operations and (2) for purposes of making decisions about allocating\nresources to, and assessing the performance of, our operations. Management believes that Adjusted EBITDA helps investors or other interested parties to\nmeaningfully evaluate and compare the results of our operations (1) from period to period and (2) to our competitors, by excluding the impact of our capital\nstructure (primarily interest charges from our outstanding debt) and asset base (primarily depreciation, amortization, and accretion) from our financial results.\nManagement also believes Adjusted EBITDA is frequently used by investors or other interested parties in the evaluation of REITs. In addition, Adjusted\nEBITDA is similar to the measure of current financial performance generally used by our lenders to determine compliance with certain covenants under our\nSenior Credit Agreement and the indentures relating to the 2020 Senior Notes and 2021 Senior Notes. Adjusted EBITDA should be considered only as a\nsupplement to net income computed in accordance with GAAP as a measure of our performance.\n33\nTable of Contents\nFor the three months ended Constant\nJune 30, Foreign Constant Currency\n2024 2023 Currency Impact Currency Change % Change\n(in thousands)\nNet income $ 159,452 $ 201,970 $ (95,928) $ 53,410 30.4%\nNon-cash straight-line leasing revenue (5,466) (7,480) (24) 2,038 (27.2%)\nNon-cash straight-line ground lease expense (2,988) (160) (48) (2,780) 1,737.5%\nNon-cash compensation 18,598 18,252 (144) 490 2.7%\nLoss from extinguishment of debt, net — — — — —%\nOther expense (income), net 104,859 (40,732) 144,454 1,137 153.6%\nAcquisition and new business initiatives\nrelated adjustments and expenses 6,574 4,953 (182) 1,803 36.4%\nAsset impairment and decommission costs 31,610 32,867 (258) (999) (3.0%)\nInterest income (7,046) (4,683) 140 (2,503) 53.4%\nInterest expense (1) 109,542 113,850 (89) (4,219) (3.7%)\nDepreciation, accretion, and amortization 64,179 181,820 (1,180) (116,461) (64.1%)\nBenefit for income taxes (2) (12,250) (28,937) (50,843) 67,530 (153.6%)\nAdjusted EBITDA $ 467,064 $ 471,720 $ (4,102) $ (554) (0.1%)\nFor the six months ended Constant\nJune 30, Foreign Constant Currency\n2024 2023 Currency Impact Currency Change % Change\n(in thousands)\nNet income $ 313,994 $ 302,525 $ (149,959) $ 161,428 64.7%\nNon-cash straight-line leasing revenue (9,558) (14,329) 66 4,705 (32.8%)\nNon-cash straight-line ground lease expense (6,371) 564 (60) (6,875) (1,219.0%)\nNon-cash compensation 40,067 44,456 (120) (4,269) (9.6%)\nLoss from extinguishment of debt, net 4,428 — — 4,428 —%\nOther expense (income), net 149,511 (78,293) 228,318 (514) 12.5%\nAcquisition and new business initiatives\nrelated adjustments and expenses 13,991 11,010 (182) 3,163 28.7%\nAsset impairment and decommission costs 75,258 59,257 (380) 16,381 27.6%\nInterest income (14,360) (7,498) 34 (6,896) 92.0%\nInterest expense (1) 219,665 234,303 (159) (14,479) (6.2%)\nDepreciation, accretion, and amortization 140,929 364,235 (778) (222,528) (61.1%)\nProvision for income taxes (2) 4,921 14,829 (78,929) 69,021 (478.7%)\nAdjusted EBITDA $ 932,475 $ 931,059 $ (2,149) $ 3,565 0.4%\n(1) Total interest expense includes interest expense, non-cash interest expense, and amortization of deferred financing fees.\n(2) (Benefit) provision for income taxes includes $0.1 million and $0.2 million of franchise taxes for the three months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023,\nrespectively, and $0.3 million and $0.5 million of franchise taxes for the six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, reflected in selling,\ngeneral, and administrative expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nAdjusted EBITDA decreased $4.7 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024, as compared to the prior year period.

The proceeds from the 2024 Term Loan were used to retire our 2018 Term Loan and to pay related\nfees and expenses.\nOn February 23, 2024, we, through our wholly owned subsidiary, SBA Senior Finance II, further increased the total commitments under the Revolving\nCredit Facility from $1.75 billion to $2.0 billion.\nAs of June 30, 2024, SBA Senior Finance II was in compliance with the financial covenants contained in the Senior Credit Agreement.\nRevolving Credit Facility under the Senior Credit Agreement\nThe Revolving Credit Facility consists of a revolving loan under which up to $2.0 billion aggregate principal amount may be borrowed, repaid and\nredrawn, based upon specific financial ratios and subject to the satisfaction of other customary conditions to borrowing through the maturity date of January 25,\n2029. Amounts borrowed under the Revolving Credit Facility accrue interest, at SBA Senior Finance II’s election, at either (1) the Eurodollar Rate or Term\nSOFR Rate plus a margin that ranges from 112.5 basis points to 150.0 basis points or (2) the Base Rate plus a margin that ranges from 12.5 basis points to 50.0\nbasis points, in each case based on the ratio of Consolidated Net Debt to Annualized Borrower EBITDA, calculated in accordance with the Senior Credit\nAgreement. In addition, SBA Senior Finance II, is required to pay a commitment fee of between 0.15% and 0.25% per annum on the amount of unused\ncommitment. Furthermore, the Revolving Credit Facility incorporates sustainability-linked targets which will adjust the Revolving Credit Facility’s applicable\ninterest and commitment fee rates upward or downward based on how we perform against those targets. Borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility may be\nused for general corporate purposes. SBA Senior Finance II may, from time to time, borrow from and repay the Revolving Credit Facility. Consequently, the\namount outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility at the end of the period may not be reflective of the total amounts outstanding during such period.\nThe key terms of the Revolving Credit Facility are as follows:\nUnused\nInterest Rate Commitment\nas of Fee as of\nJune 30, 2024 (1) June 30, 2024 (2)\nRevolving Credit Facility 6.415% 0.140%\n(1) The rate reflected includes a 0.050% reduction in the applicable spread as a result of meeting certain sustainability-linked targets as of December 31,\n2023.\n(2) The rate reflected includes a 0.010% reduction in the applicable commitment fee as a result of meeting certain sustainability-linked targets as of\nDecember 31, 2023.\n37\nTable of Contents\nThe table below summarizes our Revolving Credit Facility activity during the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023 (in thousands):\nFor the three months For the six months\nended June 30, ended June 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nBeginning outstanding balance $ 195,000 $ 675,000 $ 180,000 $ 720,000\nBorrowings 70,000 — 195,000 140,000\nRepayments (145,000) (225,000) (255,000) (410,000)\nEnding outstanding balance $ 120,000 $ 450,000 $ 120,000 $ 450,000\nSubsequent to June 30, 2024, we repaid $90.0 million and borrowed $20.0 million under the Revolving Credit Facility, and as of the date of this filing,\n$50.0 million was outstanding.\nTerm Loan under the Senior Credit Agreement\n2024 Term Loan\nOn January 25, 2024, we, through our wholly owned subsidiary, SBA Senior Finance II, issued a term loan (the “2024 Term Loan”) under the amended\nand restated Senior Credit Agreement. The 2024 Term Loan consists of a senior secured term loan with an initial aggregate principal amount of $2.3 billion that\nmatures on January 25, 2031. The 2024 Term Loan accrues interest, at SBA Senior Finance II's election, at either the Base Rate plus 100 basis points (with a\nzero Base Rate floor) or at Term SOFR plus 200 basis points (with a floor of 0%). The 2024 Term Loan was issued at 99.75% of par value. The proceeds from\nthe 2024 Term Loan were used to retire the 2018 Term Loan and to pay related fees and expenses. In connection with the repayment, we expensed $3.3 million\nof net deferred financing fees and $1.2 million of discount related to the debt. As of June 30, 2024, the 2024 Term Loan was accruing interest at 7.350% per\nannum.\nPrincipal payments on the 2024 Term Loan will be made in quarterly installments on the last day of each March, June, September, and December in an\namount equal to $5.75 million beginning on June 30, 2024. We incurred financing fees of approximately $19.4 million in relation to this transaction, which are\nbeing amortized through the maturity date.\nDuring the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, we repaid an aggregate of $5.75 million of principal on the 2024 Term Loan. As of June 30,\n2024, the 2024 Term Loan had a principal balance of $2.3 billion.\nSecured Tower Revenue Securities\nTower Revenue Securities Terms\nAs of June 30, 2024, we, through a New York common law trust (the “Trust”), had issued and outstanding an aggregate of $6.9 billion of Secured\nTower Revenue Securities (“Tower Securities”). The sole asset of the Trust consists of a non-recourse mortgage loan made in favor of certain of our subsidiaries\nthat are borrowers on the mortgage loan (the “Borrowers”) under which there is a loan tranche for each Tower Security outstanding with the same interest rate\nand maturity date as the corresponding Tower Security.

Subsequent to June 30, 2024, we repaid $90.0 million and\nborrowed $20.0 million under the Revolving Credit Facility, and as of the date of this filing, $50.0 million was outstanding.\n(2) Total debt service on the 2024 Term Loan includes the impact of the interest rate swap which swaps $1.95 billion of notional value accruing interest at\nTerm SOFR plus 200 basis points for an all-in fixed rate of 2.050% per annum through March 31, 2025 and the forward-starting interest rate swap,\nwhich will swap $1.0 billion of notional value accruing interest at Term SOFR plus 200 basis points for an all-in fixed rate of 5.830% per annum\nbeginning March 31, 2025 through April 11, 2028.\nInflation\nThe impact of inflation on our operations has not been material to date. However, the impact of rising interest rates, due to actions by the Federal\nReserve to combat inflation, has impacted, and is expected to continue to impact, our growth rate and future operating results. Increasing interest rates has\nimpacted, and is expected to continue to impact, the ability and willingness of wireless service providers to incur capital expenditures at prior levels to expand\ntheir networks, which could adversely affect our future revenue growth rates. In addition, increased interest rates may adversely affect our costs to refinance our\nindebtedness at maturity. In addition, persistent high rates of inflation could adversely affect our future operating results particularly in light of the fact that our\nsite leasing revenues are governed by long-term contracts with pre-determined pricing that we will not be able to increase in response to increases in inflation\nother than our contracts in South America, South Africa, the Philippines, and Tanzania which have inflationary index based rent escalators.\n40\nTable of Contents\nITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nWe are exposed to certain market risks that are inherent in our financial instruments. These instruments arise from transactions entered into in the\nnormal course of business.\nThe following table presents the future principal payment obligations and fair values associated with our long-term debt instruments assuming our\nactual level of long-term indebtedness as of June 30, 2024:\n2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 Thereafter Total Fair Value\n(in thousands)\nRevolving Credit Facility $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ 120,000 $ 120,000 $ 120,000\n2024 Term Loan 11,500 23,000 23,000 23,000 23,000 2,190,750 2,294,250 2,297,118\n2014-2C Tower Securities (1) 620,000 — — — — — 620,000 615,350\n2019-1C Tower Securities (1) — 1,165,000 — — — — 1,165,000 1,138,007\n2020-1C Tower Securities (1) — — 750,000 — — — 750,000 680,460\n2020-2C Tower Securities (1) — — — — 600,000 — 600,000 520,554\n2021-1C Tower Securities (1) — — 1,165,000 — — — 1,165,000 1,016,556\n2021-2C Tower Securities (1) — — — 895,000 — — 895,000 769,986\n2021-3C Tower Securities (1) — — — — — 895,000 895,000 684,684\n2022-1C Tower Securities (1) — — — — 850,000 — 850,000 870,281\n2020 Senior Notes — — — 1,500,000 — — 1,500,000 1,429,155\n2021 Senior Notes — — — — — 1,500,000 1,500,000 1,348,125\nTotal debt obligation $ 631,500 $ 1,188,000 $ 1,938,000 $ 2,418,000 $ 1,473,000 $ 4,705,750 $ 12,354,250 $ 11,490,276\n(1) For information on the anticipated repayment date and final maturity date for each Tower Security, refer to “Debt Instruments and Debt Service\nRequirements” above.\nOur current primary market risk exposure is (1) interest rate risk relating to our ability to refinance our debt at commercially reasonable rates, if at all,\nand (2) interest rate risk relating to the impact of interest rate movements on the variable portion of our 2024 Term Loan and any borrowings that we may incur\nunder our Revolving Credit Facility, which are at floating rates. We manage the interest rate risk on our outstanding debt through our large percentage of fixed\nrate debt, including interest rate swaps. While we cannot predict our ability to refinance existing debt or the impact interest rate movements will have on our\nexisting debt, we continue to evaluate our financial position on an ongoing basis.\nWe have performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical 1% increase in our variable interest rates as of June 30, 2024. As of June 30, 2024,\nthe analysis indicated that such an adverse movement would have caused our interest expense to increase by approximately 1.3% for the six months ended June\n30, 2024.\nWe are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates in connection with our operations in Brazil, Canada, Chile, Peru,\nColombia, South Africa, the Philippines, Tanzania, and to a lesser extent, our markets in Central America. In each of these countries, we pay most of our selling,\ngeneral, and administrative expenses and a portion of our operating expenses, such as taxes and utilities incurred in the country in local currency. In addition, in\nBrazil, Canada, Chile, South Africa, and the Philippines, we receive significantly all of our revenue and pay significantly all of our operating expenses in local\ncurrency. In Colombia, Costa Rica, Peru, and Tanzania, we receive our revenue and pay our operating expenses in a mix of local currency and U.S. dollars. All\ntransactions denominated in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar are reported in U.S. Dollars at the applicable exchange rate. All assets and liabilities are\ntranslated into U.S. Dollars at exchange rates in effect at the end of the applicable fiscal reporting period, and all revenues and expenses are translated at\naverage rates for the period. The cumulative translation effect is included in equity as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net. For\nthe six months ended June 30, 2024, approximately 22.0% of our revenues and approximately 31.2% of our total operating expenses were denominated in\nforeign currencies.\nWe have performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical 10% adverse movement in the Brazilian Real from the quoted foreign currency\nexchange rates at June 30, 2024. As of June 30, 2024, the analysis indicated that such an adverse movement would have caused our revenues and operating\nincome to decline by approximately 1.3% and 1.0%, respectively, for the six months ended June 30, 2024.\nAs of June 30, 2024, we had intercompany debt, which is denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the subsidiary in which it is\nrecorded. As settlement of this debt is anticipated or planned in the foreseeable future, any changes in the foreign currency exchange rates will result in\nunrealized gains or losses, which will be included in our determination of net income. A change of 10% in the underlying exchange rates of our unsettled\nintercompany debt at June 30, 2024 would have resulted in\n41\nTable of Contents\napproximately $125.7 million of unrealized gains or losses that would have been included in Other (expense) income, net in our Consolidated Statements of\nOperations for the six months ended June 30, 2024.\nSpecial Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\nThis quarterly report contains “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section\n21E of the Exchange Act.

SUBSIDIARIES\nCONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)\n1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Annual Report on Form 10-K for\nthe fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 for SBA Communications Corporation and its subsidiaries (the “Company”). These financial\nstatements have been prepared in accordance with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X and, therefore, omit\nor condense certain footnotes and other information normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting\nprinciples generally accepted in the United States. In the opinion of the Company’s management, all adjustments (consisting of normal\nrecurring accruals and deferrals) considered necessary for fair financial statement presentation have been made. The results of\noperations for an interim period may not give a true indication of the results for the year. Certain reclassifications have been made to\nprior year amounts or balances to conform to the presentation adopted in the current year.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make\nestimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. The\nsignificant estimates made by management relate to the allowance for doubtful accounts, the costs and revenue relating to the\nCompany’s construction contracts, stock-based compensation assumptions, valuation allowance related to deferred tax assets, fair value\nof long-lived assets, the useful lives of towers and intangible assets, anticipated property tax assessments, incremental borrowing rate\nfor lease accounting, fair value of investments, and asset retirement obligations. Management develops estimates based on historical\nexperience and on various assumptions about the future that are believed to be reasonable based on the information available. These\nestimates ultimately may differ from actual results and such differences could be material.\nDuring the first quarter of 2024, the Company completed its assessment on the remaining estimated useful lives of its towers\nand intangible assets. The Company concluded through its assessment that, for U.S. GAAP purposes, it should modify its current\nestimates for asset lives based on its historical operating experience and the findings obtained by its independent consultant. The\nCompany previously depreciated its towers on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the (i) term of the underlying ground lease\n(including renewal options) taking into account residual value or (ii) estimated useful life of a tower, which the Company had\nhistorically estimated to be 15 years. Based on its assessment, the Company revised the estimated useful lives of its towers and certain\nrelated intangible assets (which are amortized on a similar basis to its tower assets, as their useful lives correlate to the useful life of the\ntowers) from 15 years to 30 years, effective January 1, 2024. The Company accounted for the change in estimated useful lives as a\nchange in estimate under ASC 250 “Accounting Changes and Error Corrections.” The impact of the change in estimate was accounted\nfor prospectively effective January 1, 2024, resulting in a reduction in depreciation and amortization expense of approximately $103.0\nmillion ($93.3 million after tax, or an increase of $0.86 per diluted share) and $308.5 million ($279.2 million after tax, or an increase of\n$2.58 per diluted share) for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. This change in useful lives is expected\nto reduce depreciation and amortization expense by approximately $411.5 million ($372.5 million after tax, or an increase of $3.45 per\ndiluted share) for the year ended December 31, 2024.\nForeign Currency Translation\nAll assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries that do not utilize the U.S. dollar as its functional currency are translated at\nperiod-end exchange rates, while revenues and expenses are translated at monthly average exchange rates during the period. Unrealized\ntranslation gains and losses are reported as foreign currency translation adjustments through Accumulated other comprehensive loss, net\nin the Consolidated Statements of Shareholders’ Deficit.\nFor foreign subsidiaries where the U.S. dollar is the functional currency, monetary assets and liabilities of such subsidiaries,\nwhich are not denominated in U.S. dollars, are remeasured at exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date, and revenues and\nexpenses are remeasured at monthly average rates prevailing during the year. Remeasurement gains and losses are reported as Other\nincome (expense), net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nIntercompany Loans Subject to Remeasurement\nIn accordance with ASC 830, the Company remeasures foreign denominated intercompany loans with the corresponding\nchange in the balance being recorded in Other income (expense), net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations as settlement is\nanticipated or planned in the foreseeable future. The Company recorded a $16.2 million gain and a $31.2 million loss, net of taxes, on\nthe remeasurement of intercompany loans for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and a $78.5 million\n8\nTable of Contents\nloss and a $24.1 million gain, net of taxes, on the remeasurement of intercompany loans for the nine months ended September 30, 2024\nand 2023, respectively. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company funded $9.3 million and $132.1 million was\nrepaid under its intercompany loan agreements. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the aggregate amount outstanding\nunder the intercompany loan agreements subject to remeasurement with the Company’s foreign subsidiaries was $1.2 billion and $1.3\nbillion, respectively.\nAccounting Standards Updates\nIn November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued new guidance to enhance reportable segment\ndisclosures, primarily through additional disclosures of significant segment expenses regularly provided to the chief operating decision\nmaker (“CODM”), along with disclosure of the title and position of the CODM. The standard is effective for fiscal years beginning\nafter December 15, 2023, and for interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, with retrospective application\nto all prior periods presented. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the effect of this standard on its\nconsolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued new guidance requiring public companies to provide improved income tax disclosures on\nan annual basis, primarily through enhanced disclosures related to rate reconciliation and income taxes paid information. The standard\nis effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the\neffect of this standard on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\n2. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS\nItems Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis — The Company’s asset retirement obligations are measured at fair\nvalue on a recurring basis using Level 3 inputs and are recorded in Other long-term liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The\nfair value of the asset retirement obligations is calculated using a discounted cash flow model.\nRefer to Note 16 for discussion of the Company’s redeemable noncontrolling interests.\nItems Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis — The Company estimates the fair value of assets subject to\nimpairment using a discounted cash flow (“DCF”) (Level 3 input) analysis. Determining fair value requires the exercise of significant\njudgments, including the amount and timing of expected future cash flows, long-term growth rates, discount rates and relevant\ncomparable earnings and trading multiples. The cash flows employed in the DCF analysis are based on estimates of future revenues,\nearnings, and cash flows after considering factors such as tower location demographics, timing of additions of new tenants, lease rates,\nrate and term of renewal, attrition, ongoing cash requirements, and market multiples. Each of the assumptions are applied based on the\nspecific facts and circumstances of the identified assets at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows. The DCF analysis used an average\ndiscount rate ranging from 7.8% - 8.8%.\nAsset impairment and decommission costs for all periods presented and the related impaired assets primarily relate to the\nCompany’s site leasing operating segment. The following summarizes the activity of asset impairment and decommission costs:\nFor the three months For the nine months\nended September 30, ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\n(in thousands)\nAsset impairment (1) $ 8,920 $ 27,676 $ 61,964 $ 74,372\nWrite-off of carrying value of decommissioned towers 698 1,619 12,242 4,451\nOther (including tower and equipment decommission costs) 3,052 3,768 13,722 13,497\nTotal asset impairment and decommission costs $ 12,670 $ 33,063 $ 87,928 $ 92,320\n(1) Represents impairment charges resulting from the Company’s regular analysis of whether the anticipated future cash flows\nfrom certain towers are sufficient to recover the carrying value of the investment in those towers.\nThe Company’s long-term investments were $26.6 million and $24.5 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31,\n2023, respectively, and are recorded in Other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The estimation of the fair value of the\ninvestment involves the use of Level 3 inputs. The Company evaluates these investments for indicators of impairment. The Company\nconsiders impairment indicators such as negative changes in industry and market conditions, financial performance, business prospects,\nand other relevant events and factors. If indicators exist and the fair value of the investment is less than the carrying\n9\nTable of Contents\namount, an impairment charge will be recorded. The Company did not recognize any impairment loss associated with its investments\nduring the three or nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments — The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, restricted\ncash, accounts payable, and short-term investments approximate their estimated fair values due to the short maturity of these\ninstruments. The Company’s estimate of its short-term investments is based primarily upon Level 1 reported market values. As of\nSeptember 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had $16.2 million and $1.0 million of short-term investments, respectively.\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company purchased and sold $1.2 billion of short-term investments. For the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2023, the Company purchased and sold $1.0 billion of short-term investments.\nThe Company determines fair value of its debt and derivative instruments utilizing various Level 2 sources including quoted\nprices and indicative quotes (non-binding quotes) from brokers that require judgment to interpret market information including implied\ncredit spreads for similar borrowings on recent trades or bid/ask prices. The fair value of the Revolving Credit Facility is considered to\napproximate the carrying value because the Company does not believe its credit risk has changed materially from the date the\napplicable spread to the Eurodollar Rate and Term SOFR Rate was set for the Revolving Credit Facility (112.5 to 150.0 basis points).\nRefer to Note 10 for the fair values, principal balances, and carrying values of the Company’s debt instruments.\nFor discussion of the Company’s derivatives and hedging activities, refer to Note 17.\n3.

These restricted cash amounts are used to fund reserve accounts for the payment of (1) debt service\ncosts, (2) ground rents, real estate and personal property taxes and insurance premiums related to towers, (3) trustee and servicing\nexpenses, and (4) management fees. The restricted cash in the securitization escrow account in excess of required reserve balances is\nsubsequently released to the Borrowers (as defined in Note 10) monthly, provided that the Borrowers are in compliance with their debt\nservice coverage ratio and that no event of default has occurred. All monies held by the indenture trustee are classified as restricted cash\non the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nPayment and performance bonds relate primarily to collateral requirements for tower construction currently in process by the\nCompany.

INCOME TAXES\nThe primary reason for the difference between the Company’s effective tax rate and the U.S. statutory rate is the Company’s\nREIT election. A tax provision is recognized because U.S. taxable REIT subsidiary and certain foreign subsidiaries of the Company\nhave profitable operations or are in a net deferred tax liability position.\nThe Company elected to be taxed as a REIT commencing with its taxable year ended December 31, 2016. As a REIT, the\nCompany generally will be entitled to a deduction for dividends that it pays, and therefore, not subject to U.S. federal corporate income\ntax on that portion of its net income that it distributes to its shareholders. As a REIT, the Company will continue to pay U.S. federal\nincome tax on earnings, if any, from assets and operations held through its U.S. taxable REIT subsidiary. These assets and operations\ncurrently consist primarily of the Company’s site development services and its international operations. The Company’s international\noperations continue to be subject, as applicable, to foreign taxes in the jurisdictions in which those operations are located. The\nCompany may also be subject to a variety of taxes, including payroll taxes and state, local, and foreign income, property, and other\ntaxes on its assets and operations. The Company’s determination as to the timing and amount of future dividend distributions will be\nbased on a number of factors, including REIT distribution requirements, its existing federal net operating losses (“NOLs”) of\napproximately $382.3 million as of December 31, 2023, the Company’s financial condition, earnings, debt covenants, and other\npossible uses of such funds. The Company may use these NOLs to offset its REIT taxable income, and thus any required distributions\nto shareholders may be reduced or eliminated until such time as the NOLs have been fully utilized.\nThe Company is subject to income tax and other taxes in the geographic areas where it holds assets or operates, and the\nCompany periodically receives notifications of audits, assessments, or other actions by taxing authorities. In certain jurisdictions, taxing\nauthorities may issue notices and assessments that may not be reflective of the actual tax liability for which the Company will\nultimately be liable. In the process of responding to assessments of taxes that the Company believes are not reflective of the Company’s\nactual tax liability, the Company avails itself of both administrative and judicial remedies. The Company evaluates the circumstances of\neach notification or assessment based on the information available and, in those instances in which the Company does not anticipate a\nsuccessful defense of positions taken in its tax filings, a liability is recorded in the appropriate amount based on the underlying\nassessment.\nIn connection with a current assessment in Brazil, the taxing authorities have issued income tax deficiencies related to\npurchase accounting adjustments for tax years 2017 through 2019. The Company disagrees with the assessment and has filed an appeal\nwith the higher appellate taxing authorities. The Company estimates that there is a more likely than not probability that the Company’s\nposition will be sustained upon appeal. Accordingly, no liability has been recorded. The Company will continue to vigorously contest\nthe adjustments and expects to exhaust all administrative and judicial remedies necessary to resolve the matters, which could be a\nlengthy process. There can be no assurance that these matters will be resolved in the Company’s favor, and an adverse outcome, or any\nfuture tax examinations involving similar assertions, could have a material effect on the Company’s results of operations or cash flows\nin any one period. As of September 30, 2024, the Company estimates the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses in excess of\namounts accrued to be between zero and $68.9 million. This range excludes penalties and interest, which as of such date would have\nbeen $86.8 million.\n19\nTable of Contents\n14. SEGMENT DATA\nThe Company operates principally in two business segments: site leasing and site development. The Company’s site leasing\nbusiness includes two reportable segments, domestic site leasing and international site leasing. The Company’s business segments are\nstrategic business units that offer different services. They are managed separately based on the fundamental differences in their\noperations. The site leasing segment includes results of the managed and sublease businesses. The site development segment includes\nthe results of both consulting and construction related activities. The Company’s CODM utilizes segment operating profit and operating\nincome as his two measures of segment profit in assessing performance and allocating resources at the reportable segment level. The\nCompany has applied the aggregation criteria to operations within the international site leasing segment on a basis that is consistent\nwith management’s review of information and performance evaluations of the individual markets in this region.\nRevenues, cost of revenues (exclusive of depreciation, accretion and amortization), capital expenditures (including assets\nacquired through the issuance of shares of the Company’s Class A common stock) and identifiable assets pertaining to the segments in\nwhich the Company continues to operate are presented below.\nDomestic Site Int'l Site Site\nLeasing Leasing Development Other Total\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2024 (in thousands)\nRevenues (1) $ 464,860 $ 160,837 $ 41,898 $ — $ 667,595\nCost of revenues (2) 68,908 49,040 32,391 — 150,339\nOperating profit 395,952 111,797 9,507 — 517,256\nSelling, general, and administrative expenses 32,114 15,258 2,849 9,866 60,087\nAcquisition and new business initiatives\nrelated adjustments and expenses 3,496 1,892 — — 5,388\nAsset impairment and decommission costs 1,337 10,989 — 344 12,670\nDepreciation, amortization and accretion 34,636 26,098 895 1,886 63,515\nOperating income (loss) 324,369 57,560 5,763 (12,096) 375,596\nOther expense, net (principally interest\nexpense and other income) (77,389) (77,389)\nIncome before income taxes 298,207\nCash capital expenditures (3) 234,962 36,317 428 590 272,297\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2023\nRevenues (1) $ 468,371 $ 169,069 $ 45,104 $ — $ 682,544\nCost of revenues (2) 66,768 51,509 31,493 — 149,770\nOperating profit 401,603 117,560 13,611 — 532,774\nSelling, general, and administrative expenses 30,759 15,925 4,993 13,144 64,821\nAcquisition and new business initiatives\nrelated adjustments and expenses 2,369 3,243 — — 5,612\nAsset impairment and decommission costs 25,560 7,503 — — 33,063\nDepreciation, amortization and accretion 114,849 63,218 915 1,692 180,674\nOperating income (loss) 228,066 27,671 7,703 (14,836) 248,604\nOther expense, net (principally interest\nexpense and other income) (155,381) (155,381)\nIncome before income taxes 93,223\nCash capital expenditures (3) 81,886 31,583 1,280 681 115,430\n20\nTable of Contents\nDomestic Site Int'l Site Site\nLeasing Leasing Development Other Total\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024 (in thousands)\nRevenues (1) $ 1,389,563 $ 490,867 $ 105,504 $ — $ 1,985,934\nCost of revenues (2) 200,368 146,525 82,705 — 429,598\nOperating profit 1,189,195 344,342 22,799 — 1,556,336\nSelling, general, and administrative expenses 100,070 46,741 10,219 34,131 191,161\nAcquisition and new business initiatives\nrelated adjustments and expenses 11,883 7,496 — — 19,379\nAsset impairment and decommission costs 45,075 42,086 — 767 87,928\nDepreciation, amortization and accretion 108,851 87,384 2,767 5,442 204,444\nOperating income (loss) 923,316 160,635 9,813 (40,340) 1,053,424\nOther expense, net (principally interest\nexpense and other income) (436,632) (436,632)\nIncome before income taxes 616,792\nCash capital expenditures (3) 324,586 113,606 610 2,361 441,163\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2023\nRevenues (1) $ 1,379,959 $ 500,892 $ 155,709 $ — $ 2,036,560\nCost of revenues (2) 200,952 152,459 114,914 — 468,325\nOperating profit 1,179,007 348,433 40,795 — 1,568,235\nSelling, general, and administrative expenses 90,946 51,068 15,541 42,857 200,412\nAcquisition and new business initiatives\nrelated adjustments and expenses 8,174 8,448 — — 16,622\nAsset impairment and decommission costs 75,460 14,633 — 2,227 92,320\nDepreciation, amortization and accretion 351,689 185,522 2,767 4,931 544,909\nOperating income (loss) 652,738 88,762 22,487 (50,015) 713,972\nOther expense, net (principally interest\nexpense and other income) (303,893) (303,893)\nIncome before income taxes 410,079\nCash capital expenditures (3) 177,464 86,695 2,350 2,272 268,781\nDomestic Site Int'l Site Site\nLeasing Leasing Development Other (4) Total\nAssets (in thousands)\nAs of September 30, 2024 $ 6,173,557 $ 3,641,169 $ 55,076 $ 331,861 $ 10,201,663\nAs of December 31, 2023 $ 5,876,648 $ 3,871,164 $ 66,001 $ 364,628 $ 10,178,441\n(1) For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, site leasing revenue in Brazil was $89.3 million and $100.0 million,\nrespectively.

EARNINGS PER SHARE\nBasic earnings per share was computed by dividing net income attributable to SBA Communications Corporation by the\nweighted-average number of shares of Class A common stock outstanding for each respective period. Diluted earnings per share was\ncalculated by dividing net income attributable to SBA Communications Corporation by the weighted-average number of shares of\n21\nTable of Contents\nClass A common stock outstanding adjusted for any dilutive Class A common stock equivalents, including unvested RSUs, PSUs, and\nshares issuable upon exercise of stock options as determined under the “Treasury Stock” method.\nThe following table sets forth basic and diluted net income per common share attributable to common shareholders for the\nthree and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (in thousands, except per share data):\nFor the three months For the nine months\nended September 30, ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nNumerator:\nNet income attributable to SBA\nCommunications Corporation $ 258,534 $ 87,419 $ 575,906 $ 392,284\nDenominator:\nBasic weighted-average shares outstanding 107,486 108,373 107,683 108,288\nDilutive impact of stock options, RSUs, and PSUs 436 518 389 729\nDiluted weighted-average shares outstanding 107,922 108,891 108,072 109,017\nNet income per common share attributable to SBA\nCommunications Corporation:\nBasic $ 2.41 $ 0.81 $ 5.35 $ 3.62\nDiluted $ 2.40 $ 0.80 $ 5.33 $ 3.60\nFor the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the diluted weighted-average number of common shares\noutstanding excluded an immaterial number of shares issuable upon exercise of the Company’s stock options because the impact would\nbe anti-dilutive.\n16. REDEEMABLE NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS\nThe Company allocates income and losses to its redeemable noncontrolling interest holders based on the applicable\nmembership interest percentage. At each reporting period, the redeemable noncontrolling interest is recognized at the greater of (1) the\ninitial carrying amount of the noncontrolling interest as adjusted for accumulated income or loss attributable to the noncontrolling\ninterest holder or (2) the redemption value as of the balance sheet date. Adjustments to the carrying amount of redeemable\nnoncontrolling interest are charged against retained earnings (or additional paid-in capital if there are no retained earnings). The fair\nvalue of the redeemable noncontrolling interest is estimated using Level 3 inputs.\nThe components of redeemable noncontrolling interests as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 are as follows (in\nthousands):\nSeptember 30, December 31,\n2024 2023\nBeginning balance $ 35,047 $ 31,735\nNet loss attributable to noncontrolling interests (6,020) (4,397)\nForeign currency translation adjustments (662) (899)\nContribution from joint venture partner 1,530 1,200\nAdjustment to redemption amount 19,197 7,408\nEnding balance $ 49,092 $ 35,047\n17. DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES\nThe Company enters into interest rate swaps to hedge the future interest expense from variable rate debt and reduce the\nCompany’s exposure to fluctuations in interest rates. As of September 30, 2024, the Company has an interest rate swap agreement\non its 2024 Term Loan (as amended on October 2, 2024) which swaps $1.95 billion of notional value accruing interest at one\nmonth Term SOFR plus 175 basis points for an all-in fixed rate of 1.800% per annum through March 31, 2025.\nOn November 3, 2023, the Company entered into a forward-starting interest rate swap agreement which will swap $1.0\nbillion of notional value accruing interest at one month Term SOFR plus 175 basis points for an all-in fixed rate of 5.580% per\nannum. On September 6, 2024, the Company, through its wholly owned subsidiary, SBA Senior Finance II, entered into an\nadditional forward-starting interest rate swap agreement to swap $1.0 billion of notional value accruing interest at one month Term\nSOFR plus 175 basis points for an all-in fixed rate of 4.750% per annum (collectively the “forward-starting swaps”). The\n22\n\nTable of Contents\nforward-starting swaps have an effective start date of March 31, 2025 (coinciding with the expiration date of the current 0.050%,\n$1.95 billion notional value swap) and a maturity date of April 11, 2028. The combined notional value of both forward-starting\nswaps of $2.0 billion will effectively fix one month term SOFR for a blended all-in fixed rate of 5.165% per annum through April\n11, 2028.\nOn September 11, 2024, the Company entered into a treasury lock agreement to fix the three-year treasury rate at 3.3985%\nfor $620.0 million of notional value related to the 2024-2C Tower Securities issued on October 11, 2024. The treasury lock\nagreement was terminated and settled upon issuance of the 2024-2C Tower Securities, and the Company recognized an $8.2 million\ngain in other comprehensive income which is being amortized to interest expense over the life of the 2024-2C Tower Securities.\nAfter consideration of the treasury lock agreement, the all-in fixed rate on the 2024-2C Tower Securities is 4.654% per annum.\nAs of September 30, 2024, the hedges remain highly effective; therefore, changes in fair value are recorded in Accumulated\nother comprehensive loss, net.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF\nOPERATIONS\nWe are a leading independent owner and operator of wireless communications infrastructure, including tower structures,\nrooftops, and other structures that support antennas used for wireless communications, which we collectively refer to as “towers” or\n“sites.” Our principal operations are in the United States and its territories. In addition, we own and operate towers in South America,\nCentral America, Canada, South Africa, the Philippines, and Tanzania. Our primary business line is our site leasing business, which\ncontributed 98.5% of our total segment operating profit for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. In our site leasing business, we\n(1) lease space to wireless service providers and other customers on assets that we own or operate and (2) manage rooftop and tower\nsites for property owners under various contractual arrangements. As of September 30, 2024, we owned 39,762 towers, a\n23\nTable of Contents\nsubstantial portion of which have been built by us or built by other tower owners or operators who, like us, have built such towers to\nlease space to multiple wireless service providers. Our other business line is our site development business, through which we assist\nwireless service providers in developing and maintaining their own wireless service networks.\nSite Leasing\nOur primary focus is the leasing of antenna space on our multi-tenant towers to a variety of wireless service providers under\nlong-term lease contracts in the United States, South America, Central America, Canada, South Africa, the Philippines, and Tanzania.\nAs of September 30, 2024, no U.S. state or territory accounted for more than 10% of our total tower portfolio by tower count, and no\nU.S. state or territory accounted for more than 10% of our total revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. In addition, as\nof September 30, 2024, approximately 30% of our total towers are located in Brazil and no other international market (each country is\nconsidered a market) represented more than 5% of our total towers.\nWe derive site leasing revenues primarily from wireless service provider tenants. Wireless service providers enter into (1)\nindividual tenant site leases with us, each of which relates to the lease or use of space at an individual site or (2) master lease\nagreements (“MLA”) with us, which provide for the material terms and conditions that will apply to multiple sites; although, in most\ncases, each individual site under a MLA is also governed by its own site leasing agreement which sets forth pricing and other site\nspecific terms. Our tenant leases are generally for an initial term of five years to fifteen years with multiple renewal periods at the\noption of the tenant. Our tenant leases typically either (1) contain specific annual rent escalators, (2) escalate annually in accordance\nwith an inflationary index, or (3) escalate using a combination of fixed and inflation adjusted escalators. In addition, our international\nsite leases may include pass-through charges, such as rent related to ground leases and other property interests, utilities, property taxes,\nand fuel.\nCost of site leasing revenue primarily consists of:\n(cid:0) Cash and non-cash rental expense on ground leases, right-of-use, and other underlying property interests;\n(cid:0) Property taxes;\n(cid:0) Site maintenance and monitoring costs (exclusive of employee related costs);\n(cid:0) Utilities;\n(cid:0) Property insurance;\n(cid:0) Fuel (in those international markets that do not have an available electric grid at our tower sites); and\n(cid:0) Lease initial direct cost amortization.\nGround leases and other property interests are generally for an initial term of five years or more with multiple renewal periods,\nwhich are at our option. Our ground leases either (1) contain specific annual rent escalators or (2) escalate annually in accordance with\nan inflationary index. As of September 30, 2024, approximately 71% of our tower structures were located on parcels of land that we\nown, land subject to perpetual easements, or parcels of land in which we have a leasehold interest that extends beyond 20 years. For\nany given tower, costs are relatively fixed over a monthly or an annual time period. As such, operating costs for owned towers do not\ngenerally increase as a result of adding additional customers to the tower. The amount of property taxes varies from site to site\ndepending on the taxing jurisdiction and the height and age of the tower. The ongoing maintenance requirements are typically minimal\nand include replacing lighting systems, painting a tower, or upgrading or repairing an access road or fencing.\nIn Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Nicaragua, and Panama, significantly all of our revenue, expenses, and capital\nexpenditures arising from our activities are denominated in U.S. dollars. Specifically, most of our ground leases and other property\ninterests, tenant leases, and tower-related expenses are paid in U.S. dollars. In our Central American markets, our local currency\nobligations are principally limited to (1) permitting and other local fees, (2) utilities, and (3) taxes. In Brazil, Canada, Chile, South\nAfrica, and the Philippines, significantly all of our revenue, expenses, and capital expenditures, including tenant leases, ground leases\nand other property interests, and other tower-related expenses are denominated in local currency. In Colombia, Costa Rica, Peru, and\nTanzania, our revenue, expenses, and capital expenditures, including tenant leases, ground leases and other property interests, and other\ntower-related expenses are denominated in a mix of local currency and U.S. dollars.\n24\nTable of Contents\nAs indicated in the table below, our site leasing business generates substantially all of our total segment operating profit. For\ninformation regarding our operating segments, see Note 14 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this quarterly report.\nFor the three months ended For the nine months ended\nSegment operating profit as a percentage of September 30, September 30,\ntotal operating profit 2024 2023 2024 2023\nDomestic site leasing 76.5% 75.4% 76.4% 75.1%\nInternational site leasing 21.7% 22.0% 22.1% 22.3%\nTotal site leasing 98.2% 97.4% 98.5% 97.4%\nWe believe that the site leasing business continues to be attractive due to its long-term contracts, built-in rent escalators, high\noperating margins, and low customer churn (which refers to a lease that is non-renewed, cancelled, or discounted prior to the end of its\nterm) other than in connection with customer consolidation or cessations of specific technology. We believe that over the long-term, site\nleasing revenues will continue to grow as wireless service providers lease additional antenna space on our towers due to increasing\nminutes of network use and data transfer, network expansion, and network coverage requirements.\nDuring the remainder of 2024, we expect organic site leasing revenue in both our domestic and international segments to\nincrease over 2023 levels, on a currency neutral basis, due in part to wireless carriers deploying unused spectrum. We believe our site\nleasing business is characterized by stable and long-term recurring revenues, predictable operating costs, and minimal non-discretionary\ncapital expenditures. Due to the relatively young age and mix of our tower portfolio, we expect future expenditures required to maintain\nthese towers to be minimal. Consequently, we expect to grow our cash flows by (1) adding tenants to our towers at minimal incremental\ncosts by using existing tower capacity or requiring wireless service providers to bear all or a portion of the cost of tower modifications\nand (2) executing monetary amendments as wireless service providers add or upgrade their equipment. Furthermore, because our\ntowers are strategically positioned, we have historically experienced low tenant lease terminations as a percentage of revenue other than\nin connection with customer consolidation or cessations of a specific technology.\nSite Development\nOur site development business, which is conducted in the United States only, is complementary to our site leasing business and\nprovides us the ability to keep in close contact with the wireless service providers who generate substantially all of our site leasing\nrevenue and to capture ancillary revenues that are generated by our site leasing activities, such as antenna and equipment installation at\nour tower locations. Site development revenues are earned primarily from providing a full range of end-to-end services to wireless\nservice providers or companies providing development or project management services to wireless service providers. Our services\ninclude: (1) network pre-design; (2) site audits; (3) identification of potential locations for towers and antennas on existing\ninfrastructure; (4) support in leasing of the location; (5) assistance in obtaining zoning approvals and permits; (6) tower and related site\nconstruction; (7) antenna installation; and (8) radio equipment installation, commissioning, and maintenance. We provide site\ndevelopment services at our towers and at towers owned by others on a local basis, through regional, market, and project offices. The\nmarket offices are responsible for all site development operations.\nFor information regarding our operating segments, see Note 14 to our Consolidated Financial Statements in this quarterly\nreport.\nCapital Allocation Strategy\nOur capital allocation strategy is aimed at increasing shareholder value through investment in quality assets that meet our\nreturn criteria, stock repurchases when we believe our stock price is below its intrinsic value, and by returning cash generated by our\noperations in the form of cash dividends. In addition, in a high interest rate environment and when we believe interest rates may stay\nhigher for longer, we believe that debt repayments, especially of our variable rate debt, may be an accretive use of our excess capital.\nWhile the addition of cash dividends and debt repayments have provided us with additional tools to return value to our shareholders, we\ncontinue to believe that our priority is to make investments focused on increasing Adjusted Funds From Operations per share. Key\nelements of our capital allocation strategy include:\nPortfolio Growth. We intend to continue to grow our asset portfolio, domestically and internationally, primarily through tower\nacquisitions and the construction of new towers that meet our internal return on invested capital criteria.\nStock Repurchase Program. We currently utilize stock repurchases as part of our capital allocation policy when we believe our\nshare price is below its intrinsic value. We believe that share repurchases, when purchased at the right price, will facilitate our goal of\nincreasing our Adjusted Funds From Operations per share.\n25\nTable of Contents\nDividend. Cash dividends are an additional component of our strategy of returning value to shareholders. We do not expect our\ndividend to require any changes in our leverage and believe that, due to our low dividend payout ratio, we can continue to focus on\nbuilding and buying quality assets and opportunistically buying back our stock. While the timing and amount of future dividends will\nbe subject to approval by our Board of Directors, we believe that our future cash flow generation will permit us to grow our cash\ndividend in the future.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nWe have identified the policies and significant estimation processes listed below and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K as\ncritical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations. The listing is not intended to be a comprehensive\nlist. In many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by accounting principles generally\naccepted in the United States, with no need for management’s judgment in their application. In other cases, management is required to\nexercise judgment in the application of accounting principles with respect to particular transactions. The impact and any associated\nrisks related to these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial\nCondition and Results of Operations” where such policies affect reported and expected financial results. For a detailed discussion on\nthe application of these and other accounting policies, see Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements contained in our Annual\nReport on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Our preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates\nand assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our\nfinancial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. Management bases its estimates\non historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. There can be no\nassurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates and such differences could be significant.\nDuring the first quarter of 2024, we completed our assessment on the remaining estimated useful lives of our towers and\nintangible assets. We concluded through our assessment that, for U.S. GAAP purposes, we should modify our current estimates for\nasset lives based on our historical operating experience and the findings obtained by our independent consultant. We previously\ndepreciated our towers on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the (i) term of the underlying ground lease (including renewal\noptions) taking into account residual value or (ii) estimated useful life of a tower, which we had historically estimated to be 15 years.\nBased on our assessment, we revised the estimated useful lives of our towers and certain related intangible assets (which are amortized\non a similar basis to our tower assets, as their useful lives correlate to the useful life of the towers) from 15 years to 30 years, effective\nJanuary 1, 2024. We accounted for the change in estimated useful lives as a change in estimate under ASC 250 “Accounting Changes\nand Error Corrections.” The impact of the change in estimate was accounted for prospectively effective January 1, 2024, resulting in a\nreduction in depreciation and amortization expense of approximately $103.0 million ($93.3 million after tax, or an increase of $0.86 per\ndiluted share) and $308.5 million ($279.2 million after tax, or an increase of $2.58 per diluted share) for the three and nine months\nended September 30, 2024, respectively. This change in useful lives is expected to reduce depreciation and amortization expense by\napproximately $411.5 million ($372.5 million after tax, or an increase of $3.45 per diluted share) for the year ended December 31,\n2024.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThis report presents our financial results and other financial metrics on a GAAP basis and, with respect to our international\nand consolidated results, after eliminating the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. We believe that providing these\nfinancial results and metrics on a constant currency basis, which are non-GAAP measures, gives management and investors the ability\nto evaluate the performance of our business without the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. We eliminate the impact\nof changes in foreign currency exchange rates by dividing the current period’s financial results by the average monthly exchange rates\nof the prior year period, as well as by eliminating the impact of realized and unrealized gains and losses on our intercompany loans.\n26\nTable of Contents\nThree Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to Three Months Ended September 30, 2023\nRevenues and Segment Operating Profit:\nFor the three months ended Constant\nSeptember 30, Foreign Constant Currency\n2024 2023 Currency Impact Currency Change % Change\nRevenues (in thousands)\nDomestic site leasing $ 464,860 $ 468,371 $ — $ (3,511) (0.7%)\nInternational site leasing 160,837 169,069 (13,370) 5,138 3.0%\nSite development 41,898 45,104 — (3,206) (7.1%)\nTotal $ 667,595 $ 682,544 $ (13,370) $ (1,579) (0.2%)\nCost of Revenues\nDomestic site leasing $ 68,908 $ 66,768 $ — $ 2,140 3.2%\nInternational site leasing 49,040 51,509 (4,096) 1,627 3.2%\nSite development 32,391 31,493 — 898 2.9%\nTotal $ 150,339 $ 149,770 $ (4,096) $ 4,665 3.1%\nOperating Profit\nDomestic site leasing $ 395,952 $ 401,603 $ — $ (5,651) (1.4%)\nInternational site leasing 111,797 117,560 (9,274) 3,511 3.0%\nSite development 9,507 13,611 — (4,104) (30.2%)\nRevenues\nDomestic site leasing revenues decreased $3.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the\nprior year, primarily due to Sprint lease non-renewals and one-time revenue benefits recognized during the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023, partially offset by (1) organic site leasing growth, primarily from monetary lease amendments and additional\nequipment added to our towers as well as new leases and contractual rent escalators and (2) revenues from 116 towers acquired and 26\ntowers built since July 1, 2023.\nInternational site leasing revenues decreased $8.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the\nprior year.

We have provided below a description\nof Adjusted EBITDA, a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to its most directly comparable GAAP measure and an explanation as to\nwhy management utilizes this measure. This report also presents our financial results and other financial metrics after eliminating the\nimpact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. We believe that providing these financial results and metrics on a constant\ncurrency basis, which are non-GAAP measures, gives management and investors the ability to evaluate the performance of our business\nwithout the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. We eliminate the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange\nrates by dividing the current period’s financial results by the average monthly exchange rates of the prior year period, as well as by\neliminating the impact of the remeasurement of our intercompany loans.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nWe define Adjusted EBITDA as net income excluding the impact of non-cash straight-line leasing revenue, non-cash straight-\nline ground lease expense, non-cash compensation, net loss from extinguishment of debt, other income and expenses, acquisition and\nnew business initiatives related adjustments and expenses, asset impairment and decommission costs, interest income, interest\nexpenses, depreciation, accretion, and amortization, and income taxes.\nWe believe that Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors or other interested parties in evaluating our financial performance.\nAdjusted EBITDA is the primary measure used by management (1) to evaluate the economic productivity of our operations and (2) for\npurposes of making decisions about allocating resources to, and assessing the performance of, our operations. Management believes\nthat Adjusted EBITDA helps investors or other interested parties to meaningfully evaluate and compare the results of our operations (1)\nfrom period to period and (2) to our competitors, by excluding the impact of our capital structure (primarily interest charges from our\noutstanding debt) and asset base (primarily depreciation, amortization, and accretion) from our financial results. Management also\nbelieves Adjusted EBITDA is frequently used by investors or other interested parties in the evaluation of REITs. In addition, Adjusted\nEBITDA is similar to the measure of current financial performance generally used by our lenders to determine compliance with certain\ncovenants under our Senior Credit Agreement and the indentures relating to the 2020 Senior Notes and 2021 Senior Notes. Adjusted\nEBITDA should be considered only as a supplement to net income computed in accordance with GAAP as a measure of our\nperformance.\n34\nTable of Contents\nFor the three months ended Constant\nSeptember 30, Foreign Constant Currency\n2024 2023 Currency Impact Currency Change % Change\n(in thousands)\nNet income $ 255,891 $ 85,362 $ 45,767 $ 124,762 106.9%\nNon-cash straight-line leasing revenue (1,065) (7,048) (7) 5,990 (85.0%)\nNon-cash straight-line ground lease expense 945 (428) (161) 1,534 (358.4%)\nNon-cash compensation 16,373 21,374 (110) (4,891) (22.9%)\nOther (income) expense, net (23,700) 48,330 (72,114) 84 5.4%\nAcquisition and new business initiatives\nrelated adjustments and expenses 5,388 5,612 (143) (81) (1.4%)\nAsset impairment and decommission costs 12,670 33,063 (945) (19,448) (58.8%)\nInterest income (6,999) (5,266) 262 (1,995) 37.9%\nInterest expense (1) 108,088 112,317 (74) (4,155) (3.7%)\nDepreciation, accretion, and amortization 63,515 180,674 (2,295) (114,864) (63.6%)\nProvision for income taxes (2) 41,514 8,141 21,153 12,220 51.9%\nAdjusted EBITDA $ 472,620 $ 482,131 $ (8,667) $ (844) (0.2%)\nFor the nine months ended Constant\nSeptember 30, Foreign Constant Currency\n2024 2023 Currency Impact Currency Change % Change\n(in thousands)\nNet income $ 569,886 $ 387,887 $ (104,192) $ 286,191 78.2%\nNon-cash straight-line leasing revenue (10,623) (21,378) 59 10,696 (50.0%)\nNon-cash straight-line ground lease expense (5,426) 135 (221) (5,340) (3,955.6%)\nNon-cash compensation 56,439 65,830 (231) (9,160) (13.9%)\nLoss from extinguishment of debt, net 4,428 — — 4,428 —%\nOther expense (income), net 125,811 (29,961) 156,206 (434) 7.7%\nAcquisition and new business initiatives\nrelated adjustments and expenses 19,379 16,622 (324) 3,081 18.5%\nAsset impairment and decommission costs 87,928 92,320 (1,326) (3,066) (3.3%)\nInterest income (21,359) (12,765) 296 (8,890) 69.6%\nInterest expense (1) 327,752 346,619 (233) (18,634) (5.4%)\nDepreciation, accretion, and amortization 204,444 544,909 (3,074) (337,391) (61.9%)\nProvision for income taxes (2) 46,436 22,971 (57,776) 81,241 889.7%\nAdjusted EBITDA $ 1,405,095 $ 1,413,189 $ (10,816) $ 2,722 0.2%\n(1) Total interest expense includes interest expense, non-cash interest expense, and amortization of deferred financing fees.\n(2) Provision for income taxes includes $0.8 million and $0.5 million of benefit from franchise and gross receipts taxes for the\nthree and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, reflected in selling, general, and administrative expenses on\nthe Consolidated Statements of Operations.

SBAC’s only\nsignificant asset is 100% of the outstanding capital stock of SBA Telecommunications, LLC (“Telecommunications”), which is also a\nholding company that owns equity interests in entities that directly or indirectly own all of our domestic and international towers and\nassets. We conduct all of our business operations through Telecommunications’ subsidiaries. Accordingly, our only source of cash to\npay our obligations, other than financings, is distributions with respect to our ownership interest in our subsidiaries from the net\nearnings and cash flow generated by these subsidiaries.\nA summary of our cash flows is as follows:\nFor the nine months ended September 30,\n2024 2023\n(in thousands)\nCash provided by operating activities $ 1,024,697 $ 1,111,782\nCash used in investing activities (480,420) (361,876)\nCash used in financing activities (533,848) (705,664)\nChange in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash 10,429 44,242\nEffect of exchange rate changes on cash, cash equiv., and restricted cash (9,883) (1,441)\nCash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash, beginning of period 250,946 189,283\nCash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash, end of period $ 251,492 $ 232,084\nOperating Activities\nCash provided by operating activities was $1.0 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to $1.1\nbillion for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to increases in cash outflows associated with\nworking capital changes related to the timing of customer payments and cash asset impairment and decommission costs as well as a\ndecrease in site development segment operating profit, partially offset by an increase in site leasing segment operating profit and\ninterest income and a decrease in interest expense.\nInvesting Activities\nA detail of our cash capital expenditures is as follows:\nFor the nine months ended September 30,\n2024 2023\n(in thousands)\nAcquisitions of towers and related assets $ (234,853) $ (63,411)\nLand buyouts and other assets (1) (33,556) (29,440)\nConstruction and related costs (96,683) (70,485)\nAugmentation and tower upgrades (38,485) (62,301)\nTower maintenance (33,792) (37,101)\nGeneral corporate (3,640) (4,089)\nOther investing activities (2)(3) (39,411) (95,049)\nNet cash used in investing activities $ (480,420) $ (361,876)\n(1) Excludes $17.0 million and $15.0 million spent to extend ground lease terms for the nine months ended September 30, 2024\nand 2023, respectively.

(“Millicom”) for approximately $975.0 million in cash. These sites are located in\nGuatemala, Honduras, Panama, El Salvador, and Nicaragua, with significantly all cash flows denominated in USD. Upon closing,\n36\nTable of Contents\nMillicom will enter into country-specific MLAs to lease back space on all acquired sites for an initial term of 15 years. The MLAs will\nalso incorporate an extension to our approximately 1,500 existing site leases with Millicom for a new 15-year term. Additionally, as\npart of the purchase agreement, we have agreed to a seven-year exclusivity right with Millicom for us to build up to 2,500 build-to-suit\nsites in Central America for Millicom with new leases on any sites built having an initial lease term of 15 years. This transaction, which\nis subject to antitrust approvals and other closing conditions, is expected to close some time in 2025.\nIn addition to the Millicom transaction, subsequent to September 30, 2024, we purchased or are under contract to purchase 45\ncommunication sites which are expected to close by the end of the first quarter of 2025 at the time of this report for an aggregate\nconsideration of $16.3 million in cash.\nFor 2024, we expect to incur non-discretionary cash capital expenditures associated with tower maintenance and general\ncorporate expenditures of $51.0 million to $57.0 million and discretionary cash capital expenditures, based on current or potential\nacquisition obligations, planned new tower construction, forecasted tower augmentations, and forecasted ground lease purchases, of\n$490.0 million to $500.0 million. We expect to fund these cash capital expenditures from cash on hand, cash flow from operations, and\nborrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility or new financings. The exact amount of our future cash capital expenditures will\ndepend on a number of factors, including amounts necessary to support our tower portfolio, our new tower build and acquisition\nprograms, and our ground lease purchase program.\nFinancing Activities\nA detail of our financing activities is as follows:\nFor the nine months ended September 30,\n2024 2023\n(in thousands)\nNet repayments under Revolving Credit Facility (1) $ (20,000) $ (350,000)\nProceeds from issuance of Term Loans, net of fees (1) 2,274,815 —\nRepayment of Term Loans (1) (2,279,500) (18,000)\nRepurchase and retirement of common stock (2) (200,019) (53,652)\nPayment of dividends on common stock (318,808) (278,201)\nProceeds from employee stock purchase/stock option plans 27,144 21,058\nPayments related to taxes on stock options and restricted stock units (18,187) (27,472)\nOther financing activities 707 603\nNet cash used in financing activities $ (533,848) $ (705,664)\n(1) For additional information regarding our debt instruments and financings, refer to “Debt Instruments and Debt Service\nRequirements” below.\n(2) As of the date of this filing, we had $204.7 million remaining under the current authorized share repurchase plan.\nDividends\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we paid the following cash dividends:\nPayable to Shareholders\nof Record at the Close Cash Paid Aggregate Amount\nDate Declared of Business on Per Share Paid Date Paid\nFebruary 26, 2024 March 14, 2024 $0.98 $108.1 million (1) March 28, 2024\nApril 29, 2024 May 23, 2024 $0.98 $105.3 million June 18, 2024\nJuly 28, 2024 August 22, 2024 $0.98 $105.3 million September 18, 2024\n(1) Amount reflected includes the payment of $1.9 million in dividend equivalents.\nDividends paid in 2024 were ordinary taxable dividends.\n37\nTable of Contents\nSubsequent to September 30, 2024, we declared the following cash dividends:\nPayable to Shareholders Cash to\nof Record at the Close be Paid\nDate Declared of Business on Per Share Date to be Paid\nOctober 27, 2024 November 14, 2024 $0.98 December 12, 2024\nThe amount of future distributions will be determined, from time to time, by our Board of Directors to balance our goal of\nincreasing long-term shareholder value and retaining sufficient cash to implement our current capital allocation policy, which prioritizes\ninvestment in quality assets that meet our return criteria, and then stock repurchases when we believe our stock price is below its\nintrinsic value.

Amounts borrowed under the Revolving Credit Facility accrue interest, at\nSBA Senior Finance II’s election, at either (1) the Eurodollar Rate or Term SOFR Rate plus a margin that ranges from 112.5 basis\npoints to 150.0 basis points or (2) the Base Rate plus a margin that ranges from 12.5 basis points to 50.0 basis points, in each case based\non the ratio of Consolidated Net Debt to Annualized Borrower EBITDA, calculated in accordance with the Senior Credit Agreement. In\naddition, SBA Senior Finance II, is required to pay a commitment fee of between 0.15% and 0.25% per annum on the\n38\nTable of Contents\namount of unused commitment. Furthermore, the Revolving Credit Facility incorporates sustainability-linked targets which will adjust\nthe Revolving Credit Facility’s applicable interest and commitment fee rates upward or downward based on how we perform against\nthose targets. Borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility may be used for general corporate purposes. SBA Senior Finance II may,\nfrom time to time, borrow from and repay the Revolving Credit Facility. Consequently, the amount outstanding under the Revolving\nCredit Facility at the end of the period may not be reflective of the total amounts outstanding during such period.\nThe key terms of the Revolving Credit Facility are as follows:\nUnused\nInterest Rate Commitment\nas of Fee as of\nSeptember 30, 2024 (1) September 30, 2024 (2)\nRevolving Credit Facility 5.925% 0.140%\n(1) The rate reflected includes a 0.050% reduction in the applicable spread as a result of meeting certain sustainability-linked\ntargets as of December 31, 2023.\n(2) The rate reflected includes a 0.010% reduction in the applicable commitment fee as a result of meeting certain sustainability-\nlinked targets as of December 31, 2023.\nThe table below summarizes our Revolving Credit Facility activity during the three and nine months ended September 30,\n2024 and 2023 (in thousands):\nFor the three months For the nine months\nended September 30, ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nBeginning outstanding balance $ 120,000 $ 450,000 $ 180,000 $ 720,000\nBorrowings 175,000 50,000 370,000 190,000\nRepayments (135,000) (130,000) (390,000) (540,000)\nEnding outstanding balance $ 160,000 $ 370,000 $ 160,000 $ 370,000\nSubsequent to September 30, 2024, we repaid $160.0 million under the Revolving Credit Facility, and as of the date of this\nfiling, no amount remains outstanding.\nTerm Loan under the Senior Credit Agreement\n2024 Term Loan\nOn January 25, 2024, we, through our wholly owned subsidiary, SBA Senior Finance II, issued a term loan (the “2024 Term\nLoan”) under the amended and restated Senior Credit Agreement. The 2024 Term Loan consists of a senior secured term loan with an\ninitial aggregate principal amount of $2.3 billion that matures on January 25, 2031. The 2024 Term Loan (as amended on October 2,\n2024) accrues interest, at SBA Senior Finance II's election, at either the Base Rate (with a zero Base Rate floor) plus 75 basis points or\nat Term SOFR (with a floor of 0%) plus 175 basis points. The 2024 Term Loan was issued at 99.75% of par value. The proceeds from\nthe 2024 Term Loan were used to retire the 2018 Term Loan and to pay related fees and expenses. In connection with the repayment,\nwe expensed $3.3 million of net deferred financing fees and $1.2 million of discount related to the debt. The 2024 Term Loan has a\nblended rate of 2.760%, which includes the impact of the interest rate swaps. Excluding the impact of the interest rate swap, the 2024\nTerm Loan was accruing interest at 6.850% as of September 30, 2024.\nPrincipal payments on the 2024 Term Loan will be made in quarterly installments on the last day of each March, June,\nSeptember, and December in an amount equal to $5.75 million. We incurred financing fees of approximately $19.4 million in\nconnection with this transaction, which are being amortized through the maturity date.\nDuring the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we repaid an aggregate of $5.75 million and $11.5 million of\nprincipal on the 2024 Term Loan, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, the 2024 Term Loan had a principal balance of $2.3 billion.\n39\nTable of Contents\nSecured Tower Revenue Securities\nAs of September 30, 2024, the entities that are borrowers on the mortgage loan (the “Borrowers”) met the debt service\ncoverage ratio required by the mortgage loan agreement and were in compliance with all other covenants as set forth in the agreement.\nThe sole asset of the Trust consists of a non-recourse mortgage loan made in favor of the Borrowers.\n2014-2C Tower Securities\nOn October 11, 2024, we repaid the aggregate principal amount of the 2014-2C Tower Securities ($620.0 million) using\nproceeds from the issuance of the 2024 Tower Securities.\n2024 Tower Securities\nOn October 11, 2024, we, through a New York common law trust (the “Trust”), issued $1.45 billion of 4.831% Secured Tower\nRevenue Securities Series 2024-1C which have an anticipated repayment date of October 9, 2029 and a final maturity date of October\n8, 2054 (the “2024-1C Tower Securities”) and $620.0 million of 5.115% Secured Tower Revenue Securities Series 2024-2C, which\nhave an anticipated repayment date of October 8, 2027 and a final maturity date of October 8, 2054 (the “2024-2C Tower Securities”)\n(collectively the “2024 Tower Securities”). In anticipation of the issuance of the 2024-2C Tower Securities, we, through our wholly\nowned subsidiary, Senior Finance II, entered into a treasury lock agreement to fix the 2024-2C Tower Securities at an effective rate of\n4.654%. The aggregate $2.07 billion of 2024 Tower Securities have a blended effective interest rate of 4.778% and a weighted average\nlife through the anticipated repayment date of 4.4 years.\nNet proceeds from this offering were used to repay the aggregate principal amount of the 2014-2C Tower Securities ($620.0\nmillion), and the remaining proceeds will be used to repay the aggregate principal amount of the 2019-1C Tower Securities ($1.165\nbillion), the 2019-1R Tower Securities ($61.4 million), and for general corporate purposes. $1.165 billion of the proceeds are being held\nin escrow, by the Trust, earning interest at the U.S. federal funds rate less 10 basis points until the repayment of the 2019-1C Tower\nSecurities. We have incurred deferred financing fees of $17.6 million in connection with this transaction, which are being amortized\nthrough the anticipated repayment date of the 2024 Tower Securities.\nTower Revenue Securities Terms\nAs of September 30, 2024, we, through the Trust, had issued and outstanding an aggregate of $6.9 billion of Secured Tower\nRevenue Securities (“Tower Securities”). The sole asset of the Trust consists of a non-recourse mortgage loan made in favor of certain\nof our subsidiaries that are borrowers on the mortgage loan (the “Borrowers”) under which there is a loan tranche for each Tower\nSecurity outstanding with the same interest rate and maturity date as the corresponding Tower Security.

These securities have an anticipated repayment date of October\n9, 2029 and a final maturity date of October 8, 2054 (the “2024-1R Tower Securities”).

We may\nredeem each of the senior notes during the time periods and at the redemption prices set forth in the indentures.\nDebt Service\nAs of September 30, 2024, we believe that our cash on hand, capacity available under our Revolving Credit Facility, and cash\nflows from operations for the next twelve months will be sufficient to service our outstanding debt during the next twelve months.\n41\nTable of Contents\nThe following table illustrates our estimate of our debt service requirement over the next twelve months ended September 30,\n2025 based on the amounts outstanding as of September 30, 2024 and the interest rates accruing on those amounts on such date (in\nthousands):\nRevolving Credit Facility (1) $ 12,056\n2024 Term Loan (2) 112,892\n2014-2C Tower Securities (3) 620,937\n2019-1C Tower Securities (4) 1,198,409\n2020-1C Tower Securities 14,368\n2020-2C Tower Securities 14,159\n2021-1C Tower Securities 19,371\n2021-2C Tower Securities 16,752\n2021-3C Tower Securities 23,491\n2022-1C Tower Securities 56,362\n2020 Senior Notes 58,125\n2021 Senior Notes 46,875\nTotal debt service for the next 12 months (4) $ 2,193,797\n(1) As of September 30, 2024, $160.0 million was outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility. Subsequent to September 30,\n2024, we repaid $160.0 million under the Revolving Credit Facility, and as of the date of this filing, no amount remains\noutstanding.\n(2) Total debt service on the 2024 Term Loan (as amended on October 2, 2024) includes the impact of the interest rate swap which\nswaps $1.95 billion of notional value accruing interest at Term SOFR plus 175 basis points for an all-in fixed rate of 1.800%\nper annum through March 31, 2025 and the forward-starting interest rate swaps, which will swap $2.0 billion of notional value\naccruing interest at Term SOFR plus 175 basis points for a blended all-in fixed rate of 5.165% per annum beginning March 31,\n2025 through April 11, 2028.\n(3) On October 11, 2024, we repaid the full amount of the 2014-2C Tower Securities with proceeds from the 2024-2C Tower\nSecurities.\n(4) Our total debt service does not include any amounts for the 2024-1C and 2024-2C Tower Securities. Total debt service for the\ntwelve months ended September 30, 2025 related to the 2024 Tower Securities is projected to be $98.9 million. $1.165 billion\nof the proceeds from the 2024-1C Tower Securities are being held in escrow, by the Trust, earning interest at the U.S. federal\nfunds rate less 10 basis points until the repayment of the 2019-1C Tower Securities.\nInflation\nThe impact of inflation on our operations has not been material to date. However, the impact of rising interest rates, due to\nactions by the Federal Reserve to combat inflation, has impacted, and is expected to continue to impact, our growth rate and future\noperating results. Increasing interest rates has impacted, and is expected to continue to impact, the ability and willingness of wireless\nservice providers to incur capital expenditures at prior levels to expand their networks, which could adversely affect our future revenue\ngrowth rates. In addition, increased interest rates may adversely affect our costs to refinance our indebtedness at maturity. In addition,\npersistent high rates of inflation could adversely affect our future operating results particularly in light of the fact that our site leasing\nrevenues are governed by long-term contracts with pre-determined pricing that we will not be able to increase in response to increases\nin inflation other than our contracts in South America, South Africa, the Philippines, and Tanzania which have inflationary index based\nrent escalators.\n42\nTable of Contents\nITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nWe are exposed to certain market risks that are inherent in our financial instruments. These instruments arise from transactions\nentered into in the normal course of business.\nThe following table presents the future principal payment obligations and fair values associated with our long-term debt\ninstruments assuming our actual level of long-term indebtedness as of September 30, 2024:\n2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 Thereafter Total Fair Value\n(in thousands)\nRevolving Credit Facility $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ 160,000 $ 160,000 $ 160,000\n2024 Term Loan 5,750 23,000 23,000 23,000 23,000 2,190,750 2,288,500 2,292,802\n2014-2C Tower Securities (1) 620,000 — — — — — 620,000 619,442\n2019-1C Tower Securities (1) — 1,165,000 — — — — 1,165,000 1,126,240\n2020-1C Tower Securities (1) — — 750,000 — — — 750,000 724,395\n2020-2C Tower Securities (1) — — — — 600,000 — 600,000 515,172\n2021-1C Tower Securities (1) — — 1,165,000 — — — 1,165,000 1,006,047\n2021-2C Tower Securities (1) — — — 895,000 — — 895,000 762,030\n2021-3C Tower Securities (1) — — — — — 895,000 895,000 677,605\n2022-1C Tower Securities (1) — — — — 850,000 — 850,000 876,486\n2020 Senior Notes — — — 1,500,000 — — 1,500,000 1,465,830\n2021 Senior Notes — — — — — 1,500,000 1,500,000 1,378,125\nTotal debt obligation $ 625,750 $ 1,188,000 $ 1,938,000 $ 2,418,000 $ 1,473,000 $ 4,745,750 $ 12,388,500 $ 11,604,174\n(1) For information on the anticipated repayment date and final maturity date for each Tower Security, refer to “Debt Instruments\nand Debt Service Requirements” above.\nOur current primary market risk exposure is (1) interest rate risk relating to our ability to refinance our debt at commercially\nreasonable rates, if at all, and (2) interest rate risk relating to the impact of interest rate movements on the variable portion of our 2024\nTerm Loan and any borrowings that we may incur under our Revolving Credit Facility, which are at floating rates. We manage the\ninterest rate risk on our outstanding debt through our large percentage of fixed rate debt, including interest rate swaps. While we cannot\npredict our ability to refinance existing debt or the impact interest rate movements will have on our existing debt, we continue to\nevaluate our financial position on an ongoing basis.\nWe have performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical 1% increase in our variable interest rates as of September\n30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, the analysis indicated that such an adverse movement would have caused our interest expense to\nincrease by approximately 1.8% for the nine months ended September 30, 2024.\nWe are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates in connection with our operations in Brazil,\nCanada, Chile, Peru, Colombia, South Africa, the Philippines, Tanzania, and to a lesser extent, our markets in Central America. In each\nof these countries, we pay most of our selling, general, and administrative expenses and a portion of our operating expenses, such as\ntaxes and utilities incurred in the country in local currency. In addition, in Brazil, Canada, Chile, South Africa, and the Philippines, we\nreceive significantly all of our revenue and pay significantly all of our operating expenses in local currency. In Colombia, Costa Rica,\nPeru, and Tanzania, we receive our revenue and pay our operating expenses in a mix of local currency and U.S. dollars. All transactions\ndenominated in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar are reported in U.S. Dollars at the applicable exchange rate. All assets and\nliabilities are translated into U.S. Dollars at exchange rates in effect at the end of the applicable fiscal reporting period, and all revenues\nand expenses are translated at average rates for the period. The cumulative translation effect is included in equity as a component of\nAccumulated other comprehensive loss, net. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, approximately 21.7% of our revenues and\napproximately 31.3% of our total operating expenses were denominated in foreign currencies.\nWe have performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical 10% adverse movement in the Brazilian Real from the\nquoted foreign currency exchange rates at September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, the analysis indicated that such an adverse\nmovement would have caused our revenues and operating income to decline by approximately 1.3% and 1.0%, respectively, for the\nnine months ended September 30, 2024.\nAs of September 30, 2024, we had intercompany debt, which is denominated in a currency other than the functional currency\nof the subsidiary in which it is recorded. As settlement of this debt is anticipated or planned in the foreseeable future, any changes in the\nforeign currency exchange rates will result in unrealized gains or losses, which will be included in our determination of net income. A\nchange of 10% in the underlying exchange rates of our unsettled intercompany debt at September 30, 2024 would have\n43\nTable of Contents\nresulted in approximately $114.8 million of unrealized gains or losses that would have been included in Other income (expense), net in\nour Consolidated Statements of Operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024.\nSpecial Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\nThis quarterly report contains “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933,\nas amended, and Section 21E of the Exchange Act.
