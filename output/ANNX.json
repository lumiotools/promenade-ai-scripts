ARCHER II, our Phase 3 trial in GA, is actively enrolling and designed to provide the first significant data for protection of vision in a pivotal GA trial. Finally, we’re anticipating data from our first-in-kind oral C1s program, ANX1502, with an improved tablet formulation in patients with CAD in the first quarter of 2025,” said Douglas Love, president and chief executive officer of Annexon.\n\nMr. Love continued, “Our portfolio of programs has provided consistent support for our approach to target C1q, a key upstream driver of neuroinflammatory diseases of the body, brain and eye, and we’re encouraged by the outlook for our programs. With a strong balance sheet and runway into the second half of 2026, we are laser-focused to deliver on our near-term goals and achieve our mission of helping millions of patients live their best lives.”\n\n**Recent Corporate and Clinical Program Updates**\n\n**Strengthened senior leadership team in commercial, medical affairs and health economics to advance global late-stage neuroinflammatory-targeted portfolio:** Appointments include Shikhar Agarwal, M.B.A. as senior vice president, head of commercial, Sunil B. Mehta, Pharm.D as senior vice president of medical affairs and Myoung Kim, PhD, M.A., M.B.A. as vice president of health economics and outcomes research.\n\n_Flagship Programs_\n\n**ANX005 in Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS):** First-in-kind monoclonal antibody designed to block C1q and the entire classical complement pathway in both the body and the brain has the potential to be the first targeted therapy for GBS, if approved.\n\n  * Positive topline Phase 3 data demonstrated statistically significant effects of ANX005 treatment on multiple measures of GBS, including on the primary endpoint GBS-disability scale (GBS-DS) \n    * Demonstrated higher likelihood of being in a better state of health as early as week 1, and observed through 26-weeks on the GBS-DS\n    * Early, robust and durable treatment effects expedited recovery and led to patients walking and off ventilation for those requiring it approximately one month earlier\n    * Single infusion of ANX005 was generally well-tolerated with a safety profile similar to placebo and balanced across groups\n    * Patients with baseline characteristics similar to those of patients in North America and Europe had greater responses to ANX005 over placebo than were observed in the overall population of the study\n  * Ongoing RWE study conducted by global experts in GBS using the International Guillain-Barré Syndrome Outcomes Study (IGOS) \n    * Study will produce a cohort of patients from our GBS Phase 3 trial matched to patients in the IGOS registry based on key prognostic factors to support BLA submission\n    * Study will compare outcomes of patients treated with ANX005 vs. patients treated with IVIg or plasma exchange assessed on the GBS-DS primary and other outcome measures, including impact on muscle strength\n\n\n\n**ANX007 in Geographic Atrophy (GA):** First-in-kind, non-pegylated antigen-binding fragment (Fab) designed to block C1q and the classical complement cascade locally in the eye is the only investigational medicine to date to show significant protection against ≥15-letter loss (vision protection) on the endpoint of best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) in GA.\n\n  * Ongoing global registrational Phase 3 ARCHER II trial, a well-powered, randomized, double masked, sham-controlled trial that will include a robust safety database expected to enroll approximately ~630 patients\n  * Regulatory alignment with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) on the primary outcome measure for the Phase 3 program, BCVA protection against ≥15-letter loss\n  * [New Phase 2 ARCHER data](https://ir.annexonbio.com/news-releases/news-release-details/annexon-provides-update-archer-ii-global-registrational-program) on the protection of vision and vision-related retinal structure presented at the 2024 American Society of Retina Specialists Annual Scientific meeting, at the Retina Society’s 57th annual scientific meeting, at the 24th annual Euretina Congress, at the American Academy of Ophthalmology (AAO) 2024 annual meeting and at the Eyecelerator conference at AAO. Highlighted data with ANX007 treatment included: \n    * Significant vision protection in both standard and low light conditions, and protection of photoreceptor integrity in the central fovea, the region of the retina most important for activities such as reading, driving and recognizing faces\n    * Enhanced protection of vision in healthier eyes and greater preservation of central photoreceptor cells in patients with less advanced GA, as measured by the photoreceptor ellipsoid zone (EZ) in the central fovea\n\n\n\n**ANX1502 for Autoimmune Conditions:** First-in-kind oral C1s inhibitor has the potential to offer the advantages of selective upstream classical complement inhibition with the convenience and flexibility of oral administration.\n\n  * Completed bridging study in healthy volunteers from a liquid suspension formulation to a twice daily tablet with safety and pharmacokinetic profile similar or better than previous studies\n  * Created an enteric-coated tablet formulation to enhance the patient experience and provide improved tolerability, for use in the proof-of-concept (POC) study in CAD\n  * Ongoing open label single arm study in CAD patients will evaluate enteric-coated tablet formulation of ANX1502 administered twice daily for up to 4 weeks. The study will characterize the pharmacodynamics of ANX1502 on objective and established markers of complement activation and disease-related hemolysis \n    * POC study is designed to enable advancement in multiple antibody-mediated autoimmune indications, including those with clinical validation and where approved treatments require weekly or every other week infusions\n\n\n\n**Key Anticipated Milestones for Flagship Programs**\n\n  * **ANX005 in GBS:** Initial topline data from RWE comparability protocol with IGOS expected by year-end 2024 to support a planned BLA submission in the first half of 2025\n  * **ANX007 in GA:** Phase 3 ARCHER II trial topline data expected in the second half of 2026. Plans for an injection-controlled study, ARROW, to assess the prevention of ≥15-letter loss of BCVA, are being assessed\n  * **ANX1502 in CAD:** Initial data from POC trial evaluating the pharmacodynamics of an oral tablet formulation in CAD expected in the first quarter of 2025\n\n\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results**\n\n  * **Cash and operating runway:** Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments were $340.1 million as of September 30, 2024.
