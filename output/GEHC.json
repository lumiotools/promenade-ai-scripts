NMP, headquartered in Tokyo, was formed in 1973 and generated revenues of 28.2B JPY (~$183M) in 2023. In addition to 13 manufacturing facilities, NMP also focuses on research and development, including nonclinical and clinical development of radiotracers and theranostics research. GE HealthCare has held its 50% stake in NMP since acquiring Amersham plc in 2004 and holds three positions on its Board of Directors. \n\nKevin O’Neill, President & CEO of the Pharmaceutical Diagnostics (PDx) segment of GE HealthCare, said: “As the third largest pharmaceutical market in the world1, and amongst the leading countries by number of cyclotrons2, Japan is on a path to becoming a leader in the $7 billion molecular imaging global market and a center of excellence for Asian markets. NMP will play a key role in that journey, including bringing its deep expertise and scale to global innovators looking to bring novel products to the Japan market and beyond. This will strengthen our precision care strategy in Asia and our existing footprint in Japan, where our contrast media and medical devices are used every day to enable imaging procedures across the country.” \n\nHiroshi Ueda, Executive Vise President, Sumitomo Chemical, said: “We are proud of our 50-year relationship with NMP and our partnership with GE HealthCare to ensure patients in Japan could benefit from access to molecular imaging. At a time of exciting developments in the industry, following its discussions with Sumitomo Chemical, we believe GE HealthCare is the best owner to enable NMP to continue its successful growth journey. I would like to recognize NMP’s leadership and talented team for their significant achievements to date and their commitment to patients.” \n\nAs a leading global medical technology and pharmaceutical diagnostics innovator, GE HealthCare provides both molecular imaging equipment and proprietary radiotracers used across major patient care areas. The recent U.S. FDA approval of GE HealthCare’s first-of-its-kind PET radiopharmaceutical, Flyrcado™ (flurpiridaz F 18 injection), its in-licensing of Phase II FAPI assets and broadening theranostics offerings are all examples of the company’s commitment to novel diagnostics that are shaping the future of molecular imaging to drive improved patient outcomes. GE HealthCare’s PDx segment is a global leader in imaging agents used to support over 120 million patient procedures per year globally, equivalent to four patient procedures every second. \n\nThe Company expects this transaction to be neutral to Adjusted EPS3,4 in year one and accretive thereafter. \n\nGE HealthCare was advised by Solomon Partners Securities, LLC. \n\n**Forward-Looking Statements**\n\nThis release contains forward-looking statements.

Sonic DL for 3D builds on GE HealthCare’s deep learning innovation legacy and the success of AIR Recon DL, which has helped over 34 million patients to date. Initially launched in 2023 for Cardiac MRI, Sonic DL provides up to 12 times scan acceleration while maintaining diagnostic qualityiii. Now, GE HealthCare is extending Sonic DL to 3D volumetric imaging, designing it to broaden its applicability to brain, spine, orthopedic and body exams, in addition to cardiac. This expansion is intended to retain the same impressive 12x acceleration and reduce scan times by up to 86%. \n\nHealthcare burnout has reached critical levels, with 63% of physicians and 49% of nurses reporting symptoms of burnout, according to a 2023 American Medical Association (AMA) surveyiv. Rising workloads, time constraints, and staffing shortages contribute to high stress and fatigue among healthcare professionals, directly impacting patient care. Addressing these challenges, Sonic DL for 3D is designed to help enable faster, high-quality imaging for a majorityv of MR exams. By combining Sonic DL’s speed with AIR Recon DL’svi noise reduction technology, this deep learning integration is intended to empower clinicians to significantly cut scan times, enhance image resolution by up to 55%, and enable faster, accurate diagnoses with greater ease. \n\nIn neurology, Sonic DL 3D is designed to enable high-resolution imaging of complex brain structures, allowing for quicker, clearer insights into neurological conditions. In orthopedics, it will help to speed up the imaging of joints, ligaments, and bones, reducing scan times to minimize patient discomfort, especially for those with mobility challenges. By advancing speed and clarity in these critical areas, Sonic DL 3D helps to enhance clinical workflows, improve patient comfort, and support timely diagnoses. \n\n“Today’s unveiling of Sonic DL for 3D reinforces our commitment to advancing medical imaging,” said Kelly Londy, President & CEO, Global MR, GE HealthCare. “Our deep learning, effortless imaging portfolio has already seen great success with AIR Recon DL and Sonic DL for cardiac. Now, with Sonic DL’s expansion to 3D and its ability to combine with AIR Recon DL, we’re offering a combination of speed, accuracy, and clarity. We believe Sonic DL will be a game-changer in key clinical areas, substantially impacting our customers' ability to deliver high-quality care while enhancing the capabilities of their existing systems through seamless upgrades.” \n\nGE HealthCare’s ongoing investment in deep learning technologies, available for both in-field MR upgrades and new installations, supports its vision of sustainable and equitable MR access. By equipping facilities with faster, high-quality imaging solutions, GE HealthCare aims to help healthcare providers reduce patient backlogs, increase exam capacity, and deliver more cost-effective care. \n\nWith Sonic DL’s extended capabilities in 3D imaging, GE HealthCare continues to lead as a top provider of AI-integrated MR technology, supporting clinicians in delivering precise, timely diagnostics while enhancing the patient experiencevii. \n\nLearn more about Sonic DL 3D at the Radiological Society of North America (RSNA) Annual Meeting, December 1–4, 2024, in Chicago, or online at [gehealthcare.com](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fevents.gehealthcare.com%2Fproduct_categories%2Fmagnetic-resonance-imaging-rsna-2024%2F&esheet=54159414&newsitemid=20241201889293&lan=en-US&anchor=gehealthcare.com&index=1&md5=51a613a0077e98ec52a9c2da1d5dd82f). \n\n**About GE HealthCare Technologies Inc.**\n\nGE HealthCare is a leading global medical technology, pharmaceutical diagnostics, and digital solutions innovator, dedicated to providing integrated solutions, services, and data analytics to make hospitals more efficient, clinicians more effective, therapies more precise, and patients healthier and happier.
