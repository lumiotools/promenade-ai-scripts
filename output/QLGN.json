Our investigational QN-302 compound is a small molecule selective transcription inhibitor with strong binding affinity to G4s prevalent in cancer cells; such binding could, by stabilizing the G4s against “unwinding,” help inhibit cancer cell proliferation. The investigational compounds within Qualigen’s family of Pan-RAS oncogene protein-protein interaction inhibitor small molecules are believed to inhibit or block the binding of mutated RAS genes’ proteins to their effector proteins, thereby leaving the proteins from the mutated RAS unable to cause further harm. In theory, such mechanism of action may be effective in the treatment of about one quarter of all cancers, including certain forms of pancreatic, colorectal, and lung cancers.\n\nIn July 2023, Qualigen [sold ](https://ir.qlgntx.com/full-news/?qm-storyId=4930998669403060)its FastPack® diagnostics business to Chembio Diagnostics, Inc., an American subsidiary of French diagnostics provider BIOSYNEX Group, a leader in the design and distribution of rapid tests.\n\n[ View Management Team ](https://ir.qlgntx.com/management-team/)\n\n[ View Board of Directors ](https://ir.qlgntx.com/board-of-directors/)\n\n## Stock Snapshot\n\n### Nasdaq: QLGN\n\nQualigen Therapeutics, Inc.\n\n[ View Detailed Stock Information ](https://ir.qlgntx.com/stock-quote/)\n\n## Latest Presentation\n\n  * [ **May 2024** __Corporate Presentation - May 2024__ ](https://ir.qlgntx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Qualigen-Corporate-Presentation-May-2024.pdf)\n\n\n\n## Latest Events\n\n  * [ **October 26, 2022** __LD Micro Main Event XV__ ](https://vimeo.com/766672925)\n\n\n\n  * [ **June 02, 2022, 1:00 PM EDT** __Corporate Update__ ](https://event.choruscall.com/mediaframe/webcast.html?webcastid=1UaUt5JH)\n\n\n\n  * [ **MAY 24, 2022, 7:00 AM EDT** __H.C.

(our predecessor) was formed as a Nevada limited liability company on March 29, 2004 under the name Ritter Natural Sciences, LLC. In September 2008, this company converted into a Delaware corporation under the name Ritter Pharmaceuticals, Inc. On May 22, 2020, upon completing a “reverse recapitalization” transaction with Qualigen, Inc., Ritter Pharmaceuticals, Inc. was renamed Qualigen Therapeutics, Inc. Qualisys Diagnostics, Inc. was formed as a Minnesota corporation in 1996, reincorporated to become a Delaware corporation in 1999, and then changed its name to Qualigen, Inc. in 2000. Qualigen, Inc. was a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. On July 20, 2023, we sold all of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of Qualigen, Inc. to Chembio Diagnostics, Inc. (“Chembio”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Biosynex, S.A. Following the consummation of this transaction, Qualigen, Inc. became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Chembio. \n\nWhen did Qualigen Therapeutics, Inc. become a public company?\n\nJune 29, 2015 as Ritter Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

These statements include those related to the Company’s prospects and strategy for the development of therapeutic drug candidates, including the timing of filing with the SEC to seek authorization to begin clinical trials of QN-247. Actual events or results may differ from the Company’s expectations. For example, there can be no assurance that the Company will develop any drugs (including QN-247 and RAS-F); that preclinical or clinical development of the Company’s drugs (including QN-247 and RAS-F) will be completed on any projected timeline or will be successful; that any clinical trials will be approved to begin by or will proceed as contemplated by any projected timeline; that future clinical trial data will be favorable or that such trials will confirm any improvements over other products or lack negative impacts; that any drugs will receive required regulatory approvals (including Orphan Drug status) or that they will be commercially successful; or that the Company will be able to procure or earn sufficient working capital to complete the development, testing and launch of the Company’s prospective therapeutic products (including QN-247 and RAS-F). The Company’s stock price could be harmed if any of the events or trends contemplated by the forward-looking statements fails to occur or is delayed or if any actual future event otherwise differs from expectations. Additional information concerning these and other risk factors affecting the Company’s business can be found in the Company’s prior filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including its most recent Form 10-K, all of which are available at www.sec.gov. The Company disclaims any intent or obligation to update these forward-looking statements beyond the date of this video interview (November 1, 2021), except as required by law.
