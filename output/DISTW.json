Operating revenues increased 25.2% from the third quarter of 2023 due to higher average AUM and higher other revenues attributable to our European listed exchange-traded products (“ETPs”).\n  * Our average advisory fee was 0.37%, 0.37% and 0.36% during the third quarter of 2024, the second quarter of 2024 and the third quarter of 2023, respectively.\n\n\n\n**Operating Expenses**\n\n  * Operating expenses decreased 1.6% from the second quarter of 2024 primarily due to lower incentive compensation, partly offset by higher fund management and administration expenses.\n  * Operating expenses increased 13.6% from the third quarter of 2023 primarily due to higher professional fees, which is inclusive of the legal and other related expected to be covered by insurance described above, as well as higher fund management and administration costs, incentive compensation and marketing expenses.\n\n\n\n**Other Income/(Expenses)**\n\n  * Interest expense increased 21.4% and 45.2% from the second quarter of 2024 and third quarter of 2023, respectively, due to a higher level of debt outstanding, partly offset by a lower average interest rate. The increase from the third quarter of 2023 also is due to the recognition of imputed interest on our obligation payable to Gold Bullion Holdings (Jersey) Limited (“GBH”), a subsidiary of the World Gold Council, in connection with our repurchase in November 2023 of our Series C Non-Voting Convertible Preferred Stock.\n  * Interest income increased 24.8% and 126.9% from the second quarter of 2024 and the third quarter of 2023, respectively, due to a higher level of interest-earning assets.\n  * During the third quarter of 2024, we recognized a loss on extinguishment of convertible notes of $30.6 million arising from the repurchase of $104.2 million aggregate principal amount of our 2028 Notes.\n  * Other losses and gains, net was a loss of $3.1 million for the third quarter of 2024. This included a $4.0 million civil money penalty in connection with the SEC ESG Settlement. Also included are net gains of $0.8 million and $0.6 million on our financial instruments owned and our investments, respectively. Gains and losses also generally arise from the sale of gold and crypto earned from management fees paid by our physically-backed gold and crypto ETPs, foreign exchange fluctuations and other miscellaneous items.\n\n\n\n**Income Taxes**\n\n  * Our effective income tax rate for the third quarter of 2024 was 216.0%, resulting in income tax expense of $8.4 million. The effective tax rate differs from the federal statutory rate of 21.0% primarily due to non-deductible loss on extinguishment of convertible notes, a non-deductible civil money penalty of $4.0 million and non-deductible executive compensation. These items were partly offset by a lower tax rate on foreign earnings.\n\n\n  * Our adjusted effective income tax rate for the third quarter of 2024 was 23.9%(1).\n\n\n\n**NINE MONTH HIGHLIGHTS**\n\n  * Operating revenues increased 22.8% as compared to 2023 due to higher average AUM, higher other revenues attributable to our European listed ETPs and the recognition of $4.1 million of other revenue related to legal and other related expenses expected to be covered by insurance described above.\n  * Operating expenses increased 9.2% as compared to 2023 primarily due to higher incentive and stock-based compensation expense and increased headcount, fund management and administration costs, marketing expenses, sales and business development expenses, third-party distribution fees, as well as higher depreciation and amortization. Operating expenses during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, also includes $4.1 million of legal and other related expenses expected to be covered by insurance that were incurred in connection with the SEC ESG Settlement. These increases were partly offset by lower contractual gold payments.\n  * Significant items reported in other income/(expense) in 2024 include: a loss on extinguishment of convertible notes of $30.6 million arising from the repurchase of $104.2 million aggregate principal amount of our 2028 Notes; a civil money penalty of $4.0 million in connection with the SEC ESG Settlement; an increase in interest expense of 15.8% due to imputed interest on our obligation payable to GBH and higher level of debt outstanding, partly offset by a lower average interest rate; an increase in interest income of 61.1% due to an increase in our interest-earning assets; net gains on our financial instruments owned of $2.6 million; and losses on our investments of $0.6 million. Gains and losses also generally arise from the sale of gold earned on management fees paid by our physically-backed gold ETPs, foreign exchange fluctuations and other miscellaneous items.\n  * Our effective income tax rate for 2024 was 35.6%, resulting in an income tax expense of $21.8 million. Our tax rate differs from the federal statutory rate of 21.0% primarily due to non-deductible loss on extinguishment of convertible notes, a non-deductible civil money penalty of $4.0 million and non-deductible executive compensation. These items were partly offset by a lower tax rate on foreign earnings.\n\n\n\n**CONFERENCE CALL DIAL-IN AND WEBCAST DETAILS**\n\nWisdomTree will discuss its results and operational highlights during a live webcast on Friday, October 25, 2024 at 11:00 a.m. ET, which can be accessed using the following link: <https://event.choruscall.com/mediaframe/webcast.html?webcastid=kZrhyzrd>.\n\nParticipants also can dial in using the following numbers: (877) 407-9210 or (201) 689-8049.

Our management reviews these non-GAAP financial measurements when evaluating our financial performance and results of operations; therefore, we believe it is useful to provide information with respect to these non-GAAP measurements so as to share this perspective of management. Non-GAAP measurements do not have any standardized meaning, do not replace nor are superior to GAAP financial measurements and are unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. These non-GAAP financial measurements should be considered in the context with our GAAP results. The non-GAAP financial measurements contained in this press release include:\n\n**Adjusted Revenues, Operating Income, Operating Expenses, Income Before Income Taxes, Income Tax Expense, Net Income and Diluted Earnings per Share**\n\nWe disclose adjusted revenues, operating income, operating expenses, income before income taxes, income tax expense, net income and diluted earnings per share as non-GAAP financial measurements in order to report our results exclusive of items that are non-recurring or not core to our operating business. We believe presenting these non-GAAP financial measurements provides investors with a consistent way to analyze our performance. These non-GAAP financial measurements exclude the following:\n\n**_Legal and other related expenses expected to be covered by insurance:_ **We have incurred $4.1 million of legal and other related expenses in connection with the SEC ESG Settlement that are expected to be covered by insurance. GAAP requires that such covered expenses be reported gross in the income statement such that revenues are recorded to offset expenses incurred. We offset the revenues and related expenses when calculating our non-GAAP financial measurements as the gross presentation serves to overstate our revenues and expenses recognized in the ordinary course of business.\n\n**_Gains or losses on financial instruments owned:_** We account for our financial instruments owned as trading securities, which requires these instruments to be measured at fair value with gains and losses reported in net income. We exclude these items when calculating our non-GAAP financial measurements as the gains and losses introduce volatility in earnings and are not core to our operating business.\n\n**_Tax windfalls and shortfalls upon vesting of stock-based compensation awards:_** GAAP requires the recognition of tax windfalls and shortfalls within income tax expense. These items arise upon the vesting of stock-based compensation awards and the magnitude is directly correlated to the number of awards vesting/exercised as well as the difference between the price of our stock on the date the award was granted and the date the award vested or was exercised. We exclude these items when calculating our non-GAAP financial measurements as they introduce volatility in earnings and are not core to our operating business.\n\n**_Imputed interest on our payable to the Gold Bullion Holdings (Jersey) Limited (“GBH”):_** During the fourth quarter of 2023, we repurchased our Series C Non-Voting Convertible Preferred Stock, which was convertible into approximately 13.1 million shares of WisdomTree common stock, from GBH, a subsidiary of the World Gold Council, for aggregate cash consideration of approximately $84.4 million. Under the terms of the transaction, we paid GBH $40.0 million on the closing date, with the remainder of the purchase price payable in equal annual installments on the first, second and third anniversaries of the closing date, with no requirement to pay interest. Under US GAAP, the obligation is recorded at its present value utilizing a market rate of interest on the closing date of 7.0% and the corresponding discount is amortized as interest expense pursuant to the effective interest method of accounting over the life of the obligation. We exclude this item when calculating our non-GAAP financial measurements as recognition of interest expense is non-cash and contrary to the stated terms of our obligation.\n\n**_Other items:_** Losses on extinguishment of convertible notes, a civil money penalty in connection with the SEC ESG Settlement, gains and losses recognized on our investments, changes in deferred tax asset valuation allowance, expenses incurred in response to an activist campaign and impairments are excluded when calculating our non-GAAP financial measurements.\n\n**Adjusted Effective Income Tax Rate**\n\nWe disclose our adjusted effective income tax rate as a non-GAAP financial measurement in order to report our effective income tax rate exclusive of items that are non-recurring or not core to our operating business. We believe reporting our adjusted effective income tax rate provides investors with a consistent way to analyze our income taxes. Our adjusted effective income tax rate is calculated by dividing adjusted income tax expense by adjusted income before income taxes. See above for information regarding the items that are excluded.\n\n**Gross Margin and Gross Margin Percentage**\n\nWe disclose our gross margin and gross margin percentage as non-GAAP financial measurements because we believe they provide investors with a consistent way to analyze the amount we retain after paying third-party service providers to operate our ETPs. These measures also assist us in analyzing the profitability of our products. We define gross margin as total adjusted operating revenues less fund management and administration expenses. Gross margin percentage is calculated as gross margin divided by total adjusted operating revenues.\n\n**GAAP to NON-GAAP RECONCILIATION (CONSOLIDATED)****(in thousands)****(Unaudited)**\n\n**Three

our management’s beliefs and assumptions and on information currently available to our management. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in these forward-looking statements are reasonable, these statements relate to future events or our future financial performance, and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results, levels of activity, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as “may,” “will,” “should,” “expects,” “intends,” “plans,” “anticipates,” “believes,” “estimates,” “predicts,” “potential,” “continue” or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology. These statements are only predictions. You should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements because they involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors, which are, in some cases, beyond our control and could materially affect results. Factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from current expectations include, among other things, the risks described below. If one or more of these or other risks or uncertainties occur, or if our underlying assumptions prove to be incorrect, actual events or results may vary significantly from those implied or projected by the forward-looking statements. No forward-looking statement is a guarantee of future performance. You should read this press release completely and with the understanding that our actual future results may be materially different from any future results expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements.\n\nIn particular, forward-looking statements in this press release may include statements about:\n\n  * anticipated trends, conditions and investor sentiment in the global markets and ETPs;\n  * anticipated levels of inflows into and outflows out of our ETPs;\n  * our ability to deliver favorable rates of return to investors;\n  * competition in our business;\n  * whether we will experience future growth;\n  * our ability to develop new products and services and their potential for success;\n  * our ability to maintain current vendors or find new vendors to provide services to us at favorable costs;\n  * our ability to successfully implement our strategy relating to digital assets and blockchain-enabled financial services, including WisdomTree Prime® and WisdomTree Connect™, and achieve its objectives;\n  * our ability to successfully operate and expand our business in non-U.S. markets;\n  * the effect of laws and regulations that apply to our business; and\n  * actions of activist stockholders.\n\n\n\nOur business is subject to many risks and uncertainties, including without limitation:\n\n  * declining prices of securities, gold and other precious metals and other commodities and changes in interest rates and general market conditions can adversely affect our business by reducing the market value of the assets we manage or causing WisdomTree ETP investors to sell their fund shares and trigger redemptions;\n  * fluctuations in the amount and mix of our AUM, whether caused by disruptions in the financial markets or otherwise, including but not limited to events such as a pandemic or war, geopolitical conflicts, political events, acts of terrorism and other matters beyond our control, may negatively impact revenues and operating margins, and may impede our ability to refinance our debt upon maturity or increase the cost of borrowing upon a refinancing;\n  * competitive pressures could reduce revenues and profit margins;\n  * we derive a substantial portion of our revenues from a limited number of products, and, as a result, our operating results are particularly exposed to investor sentiment toward investing in the products’ strategies and our ability to maintain the AUM of these products, as well as the performance of these products and market-specific and political and economic risk;\n  * a significant portion of our AUM is held in products with exposure to U.S. and international developed markets, and we therefore have exposure to domestic and foreign market conditions and are subject to currency exchange rate risks;\n  * withdrawals or broad changes in investments in our ETPs by investors with significant positions may negatively impact revenues and operating margins;\n  * we face increased operational, regulatory, financial and other risks as a result of conducting our business internationally, and as we expand our digital assets product offerings and services beyond our existing ETP business;\n  * many of our ETPs have a limited track record, and poor investment performance could cause our revenues to decline;\n  * we depend on third parties to provide many critical services to operate our business and our ETPs. The failure of key vendors to adequately provide such services could materially affect our operating business and harm WisdomTree ETP investors; and\n  * actions of activist stockholders against us, which have been costly and may be disruptive and cause uncertainty about the strategic direction of our business.\n\n\n\nOther factors, such as general economic conditions, including currency exchange rate fluctuations, also may have an effect on the results of our operations. For a more complete description of the risks noted above and other risks that could cause our actual results to differ from our current expectations, see “Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, and in subsequent reports filed with or furnished to the SEC.\n\nThe forward-looking statements in this press release represent our views as of the date of this press release. We anticipate that subsequent events and developments may cause our views to change. However, while we may elect to update these forward-looking statements at some point in the future, we have no current intention of doing so except to the extent required by applicable law. Therefore, these forward-looking statements do not represent our views as of any date other than the date of this press release.\n\nCategory: Business Update\n\nView source version on businesswire.com: <https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20241025121692/en/>\n\n**Investor Relations** Jeremy Campbell +1.917.267.3859 jeremy.campbell@wisdomtree.com\n\n**Media Relations** Natasha Ramsammy +1.917.267.3798 nramsammy@wisdomtree.com / wisdomtree@fullyvested.com\n\nSource: WisdomTree, Inc.\n\nReleased October 25, 2024\n\n  * [ Email Alerts ](/news-events/email-alerts)\n  * [ Company Profile ](/company-information)\n  * [ Contacts ](/company-information/contacts)\n  * [ RSS News Feed ](https://ir.wisdomtree.com/news-events/press-releases/rss \"Opens in a new window\")\n\n\n"

Operating revenues increased 25.2% from the third quarter of 2023 due to higher average AUM and higher other revenues attributable to our European listed exchange-traded products (“ETPs”).\n  * Our average advisory fee was 0.37%, 0.37% and 0.36% during the third quarter of 2024, the second quarter of 2024 and the third quarter of 2023, respectively.\n\n\n\n**Operating Expenses**\n\n  * Operating expenses decreased 1.6% from the second quarter of 2024 primarily due to lower incentive compensation, partly offset by higher fund management and administration expenses.\n  * Operating expenses increased 13.6% from the third quarter of 2023 primarily due to higher professional fees, which is inclusive of the legal and other related expected to be covered by insurance described above, as well as higher fund management and administration costs, incentive compensation and marketing expenses.\n\n\n\n**Other Income/(Expenses)**\n\n  * Interest expense increased 21.4% and 45.2% from the second quarter of 2024 and third quarter of 2023, respectively, due to a higher level of debt outstanding, partly offset by a lower average interest rate. The increase from the third quarter of 2023 also is due to the recognition of imputed interest on our obligation payable to Gold Bullion Holdings (Jersey) Limited (“GBH”), a subsidiary of the World Gold Council, in connection with our repurchase in November 2023 of our Series C Non-Voting Convertible Preferred Stock.\n  * Interest income increased 24.8% and 126.9% from the second quarter of 2024 and the third quarter of 2023, respectively, due to a higher level of interest-earning assets.\n  * During the third quarter of 2024, we recognized a loss on extinguishment of convertible notes of $30.6 million arising from the repurchase of $104.2 million aggregate principal amount of our 2028 Notes.\n  * Other losses and gains, net was a loss of $3.1 million for the third quarter of 2024. This included a $4.0 million civil money penalty in connection with the SEC ESG Settlement. Also included are net gains of $0.8 million and $0.6 million on our financial instruments owned and our investments, respectively. Gains and losses also generally arise from the sale of gold and crypto earned from management fees paid by our physically-backed gold and crypto ETPs, foreign exchange fluctuations and other miscellaneous items.\n\n\n\n**Income Taxes**\n\n  * Our effective income tax rate for the third quarter of 2024 was 216.0%, resulting in income tax expense of $8.4 million. The effective tax rate differs from the federal statutory rate of 21.0% primarily due to non-deductible loss on extinguishment of convertible notes, a non-deductible civil money penalty of $4.0 million and non-deductible executive compensation. These items were partly offset by a lower tax rate on foreign earnings.\n\n\n  * Our adjusted effective income tax rate for the third quarter of 2024 was 23.9%(1).\n\n\n\n**NINE MONTH HIGHLIGHTS**\n\n  * Operating revenues increased 22.8% as compared to 2023 due to higher average AUM, higher other revenues attributable to our European listed ETPs and the recognition of $4.1 million of other revenue related to legal and other related expenses expected to be covered by insurance described above.\n  * Operating expenses increased 9.2% as compared to 2023 primarily due to higher incentive and stock-based compensation expense and increased headcount, fund management and administration costs, marketing expenses, sales and business development expenses, third-party distribution fees, as well as higher depreciation and amortization. Operating expenses during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, also includes $4.1 million of legal and other related expenses expected to be covered by insurance that were incurred in connection with the SEC ESG Settlement. These increases were partly offset by lower contractual gold payments.\n  * Significant items reported in other income/(expense) in 2024 include: a loss on extinguishment of convertible notes of $30.6 million arising from the repurchase of $104.2 million aggregate principal amount of our 2028 Notes; a civil money penalty of $4.0 million in connection with the SEC ESG Settlement; an increase in interest expense of 15.8% due to imputed interest on our obligation payable to GBH and higher level of debt outstanding, partly offset by a lower average interest rate; an increase in interest income of 61.1% due to an increase in our interest-earning assets; net gains on our financial instruments owned of $2.6 million; and losses on our investments of $0.6 million. Gains and losses also generally arise from the sale of gold earned on management fees paid by our physically-backed gold ETPs, foreign exchange fluctuations and other miscellaneous items.\n  * Our effective income tax rate for 2024 was 35.6%, resulting in an income tax expense of $21.8 million. Our tax rate differs from the federal statutory rate of 21.0% primarily due to non-deductible loss on extinguishment of convertible notes, a non-deductible civil money penalty of $4.0 million and non-deductible executive compensation. These items were partly offset by a lower tax rate on foreign earnings.\n\n\n\n**CONFERENCE CALL DIAL-IN AND WEBCAST DETAILS**\n\nWisdomTree will discuss its results and operational highlights during a live webcast on Friday, October 25, 2024 at 11:00 a.m. ET, which can be accessed using the following link: <https://event.choruscall.com/mediaframe/webcast.html?webcastid=kZrhyzrd>.\n\nParticipants also can dial in using the following numbers: (877) 407-9210 or (201) 689-8049.

Our management reviews these non-GAAP financial measurements when evaluating our financial performance and results of operations; therefore, we believe it is useful to provide information with respect to these non-GAAP measurements so as to share this perspective of management. Non-GAAP measurements do not have any standardized meaning, do not replace nor are superior to GAAP financial measurements and are unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. These non-GAAP financial measurements should be considered in the context with our GAAP results. The non-GAAP financial measurements contained in this press release include:\n\n**Adjusted Revenues, Operating Income, Operating Expenses, Income Before Income Taxes, Income Tax Expense, Net Income and Diluted Earnings per Share**\n\nWe disclose adjusted revenues, operating income, operating expenses, income before income taxes, income tax expense, net income and diluted earnings per share as non-GAAP financial measurements in order to report our results exclusive of items that are non-recurring or not core to our operating business. We believe presenting these non-GAAP financial measurements provides investors with a consistent way to analyze our performance. These non-GAAP financial measurements exclude the following:\n\n**_Legal and other related expenses expected to be covered by insurance:_ **We have incurred $4.1 million of legal and other related expenses in connection with the SEC ESG Settlement that are expected to be covered by insurance. GAAP requires that such covered expenses be reported gross in the income statement such that revenues are recorded to offset expenses incurred. We offset the revenues and related expenses when calculating our non-GAAP financial measurements as the gross presentation serves to overstate our revenues and expenses recognized in the ordinary course of business.\n\n**_Gains or losses on financial instruments owned:_** We account for our financial instruments owned as trading securities, which requires these instruments to be measured at fair value with gains and losses reported in net income. We exclude these items when calculating our non-GAAP financial measurements as the gains and losses introduce volatility in earnings and are not core to our operating business.\n\n**_Tax windfalls and shortfalls upon vesting of stock-based compensation awards:_** GAAP requires the recognition of tax windfalls and shortfalls within income tax expense. These items arise upon the vesting of stock-based compensation awards and the magnitude is directly correlated to the number of awards vesting/exercised as well as the difference between the price of our stock on the date the award was granted and the date the award vested or was exercised. We exclude these items when calculating our non-GAAP financial measurements as they introduce volatility in earnings and are not core to our operating business.\n\n**_Imputed interest on our payable to the Gold Bullion Holdings (Jersey) Limited (“GBH”):_** During the fourth quarter of 2023, we repurchased our Series C Non-Voting Convertible Preferred Stock, which was convertible into approximately 13.1 million shares of WisdomTree common stock, from GBH, a subsidiary of the World Gold Council, for aggregate cash consideration of approximately $84.4 million. Under the terms of the transaction, we paid GBH $40.0 million on the closing date, with the remainder of the purchase price payable in equal annual installments on the first, second and third anniversaries of the closing date, with no requirement to pay interest. Under US GAAP, the obligation is recorded at its present value utilizing a market rate of interest on the closing date of 7.0% and the corresponding discount is amortized as interest expense pursuant to the effective interest method of accounting over the life of the obligation. We exclude this item when calculating our non-GAAP financial measurements as recognition of interest expense is non-cash and contrary to the stated terms of our obligation.\n\n**_Other items:_** Losses on extinguishment of convertible notes, a civil money penalty in connection with the SEC ESG Settlement, gains and losses recognized on our investments, changes in deferred tax asset valuation allowance, expenses incurred in response to an activist campaign and impairments are excluded when calculating our non-GAAP financial measurements.\n\n**Adjusted Effective Income Tax Rate**\n\nWe disclose our adjusted effective income tax rate as a non-GAAP financial measurement in order to report our effective income tax rate exclusive of items that are non-recurring or not core to our operating business. We believe reporting our adjusted effective income tax rate provides investors with a consistent way to analyze our income taxes. Our adjusted effective income tax rate is calculated by dividing adjusted income tax expense by adjusted income before income taxes. See above for information regarding the items that are excluded.\n\n**Gross Margin and Gross Margin Percentage**\n\nWe disclose our gross margin and gross margin percentage as non-GAAP financial measurements because we believe they provide investors with a consistent way to analyze the amount we retain after paying third-party service providers to operate our ETPs. These measures also assist us in analyzing the profitability of our products. We define gross margin as total adjusted operating revenues less fund management and administration expenses. Gross margin percentage is calculated as gross margin divided by total adjusted operating revenues.\n\n**GAAP to NON-GAAP RECONCILIATION (CONSOLIDATED)****(in thousands)****(Unaudited)**\n\n**Three

our management’s beliefs and assumptions and on information currently available to our management. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in these forward-looking statements are reasonable, these statements relate to future events or our future financial performance, and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results, levels of activity, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as “may,” “will,” “should,” “expects,” “intends,” “plans,” “anticipates,” “believes,” “estimates,” “predicts,” “potential,” “continue” or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology. These statements are only predictions. You should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements because they involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors, which are, in some cases, beyond our control and could materially affect results. Factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from current expectations include, among other things, the risks described below. If one or more of these or other risks or uncertainties occur, or if our underlying assumptions prove to be incorrect, actual events or results may vary significantly from those implied or projected by the forward-looking statements. No forward-looking statement is a guarantee of future performance. You should read this press release completely and with the understanding that our actual future results may be materially different from any future results expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements.\n\nIn particular, forward-looking statements in this press release may include statements about:\n\n  * anticipated trends, conditions and investor sentiment in the global markets and ETPs;\n  * anticipated levels of inflows into and outflows out of our ETPs;\n  * our ability to deliver favorable rates of return to investors;\n  * competition in our business;\n  * whether we will experience future growth;\n  * our ability to develop new products and services and their potential for success;\n  * our ability to maintain current vendors or find new vendors to provide services to us at favorable costs;\n  * our ability to successfully implement our strategy relating to digital assets and blockchain-enabled financial services, including WisdomTree Prime® and WisdomTree Connect™, and achieve its objectives;\n  * our ability to successfully operate and expand our business in non-U.S. markets;\n  * the effect of laws and regulations that apply to our business; and\n  * actions of activist stockholders.\n\n\n\nOur business is subject to many risks and uncertainties, including without limitation:\n\n  * declining prices of securities, gold and other precious metals and other commodities and changes in interest rates and general market conditions can adversely affect our business by reducing the market value of the assets we manage or causing WisdomTree ETP investors to sell their fund shares and trigger redemptions;\n  * fluctuations in the amount and mix of our AUM, whether caused by disruptions in the financial markets or otherwise, including but not limited to events such as a pandemic or war, geopolitical conflicts, political events, acts of terrorism and other matters beyond our control, may negatively impact revenues and operating margins, and may impede our ability to refinance our debt upon maturity or increase the cost of borrowing upon a refinancing;\n  * competitive pressures could reduce revenues and profit margins;\n  * we derive a substantial portion of our revenues from a limited number of products, and, as a result, our operating results are particularly exposed to investor sentiment toward investing in the products’ strategies and our ability to maintain the AUM of these products, as well as the performance of these products and market-specific and political and economic risk;\n  * a significant portion of our AUM is held in products with exposure to U.S. and international developed markets, and we therefore have exposure to domestic and foreign market conditions and are subject to currency exchange rate risks;\n  * withdrawals or broad changes in investments in our ETPs by investors with significant positions may negatively impact revenues and operating margins;\n  * we face increased operational, regulatory, financial and other risks as a result of conducting our business internationally, and as we expand our digital assets product offerings and services beyond our existing ETP business;\n  * many of our ETPs have a limited track record, and poor investment performance could cause our revenues to decline;\n  * we depend on third parties to provide many critical services to operate our business and our ETPs. The failure of key vendors to adequately provide such services could materially affect our operating business and harm WisdomTree ETP investors; and\n  * actions of activist stockholders against us, which have been costly and may be disruptive and cause uncertainty about the strategic direction of our business.\n\n\n\nOther factors, such as general economic conditions, including currency exchange rate fluctuations, also may have an effect on the results of our operations. For a more complete description of the risks noted above and other risks that could cause our actual results to differ from our current expectations, see “Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, and in subsequent reports filed with or furnished to the SEC.\n\nThe forward-looking statements in this press release represent our views as of the date of this press release. We anticipate that subsequent events and developments may cause our views to change. However, while we may elect to update these forward-looking statements at some point in the future, we have no current intention of doing so except to the extent required by applicable law. Therefore, these forward-looking statements do not represent our views as of any date other than the date of this press release.\n\nCategory: Business Update\n\nView source version on businesswire.com: <https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20241025121692/en/>\n\n**Investor Relations** Jeremy Campbell +1.917.267.3859 jeremy.campbell@wisdomtree.com\n\n**Media Relations** Natasha Ramsammy +1.917.267.3798 nramsammy@wisdomtree.com / wisdomtree@fullyvested.com\n\nSource: WisdomTree, Inc.\n\nReleased October 25, 2024\n\n  * [ Email Alerts ](/news-events/email-alerts)\n  * [ Company Profile ](/company-information)\n  * [ Contacts ](/company-information/contacts)\n  * [ RSS News Feed ](https://ir.wisdomtree.com/news-events/press-releases/rss \"Opens in a new window\")\n\n\n"

regarding our results as determined by GAAP, we also disclose certain non-GAAP information which we believe provides useful and meaningful\ninformation. Our management reviews these non-GAAP financial measurements when evaluating our financial performance and results of operations; therefore, we believe it is useful to provide\ninformation with respect to these non-GAAP measurements so as to share this perspective of management. Non-GAAP measurements do not have any standardized meaning, do not replace nor are\nsuperior to GAAP financial measurements and are unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. These non-GAAP financial measurements should be considered in the\ncontext with our GAAP results. The non-GAAP financial measurements contained in this release include:\n• Adjusted revenues, operating income, operating expenses, income before income taxes, income tax expense, net income and diluted earnings per share. We disclose adjusted revenues, operating\nincome, operating expenses, income before income taxes, income tax expense, net income and diluted earnings per share as non-GAAP financial measurements in order to report our results\nexclusive of items that are non-recurring or not core to our operating business. We believe presenting these non-GAAP financialmeasurements provides investors with a consistent way to analyze\nour performance. These non-GAAP financial measurements exclude the following:\n• Legal and other related expenses covered by insurance:We have incurred $4.1 million of legal and other related expenses in connection with the SEC ESG Settlement that are covered by\ninsurance. GAAP requires that such covered expenses be reported gross in the income statement such that revenues are recorded to offset expenses incurred. We offset the revenues and\nrelated expenses when calculating our non-GAAP financial measurements as the gross presentation serves to overstate our revenuesand expenses recognized in the ordinary course of\nbusiness.\n• Gains or losses on financial instruments owned: We account for our financial instruments owned as trading securities which requires these instruments to be measured at fair value with\ngains and losses reported in net income. We exclude these items when calculating our non-GAAP financial measurements as the gains and losses introduce volatility in earnings and are not\ncore to our operating business.\n• Tax windfalls and shortfalls upon vesting of stock-based compensation awards: GAAP requires the recognition of tax windfalls and shortfalls within income tax expense. These items arise\nupon the vesting of stock-based compensation awards and the magnitude is directly correlated to the number of awards vesting/exercised as well as the difference between the price of\nour stock on the date the award was granted and the date the award vested or was exercised. We exclude these items when calculating our non-GAAP financial measurements as they\nintroduce volatility in earnings and are not core to our operating business.\n• Imputed interest on our payable to the Gold Bullion Holdings (Jersey) Limited (“GBH”):During the fourth quarter of 2023, we repurchased our Series C Non-Voting Convertible Preferred Stock\nwhich was convertible into approximately 13.1 million shares of WisdomTree common stock, from GBH, a subsidiary of the World Gold Council, for aggregate cash consideration of\napproximately $84.4 million. Under the terms of the transaction, we paid GBH $40.0 million on the closing date, with the remainder of the purchase price payable in equal annual\ninstallments on the first, second and third anniversaries of the closing date, with no requirement to pay interest. Under US GAAP, the obligation is recorded at its present value utilizing a\nmarket rate of interest on the closing date of 7.0% and the corresponding discount is amortized as interest expense pursuant to the effective interest method of accounting over the life of\nthe obligation. We exclude this item when calculating our non-GAAP financial measurements as recognition of interest expense is non-cash and contrary to the stated terms of our\nobligation.\n• Other items: Loss on extinguishment of convertible notes, a civil money penalty in connection with SEC ESG Settlement, gains and losses recognized on our investments, changes in\ndeferred tax asset valuation allowance, expenses incurred in response to an activist campaign and impairments, are excluded whencalculating our non-GAAP financial measurements.\n• Adjusted effective income tax rate. We disclose our adjusted effective income tax rate as a non-GAAP financial measurement inorder to report our effective income tax rate exclusive of items that\nare non-recurring or not core to our operating business. We believe reporting our adjusted effective income tax rate provides investors with a consistent way to analyze our income taxes. Our\nadjusted effective income tax rate is calculated by dividing adjusted income tax expense by adjusted income before income taxes. See above for information regarding the items that are excluded.\n• Gross margin and gross margin percentage. We disclose our gross margin and gross margin percentage as non-GAAP financial measurements because we believe they provide investors with a\nconsistent way to analyze the amount we retain after paying third-party service providers to operate our ETPs. These measures also assist us in analyzing the profitability of our products. We\ndefine gross margin as total adjusted operating revenues less fund management and administration expenses. Gross margin percentage is calculated as gross margin divided by total adjusted\noperating revenues.\nWisdomTree –Q3/24 Results 20\nNon-GAAP Reconciliation to GAAP Results\nThree Months Ended Three Months Ended\n($ in thousands) Sept. 30 June 30 Mar. 31 Dec. 31 Sept. 30 ($ in thousands) Sept. 30 June 30 Mar. 31 Dec. 31 Sept. 30\nUnaudited 2024 2024 2024 2023 2023 Unaudited 2024 2024 2024 2023 2023\nAdjusted net income and diluted earnings per share: Adjusted Total Operating Expenses\nNet (loss)/income, as reported $ (4,485) $ 21,759 $ 22,111 $ 19,077 $ 12,984\nTotal operating expenses $ 72,376 $ 73,523 $ 68,888 $ 64,809 $ 63,718\nAdd back: Loss on extinguishment of convertible notes, net of\n3 0,128 -
