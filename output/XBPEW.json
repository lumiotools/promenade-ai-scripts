Reports Third Quarter 2024 Results\n\nNovember 12, 2024\n\n[PDF Version](/node/7501/pdf)\n\n**Third Quarter Highlights**\n\n  * Revenue of $35.4 million, decrease of 5.6% year-over-year and increase of 5.5% sequentially\n  * Gross margin increased to 32.6%, a 800 bps increase year-over-year and 1,300 bps increase sequentially\n  * Operating profit of $2.5 million, an increase of $2.2 million year-over-year and $3.8 million sequentially\n  * Net loss of $2.8 million includes $0.7 million of FX losses, a decrease of $0.1 million year-over-year and $2.0 million sequentially\n  * Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations of $4.8 million, an increase of $2.6 million year-over-year and $3.6 million sequentially\n  * Announced plans to divest on-demand printing operation\n\n\n\nLONDON and SANTA MONICA, Calif., Nov. 12, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- XBP Europe Holdings, Inc. (“XBP Europe” or “the Company”) (NASDAQ: XBP), a pan-European integrator of bills, payments, and related solutions and services seeking to enable the digital transformation of its clients, announced today its financial results for the quarter ended September 30, 2024.\n\n“Our focus on expanding technology sales and cost structure optimization contributed to our performance in the quarter. Our backlog is rising, and we are ramping up prudently and as fast as we can. We expect these efforts to result in a continued top and bottom line improvement. We are additionally excited by opportunities available to us as a result of being selected for the UK government’s G-cloud 14 framework” said Andrej Jonovic, Chief Executive Officer of XBP Europe.\n\n  * **Revenue:** Total Revenue was $35.4 million, a decline of 5.6% year-over-year and an increase of 5.5% sequentially, primarily due to completion of projects, lower volumes, and client contract ends, offset by positive impact of new business, some of which is in early stage of ramp. \n    * **_Bills & Payments _**segment revenue was $24.6 million, a decline of 3.1% year-over-year, primarily attributable to lower postage revenue, lower volumes and client contract ends, offset by the positive impact of newly won business, some of which is in early stage of ramp.\n    * **_Technology_** segment revenue was $10.8 million, a decrease of 10.8% year-over-year, largely due to lower license sales offset by implementation and professional services revenue.\n  * **Operating Profit:** Operating Profit was $2.5 million, compared to $0.3 million in 3Q 2023. This was driven primarily by higher gross margins coupled with SG&A improvement. Our operating expenses include costs associated with accelerated migration to the cloud.\n  * **Net Loss:** Net loss was $2.8 million, compared with a net loss of $2.9 million in 3Q 2023. The year-over-year decrease was primarily driven by higher Operating Profit, offset by higher Income tax expense and interest expense.\n  * **Adjusted EBITDA****(****1)****:** Adjusted EBITDA from Continuing Operations was $4.8 million, an increase of $2.6 million or 116% compared to $2.2 million in 3Q 2023. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 13.7%, an increase of 770 basis points from 6.0% in 3Q 2023.\n  * **Capital Expenditures:** Capital expenditures were 2.0% of revenue compared to 0.7% of revenue in 3Q 2023, with the increase primarily due to higher investments for growth during the quarter versus a year ago.\n  * **Adequate Liquidity:** The Company’s cash and cash equivalents totaled $7.8 million as of September 30, 2024 and additional funding available under secured borrowing facilities including the €15 million factoring facility.\n\n\n\n**Other Highlights:**\n\n  * **Pending Divestiture:** During the third quarter of fiscal year 2024, the Company determined that its certain on-demand printing operation met the criteria to be classified as a discontinued operation, and, as a result, disposable group’s historical financial results are reflected in the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements as discontinued operations and are presented separately from continuing operations. On a YTD basis, this business had revenue of approximately $6.8 million and negative Adjusted EBITDA of approximately $3.3 million.\n\n\n\n**Segment Revenue and Profitability:**\n\n**Three months ended September 30, 2024**  \n---  \n**Bills & Payments** | **Technology** | **Total**  \nRevenue, net | $ |  24,555 | $ |  10,845 | $ |  35,400  \nCost of revenue | 19,402 | 4,446 | 23,848  \n**Segment Gross Profit** | **5,153** | **6,399** | **11,552**  \n**Three months ended September 30, 2023**  \n**Bills & Payments** | **Technology** | **Total**  \nRevenue, net | $ |  25,344 | $ |  12,152 | $ |  37,496  \nCost of revenue | 22,604 | 5,637 | 28,241  \n**Segment Gross Profit** | **2,740** | **6,515** | **9,255**  \n  \n**Below is the note referenced above:**\n\n_(1)__Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure. A reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA is attached to this release._\n\n**Supplemental Investor Presentation** An investor presentation relating to our third quarter 2024 performance is available at **[investors.xbpeurope.com](http://investors.xbpeurope.com)**. This information has also been furnished to the SEC in a current report on Form 8-K.\n\n**About Non-GAAP Financial Measures** This press release includes constant currency, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, each of which is a financial measure that is not prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). XBP Europe believes that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures will provide useful information to investors in assessing our financial performance, results of operations and liquidity and allows investors to better understand the trends in our business and to better understand and compare our results. XBP Europe’s board of directors and management use constant currency, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to assess XBP Europe’s financial performance, because it allows them to compare XBP Europe’s operating performance on a consistent basis across periods by removing the effects of XBP Europe’s capital structure (such as varying levels of debt and interest expense, as well as transaction costs resulting from the combination with CF Acquisition Corp. VIII. on November 29, 2023). Adjusted EBITDA also seeks to remove the effects of restructuring and related expenses and other similar non-routine items, some of which are outside the control of our management team. Restructuring expenses are primarily related to the implementation of strategic actions and initiatives related to right sizing of the business. All of these costs are variable and dependent upon the nature of the actions being implemented and can vary significantly driven by business needs. Accordingly, due to that significant variability, we exclude these charges since we do not believe they truly reflect our past, current or future operating performance. The constant currency presentation excludes the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. We calculate constant currency revenue on a constant currency basis by converting our current-period local currency revenue using the exchange rates from the corresponding prior-period and compare these adjusted amounts to our corresponding prior period reported results. XBP Europe does not consider these non-GAAP measures in isolation or as an alternative to liquidity or financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP. A limitation of these non-GAAP financial measures is that they exclude significant expenses and income that are required by GAAP to be recorded in XBP Europe’s financial statements. In addition, they are subject to inherent limitations as they reflect the exercise of judgments by management about which expenses and income are excluded or included in determining these non-GAAP financial measures and therefore the basis of presentation for these measures may not be comparable to similarly-titled measures used by other companies. These non-GAAP financial measures are not required to be uniformly applied, are not audited and should not be considered in isolation or as substitutes for results prepared in accordance with GAAP. Net loss is the GAAP measure most directly comparable to the non-GAAP measures presented here. For reconciliation of the comparable GAAP measures to these non-GAAP financial measures, see the schedules attached to this release.\n\n**Forward-Looking Statements** This press release contains certain “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), and Section 21E of the Exchange Act, including certain financial forecasts and projections.

These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as alternatives to operating or net income or cash flows from operating activities, in each case determined in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures are among the indicators used by management to measure the performance of the Company’s operations, and also among the criteria upon which performance-based compensation may be based. Adjusted EBITDA also is used by our lenders for debt covenant compliance purposes.\n\nSimilar non-GAAP financial measures may be calculated differently by other companies, including other companies in our industry, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures. Because of these limitations, you should consider the non-GAAP financial measures alongside other performance measures and liquidity measures, including operating income, various cash flow metrics, net income and our other GAAP results.\n\n(7) Adjustment represents costs associated with restructuring related to employee severance.\n\nSource: XBP Europe Holdings, Inc.\n\n![](https://www.globenewswire.com/newsroom/ti?nf=MTAwMTAxMjg4MSM0MDE5ODU5MzIjMjI2MDc4Mg==)![](https://ml-eu.globenewswire.com/media/YjA2ZDI0NTktMDg4Mi00YzgxLWFhZWYtMjdhYWM3OGUwYjJmLTEyNzIzMzI=/tiny/Exela-Technologies-Limited.png)\n\n[![Primary Logo](https://ml-eu.globenewswire.com/media/8ab78c65-c522-42b6-bd1d-916f5c708913/small/xbp-png.png)](https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/8ab78c65-c522-42b6-bd1d-916f5c708913)\n\nSource: XBP Europe\n\nSearch Investors\n\nSearch this site\n\nSubmit\n"
