(“P3” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: PIII), a patient-centered and physician-led population health management company, today announced its financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024. \n\n“As we execute on our strategic initiatives, we believe P3 will be well-positioned to unlock the value built within our platform and generate sustainable, profitable growth in the medium and long term,” said Aric Coffman, CEO of P3. “We have identified more than $130 million of potential improvement opportunities, and while near-term dynamics have negatively affected our financial results, demand for our platform has never been stronger as we continue to deliver value to patients, payors and our PCP partners. Our business model is fundamentally strong, as shown by our member and top-line growth, quality outcomes, and provider retention.” \n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results**\n\n  * Total revenue was $362.1 million, an increase of 26% compared to $288.4 million in the third quarter of the prior year \n  * Capitated revenue was $357.7 million, an increase of 25% compared to $285.2 million in the third quarter of the prior year \n  * Gross profit was a loss of $39.8 million, as compared to gross profit of $9.1 million in the prior year. Gross profit PMPM was a loss of $103, compared to $29 PMPM in the prior year \n  * Medical margin(1) was $0.5 million compared to $36.2 million in the prior year. Medical margin PMPM(1) was $1, compared to a medical margin PMPM of $115 in the prior year \n  * Net loss was $102.9 million compared to a net loss of $37.3 million in the third quarter of the prior year. Net loss PMPM was $267 compared to a net loss PMPM of $119 in the prior year \n  * Adjusted EBITDA loss(1) was $71.0 million compared to $22.3 million in the third quarter of the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA loss PMPM(1) was $184, compared to Adjusted EBITDA loss PMPM of $71 in the third quarter of the prior year \n  * In light of a lower-than-expected 2024 risk adjustment, continued elevated medical cost pressures, and retroactive adjustments, the Company is withdrawing its previous guidance for fiscal year ending December 31, 2024, provided on its second quarter 2024 earnings call on August 7, 2024, and investors should no longer rely on it. \n\n(1) Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA per member, per month (“PMPM”), medical margin, and medical margin PMPM are non-GAAP financial measures.

EBITDA is defined as GAAP net income (loss) before (i) interest, (ii) income taxes and (iii) depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA, further adjusted to exclude the effect of certain supplemental adjustments, such as (i) mark-to-market warrant gain/loss, (ii) premium deficiency reserves, (iii) equity-based compensation expense, (iv) certain transaction and other related costs and (v) certain other items that we believe are not indicative of our core operating performances. Adjusted EBITDA PMPM is defined as Adjusted EBITDA divided by the number of at-risk Medicare members each month divided by the number of months in the period. We believe these non‐GAAP financial measures provide an additional tool for investors to use in evaluating ongoing operating results and trends and in comparing our financial measures with other similar companies. Medical margin represents the amount earned from capitation revenue after medical claims expenses are deducted and medical margin PMPM is defined as medical margin divided by the number of Medicare members each month divided by the number of months in the period. \n\nMedical claims expenses represent costs incurred for medical services provided to our members. As our platform grows and matures over time, we expect medical margin to increase in absolute dollars; however, medical margin PMPM may vary as the percentage of new members brought onto our platform fluctuates. New membership added to the platform is typically dilutive to medical margin PMPM. We do not consider these non‐GAAP measures in isolation or as an alternative to financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures are subject to inherent limitations as they reflect the exercise of judgments by management about which expense and income are excluded or included in determining these non‐GAAP financial measures. In addition, other companies may calculate non-GAAP financial measures differently or may use other measures to evaluate their performance, all of which could reduce the usefulness of our non-GAAP financial measures as tools for comparison. The tables at the end of this press release present a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income (loss) and Adjusted EBITDA PMPM to net income (loss) PMPM, medical margin to gross profit, and medical margin PMPM to gross profit PMPM, which are the most directly comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. \n\n**Key Performance Metrics**\n\nIn addition to our GAAP and non-GAAP financial information, the Company also monitors “at-risk members” to help us evaluate our business, identify trends affecting our business, formulate business plans and make strategic decisions.

(“P3” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: PIII), a patient-centered and physician-led population health management company, today announced its financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024. \n\n“As we execute on our strategic initiatives, we believe P3 will be well-positioned to unlock the value built within our platform and generate sustainable, profitable growth in the medium and long term,” said Aric Coffman, CEO of P3. “We have identified more than $130 million of potential improvement opportunities, and while near-term dynamics have negatively affected our financial results, demand for our platform has never been stronger as we continue to deliver value to patients, payors and our PCP partners. Our business model is fundamentally strong, as shown by our member and top-line growth, quality outcomes, and provider retention.” \n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results**\n\n  * Total revenue was $362.1 million, an increase of 26% compared to $288.4 million in the third quarter of the prior year \n  * Capitated revenue was $357.7 million, an increase of 25% compared to $285.2 million in the third quarter of the prior year \n  * Gross profit was a loss of $39.8 million, as compared to gross profit of $9.1 million in the prior year. Gross profit PMPM was a loss of $103, compared to $29 PMPM in the prior year \n  * Medical margin(1) was $0.5 million compared to $36.2 million in the prior year. Medical margin PMPM(1) was $1, compared to a medical margin PMPM of $115 in the prior year \n  * Net loss was $102.9 million compared to a net loss of $37.3 million in the third quarter of the prior year. Net loss PMPM was $267 compared to a net loss PMPM of $119 in the prior year \n  * Adjusted EBITDA loss(1) was $71.0 million compared to $22.3 million in the third quarter of the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA loss PMPM(1) was $184, compared to Adjusted EBITDA loss PMPM of $71 in the third quarter of the prior year \n  * In light of a lower-than-expected 2024 risk adjustment, continued elevated medical cost pressures, and retroactive adjustments, the Company is withdrawing its previous guidance for fiscal year ending December 31, 2024, provided on its second quarter 2024 earnings call on August 7, 2024, and investors should no longer rely on it. \n\n(1) Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA per member, per month (“PMPM”), medical margin, and medical margin PMPM are non-GAAP financial measures.

EBITDA is defined as GAAP net income (loss) before (i) interest, (ii) income taxes and (iii) depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA, further adjusted to exclude the effect of certain supplemental adjustments, such as (i) mark-to-market warrant gain/loss, (ii) premium deficiency reserves, (iii) equity-based compensation expense, (iv) certain transaction and other related costs and (v) certain other items that we believe are not indicative of our core operating performances. Adjusted EBITDA PMPM is defined as Adjusted EBITDA divided by the number of at-risk Medicare members each month divided by the number of months in the period. We believe these non‐GAAP financial measures provide an additional tool for investors to use in evaluating ongoing operating results and trends and in comparing our financial measures with other similar companies. Medical margin represents the amount earned from capitation revenue after medical claims expenses are deducted and medical margin PMPM is defined as medical margin divided by the number of Medicare members each month divided by the number of months in the period. \n\nMedical claims expenses represent costs incurred for medical services provided to our members. As our platform grows and matures over time, we expect medical margin to increase in absolute dollars; however, medical margin PMPM may vary as the percentage of new members brought onto our platform fluctuates. New membership added to the platform is typically dilutive to medical margin PMPM. We do not consider these non‐GAAP measures in isolation or as an alternative to financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures are subject to inherent limitations as they reflect the exercise of judgments by management about which expense and income are excluded or included in determining these non‐GAAP financial measures. In addition, other companies may calculate non-GAAP financial measures differently or may use other measures to evaluate their performance, all of which could reduce the usefulness of our non-GAAP financial measures as tools for comparison. The tables at the end of this press release present a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income (loss) and Adjusted EBITDA PMPM to net income (loss) PMPM, medical margin to gross profit, and medical margin PMPM to gross profit PMPM, which are the most directly comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. \n\n**Key Performance Metrics**\n\nIn addition to our GAAP and non-GAAP financial information, the Company also monitors “at-risk members” to help us evaluate our business, identify trends affecting our business, formulate business plans and make strategic decisions. At-risk membership represents the approximate number of Medicare members for whom we receive a fixed percentage of premium under capitation arrangements as of the end of a particular period. \n\n**Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements**\n\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. We intend such forward-looking statements to be covered by the safe harbor provisions for forward-looking statements contained in Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Words such as \"anticipate,\" \"believe,\" \"budget,\" \"contemplate,\" \"continue,\" \"could,\" \"envision,\" \"estimate,\" \"expect,\" \"guidance,\" \"indicate,\" \"intend,\" \"may,\" \"might,\" \"plan,\" \"possibly,\" \"potential,\" \"predict,\" \"probably,\" \"pro-forma,\" \"project,\" \"seek,\" \"should,\" \"target,\" or \"will,\" or the negative or other variations thereof, and similar words or phrases or comparable terminology, are intended to identify forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements address various matters, including the Company’s future expected growth strategy and operating performance; and the Company’s ability to execute on its identified strategic improvement opportunities, all of which reflect the Company’s expectations based upon currently available information and data.

As a result, the language and amounts below refer only to VIEs held at the P3 LLC level. The condensed consolidated balance sheets include total assets that can be used only to settle obligations of P3 LLC’s consolidated VIEs totaling $13.0 million and $8.6 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, and total liabilities of P3 LLC’s consolidated VIEs for which creditors do not have recourse to the general credit of the Company totaled $15.8 million and $13.6 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. These VIE assets and liabilities do not include $46.9 million and $44.2 million of net amounts due to affiliates as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, as these are eliminated in consolidation and not presented within the condensed consolidated balance sheets.   \n**P3 HEALTH PARTNERS INC. and SUBSIDIARIES** **CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS** **_(in

(“P3” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: PIII), a patient-centered and physician-led population health management company, today announced its financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024. \n\n“As we execute on our strategic initiatives, we believe P3 will be well-positioned to unlock the value built within our platform and generate sustainable, profitable growth in the medium and long term,” said Aric Coffman, CEO of P3. “We have identified more than $130 million of potential improvement opportunities, and while near-term dynamics have negatively affected our financial results, demand for our platform has never been stronger as we continue to deliver value to patients, payors and our PCP partners. Our business model is fundamentally strong, as shown by our member and top-line growth, quality outcomes, and provider retention.” \n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results**\n\n  * Total revenue was $362.1 million, an increase of 26% compared to $288.4 million in the third quarter of the prior year \n  * Capitated revenue was $357.7 million, an increase of 25% compared to $285.2 million in the third quarter of the prior year \n  * Gross profit was a loss of $39.8 million, as compared to gross profit of $9.1 million in the prior year. Gross profit PMPM was a loss of $103, compared to $29 PMPM in the prior year \n  * Medical margin(1) was $0.5 million compared to $36.2 million in the prior year. Medical margin PMPM(1) was $1, compared to a medical margin PMPM of $115 in the prior year \n  * Net loss was $102.9 million compared to a net loss of $37.3 million in the third quarter of the prior year. Net loss PMPM was $267 compared to a net loss PMPM of $119 in the prior year \n  * Adjusted EBITDA loss(1) was $71.0 million compared to $22.3 million in the third quarter of the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA loss PMPM(1) was $184, compared to Adjusted EBITDA loss PMPM of $71 in the third quarter of the prior year \n  * In light of a lower-than-expected 2024 risk adjustment, continued elevated medical cost pressures, and retroactive adjustments, the Company is withdrawing its previous guidance for fiscal year ending December 31, 2024, provided on its second quarter 2024 earnings call on August 7, 2024, and investors should no longer rely on it. \n\n(1) Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA per member, per month (“PMPM”), medical margin, and medical margin PMPM are non-GAAP financial measures. For reconciliations of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, if applicable, and more information regarding the Company’s use of non-GAAP financial measures, please see the section titled “Non-GAAP Financial Measures.”   \n---  \n(2) See “Key Performance Metrics” for additional information on how the Company defines “at-risk members.”   \n  \n**Management to Host Conference Call and Webcast on November 12, 2024 at 4:30 PM ET**\n\nTitle & Webcast  |  [P3 Health Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call](https://protect.checkpoint.com/v2/___https:/event.choruscall.com/mediaframe/webcast.html?webcastid=00NmOrB0___.YzJ1OmdpbG1hcnRpbmdyb3VwOmM6bzo2YzlkNDY4MTY0ZWNhN2MyNmViMmU5ZjI1ZWFjNjViMzo2OjAwNWM6OTUyYTI3ZmY5NGIwZGI1NzljOTM3YzFjOWRjYmVkYjg2YmU5YjljMWM2NDE4YzcwMDcxZjQ2ZTg3MTc1M2RlMDpwOlQ6Rg)  \n---|---  \nDate & Time  |  November 12, 2024, 4:30pm Eastern Time   \nConference Call Details  |  Toll-Free 1-833-316-0546 (US) International 1-412-317-0692 Ask to be joined into the P3 Health Partners call   \nThe conference call will also be webcast live in the \"Events & Presentations\" section of the Investor page of the P3 website ([ir.p3hp.org](https://protect.checkpoint.com/v2/___https:/nam12.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Furldefense.proofpoint.com%2Fv2%2Furl%3Fu%3Dhttps-3A__ir.p3hp.org_%26d%3DDwMGaQ%26c%3DeuGZstcaTDllvimEN8b7jXrwqOf-v5A_CdpgnVfiiMM%26r%3DR0AWpg-KEPUK4-7pHChNIDjaaZFnASiMeDluBqSipp4%26m%3D4_5hAQNQkkUsyyFMBvP-RK4anM81Rrhs-c6ToD08dxJnv11FzkajhfCH26tG3kY7%26s%3DNs-kOcMtc3qp4tTS7KdXQX_VUIjVZVxWZX1fe4r9Y_s%26e%3D&data=05%7C02%7Catul.kavthekar%40p3hp.org%7C97c309c08fb94f0c42ff08dc43a425d2%7Cae1b4de6abef4bff89469bec791532d7%7C0%7C0%7C638459619528655341%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=689Zn%2BYEQ8qlLKVeBCwC8DGJa6rdfVcI8tmBwLbVD6c%3D&reserved=0___.YzJ1OmdpbG1hcnRpbmdyb3VwOmM6bzo2YzlkNDY4MTY0ZWNhN2MyNmViMmU5ZjI1ZWFjNjViMzo2OmYzZjE6Y2QyOTlmZGU3ZDU1Y2ViODMyMTQwZDRkN2YwM2M3N2FkMDNmNmVhYWY3ODNhZDU4Njc5Y2ZlNTNiMTgxYTlmYTpwOlQ6Rg)).

EBITDA is defined as GAAP net income (loss) before (i) interest, (ii) income taxes and (iii) depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA, further adjusted to exclude the effect of certain supplemental adjustments, such as (i) mark-to-market warrant gain/loss, (ii) premium deficiency reserves, (iii) equity-based compensation expense, (iv) certain transaction and other related costs and (v) certain other items that we believe are not indicative of our core operating performances. Adjusted EBITDA PMPM is defined as Adjusted EBITDA divided by the number of at-risk Medicare members each month divided by the number of months in the period. We believe these non‐GAAP financial measures provide an additional tool for investors to use in evaluating ongoing operating results and trends and in comparing our financial measures with other similar companies. Medical margin represents the amount earned from capitation revenue after medical claims expenses are deducted and medical margin PMPM is defined as medical margin divided by the number of Medicare members each month divided by the number of months in the period. \n\nMedical claims expenses represent costs incurred for medical services provided to our members. As our platform grows and matures over time, we expect medical margin to increase in absolute dollars; however, medical margin PMPM may vary as the percentage of new members brought onto our platform fluctuates. New membership added to the platform is typically dilutive to medical margin PMPM. We do not consider these non‐GAAP measures in isolation or as an alternative to financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures are subject to inherent limitations as they reflect the exercise of judgments by management about which expense and income are excluded or included in determining these non‐GAAP financial measures. In addition, other companies may calculate non-GAAP financial measures differently or may use other measures to evaluate their performance, all of which could reduce the usefulness of our non-GAAP financial measures as tools for comparison. The tables at the end of this press release present a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income (loss) and Adjusted EBITDA PMPM to net income (loss) PMPM, medical margin to gross profit, and medical margin PMPM to gross profit PMPM, which are the most directly comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. \n\n**Key Performance Metrics**\n\nIn addition to our GAAP and non-GAAP financial information, the Company also monitors “at-risk members” to help us evaluate our business, identify trends affecting our business, formulate business plans and make strategic decisions. At-risk membership represents the approximate number of Medicare members for whom we receive a fixed percentage of premium under capitation arrangements as of the end of a particular period. \n\n**Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements**\n\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. We intend such forward-looking statements to be covered by the safe harbor provisions for forward-looking statements contained in Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

Exhibits 45\nSIGNATURES\nTable of Contents\nCAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nIn addition to historical information, this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended September 30, 2024 (the “Form 10-Q”) contains “forward-\nlooking statements” within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. We intend such forward-looking statements\nto be covered by the safe harbor provisions for forward-looking statements contained in Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), and\nSection 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). All statements other than statements of historical facts contained in this Form 10-Q,\nincluding statements regarding our future results of operations and financial position, business and growth strategy, prospective products, research and development costs, future\nrevenue, market opportunity, timing and likelihood of success, plans and objectives of management for future operations, our ability to raise additional capital and continue as a\ngoing concern, the anticipated closing of the asset sale discussed herein, future results of anticipated products and prospects, and our ability to regain compliance with the\nNasdaq listing rules, are forward-looking statements. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terms such as “may,” “will,” “should,” “expect,” “plan,”\n“anticipate,” “could,” “intend,” “target,” “project,” “contemplate,” “believe,” “estimate,” “predict,” “potential,” “would” or “continue” or the negative of these terms or other\nsimilar expressions, although not all forward-looking statements contain these words.\nThe forward-looking statements in this Form 10-Q are only predictions and are based largely on our current expectations and projections about future events and\nfinancial trends that we believe may affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this Form\n10-Q and are subject to a number of known and unknown risks, uncertainties and assumptions, and other important factors that may cause our actual results, performance or\nachievements to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements, including, without\nlimitation, the following:\n• Our ability to continue as a going concern.\n• Our need to raise additional capital to fund our existing operations or develop and commercialize new services or expand our operations.\n• We have a history of net losses. We expect to continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future and we may never achieve or maintain profitability.\n• We may not be able to maintain compliance with our debt covenants in the future, which could result in an event of default.\n• Our relatively limited operating history makes it difficult to evaluate our future prospects and the risks and challenges we may encounter.\n• A significant portion of our assets consists of other intangible assets, the value of which may be reduced if we determine that those assets are impaired.\n• We rely on our management team and key employees and our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations could be harmed if we are\nunable to retain qualified personnel.\n• Our growth depends in part on our ability to identify and develop successful new geographies, physician partners, payors and patients. If we are not able to\nsuccessfully execute upon our growth strategies, there may be material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\n• If growth in the number of patients and physician partners on our platform decreases, or the number of services that we are able to provide to physician partners\nand members decreases, due to legal, economic or business developments, our business, financial condition and results of operations will be harmed.\n• We primarily depend on reimbursement by third-party payors, as well as payments by individuals, which could lead to delays, uncertainties and disagreements\nregarding the timing and process of reimbursement, including any changes or reductions in Medicare reimbursement rates or rules.\nP3 Health Partners Inc. | Q3 2024 Form 10-Q | 1\nTable of Contents\n• The termination or non-renewal of the Medicare Advantage (“MA”) contracts held by the health plans with which we contract, or the termination or nonrenewal\nof our contracts with those plans, could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and our operations.\n• We are dependent on our affiliated professional entities and other physician partners and other providers to effectively manage the quality and cost of care and\nperform obligations under payor contracts.\n• Reductions in the quality ratings of the health plans we serve could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and\ncash flows.\n• Developments affecting spending by the healthcare industry could adversely affect our business.\n• Our business and operations would suffer in the event of information technology system failures, security breaches, cyberattacks or other deficiencies in\ncybersecurity.\n• Actual or perceived failures to comply with applicable data protection, privacy and security laws, regulations, standards and other requirements could adversely\naffect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n• We conduct business in a heavily regulated industry and if we fail to adhere to all of the complex government laws and regulations that apply to our business,\nwe could incur fines or penalties or be required to make changes to our operations or experience adverse publicity, any or all of which could have a material\nadverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows, and reputation.\n• If our arrangements with our affiliated professional entities and other physician partners are found to constitute the improper rendering of medical services or\nfee splitting under applicable state laws, our business, financial condition and our ability to operate in those states could be adversely impacted.\n• We face inspections, reviews, audits and investigations under federal and state government programs and contracts. These audits could have adverse findings\nthat may negatively affect our business, including our results of operations, liquidity, financial condition and reputation.\n• The impact on us of recent healthcare legislation and other changes in the healthcare industry and in healthcare spending is currently unknown, but may\nadversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n• Our only significant asset is the ownership of a minority of the economic interest in P3 LLC, and such ownership may not be sufficient to generate the funds\nnecessary to meet our financial obligations or to pay any dividends on our Class A common stock.\n• We will be required to make payments under the TRA (defined herein) for certain tax benefits we may claim, and the amounts of such payments could be\nsignificant.\n• Foresight Sponsor Group, LLC and the Chicago Pacific Founders funds, and their respective affiliates and representatives, non-employee directors and other\nnon-employee stockholders are not limited in their ability to compete with us, and the corporate opportunity provisions in our certificate of incorporation could\nenable such persons to benefit from corporate opportunities that might otherwise be available to us, which presents potential conflicts of interest.\n• The impact of the material weaknesses we have identified in our internal control over financial reporting and our ability to establish and maintain effective\ninternal controls in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.\n• Our ability to maintain the listing of our securities on The Nasdaq Stock Market, LLC.\n• The factors described under Part I, Item 1A. “Risk Factors” and Part II, Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of\nOperations” in our Annual Report on\nP3 Health Partners Inc. | Q3 2024 Form 10-Q | 2\nTable of Contents\nForm 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on March 28, 2024 (the “2023 Form 10-\nK”), in Part II, Item 1A. “Risk Factors” and Part I, Item 2. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations” in this\nForm 10-Q and in our subsequent filings with the SEC.\nBecause forward-looking statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties, some of which cannot be predicted or quantified and some of which are beyond\nour control, you should not rely on these forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. The events and circumstances reflected in our forward-looking statements\nmay not be achieved or occur and actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements.

(“P3”) is a patient-centered and physician-led population health management company and, for accounting purposes, the successor to P3\nHealth Group Holdings, LLC and its subsidiaries (collectively, “P3 LLC,” and together with P3, the “Company”) after the consummation of a series of business combinations in\nDecember 2021 with Foresight Acquisition Corp. (the “Business Combinations”). As the sole manager of P3 LLC, P3 operates and controls all of the business and affairs of P3\nLLC and P3’s only assets are equity interests in P3 LLC.\nP3 LLC was founded on April 12, 2017 and began commercial operations on April 20, 2017 to provide population health management services on an at-risk basis to\ninsurance plans offering medical coverage to Medicare beneficiaries under Medicare Advantage programs. Medicare Advantage (“MA”) programs are insurance products\ncreated solely for Medicare beneficiaries. Insurance plans contract directly with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”) to offer Medicare beneficiaries\nbenefits that replace traditional Medicare fee-for-service (“FFS”) coverage.\nThe Company’s contracts with health plans are based on an at-risk shared savings model. Under this model, the Company is financially responsible for the cost of all\ncontractually-covered services provided to members assigned to the Company by health plans in exchange for a fixed monthly “capitation” payment, which is generally a\npercentage of the payment health plans receive from CMS. Under this arrangement, Medicare beneficiaries generally receive all their healthcare coverage through the\nCompany’s network of employed and affiliated physicians and specialists.\nThe services provided to health plans’ members vary by contract. These may include utilization management, care management, disease education, and maintenance of\na quality improvement and quality management program for members assigned to the Company. The Company is also responsible for the credentialing of its providers,\nprocessing and payment of claims, and the establishment of a provider network for certain health plans.\nIn addition to the Company’s contracts with health plans, the Company provides primary healthcare services through its employed physician clinic locations. These\nprimary care clinics are reimbursed for services provided under FFS contracts with various payers and through capitated – per member, per month (“PMPM”) arrangements.\nNote 2: Going Concern and Liquidity\nThe accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern. The Company\nhas experienced losses since its inception and had net losses of $102.9 million and $37.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and\n$181.2 million and $117.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Such losses were primarily the result of costs incurred in adding new\nmembers and adverse claims experience, partly driven by general market conditions for MA plans. The Company anticipates operating losses and negative cash flows to\ncontinue for the foreseeable future as it continues to grow membership.\nAs of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had $63.0 million and $36.3 million, respectively, in unrestricted cash and cash equivalents available\nto fund future operations. The Company’s capital requirements will depend on many factors, including the pace of the Company’s growth, ability to manage medical costs, the\nmaturity of its members, its ability to complete the sale of its Florida operations, and its ability to raise capital. The Company continues to explore raising additional capital\nthrough a combination of debt financing and equity issuances and sales of assets. When the Company pursues additional debt and/or equity financing, there can be no assurance\nthat such financing will be available on terms commercially acceptable to the Company or at all. If the Company is unable to obtain additional funding when needed, it will need\nto curtail planned activities in order to reduce costs, which will likely have an unfavorable effect on the Company’s ability to execute on its business plan, and have an adverse\neffect on its business, results of operations, and future prospects. As a result of these matters, substantial doubt exists about the Company’s ability to continue as a going\nconcern within one year after the date the financial statements are issued. The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any\nadjustments that might result from the outcome of these uncertainties.\nP3 Health Partners Inc. | Q3 2024 Form 10-Q | 10\nTable of Contents\nNote 3: Significant Accounting Policies\nBasis of Presentation\nThe accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the\nUnited States (“GAAP”) for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”)\nRegulation S-X. The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company’s audited consolidated financial statements\nincluded in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements\nprepared in accordance with GAAP have been condensed or omitted pursuant to SEC rules and regulations dealing with interim financial statements.\nManagement believes the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments of a normal recurring nature necessary for a fair\npresentation of periods presented. The consolidated operating results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 are not necessarily indicative of the results that\nmay be expected for the year ending December 31, 2024, or for any other future annual or interim period.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and all significant intercompany transactions and\nbalances have been eliminated.\nThe Company periodically evaluates entities for consolidation either through ownership of a majority voting interest, or through means other than voting interest, in\naccordance with the Variable Interest Entity (“VIE”) accounting model. This evaluation includes a qualitative review of the design of the entity, its organizational structure,\nincluding decision making ability and financial agreements, as well as a quantitative review. The Company consolidates a VIE when it has a variable interest that provides it\nwith a controlling financial interest in the VIE, referred to as the primary beneficiary of the VIE.\nAs the sole managing member of P3 LLC, P3 has the right to direct the most significant activities of P3 LLC and the obligation to absorb losses and receive benefits.\nThe rights of the non-managing members of P3 LLC are limited and protective in nature and do not give substantive participation rights over the sole managing member.\nAccordingly, P3 identifies itself as the primary beneficiary of P3 LLC and began consolidating P3 LLC as of December 3, 2021, the closing date of the Business Combinations\n(the “Closing Date”), resulting in a non-controlling interest related to the common units of P3 LLC (“Common Units”) held by members other than P3. Additionally, as more\nfully described in Note 13 “Variable Interest Entities,” P3 LLC is the primary beneficiary of the following physician practices (collectively, the “Network VIEs”):\n• Kahan, Wakefield, Abdou, PLLC\n• Bacchus, Wakefield, Kahan, PC\n• P3 Health Partners Professional Services, P.C.\n• P3 Medical Group, P.C.\n• P3 Health Partners California, P.C. (f/k/a Omni IPA Medical Group, Inc.)\nComprehensive Loss\nComprehensive loss includes net loss to common stockholders as well as other changes in equity that result from transactions and economic events other than those\nwith stockholders. There was no difference between comprehensive loss and net loss to common stockholders for the periods presented.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions\nthat could affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the\nreported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its estimates, including, but not limited to, those related to\nallowance for credit losses, revenue recognition, the liability for unpaid claims, equity-based compensation, premium deficiency reserves (“PDR”), fair value and impairment\nrecognition of long-lived assets\nP3 Health Partners Inc. | Q3 2024 Form 10-Q | 11\nTable of Contents\n(including intangibles), fair value of liability classified instruments, and judgments related to deferred income taxes.

The ASU aims to distinguish between authoritative and nonauthoritative\nliterature and to address unintended applications of guidance. The Company adopted ASU 2024-02 effective January 1, 2024. The guidance will be applied prospectively to all\nnew transactions recognized on or after January 1, 2024.\nASU 2020-06, Debt – Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging — Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40),\nAccounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity’s Own Equity (“ASU 2020-06”)\nASU 2020-06 eliminates two of the three models in ASC 470-20 that require issuers to separately account for embedded conversion features and eliminates some of\nthe requirements for equity classification in ASC 815-40-25 for contracts in an entity’s own equity. The guidance also requires entities to use the if-converted method for all\nconvertible instruments in the diluted earnings per share calculation and generally requires them to include the effect of potential share settlement for instruments that may be\nsettled in cash or shares. The Company adopted ASU 2020-06 effective January 1, 2024 using the modified retrospective method. The Company’s liability-classified stock\nwarrants remained classified as liabilities under the amended guidance. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial\nstatements and related disclosures.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted\nASU 2024-03, Income Statement—Reporting Comprehensive Income—Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40): Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses\n(“ASU 2024-03”)\nASU 2024-03 enhances transparency and decision-usefulness of expense disclosures in response to investors’ requests for more detailed, disaggregated expense\ninformation, enabling a clearer understanding of a public business entity’s performance and cost structure. The amendments improve disclosure requirements in financial\nstatement notes for specific expense categories, including inventory purchases, employee compensation, depreciation, amortization, and depletion, as well as qualitative\ndescriptions of other expenses. The amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2026, with early adoption permitted. The Company is evaluating the\neffect ASU 2024-03 will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures (“ASU 2023-09”)\nASU 2023-09 enhances the transparency and decision usefulness of income tax disclosures, in response to investors’ feedback, indicating the need for improved\ninformation to assess an entity’s operations, tax risks, and planning opportunities, particularly in understanding exposure to jurisdictional tax changes and their impact on cash\nflows. The amendments address these concerns by improving income tax disclosures, primarily related to the rate reconciliation and income taxes paid information. The\namendments in this update are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024 and should be applied prospectively. Early adoption and retrospective\napplication is permitted. The Company is evaluating the effect ASU 2023-09 will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures (“ASU 2023-07”)\nASU 2023-07 improves the disclosures about a public entity’s reportable segments and addresses requests from investors for additional, more detailed information\nabout a reportable segment’s expenses. The amendments in this update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years\nbeginning after December 15, 2024. The amendments require retrospective application to all prior periods presented in the financial statements. Upon transition, the segment\nexpense categories and amounts disclosed in the prior periods should be based on the significant segment expense categories identified and disclosed in the period of adoption.\nThe Company is evaluating the effect ASU 2023-07 will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nP3 Health Partners Inc. | Q3 2024 Form 10-Q | 13\nTable of Contents\nASU 2023-06, Disclosure Improvements: Codification Amendments In Response to the SEC’s Disclosure Update and Simplification Initiative (“ASU 2023-06”)\nASU 2023-06 clarifies or improves disclosure and presentation requirements on a variety of topics and aligns the requirements in the Codification with the SEC’s\nregulations. The effective date for each amendment will be the date on which the SEC’s removal of that related disclosure from Regulation S-X or Regulation S-K becomes\neffective, with early adoption prohibited. The amendments in this update should be applied prospectively. If by June 30, 2027, the SEC has not removed the applicable\nrequirement from Regulation S-X or Regulation S-K, the pending content of the related amendment will be removed from the Codification and will not become effective for\nany entity.

Such changes\nwould increase the associated liability while decreases in these assumptions would decrease the associated liability. An increase in the risk-free interest rate would result in a\ndecrease in the estimated fair value measurement and thus a decrease in the associated liability. The Company has not, and does not plan to, declare dividends on its common\nstock and, as such, there is no change in the estimated fair value of the warrant liabilities due to the dividend assumption.\nThe following table sets forth a summary of changes in the fair value of the Company’s private placement warrants to purchase Class A common stock, which are\nconsidered to be Level 3 fair value measurements:\nNine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023\n(in thousands)\nBeginning balance $ 29 $ 40\nIssuance of Common Warrants (see Note 12) 33,260 —\nMark-to-market adjustment of stock warrants (13,993) 11\nEnding balance $ 19,296 $ 51\nThe Company recorded gains of $5.7 million and $0.8 million from changes in the fair value of stock warrants for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and\n2023, respectively, and a gain of $14.6 million and loss of $0.3 million from changes in the fair value of stock warrants for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and\n2023, respectively.\nP3 Health Partners Inc. | Q3 2024 Form 10-Q | 14\nTable of Contents\nThe book value of cash; clinic fees, insurance receivables, and other receivables; accounts payable; and accrued expenses and other current liabilities approximate fair\nvalue because of the short maturity and high liquidity of these instruments.\nDuring the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded a gain of $6.2 million reflecting the write-off and settlement of contingent\nconsideration related to the Company’s 2021 acquisition of Medcore HP, a Level 3 fair value measurement, upon resolution with the sellers of the assumed claims payable and\nrisk adjustment factor.\nNote 6: Property and Equipment\nThe Company’s property and equipment balances consisted of the following as of:\nSeptember 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\n(in thousands)\nLeasehold improvements $ 2,332 $ 2,933\nFurniture & fixtures 1,101 1,165\nComputer equipment & software 7,070 3,699\nMedical equipment 1,082 1,106\nSoftware (development in process) 343 3,877\nVehicles 660 654\nOther — 33\n12,588 13,467\nLess: accumulated depreciation (6,273) (4,781)\nProperty and equipment, net $ 6,315 $ 8,686\nTotal depreciation of property and equipment recognized on the condensed consolidated statements of operations was $0.6 million and $0.5 million for the three\nmonths ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and $1.7 million and $1.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nAsset Sale\nOn September 27, 2024, the Company executed a nonbinding proposal with an entity in which the Company’s principal stockholder has an ownership interest (the\n“Buyer”) setting forth terms and conditions for the proposed sale of substantially all of the assets, clinical and non-clinical, exclusively or primarily used by the Company’s\nsubsidiary, P3 Health Partners-Florida, LLC, on a cash-free, debt-free basis for a purchase price of $15 million.

The Registration Rights Agreement also contains certain shelf takedown and piggyback rights.\nThe Company has also agreed, among other things, to indemnify the Purchasers, their officers, directors, members, employees and agents, successors and assigns\nunder the registration statement from certain liabilities and to pay all fees and expenses incident to the Company’s obligations under the Registration Rights Agreement.\nAmended and Restated Letter Agreement with CPF\nOn May 24, 2024, in connection with entry into the Purchase Agreement, the Company entered into an amended and restated letter agreement (the “Amended and\nRestated Letter Agreement”) with CPF GP, and Chicago Pacific Founders GP III, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership (“CPF GP III,” and together with CPF GP, “CPF”) (on\nbehalf of the funds of which CPF GP is the general partner, certain funds of which CPF GP III is the general partner and/or certain of their affiliated entities and funds\n(collectively, the “CPF Parties”)). The Amended and Restated Letter Agreement provides that for as long as the CPF Parties own 40% of the Company’s outstanding common\nstock, (i) CPF will be entitled to designate one additional independent member of the Company’s board of directors, and (ii) CPF will be entitled to certain information rights\nand protective provisions. As of the date of the issuance of these financial statements, CPF has not exercised its right to designate a director under the terms of the Amended and\nRestated Letter Agreement. The CPF Parties also agreed to extend a standstill restriction that limits the ownership of the CPF Parties to 49.99% of the Company’s Class A\ncommon stock and Class V common stock from the date of the closing of the May 2024 Private Placement to July 31, 2025.\nRestricted Stock Unit Settlement\nOn December 31, 2023, 1.5 million restricted stock units (“RSU”), each RSU representing the right to receive one share of Class A common stock of the Company,\npreviously granted to Sherif Abdou, M.D., the Company’s former Chief\nP3 Health Partners Inc. | Q3 2024 Form 10-Q | 20\nTable of Contents\nExecutive Officer, vested pursuant to the terms of a Restricted Stock Unit Agreement between the Company and Dr. Abdou. The Company timely paid $0.7 million in\nwithholding taxes attributable to the vesting of the RSUs to the Internal Revenue Service on behalf of Dr. Abdou on January 10, 2024. Dr. Abdou repaid such sum to the\nCompany on May 2, 2024.\nNote 13: Variable Interest Entities\nP3 LLC has Management Services Agreements (“MSAs”) and deficit funding agreements with the Network VIEs. The MSAs provide that the P3 LLC will furnish\nadministrative personnel, office supplies and equipment, general business services, contract negotiation, and billing and collection services to the Network VIEs. Fees for these\nservices are the excess of the Network VIEs’ revenue over expenses. Per the deficit funding agreements, P3 LLC is obligated to advance funds, as needed, to support the\nNetwork VIE’s working capital needs to the extent operating expenses exceed gross revenue. These advances accrue interest at a rate of prime plus 2%. Net advances made to\nthe Network VIEs and accrued interest on those advances are presented within due to consolidated entities of P3 in the table below. Additionally, P3 LLC entered into stock\ntransfer restriction agreements with the practice shareholders of the Network VIEs, which, by way of a call option, unequivocally permit P3 LLC to appoint successor\nphysicians if a practice shareholder vacates their ownership position. Accordingly, P3 LLC identifies itself as the primary beneficiary of the Network VIEs. Practice\nshareholders, who are employees of P3 LLC, retain equity ownership in the Network VIEs, which represents nominal non-controlling interests; however, the non-controlling\ninterests do not participate in the profit or loss of the Network VIEs.\nP3 LLC, directly or indirectly via its wholly owned subsidiaries, may not use or access any net assets of the Network VIEs to settle its obligations or the obligations of\nits wholly owned subsidiaries. Additionally, the creditors of the Network VIEs do not have recourse to the net assets of P3 LLC.\nSince P3 LLC represents substantially all the assets and liabilities of the Company, the following tables provide a summary of the assets, liabilities, and operating\nperformance of only VIEs held at the P3 LLC level.\nSeptember 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\n(in thousands)\nASSETS\nCash $ 7,371 $ 6,491\nClinic fees, insurance and other receivable 1,757 138\nHealth plan receivable 566 571\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets 3,152 1,261\nProperty and equipment, net 32 23\nOther long-term assets 115 153\nTOTAL ASSETS $ 12,993 $ 8,637\nLIABILITIES AND MEMBERS’ DEFICIT\nAccounts payable $ 5,166 $ 5,073\nAccrued expenses and other current liabilities 516 515\nAccrued payroll 3,769 3,141\nClaims payable 5,388 3,973\nOther long-term liabilities 932 946\nDue to consolidated entities of P3 46,934 44,200\nTOTAL LIABILITIES 62,705 57,848\nMEMBERS’ DEFICIT (49,712) (49,211)\nTOTAL LIABILITIES AND MEMBERS’ DEFICIT $ 12,993 $ 8,637\nP3 Health Partners Inc. | Q3 2024 Form 10-Q | 21\nTable of Contents\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\n(in thousands)\nRevenue $ 8,923 $ 9,024 $ 28,041 $ 29,374\nExpense 8,379 11,364 28,079 36,886\nNet income (loss) $ 544 $ (2,340) $ (38) $ (7,512)\nNote 14: Income Taxes\nThe Company’s tax rate is affected primarily by the recognition of a valuation allowance and the portion of income and expense allocated to the non-controlling\ninterest.

During the\nthree and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company’s tax rate was impacted by the release of the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets related to one of its\nconsolidated VIEs.\nP3 Health Partners Inc. | Q3 2024 Form 10-Q | 22\nTable of Contents\nItem 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe following discussion and analysis is intended to provide the reader with an understanding of our business, including an overview of our results of operations and\nliquidity and should be read in conjunction with the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Form 10-Q, as well as\nour audited financial statements and related notes and in Part II, Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” included\nin our 2023 Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements and involves numerous risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those\nanticipated in any forward-looking statements as a result of many factors, including those set forth under “Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements,” in\nPart II, Item 1A. “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this Form 10-Q. Our historical results are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for any periods in the\nfuture.\nOverview\nP3 is a patient-centered and physician-led population health management company. We strive to offer superior care to all those in need. We believe that the misaligned\nincentives in the fee-for-service (“FFS”) healthcare payment model and the fragmentation between physicians and care teams has led to sub-optimal clinical outcomes, limited\naccess, high spending and unnecessary variability in the quality of care. We believe that a platform such as ours, which helps to realign incentives and focuses on treating the\nfull patient, is uniquely positioned to address these healthcare challenges.\nWe have leveraged the expertise of our management team’s more than 20 years of experience in population health management, to build our “P3 Care Model.” The\nkey attributes that differentiate P3 include: 1) patient-focused model, 2) physician-led model, and 3) our broad delegated model. Our model operates by entering into\narrangements with payors providing for monthly payments to manage the total healthcare needs of members attributed to our primary care physicians. In tandem, we enter into\narrangements directly with existing physician groups or independent physicians in the community to join our value-based care (“VBC”) network. In our model, physicians are\nable to retain their independence and entrepreneurial spirit, while gaining access to the tools, teams and technologies that are key to success in a VBC model, all while sharing in\nthe savings from successfully improving the quality of patient care and reducing costs.\nWe operate in the $944 billion Medicare market, which covers approximately 67.5 million eligible lives as of June 2024. Our core focus is the MA market, which\nmakes up approximately 51% of the overall Medicare market, or nearly 31 million Medicare eligible lives in 2023. Medicare beneficiaries may enroll in an MA plan, under\nwhich payors contract with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”) to provide a defined range of healthcare services that are comparable to Medicare FFS\n(which is also referred to as “traditional Medicare”).\nWe predominantly enter into capitated contracts with the nation’s largest health plans to provide holistic, comprehensive healthcare to MA members. Under the typical\ncapitation arrangement, we are entitled to per member per month (“PMPM”) fees from payors to provide a defined range of healthcare services for MA health plan members\nattributed to our primary care physicians (“PCPs”). These PMPM fees comprise our capitated revenue and are determined as a percent of the premium (“POP”) payors receive\nfrom CMS for these members. Our contracted recurring revenue model offers us highly predictable revenue, and rewards us for providing high-quality care rather than driving a\nhigh volume of services. In this capitated arrangement, our goals are well-aligned with payors and patients alike—the more we improve health outcomes, the more profitable we\nwill be over time.\nUnder this capitated contract structure, we are generally responsible for all members’ medical costs across the care continuum, including, but not limited to emergency\nroom and hospital visits, post-acute care admissions, prescription drugs, specialist physician spend, and primary care spend. Keeping members healthy is our primary objective.\nWhen they need medical care, delivery of the right care in the right setting can greatly impact outcomes. When our members need care outside of our network of PCPs, we\nutilize a number of tools including network management, utilization management and claims processing to ensure that the appropriate quality care is provided.\nOur company was formed in 2017 and our first at-risk contract became effective on January 1, 2018. We have demonstrated an ability to rapidly scale, primarily\nentering markets with our affiliate physician model, and expanding to a PCP network of approximately 3,100 physicians, in 27 markets (counties) across five states in over six\nfull years of operations as of September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, our PCP network served approximately 128,900 at-risk members.\nP3 Health Partners Inc. | Q3 2024 Form 10-Q | 23\nTable of Contents\nKey Factors Affecting our Performance\nGrowing Medicare Advantage Membership on Our Platform\nMembership and revenue are tied to the number of members attributed to our physician network by our payors. We believe we have multiple avenues to serve\nadditional members, including through:\n• Growth in membership under our existing contracts and existing markets:\n◦ Patients who are attributed to our physician network who (a) age into Medicare and elect to enroll in MA or (b) elect to convert from Medicare FFS to MA.\n• Adding new contracts (either payor contracts or physician contracts) in existing markets.\n• Adding new contracts (either payor contracts or physician contracts) in adjacent and new markets.\nGrowing Existing Contract Membership\nAs new patients age-in to Medicare and enroll in MA through our payors, they become attributed to our network of physicians with little incremental cost to us.\nIn addition to age-ins, Medicare eligible patients can change their enrollment selections during select periods throughout the year. Our sales and marketing teams\nactively work with local community partners to connect with Medicare eligible patients and make them aware of their healthcare choices and the services that we offer with our\nVBC model, including greater access to their physicians and customized care plans catered to their needs. The ultimate effect of our marketing efforts is increased awareness of\nP3 and additional patients choosing us as their primary care provider. We believe that our marketing efforts also help to grow our payor partners’ membership base as we grow\nour own patient base and help educate patients about their choices on Medicare, further aligning our model with that of healthcare payors.\nGrowing Membership in Adjacent and New Markets\nOur affiliate model allows us to quickly and efficiently enter into new and adjacent markets in two ways: (1 )partnering with payors and (2) partnering with providers.\nBecause our model honors the existing patient-provider relationship, we are able to deploy our care model around existing physicians in a given a market. By utilizing the local\nhealthcare infrastructure, we can quickly build a network of PCPs to serve the healthcare needs of contracted members.\nWe maintain an active pipeline of new partnership opportunities for both providers and payors. These potential opportunities are developed through significant\ninbound interest and the deep relationships our team has developed with their more than 20 years of experience in the VBC space and our proactive assessment of expansion\nmarkets. When choosing a market to enter, we make our decision on a county-by-county basis across the United States. We look at various factors including: (i) population size,\n(ii) payor participants and concentration, (iii) health system participants and concentration, and (iv) competitive landscape.\nWhen entering a new market, we supplement the existing physician network with local market leadership teams and support infrastructure to drive the improvement in\nmedical cost and quality. When entering an adjacent market, we are able to leverage the investments we previously made to have a faster impact on our expanded footprint.\nGrowing Membership in Existing Markets\nOnce established in a market, we have an opportunity to efficiently expand both our provider and payor contracts. Given the benefits PCPs experience from joining our\nP3 Care Model, which offers providers the teams, tools and technologies to better support their patient base, we often experience growth in our affiliate network after entering a\nmarket. Because of the benefits, we have also historically experienced high retention with our affiliate providers. From 2018 through September 30, 2024, we experienced a\n96% physician retention rate in our affiliate provider network. By expanding our affiliate provider network and adding new physicians to the P3 network, we can quickly\nincrease the number of contracted at-risk members under our existing health plan arrangements.\nP3 Health Partners Inc. | Q3 2024 Form 10-Q | 24\nTable of Contents\nAdditionally, by expanding the number of contracted payors, we can leverage our existing infrastructure to quickly increase our share of patients within our physician\nnetwork. However, we have and intend to continue to conduct periodic strategic reviews of our provider and payor contracts, as a result of which we may elect to periodically\nexit underperforming provider and payor contracts from our network.\nGrowing Capitated Revenue Per Member\nMedicare pays capitation using a risk adjusted model, which compensates payors based on the health status, or acuity, of each individual member. Payors with higher\nacuity members receive a higher payment and those with lower acuity members receive a lower payment. Moreover, some of our capitated revenue also includes adjustments\nfor performance incentives or penalties based on the achievement of certain clinical quality metrics as contracted with payors. Given the prevalence of FFS arrangements, our\npatients often have historically not participated in a VBC model, and therefore their health conditions are poorly documented. Through the P3 Care Model, we determine and\nassess the health needs of our patients and create an individualized care plan consistent with those needs. We capture and document health conditions as a part of this process.\nWe expect that our PMPM revenue will continue to improve the longer members participate in our care model as we better understand and assess their health status (acuity) and\ncoordinate their medical care.\nEffectively Managing Member Medical Expense\nOur medical expense is our largest expense category, representing 88% of our total operating expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. We manage our\nmedical costs by improving our members access to healthcare. Our care model focuses on maintaining health and leveraging the primary care setting as a means of avoiding\ncostly downstream healthcare costs, such as emergency department visits and acute hospital inpatient admissions.\nAchieving Operating Efficiencies\nAs a result of our affiliate model and ability to leverage our existing local and national infrastructure, we generate operating efficiencies at both the market and\nenterprise level. Our local corporate, general and administrative expense, which includes our local leadership, care management teams and other operating costs to support our\nmarkets, are expected to decrease over time as a percentage of revenue as we add members to our existing contracts, grow membership with new payor and physician contracts,\nand our revenue subsequently increases. Our corporate general and administrative expenses at the enterprise level include resources and technology to support payor\ncontracting, quality, data management, delegated services, finance and legal functions. While we expect our absolute investment in our enterprise resources to increase over\ntime, we expect our investment will decrease as a percentage of revenue when we are able to leverage our infrastructure across a broader group of at-risk members. We expect\nour corporate, general and administrative expenses to increase in absolute dollars in the future as we continue to invest to support growth of our business, as well as due to the\ncosts required to operate as a public company, including insurance coverage, investments in internal audit, investor relations and financial reporting functions, fees paid to the\nNasdaq Stock Market, and increased legal and audit fees.\nImpact of Seasonality\nOur operational and financial results reflect some variability depending upon the time of year in which they are measured. This variability is most notable in the\nfollowing areas:\nAt-Risk Member Growth. While new members are attributed to our platform throughout the year, we experience the largest portion of our at-risk member growth\nduring the first quarter. Contracts with new payors typically begin on January 1, at which time new members become attributed to our network of physicians. Additionally, new\nmembers are attributed to our network on January 1, when plan enrollment selections made during the prior Annual Enrollment Period from October 15 through December 7 of\nthe prior year take effect.\nRevenue Per Member. Our revenue is based on percentage of premium we have negotiated with our payors as well as our ability to accurately and appropriately\ndocument the acuity of a member’s health status. We experience some seasonality with respect to our per member revenue as it will generally decline over the course of the\nyear. In January of each year, CMS revises the risk adjustment factor for each patient based upon health conditions documented in the prior year, leading to an overall increase\nin per-patient revenue. As the year progresses, our per-patient revenue declines as new patients join us typically with less complete or accurate documentation (and therefore\nlower risk-adjustment scores) and patients with more severe acuity profiles (and, therefore, higher per member revenue rates) expire.\nP3 Health Partners Inc. | Q3 2024 Form 10-Q | 25\nTable of Contents\nMedical Costs. Medical expense is driven by utilization of healthcare services by our attributed membership. Medical expense will vary seasonally depending on a\nnumber of factors, including the weather and the number of business days. Certain illnesses, such as the influenza virus, are far more prevalent during colder months of the year,\nwhich will result in an increase in medical expenses during these time periods. We would therefore expect to see higher levels of per-member medical expense in the first and\nfourth quarters. Business days can also create year-over-year comparability issues if one year has a different number of business days compared to another.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures and Key Performance Metrics\nWe use certain financial measures, which are not calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (“GAAP”), as well as key\nperformance metrics, to supplement our consolidated financial statements. The measures set forth below should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for,\nfinancial information presented in compliance with GAAP, and non-GAAP financial measures and key performance metrics as used by us may not be comparable to similarly\ntitled measures used by other companies. Our presentation of these measures should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or\nnon-recurring items. The presentation of non-GAAP financial measures and key performance metrics provides additional information to investors regarding our results of\noperations that our management believes is useful for identifying trends, analyzing and benchmarking the performance of our business.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nAdjusted EBITDA\nThe key non-GAAP metric we utilize to measure our profitability and performance is Adjusted EBITDA. We present Adjusted EBITDA because we believe it helps\ninvestors understand underlying trends in our business and facilitates an understanding of our operating performance from period to period because it facilitates a comparison of\nour recurring core business operating results.\nBy definition, EBITDA consists of net income (loss) before interest, income taxes, depreciation, and amortization. We define Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA, further\nadjusted to exclude the effect of certain supplemental adjustments, such as mark-to-market warrant gain/loss, premium deficiency reserves, equity-based compensation expense,\nand certain other items that we believe are not indicative of our core operating performance. Our definition of Adjusted EBITDA may not be the same as the definitions used in\nany of our debt agreements.\nAdjusted EBITDA is not a measure of performance or liquidity calculated in accordance with GAAP. It is unaudited and should not be considered an alternative to, or\nmore meaningful than, net income (loss) as an indicator of our operating performance. Uses of cash flows that are not reflected in Adjusted EBITDA include capital\nexpenditures, interest payments, debt principal repayments, and other expenses defined above, which can be significant. As a result, Adjusted EBITDA should not be\nconsidered as a measure of our liquidity.\nBecause of these limitations, Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for performance measures calculated in accordance with\nGAAP. We compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our GAAP results and using Adjusted EBITDA on a supplemental basis. You should review the\nreconciliation of net loss to Adjusted EBITDA set forth below and not rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business.\nP3 Health Partners Inc. | Q3 2024 Form 10-Q | 26\nTable of Contents\nThe following table sets forth a reconciliation of our net loss, the most directly comparable GAAP metric, to Adjusted EBITDA:\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\n(in thousands)\nNet loss $ (102,850) $ (37,289) $ (181,230) $ (117,319)\nInterest expense, net 5,647 4,002 15,339 11,939\nDepreciation and amortization 21,673 21,721 64,905 65,041\nIncome tax (benefit) provision (3,605) 412 (565) 928\nMark-to-market of stock warrants (5,737) (755) (14,626) 327\nPremium deficiency reserve 18,168 (12,489) 15,771 (9,361)\nEquity-based compensation 1,958 2,251 5,031 4,259\nOther(1) (6,254) (185) (4,242) 2,868\nTransaction and other related costs(2) — — — 70\nAdjusted EBITDA loss $ (71,000) $ (22,332) $ (99,617) $ (41,248)\n_____________________________________________\n(1) Other during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 consisted of (i) interest income and (ii) gain recognized upon the settlement and write-off of contingent consideration related to an\nacquisition completed in a prior year partially offset by (iii) severance and related expense in connection with our chief executive officer transition and (iv) valuation allowance on our notes receivable.\nOther during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 consisted of (i) interest income offset by (ii) cybersecurity incident loss with respect to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, (iii)\nrestructuring and other charges, including severance and benefits paid to employees pursuant to workforce reduction plans with respect to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, (iv) the disposition of\nour Pahrump operations, (v) expenses for third-party consultants to assist us with the development, implementation, and documentation of new and enhanced internal controls and processes for compliance\nwith Sarbanes-Oxley Section 404(b) with respect to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, (vi) a legal settlement outside of the ordinary course of business with respect to the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023, and (vii) valuation allowance on our notes receivable.\n(2) Transaction and other related costs during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 consisted of legal fees incurred related to acquisition-related litigation.\nMedical Margin\nMedical margin is a non-GAAP financial metric. We present medical margin because we believe it helps investors understand underlying trends in our business and\nfacilitates an understanding of our operating performance from period to period by facilitating a comparison of our recurring core business operating results.\nMedical margin represents the amount earned from capitated revenue after medical claims expenses are deducted. Medical claims expenses represent costs incurred for\nmedical services provided to our members. As our platform grows and matures over time, we expect medical margin to increase in absolute dollars; however, medical margin\nPMPM may vary as the percentage of new members brought onto our platform fluctuates. New membership added to the platform is typically dilutive to medical margin\nPMPM.\nMedical margin should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. We compensate for these\nlimitations by relying primarily on our GAAP results and using medical margin on a supplemental basis. You should review the reconciliation of gross profit to medical margin\nset forth below and not rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business.\nThe following table presents our medical margin:\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\n(in thousands)\nCapitated revenue $ 357,706 $ 285,153 $ 1,116,146 $ 909,473\nLess: medical claims expense (357,166) (248,918) (1,037,965) (783,497)\nMedical margin $ 540 $ 36,235 $ 78,181 $ 125,976\nP3 Health Partners Inc. | Q3 2024 Form 10-Q | 27\nTable of Contents\nThe following table sets forth a reconciliation of our gross profit, the most directly comparable GAAP metric, to medical margin:\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\n(in thousands)\nGross profit (loss) $ (39,796) $ 9,131 $ (19,379) $ 52,453\nOther patient service revenue (4,418) (3,198) (13,623) (10,041)\nOther medical expense 44,754 30,302 111,183 83,564\nMedical margin $ 540 $ 36,235 $ 78,181 $ 125,976\nKey Performance Metrics\nWe monitor the following operating metrics to help us evaluate our business, identify trends affecting our business, formulate business plans and make strategic\ndecisions.\nGross Profit\nGross profit represents the amount earned from total operating revenue less the sum of: (i) medical claims expenses and (ii) other medical expenses including physician\ncompensation expense related to surplus sharing and bonuses and other direct medical expenses incurred to improve care for our members. We believe this metric provides\ninsight into the economics of the P3 Care Model, as it includes all medical claims expense associated with our members’ care as well as partner compensation and additional\nmedical costs we incur as part of our aligned partnership model. Other medical expenses are largely variable and proportionate to the level of surplus in each respective market,\namong other cost factors.\nThe following table presents our gross profit (loss):\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\n(in thousands)\nTotal operating revenue $ 362,124 $ 288,351 $ 1,129,769 $ 919,514\nLess: medical claims expense (357,166) (248,918) (1,037,965) (783,497)\nLess: other medical expense (44,754) (30,302) (111,183) (83,564)\nGross profit (loss) $ (39,796) $ 9,131 $ (19,379) $ 52,453\nAt-Risk Membership\nAt-risk membership represents the approximate number of Medicare members for whom we receive a fixed percentage of premium under capitation arrangements as of\nthe end of the reporting period. We had 128,900 and 105,600 at-risk members as of September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nAffiliate Primary Care Physicians\nAffiliate primary care physicians represent the approximate number of primary care physicians included in our affiliate network, with whom members may be\nattributed under our capitation arrangements, as of the end of the reporting period. We had 3,100 and 2,700 primary care physicians as of September 30, 2024 and 2023,\nrespectively.\nPlatform Support Costs\nOur platform support costs, which include regionally-based support personnel and other operating costs to support our markets, are expected to decrease over time as a\npercentage of revenue as our physician partners add members and our revenue grows. Our operating expenses at the enterprise level include resources and technology to support\npayor contracting, clinical program development, quality, data management, finance, and legal functions. We exclude costs related to the operations of our owned medical\nclinics and wellness centers.\nP3 Health Partners Inc. | Q3 2024 Form 10-Q | 28\nTable of Contents\nThe table below represents costs to support our markets and enterprise functions, which are included in corporate, general and administrative expenses:\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\n(dollars in thousands)\nPlatform support costs $ 26,604 $ 25,932 $ 68,064 $ 78,583\n% of total operating revenue 7.3 % 9.0 % 6.0 % 8.5 %\nKey Components of Results of Operations\nRevenue\nCapitated revenue. We contract with health plans using an at-risk model. Under the at-risk model, we are responsible for the cost of all covered health care services\nprovided to members assigned by the health plans to the Company in exchange for a fixed payment, which generally is a POP based on health plans’ premiums received from\nCMS. Through this capitation arrangement, we stand ready to provide assigned MA members all their medical care via our directly employed and affiliated physician/specialist\nnetwork.\nThe premiums health plans receive are determined via a competitive bidding process with CMS and are based on the costs of care in local markets and the average\nutilization of services by patients enrolled. Medicare pays capitation using a “risk adjustment model,” which compensates providers based on the health status (acuity) of each\nindividual patient. MA plans with higher acuity patients receive higher premiums. Conversely, MA plans with lower acuity patients receive lesser premiums. Under the risk\nadjustment model, capitation is paid on an interim basis based on enrollee data submitted for the preceding year and is adjusted in subsequent periods after final data is\ncompiled. As premiums are adjusted via this risk adjustment model (using a Risk Adjustment Factor, “RAF”), our PMPM payments change commensurately with how our\ncontracted Medicare Advantage plans’ premiums change with CMS.\nThe transaction price for these contracts is variable as it primarily includes PMPM fees, which can fluctuate throughout the course of the year based on the acuity of\neach individual enrollee. In certain contracts, PMPM fees also include adjustments for items such as performance incentives or penalties based on the achievement of certain\nclinical quality metrics as contracted with payors. Capitated revenue is recognized based on a PMPM transaction price to transfer the service for a distinct increment of the series\nand is recognized net of projected acuity adjustments and performance incentives or penalties. We recognize revenue in the month in which attributed members are entitled to\nreceive healthcare benefits during the contract term. The capitation amount is subject to possible retroactive premium risk adjustments based on the member’s individual acuity.\nOther patient service revenue. Other patient service revenue is comprised primarily of encounter-related fees to treat patients outside of our at-risk arrangements at\ncompany owned clinics. Other patient service revenue also includes ancillary fees earned under contracts with certain payors for the provision of certain care coordination and\nother care management services. These services are provided to patients covered by these payors regardless of whether those patients receive their care from our directly\nemployed or affiliated medical groups.\nOperating Expense\nMedical expense. Medical expenses primarily include costs of all covered services provided to members by non-P3 employed providers. This also includes an estimate\nof the cost of services that have been incurred, but not yet reported (“IBNR”). IBNR is recorded as claims payable on the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets.\nEstimates for incurred claims are based on historical enrollment and cost trends while also taking into consideration operational changes. Future and actual results typically\ndiffer from estimates. Differences could result from an overall change in medical expenses per member, changes in member mix or simply due to the addition of new members.\nIBNR estimates are made on an accrual basis and adjusted in future periods as required. To the extent we revise our estimates of incurred but not reported claims for prior\nperiods up or down, there would be a correspondingly favorable or unfavorable effect on our current period results that may or may not reflect changes in long term trends in\nour performance.\nPremium deficiency reserve. Premium deficiency reserves (“PDR”) are recognized when it is probable that expected future health care costs and maintenance costs\nunder a group of existing contracts will exceed anticipated future\nP3 Health Partners Inc. | Q3 2024 Form 10-Q | 29\nTable of Contents\npremiums and stop-loss insurance recoveries on those contracts. PDR represents the advance recognition of a probable future loss in the current period’s financial statements.\nCorporate, general and administrative expense. Corporate, general and administrative expenses include employee-related expenses, including salaries and related costs\nand equity-based compensation for our executive, technology infrastructure, operations, clinical and quality support, finance, legal, and human resources departments. In\naddition, general and administrative expenses include all corporate technology and occupancy costs.\nSales and marketing expense. Sales and marketing expenses consist of costs related to patient and provider marketing and community outreach. These expenses capture\nall costs for both our local and enterprise sales and marketing efforts.\nDepreciation and amortization expense. Depreciation expense is associated with our property and equipment, including leasehold improvements, computer equipment\nand software, furniture and fixtures, and internally developed software. Amortization expense is associated with definite lived intangible assets, including trademarks and\ntradenames, customer contracts, provider network agreements, and payor contracts.\nOther Income (Expense)\nInterest expense, net. Interest expense primarily consists of interest on our Term Loan Facility (as defined below) and unsecured promissory notes and amortization of\ndebt issuance costs and original issue discount.\nMark-to-market of stock warrants. Mark-to-market of stock warrants consists of the change in the fair value on the revaluation of warrant liabilities associated with our\npublic and private placement Class A common stock warrants.\nOther. Other consists of gains and losses resulting from other transactions.\nIncome Taxes\nP3 LLC is treated as a partnership for U.S. federal and most applicable state and local income tax jurisdictions. As a partnership, P3 LLC is generally not subject to\ntaxes, other than entity level state income taxes, such as the Oregon corporate activity tax, a quasi-gross receipts tax that is levied on our Oregon sourced revenue. Any taxable\nincome or loss generated by P3 LLC is passed through to and included within the taxable income or loss of its members, including us, on a pro rata basis. We are subject to U.S.\nfederal income taxes, in addition to state and local income taxes with respect to our allocable share of any taxable income or loss generated by P3 LLC.\nNon-controlling Interest\nWe consolidate the financial results of P3 LLC and report a non-controlling interest on our consolidated statements of operations, representing the portion of net\nincome or loss attributable to the non-controlling interest. The weighted average ownership percentages during the period are used to calculate the net income or loss attributable\nto P3 Health Partners Inc. and the non-controlling interest.\nP3 Health Partners Inc. | Q3 2024 Form 10-Q | 30\nTable of Contents\nResults of Operations\nThe following tables set forth our condensed consolidated statements of operations data for the periods indicated.

As such, we have no independent\nmeans of generating revenue or cash flow, and our ability to pay taxes, make payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement (“TRA”), and to pay dividends will depend on the\nfinancial results and cash flows of P3 LLC and the distributions received from P3 LLC. Deterioration in the financial condition, earnings or cash flow of P3 LLC for any reason\ncould limit or impair P3 LLC’s ability to pay such distributions. Additionally, to the extent that we need funds and P3 LLC is restricted from making such distributions under\napplicable law or regulation or under the terms of any financing arrangements, or P3 LLC is otherwise unable to provide such funds, it could materially adversely affect our\nliquidity and financial condition. It is anticipated that the distributions we will receive from P3 LLC may, in certain periods, exceed the actual tax liabilities and obligations to\nmake payments under the TRA.\nCash Sources\nTo date, we have financed our operations principally through the cash we obtained as a result of the Business Combinations, private placements of our equity\nsecurities, payments from our payors, issuances of promissory notes, and borrowings under the Term Loan Facility. We generate cash from our operations, generally from our\ncontracts with payors. As of September 30, 2024, we had cash and restricted cash of $68.1 million, which includes a $15 million refundable good faith deposit for the sale of\nour Florida operations, which we received in advance of the proposed sale (as described below).\nWe have experienced losses since our inception and net losses of $102.9 million and $181.2 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024,\nrespectively. We expect to continue to incur operating losses and generate negative cash flows from operations for the foreseeable future due to the strong growth we have\nexperienced over the last seven years and the investments we are making in expanding our business, which require up-front expenses. Our future capital requirements will\ndepend on many factors, including the pace of our growth, ability to manage medical costs, the maturity of our members, our ability to complete the sale of our Florida\noperations, and our ability to raise capital. We may need to raise additional capital through a combination of debt financing, other non-dilutive financing and/or equity financing\nand to the extent we are unsuccessful at doing so, we may need to adjust our growth trajectory to accommodate our capital needs and look for additional ways to generate cost\nefficiencies.\nAsset Sale\nOn September 27, 2024, we executed a nonbinding proposal with an entity in which our principal stockholder has an ownership interest (the “Buyer”) setting forth\nterms and conditions for the proposed sale of substantially all of the assets, clinical and non-clinical, exclusively or primarily used by our Florida operations on a cash-free, debt-\nfree basis for a purchase price of $15 million. As of September 30, 2024, the Buyer has paid a good faith deposit in the amount of $15 million (the “Good Faith Deposit”),\nwhich was recorded within cash and accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the condensed consolidated balance sheet. The completion of the transaction is subject to\nthe negotiation and signing of a definitive agreement and the satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including completion of the Buyer’s financial due diligence, and is\nexpected to close during the fourth quarter of 2024. The terms of a definitive agreement may differ from the anticipated terms described herein and there can be no assurance\nthat we will enter into a definitive agreement for the sale. If we do not enter into a definitive agreement for the sale, or the sale is not completed for any other reason, we will be\nrequired to return the Good Faith Deposit to the Buyer.\nP3 Health Partners Inc. | Q3 2024 Form 10-Q | 35\nTable of Contents\nMay 2024 Private Placement\nOn May 24, 2024, pursuant to a securities purchase agreement, dated May 22, 2024, with the purchasers named therein (the “Purchasers”), which included certain\naffiliated entities of Chicago Pacific Founders GP, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership (“CPF GP”), and institutional investors, we issued approximately 67.4 million units at a\nprice of approximately $0.6270 per unit. Each unit consists of one share of Class A common stock and a warrant (the “Common Warrants”) to purchase one share of Class A\ncommon stock at an exercise price of $0.5020. Certain institutional investors elected to receive pre-funded warrants (the “Pre-Funded Warrants,” and together with the Common\nWarrants, the “Warrants”) to purchase Class A common stock in lieu of a portion of their Class A common stock. In total, we sold (i) an aggregate of 41.6 million shares of\nClass A common stock, (ii) Common Warrants to purchase an aggregate of 67.4 million shares of Class A common stock, and (iii) Pre-Funded Warrants to purchase an\naggregate of 25.8 million shares of Class A common stock for aggregate proceeds of $39.8 million, net of $2.4 million in offering costs (collectively, the “May 2024 Private\nPlacement”).

The sales agent will make commercially reasonable efforts, following our\ninstructions, to sell shares over time, adhering to specified limits. Sales will be conducted through at-the-market offerings as defined by Rule 415(a)(4) under the Securities Act.\nThe aggregate value of shares of Class A common stock that may be offered, issued, and sold under the Sales Agreement is included in the aggregate value of securities that\nmay be offered, issued, and sold by us under the Shelf Registration. Upon termination of the Sales Agreement, any unused portion will be available for sale in other offerings\npursuant to the Shelf Registration. As of September 30, 2024, we have sold approximately 27,000 shares of our Class A common stock under the Sales Agreement for net\nproceeds of approximately $33,000.\nMarch 2023 Private Placement\nOn April 6, 2023, pursuant to a securities purchase agreement, dated March 30, 2023, with the purchasers named therein, which included certain affiliated entities of\nCPF and our Chief Medical Officer and member of our board of directors, we issued 79.9 million units at a price of approximately $1.12 per unit for institutional investors, and\na purchase price of approximately $1.19 per unit for employees and consultants. Each unit consisted of one share of Class A common stock and 0.75 of a warrant to purchase\none share of Class A common stock at an exercise price of $1.13. Certain institutional investors elected to receive pre-funded warrants to purchase Class A common stock in\nlieu of a portion of their Class A common stock. In total, we sold (i) an aggregate of 69.2 million shares of our Class A common stock, (ii) warrants to purchase an aggregate of\n59.9 million shares of Class A common stock, and (iii) pre-funded warrants to purchase an aggregate of 10.8 million shares of Class A common stock for aggregate proceeds of\napproximately $86.6 million, net of offering costs of approximately $2.9 million (collectively, the “March 2023 Private Placement”).\nTerm Loan\nIn November 2020, we entered into a Term Loan and Security Agreement with CRG Servicing, LLC (as amended, the “Term Loan Agreement”) providing for funding\nof up to $100.0 million (the “Term Loan Facility”). The Term Loan Facility’s maturity date is December 31, 2025. As of September 30, 2024, we had $65.0 million of\nborrowings outstanding under the Term Loan Facility, and remaining availability under the Term Loan Facility ended upon termination of the commitment period on February\n28, 2022. Interest is payable at 12.0% per annum on a quarterly cycle (in arrears), which began on March 31, 2021. In March 2021, we elected to pay interest at 8.0% with the\nremaining interest at 4.0% being added to principal as paid in-kind (“PIK”) for a period of three years (or 12 payments).\nWe are required to remain in compliance with financial covenants such as minimum liquidity of $5.0 million and annual minimum revenue levels. In addition, the\nTerm Loan Agreement restricts our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to, among other things, incur indebtedness and liens. On an annual basis, we must post a minimum\namount of annual revenue equal to $585.0 million in 2024 and $650.0 million in 2025.

The VGS Promissory Note provided for\nfunding of up to $40.0 million. The maturity date of the VGS Promissory Note is May 19, 2026. As of September 30, 2024, we had $29.1 million of borrowings outstanding\nunder the VGS Promissory Note, and remaining availability under the VGS Promissory Note ended upon termination of the commitment period on February 3, 2023. We paid\nVGS an up-front fee of 1.5% and will pay a back-end fee of 9.0% at the time the VGS Promissory Note is paid. Interest is payable at 14.0% per annum on a quarterly cycle (in\narrears) beginning March 31, 2023. We may elect to pay interest of 6.0% in kind and 8.0% in cash, subject to certain limitations.\nThe VGS Promissory Note may be prepaid, at our option, either in whole or in part, without penalty or premium, at any time and from time to time, subject to the\npayment of the back-end fee; provided that prepayments must be in increments of at least $2.0 million. The VGS Promissory Note provides for mandatory prepayments with the\nproceeds of certain asset sales, and the Lender has the right to demand payment in full upon (i) a change of control of the Company and (ii) certain qualified financings (as\ndefined in the VGS Promissory Note).\nThe VGS Promissory Note restricts our ability to, among other things, incur indebtedness and liens, and make investments and restricted payments. The maturity date\nmay be accelerated as a remedy under the certain default provisions in the agreement, or in the event a mandatory prepayment event occurs.\nIn connection with the issuance of the VGS Promissory Note, we also entered into a subordination agreement, dated as of December 13, 2022 (the “2022 Subordination\nAgreement”) with VGS which subordinates VGS’s right of payment under the VGS Promissory Note to the right of payment and security interests of the lenders under the\nTerm Loan Facility. Under the terms of the 2022 Subordination Agreement, we will be required to pay all interest under the VGS Promissory Note in-kind. The VGS\nPromissory Note may be prepaid, at our option, either in whole or in part, without penalty or premium subject to certain conditions.\nVGS 2 Promissory Note\nOn March 22, 2024, we entered into a financing transaction with VBC Growth SPV 2, LLC (“VGS 2”), consisting of the issuance by P3 LLC of an unsecured\npromissory note (the “VGS 2 Promissory Note”) to VGS 2. The VGS 2 Promissory Note provided for funding of up to $25.0 million. The VGS 2 Promissory Note matures on\nSeptember 30, 2027. As of September 30, 2024, we had $25.4 million of borrowings outstanding under the VGS 2 Promissory Note, $0.4 million of which consists of an up-\nfront fee of 1.5% of the aggregate principal amount of the loan paid to VGS 2 in-kind. Interest is payable at 17.5% per annum on a quarterly cycle (in arrears) beginning June\n30, 2024. We may elect to pay either (1) 8.0% cash interest and 9.5% PIK interest, or (2) 17.5% PIK interest, provided that payment of cash interest will be permitted only to the\nextent permitted by the Term Loan Agreement and the 2024 Subordination Agreement, and if not so permitted, such interest shall accrue as PIK interest. The VGS 2 Promissory\nNote provides for mandatory prepayments with the proceeds of certain asset sales, and VGS 2 has the right to demand payment in full upon (i) a change of control of the\nCompany and (ii) certain qualified financings (as defined in the VGS 2 Promissory Note).\nThe VGS 2 Promissory Note restricts P3 LLC’s ability and the ability of its subsidiaries to, among other things, incur indebtedness and liens, and make investments\nand restricted payments. The maturity date may be accelerated as a remedy under the certain default provisions in the agreement, or in the event a mandatory prepayment event\noccurs.\nIn connection with the issuance of the VGS 2 Promissory Note, we also entered into a subordination agreement, dated as of March 22, 2024 (the “2024 Subordination\nAgreement”) with VGS 2 which subordinates VGS 2’s right of payment under the VGS 2 Promissory Note to the right of payment and security interests of the lenders under the\nTerm\nP3 Health Partners Inc. | Q3 2024 Form 10-Q | 37\nTable of Contents\nLoan Facility. Under the terms of the 2024 Subordination Agreement, we will be required to pay all interest under the VGS 2 Promissory Note in-kind.\nIn addition, we will pay VGS 2 a back-end fee at the time the VGS 2 Promissory Note is redeemed as follows: (i) if paid after June 30, 2024 and on or before\nSeptember 30, 2024, 4.5%; (ii) if paid after September 30, 2024 and on or before December 31, 2024, 6.75% and (iii) if paid after December 31, 2024, 9.0%.\nAs of September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with the covenants under our Term Loan Facility, VGS Promissory Note, and VGS 2 Promissory Note; however,\nthere can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain compliance with these covenants in the future or that the lenders under the term loan facility and unsecured\npromissory note or the lenders of any future indebtedness we may incur will grant any waiver or forbearance with respect to such covenants that we may request in the future.\nRepurchase Promissory Note\nIn June 2019, we issued a share repurchase promissory note to a former equity investor for $15.0 million, which was subsequently amended in November 2020 (as\namended, the “Repurchase Promissory Note”). The Repurchase Promissory Note automatically matures and is due and payable on the earlier of June 30, 2026, a change in\ncontrol transaction, or an underwritten primary public offering, each as defined in the agreement. The Repurchase Promissory Note accrues PIK interest of 11.0% per year. The\nprincipal balance, accrued interest, and an exit fee of $0.6 million are due at maturity.\nCash Uses\nOur primary uses of cash include payments for medical expenses, administrative expenses, cost associated with our care model, and debt service. Final reconciliation\nand receipts of amounts due from payors are typically settled in arrears.\nPursuant to our election under Section 754 of the Internal Revenue Code (the “Code”), we expect to obtain an increase in our share of the tax basis in the net assets of\nP3 LLC when its units are redeemed or exchanged. We intend to treat any redemptions and exchanges of P3 LLC units as direct purchases of the units for U.S. federal income\ntax purposes. These increases in tax basis may reduce the amounts that we would otherwise pay in the future to various tax authorities. They may also decrease gains (or\nincrease losses) on future dispositions of certain capital assets to the extent the tax basis is allocated to those capital assets.\nIn connection with the Business Combinations, we entered into a TRA that provides for the payment by us of 85% of the amount of any tax benefits that we actually\nrealize, or in some cases are deemed to realize, as a result of (i) increases in our share of the tax basis in the net assets of P3 LLC resulting from any redemptions or exchanges\nof P3 LLC, (ii) tax basis increases attributable to payments made under the TRA, and (iii) deductions attributable to imputed interest pursuant to the TRA (the “TRA\nPayments”). We expect to benefit from the remaining 15% of any tax benefits that we may actually realize.\nThe estimation of a liability under the TRA is, by its nature, imprecise and subject to significant assumptions regarding a number of factors, including (but not limited\nto) the amount and timing of taxable income generated by the Company each year as well as the tax rate then applicable. The TRA liability is estimated to be $11.0 million as\nof September 30, 2024. Due to the Company’s history of losses, the Company has not recorded tax benefits associated with the increase in tax basis as a result of the Business\nCombinations. As a result, the Company determined that payments to TRA holders are not probable and no TRA liability has been recorded as of September 30, 2024.\nAs non-controlling interest holders exercise their right to exchange their units in P3 LLC, a TRA liability may be recorded based on 85% of the estimated future tax\nbenefits that the Company may realize as a result of increases in the tax basis of P3 LLC. The amount of the increase in the tax basis, the related estimated tax benefits, and the\nrelated TRA liability to be recorded will depend on the price of the Company’s Class A common stock at the time of the relevant redemption or exchange.\nOutside of the aforementioned, and any routine transactions made in the ordinary course of business, there have been no material changes to our primary short-term\nand long-term requirements for liquidity and capital as disclosed in Part\nP3 Health Partners Inc. | Q3 2024 Form 10-Q | 38\nTable of Contents\nII, Item 7, “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” of our 2023 Form 10-K.\nLiquidity and Going Concern\nAs of the date of this Form 10-Q, we believe that our existing cash resources are not sufficient to support planned operations for at least the next year from the issuance\nof the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-Q. As a result, we have concluded that there is substantial doubt about our\nability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-Q are issued.\nIn evaluating our ability to continue as a going concern and meet our obligations, we considered our current projections of future cash flows, current financial condition, sources\nof liquidity, and debt obligations for at least one year from the date of issuance of this Form 10-Q. This evaluation of our cash resources available over the next year from the\ndate of issuance of the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-Q does not take into consideration the potential mitigating\neffect of our ongoing efforts to raise capital or our plans that have not been fully implemented or the many factors that determine our capital requirements, including the pace of\nour growth, ability to manage medical costs and the maturity of our members. We continue to explore raising additional capital through a combination of debt financing and\nequity issuances. If we raise funds by issuing debt securities or preferred stock, or by incurring loans, these forms of financing would have rights, preferences, and privileges\nsenior to those of holders of our common stock. If we raise capital through the issuance of additional equity, such sales and issuance would dilute the ownership interests of the\nexisting holders of our Class A common stock. The availability and the terms under which we may be able to raise additional capital could be disadvantageous, and the terms of\ndebt financing or other non-dilutive financing may involve restrictive covenants and dilutive financing instruments, which could place significant restrictions on our operations.\nMacroeconomic conditions and credit markets could also impact the availability and cost of potential future debt financing. There can be no assurances that any additional debt,\nother non-dilutive and/or equity financing would be available to us on favorable terms, or potentially at all. We expect to continue to incur net losses, comprehensive losses, and\nnegative cash flows from operating activities in accordance with our operating plan. If we are unable to obtain additional funding when needed, we will need to curtail planned\nactivities, divest certain operations, sell certain assets or reduce our costs, which will likely have an unfavorable effect on our ability to execute on our business plan, and have\nan adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and future prospects.\nThe unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-Q have been prepared assuming we will continue as a going concern\nand do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of these uncertainties.\nCash Flows\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows:\nNine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023\n(in thousands)\nNet cash used in operating activities $ (52,890) $ (60,150)\nNet cash provided by (used in) investing activities 15,000 (2,039)\nNet cash provided by financing activities 65,054 101,172\nNet change in cash 27,164 38,983\nCash at beginning of period 40,934 18,457\nCash at end of period $ 68,098 $ 57,440\nOperating Activities\nNet cash used in operating activities was $52.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to net cash used in operating activities of $60.2\nmillion for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Significant changes impacting net cash used in operating activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as\ncompared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 were primarily due to changes in working capital.\nP3 Health Partners Inc. | Q3 2024 Form 10-Q | 39\nTable of Contents\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash provided by investing activities was $15.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, consisting of purchase price received in advance of the sale\nof our Florida operations. Net cash used in investing activities was $2.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, consisting of purchases of property and\nequipment.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $65.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily consisting of proceeds from the May 2024\nPrivate Placement, net of offering costs, borrowings on the VGS 2 Promissory Note, and short-term financing agreements for the funding of certain insurance policies. Net cash\nprovided by financing activities was $101.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily consisting of proceeds from the March 2023 Private Placement,\nnet of offering costs, and borrowings on the VGS Promissory Note.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nThe discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in\naccordance with GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management use judgment in the application of accounting policies, including\nmaking estimates and assumptions that could affect assets and liabilities, revenue and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. Management bases its\nestimates on the best information available at the time, its experiences and various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could\ndiffer from those estimates. To the extent that there are differences between our estimates and actual results, our future financial statement presentation, financial condition,\nresults of operations, and cash flows will be affected. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate the continued appropriateness of our accounting estimates to make adjustments we\nconsider appropriate under the facts and circumstances. There have been no significant changes to our critical accounting estimates as disclosed in our 2023 Form 10-K.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 4 “Recent Accounting Pronouncements” to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-Q for a\ndescription of recent accounting standards issued and the anticipated effects on our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements.\nItem 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.\nNot required for Smaller Reporting Companies.\nItem 4. Controls and Procedures.\nLimitations on effectiveness of controls and procedures\nIn designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and\noperated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact\nthat there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs.\nEvaluation of disclosure controls and procedures\nOur management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated, as of the end of the period covered by this Form 10-Q,\nthe effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act). Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive\nOfficer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, due to the material weaknesses described below, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective at the reasonable\nassurance level as of September 30, 2024.\nP3 Health Partners Inc. | Q3 2024 Form 10-Q | 40\nTable of Contents\nMaterial weaknesses\nIn connection with the audit of our financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, we concluded that there were material weaknesses in our\ninternal control over financial reporting. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a\nreasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.\nAs previously reported, management has identified the following material weaknesses in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting, which continued to\nexist as of September 30, 2024:\n• We did not have adequate policies and procedures or sufficient qualified resources with appropriate technical knowledge to maintain effective internal controls over\nthe accounting related to significant accounts and related financial statement disclosures;\n• We did not design and implement a sufficient risk assessment process to identify and assess risks impacting internal control over financial reporting;\n• We had ineffective evaluation and determination as to whether the components of internal control were present and functioning;\n• We did not design and implement effective information technology general controls in the areas of user access related to certain information technology systems\nthat support our financial reporting process;\n• We did not maintain sufficient segregation of duties over the performance of control activities for financial close and reporting, including over the review of account\nreconciliations and journal entries;\n• We did not design and maintain effective management review controls at a sufficient level of precision over all financial statement areas; and\n• We did not design and maintain effective controls at a sufficient level of precision over the estimation of claims expense and payable including controls over the\nreview of historical claims data, including the completeness and accuracy of data used to determine the financial statement amounts.\nRemediation activities\nIn response to these material weaknesses, with oversight from the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, we have been actively engaged in implementing a\ncomprehensive remediation plan. We have completed the design phase of our remediation plan, and the redesigned controls will be tested by management to assess operating\neffectiveness. We will continue to monitor the effectiveness of these and other previously existing processes, procedures, and controls and will make any further changes\nmanagement determines appropriate to enhance the overall internal control environment. Specifically, we have:\n• enhanced the design of existing controls, implemented newly designed controls, and performed walkthroughs of the newly designed processes to evaluate the\nappropriateness of their design and implementation with the assistance of an external advisor engaged by us;\n• formalized enhanced policies, procedures, and documentation for significant areas of accounting, including each area where a material weakness was identified;\n• hired qualified accounting, financial reporting, information technology, and other key management personnel with public company experience;\n• implemented a revised information technology general controls framework that is customized to our application landscape and information risks inherent in the\nfinancial reporting process;\nP3 Health Partners Inc. | Q3 2024 Form 10-Q | 41\nTable of Contents\n• implemented user access reviews across all in-scope information technology applications, standardized and improved the change management process to mitigate\nexecution risks, and provided training to control owners; and\n• designed a segregation of duties risk framework in order to establish a technology-enabled process to identify and evaluate user roles to mitigate segregation of\nduties conflicts.\nWe are committed to maintaining a strong internal control environment. We are still in the process of implementing these steps and cannot assure investors that these\nmeasures will significantly improve or remediate the material weaknesses described above. The material weaknesses cannot be considered remediated until the newly designed\ncontrol activity operates for a sufficient period of time and management has concluded, through testing, that the control is operating effectively. We may also conclude that\nadditional measures may be required to remediate the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, which may necessitate additional implementation and\nevaluation time. We will continue to assess the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and take steps to remediate the known material weaknesses\nexpeditiously.\nChanges in internal control over financial reporting\nOther than the actions taken to remediate our material weaknesses, described above, which were ongoing as of the date of issuance of this Form 10-Q, there were no\nchanges in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that\nhave materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nP3 Health Partners Inc. | Q3 2024 Form 10-Q | 42\nTable of Contents\nPART II\nItem 1. Legal Proceedings.\nThe Company is a party to various claims, legal and regulatory proceedings, lawsuits and administrative actions arising in the ordinary course of business and\nassociated with the Business Combinations. The Company carries general and professional liability insurance coverage to mitigate the Company’s risk of potential loss in such\ncases. An accrual is established when a specific contingency is probable and estimable. The Company also faces contingencies that are reasonably possible to occur that cannot\ncurrently be estimated. The Company believes that disposition of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated financial position, net loss\nor cash flows. It is the Company’s policy to expense costs associated with loss contingencies, including any related legal fees, as they are incurred.\nHudson Class D Dispute\nOn June 11, 2021, Hudson Vegas Investment SPV, LLC (“Hudson”), a holder of P3’s Class D Units, filed an action in the Delaware Court of Chancery captioned\nHudson Vegas Investments SPV, LLC v. Chicago Pacific Founders Fund, L.P., et al., C.A. No. 2021-0518-JTL (the “Hudson Action”), in which it challenged the Business\nCombinations. Specifically, Hudson purported to assert claims against P3, certain managers that were on the P3 Board of Managers, certain of its officers, and Chicago Pacific\nFounders Fund, L.P. for breach of P3’s then-existing LLC agreement (the “LLC Agreement”) (against P3 and Chicago Pacific Founders Fund, L.P.), breach of fiduciary duty\n(against certain of P3’s officers) and breach of contract claims related to the then-existing LLC Agreement (against the P3 Board of Managers) in connection with the process\nleading up to, and approval of, the Business Combinations. In the Hudson Action, Hudson sought to enjoin the consummation of the Business Combinations and seeks a\ndeclaration that the Business Combinations violate its rights under the P3 then-existing LLC Agreement, a declaration that certain managers on the P3 Board of Managers and\ncertain of P3’s officers breached their fiduciary duties, and money damages including attorneys’ fees.\nOn June 13, 2021, P3 filed an action in the Delaware Court of Chancery captioned P3 Health Group Holdings, L.L.C. v. Hudson Vegas Investment SPV, LLC, C.A.\nNo. 2021-0519-JTL (the “P3 Action”). In the P3 Action, P3 sought: (i) a declaration that the Business Combinations do not violate Section 3.10 of P3’s Existing LLC\nAgreement; and (ii) reformation of a provision of P3’s Existing LLC Agreement. The P3 Action was consolidated with the Hudson Action. The combined cases are captioned In\nre P3 Health Group Holdings, L.L.C, C.A. No. 2021-0518-JTL (the “Action”).\nOn August 22, 2024, the parties to the Action executed a Confidential Settlement and Mutual Release Agreement, pursuant to which the parties to the Action agreed to\njointly file a Stipulation of Dismissal with Prejudice relating to the Action. On October 9, 2024, the Action was dismissed with prejudice.\nItem 1A. Risk Factors.\nExcept as described below, there have been no material changes to the risk factors previously disclosed in Part I, Item 1A., “Risk Factors” of our 2023 Form 10-K.\nYou should carefully consider the risk factors included below and discussed in our 2023 Form 10-K, which could materially affect our business, financial condition or future\nresults.\nOur failure to meet the continued listing requirements of The Nasdaq Capital Market could result in a delisting of our securities.\nWe are required to meet the continued listing requirements of the Nasdaq Capital Market and if we fail to satisfy such continued listing requirements, Nasdaq may take\nsteps to delist our securities. For example, on May 15, 2024, we received a deficiency letter (the “Deficiency Letter”) from the listing qualifications department of Nasdaq\nindicating that, for the prior thirty-one consecutive business days, the bid price for our Class A common stock had closed below the minimum $1.00 per share requirement for\ncontinued listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market under Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) (the “Bid Price Rule”). In accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A), we were\ngranted an initial period of 180 calendar days, or until November 11, 2024, to regain compliance with the Bid Price Rule. We did not achieve compliance with the Bid Price\nRule prior to this time.\nOn November 12, 2024, Nasdaq notified us that we were eligible for an additional 180 calendar day period to regain compliance with the Bid Price Rule as we met the\ncontinued listing requirement for market value of publicly held shares and all other initial listing standards for The Nasdaq Capital Market, with the exception of the bid price\nrequirement,\nP3 Health Partners Inc. | Q3 2024 Form 10-Q | 43\nTable of Contents\nand have provided written notice to Nasdaq of our intention to cure the deficiency during the second compliance period by effecting a reverse stock split, if necessary.\nWe intend to actively monitor the closing bid price of our Class A common stock and will consider all available options to regain compliance with the Bid Price Rule,\nwhich may include seeking stockholder approval to effect a reverse stock split. However, there can be no assurance that any such reverse stock split, if approved by the\nstockholders and implemented, would increase the market price of our Class A common stock in proportion to the reverse split ratio or result in a sustained increase in the\nmarket price of our Class A common stock. In addition, it is possible that the reduced number of issued shares of Class A common stock resulting from such a reverse stock\nsplit could adversely affect the liquidity of our Class A common stock. There can also be no assurance that any actions that we take will be successful in restoring our\ncompliance with the Bid Price Rule or will prevent future non-compliance therewith. There is also no assurance that we will maintain compliance with the other listing\nrequirements of The Nasdaq Capital Market or that we will be successful in appealing any delisting determination.\nDelisting from the Nasdaq Capital Market would cause us to pursue eligibility for trading of these securities on other markets or exchanges, or on the “pink sheets.” In\nsuch case, our stockholders’ ability to trade, or obtain quotations of the market value of our Class A common stock would be severely limited because of lower trading volumes\nand transaction delays. These factors could contribute to lower prices and larger spreads in the bid and ask prices of our Class A common stock. There can be no assurance that\nour securities, if delisted from the Nasdaq Capital Market in the future, would be listed on a national securities exchange, a national quotation service, the over-the-counter\nmarkets or the pink sheets. Delisting from the Nasdaq Capital Market, or even the issuance of a notice of potential delisting, would also result in negative publicity, make it\nmore difficult for us to raise additional capital, adversely affect the market liquidity of our securities, decrease securities analysts’ coverage of us or diminish investor\nconfidence. Moreover, there is no assurance that any actions that we take will be successful in restoring our compliance with the Bid Price Rule or will prevent future non-\ncompliance therewith. There is also no assurance that we will maintain compliance with the other listing requirements of The Nasdaq Capital Market.\nItem 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds.\nThere were no unregistered sales of our equity securities during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, that were not otherwise disclosed in a Current Report on Form\n8-K.\nItem 3. Defaults Upon Senior Securities.\nNot applicable.\nItem 4. Mine Safety Disclosures.\nNot applicable.\nItem 5. Other Information.\n(a) None.\n(b) None.\n(c) Insider Trading Arrangements and Policies.\nDuring the quarter ended September 30, 2024, no director or “officer” (as defined in Rule 16a-1(f) under the Exchange Act) of the Companya dopted or terminated a\n“Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement” or “non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement,” as each term is defined in Item 408(a) of Regulation S-K.\nP3 Health Partners Inc. | Q3 2024 Form 10-Q | 44\nTable of Contents\nItem 6.

We believe we are building a remarkable team\nof thought leaders in healthcare and are thrilled to invite you to be part of it. The commitment and conviction you have demonstrated about the important\nrole that value based care is playing, and will play, in transforming healthcare delivery in the U.S is a shared value across our team, and we truly look\nforward to having you join us on that journey.\nAs you know, P3 is a public company and, as such, this offer is contingent upon securing approval from our Board of Directors, which we will pursue\nexpeditiously upon your indication that you are prepared to move forward based on the details outlined in this offer. Upon your acceptance we will\ncoordinate individual meetings with the Board’s Chair, Mark Thierer and our Audit Chair Jeff Park which will be confirmatory calls. We are confident\nthat the Board will be quite supportive of your leadership.\nYour target start date will be August 26th, 2024, which we hope will allow you to provide appropriate notice and complete your commitments to your\ncurrent employer. Your initial base compensation will be $440,000 per year, and your target annual bonus will be 50% of your annual salary. The annual\nbonus target will be based on mutually agreed upon performance metrics established by the CEO and Board, in consultation with you, prior to the start\nof each performance year. Your cash compensation will be reviewed annually by the Company’s Compensation Committee.\nIf your employment with P3 is terminated by the Company without Cause after you have been employed for at least six months, you will receive six\nmonths of salary as severance pay. Please note that this severance will be subject to mitigation if you obtain new employment during that time.\nAs a key leader in the Company, a significant portion of your compensation will be in the form of equity. You will be granted a total of 1,500,000 units,\nunderscoring our confidence in your ability to drive the Company’s future performance and success. The equity units will be granted with an exercise\nprice set at the market value on the date of grant.\nThe units are structured as follows:\nYou will be granted a total of 1,500,000 units, divided equally into 750,000 stock options and 750,000 RSUs. The stock options will vest over a four-\nyear period, with 25% vesting on the first anniversary of your start date and the remaining 75% vesting pro rata quarterly over the following three years.\nThe RSUs will also vest over a four-year period, with 25% vesting on the first anniversary of your start date and the remaining 75% vesting pro rata\nquarterly over the following three years. The RSU’s will vest on the same schedule as the stock options. They will also have a second vesting condition\ntied to the Company completing a secondary transaction. This second vesting trigger will allow us to manage the tax obligations associated with the\nvesting of the RSU’s.\nIn the event of a change in control, such as a merger or acquisition, 50% of your total equity units, including both options and RSUs, will vest. This\nmeans 750,000 units (375,000 options and 375,000 RSUs) will vest, provided you remain employed by the Company through the transaction and any\nnecessary transition period as reasonably required by the acquiring company. If the Company goes private, 30% of your total stock, including both\noptions and RSUs, will vest. This means 450,000 units (225,000 options and 225,000 RSUs) will vest.\nThe projected value of this equity grant would be between $4 million and $13 million, based on an improvement in the Company’s stock price in the\nrange from $8 to $25 – which would be achieved were the Company to realize valuations consistent with its peers (the $25 share price correlates to a\nmarket cap of approximately $13B).\nWe believe that this equity grant aligns your interests with those of our shareholders and underscores our commitment to your success as the CFO of P3.\nLeif, we are excited to move forward with you and welcome the opportunity to discuss any questions you may have regarding this offer, or P3 Health\nPartners.\nFinally, as you might expect, as a CFO of a CPF portfolio company we are required to undertake a routine background check by a third-party vendor\nwho regularly completes this due diligence step for our leadership teams.\nWe look forward to reviewing this offer letter and the opportunity with you soon.\nWith warmest regards,\nAric Coffman\nChief Executive Officer\nP3 Health Partners, Inc\nAgreed to and Accepted By:\nName: /s/ Leif Pedersen Date: 7/23/2024\nLeif Pedersen\nExhibit 10.2\nP3 HEALTH PARTNERS INC.\n2021 INCENTIVE AWARD PLAN\nSTOCK OPTION GRANT NOTICE\nP3 Health Partners Inc., a Delaware corporation (the “Company”) has granted to the participant listed below (“Participant”) the stock option (the\n“Option”) described in this Stock Option Grant Notice (the “Grant Notice”), subject to the terms and conditions of the P3 Health Partners Inc. 2021\nIncentive Award Plan (as amended from time to time, the “Plan”) and the Stock Option Agreement attached hereto as Exhibit A (the “Agreement”),\nboth of which are incorporated into this Grant Notice by reference.

Participant further acknowledges that the rule set forth in the preceding sentence will be applied\nby taking the Option and other stock options into account in the order in which they were granted, as determined under Section 422(d) of the Code.\nParticipant also acknowledges that if the Option is exercised more than three months after Participant’s Termination of Service, other than by reason of\ndeath or Disability, the Option will be taxed as a Non-Qualified Stock Option.\n(b) Participant will give prompt written notice to the Company of any disposition or other transfer of any Shares acquired under this\nAgreement if such disposition or other transfer is made (i) within two years from the Grant Date or (ii) within one year after the transfer of such Shares\nto Participant.

We intend such forward-looking statements to be covered by the safe harbor provisions for\nforward-looking statements contained in Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,\nas amended (the “Exchange Act”). All statements other than statements of historical facts contained in this Form 10-K, including statements regarding our future results of\noperations and financial position, business and growth strategy, prospective products, research and development costs, future revenue, market opportunity, timing and likelihood\nof success, plans and objectives of management for future operations, our ability to raise additional capital and continue as a going concern, future results of anticipated\nproducts and prospects, are forward-looking statements. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terms such as “may,” “will,” “should,” “expect,” “plan,”\n“anticipate,” “could,” “intend,” “target,” “project,” “contemplate,” “believe,” “estimate,” “predict,” “potential,” “would” or “continue” or the negative of these terms or other\nsimilar expressions, although not all forward-looking statements contain these words.\nThe forward-looking statements in this Form 10-K are only predictions and are based largely on our current expectations and projections about future events and\nfinancial trends that we believe may affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this Form\n10-K and are subject to a number of known and unknown risks, uncertainties and assumptions, and other important factors that may cause our actual results, performance or\nachievements to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements, including those described\nunder the sections in this Form 10-K in Part I, Item 1A. “Risk Factors” and Part II, Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of\nOperations” and elsewhere in this Form 10-K.\nBecause forward-looking statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties, some of which cannot be predicted or quantified and some of which are beyond\nour control, you should not rely on these forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. The events and circumstances reflected in our forward-looking statements\nmay not be achieved or occur and actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Moreover, we operate in an evolving\nenvironment. New risk factors and uncertainties may emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for management to predict all risk factors and uncertainties. Except as\nrequired by applicable law, we do not plan to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements contained herein, whether as a result of any new information, future\nevents, changed circumstances or otherwise.\nYou should read this Form 10-K and the documents that we reference in this Form 10-K and have filed as exhibits hereto completely and with the understanding that\nour actual future results, performance and achievements may be materially different from what we expect. We qualify all of our forward-looking statements by these cautionary\nstatements.\nUnless the context otherwise requires, “we,” “us,” “our,” “P3” and the “Company” refer to P3 Health Partners Inc. and its subsidiaries. “Foresight” refers to the\nCompany prior to the closing of the Business Combinations (defined below), and “P3 LLC” refers to the surviving entity of the P3 Merger (defined below), which was renamed\nP3 Health Group, LLC.\nP3 Health Partners Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 1\nTable of Contents\nSUMMARY RISK FACTORS\nOur business is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including those described in Part I, Item 1A. “Risk Factors” in this Form 10-K. You should carefully\nconsider these risks and uncertainties when investing in our common stock. The principal risks and uncertainties affecting our business include the following:\n• Our ability to continue as a going concern.\n• Our need to raise additional capital to fund our existing operations or develop and commercialize new services or expand our operations.\n• We have a history of net losses. We expect to continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future and we may never achieve or maintain profitability.\n• We may not be able to maintain compliance with our debt covenants in the future which could result in an event of default.\n• Our relatively limited operating history makes it difficult to evaluate our future prospects and the risks and challenges we may encounter.\n• A significant portion of our assets consists of other intangible assets, the value of which may be reduced if we determine that those assets are impaired.\n• We rely on our management team and key employees and our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations could be harmed if we are unable to\nretain qualified personnel.\n• Our growth depends in part on our ability to identify and develop successful new geographies, physician partners, payors and patients. If we are not able to\nsuccessfully execute upon our growth strategies, there may be material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\n• If growth in the number of patients and physician partners on our platform decreases, or the number of services that we are able to provide to physician partners and\nmembers decreases, due to legal, economic or business developments, our business, financial condition and results of operations will be harmed.\n• We primarily depend on reimbursement by third-party payors, as well as payments by individuals, which could lead to delays, uncertainties and disagreements\nregarding the timing and process of reimbursement, including any changes or reductions in Medicare reimbursement rates or rules.\n• The termination or non-renewal of the Medicare Advantage (“MA”) contracts held by the health plans with which we contract, or the termination or nonrenewal of\nour contracts with those plans, could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and our operations.\n• We are dependent on our affiliated professional entities and other physician partners and other providers to effectively manage the quality and cost of care and\nperform obligations under payor contracts.\n• Reductions in the quality ratings of the health plans we serve could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash\nflows.\n• Developments affecting spending by the healthcare industry could adversely affect our business.\n• Our business and operations would suffer in the event of information technology system failures, security breaches, cyberattacks or other deficiencies in\ncybersecurity.\n• Actual or perceived failures to comply with applicable data protection, privacy and security laws, regulations, standards and other requirements could adversely\naffect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nP3 Health Partners Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 2\nTable of Contents\n• We conduct business in a heavily regulated industry and if we fail to adhere to all of the complex government laws and regulations that apply to our business, we\ncould incur fines or penalties or be required to make changes to our operations or experience adverse publicity, any or all of which could have a material adverse\neffect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows, and reputation.\n• If our arrangements with our affiliated professional entities and other physician partners are found to constitute the improper rendering of medical services or fee\nsplitting under applicable state laws, our business, financial condition and our ability to operate in those states could be adversely impacted.\n• We face inspections, reviews, audits and investigations under federal and state government programs and contracts. These audits could have adverse findings that\nmay negatively affect our business, including our results of operations, liquidity, financial condition and reputation.\n• The impact on us of recent healthcare legislation and other changes in the healthcare industry and in healthcare spending is currently unknown, but may adversely\naffect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n• Our only significant asset is the ownership of a minority of the economic interest in P3 LLC, and such ownership may not be sufficient to generate the funds\nnecessary to meet our financial obligations or to pay any dividends on our Class A common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the “Class A common stock”).\n• We will be required to make payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement, dated as of December 3, 2021, by and among P3 LLC and the members of P3 LLC\nfrom time to time party thereto (the “Tax Receivable Agreement”) for certain tax benefits we may claim, and the amounts of such payments could be significant.\n• Foresight Sponsor Group, LLC (the “Sponsor”) and the Chicago Pacific Founders funds, and their respective affiliates and representatives, non-employee directors\nand other non-employee stockholders are not limited in their ability to compete with us, and the corporate opportunity provisions in our certificate of incorporation\ncould enable such persons to benefit from corporate opportunities that might otherwise be available to us, which presents potential conflicts of interest.\n• We have identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. If we fail to establish and maintain effective internal controls in accordance\nwith Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or file our periodic reports in a timely manner, which may\ncause adverse effects on our business and may cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information and may lead to a decline in the price of our\nClass A common stock.\n• Other risks and uncertainties described in this Form 10-K, including those under Part I, Item 1A. “Risk Factors.”\nP3 Health Partners Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 3\nTable of Contents\nPART I\nItem 1. Business.\nBackground\nWe were incorporated in Delaware as Foresight Acquisition Corp. (“Foresight”) on August 20, 2020. On December 3, 2021 (the “Closing Date”), we completed the\nBusiness Combinations (defined and discussed more fully below) with P3 Health Group Holdings, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“P3 Health Group Holdings”)\nand we changed our name to P3 Health Partners Inc. Following the Business Combinations, we are organized in an “Up-C” structure, in which P3 Health Partners Inc. is the sole\nmanager of P3 Health Group, LLC and directly owns approximately 37.2% of P3 Health Group, LLC as of December 31, 2023. Substantially all of the Company’s assets are\nheld and operations are conducted by P3 LLC and its subsidiaries, and the Company’s only assets are equity interests in P3 LLC.\nBusiness Combinations\nThe Business Combinations were effected pursuant to (1) an agreement and plan of merger, dated as of May 25, 2021 (as amended, the “Merger Agreement”), by and\namong Foresight, P3 Health Group Holdings and Merger Sub, and (2) the transaction and combination agreement, dated as of May 25, 2021 (as amended, the “Transaction and\nCombination Agreement”), by and among Foresight, the Merger Corps, the Blockers, and the Blocker sellers (each term as defined in the Transaction and Combination\nAgreement), pursuant to which, among other things, P3 Health Group Holdings merged with and into Merger Sub (the “P3 Merger”), with Merger Sub as the surviving\ncompany, which was renamed P3 LLC, and the Merger Corps merged with and into the Blockers, with the Blockers as the surviving entities and wholly owned subsidiaries of\nForesight (collectively, the “Business Combinations”).\nOverview\nP3 is a patient-centered and physician-led population health management company. We strive to offer superior care to those patients that we serve. Founded and led by\nphysicians, P3 is a team of doctors, clinicians and healthcare professionals with a shared passion for delivering value-based care (“VBC”). We believe our leadership team’s\nmore than 20 years of experience in VBC and population health management, combined with our strong payor relationships, large community-based physician networks and\ncustom technology platform uniquely position us to empower physicians, align incentives for healthcare providers and payors and improve the clinical outcomes for the\ncommunities we serve.\nAs fellow healthcare professionals, we understand the challenges physicians face when providing VBC. We have leveraged that expertise to build our “P3 Care\nModel.” The key attributes that differentiate P3 include: 1) patient centricity, 2) physician leadership, and 3) our delegated/integrated care model. Tactically, we typically\nleverage the community’s existing healthcare infrastructure to build a strong network of local physicians. We primarily contract with local physicians to enter the P3 network\nusing an affiliate model, rather than building and staffing our own clinics or acquiring individual practices. By doing so, we preserve the existing patient-physician relationship,\nallow physicians to maintain their independence and have a built-in patient panel on Day 1. We then align physician incentives and provide our team tools and technology to\nsupport our physician partners in a VBC system and care for the patients we have the honor and privilege to serve together. These affiliated physicians provided care to\napproximately 99% of our primary care physicians as of December 31, 2023. We augment these affiliate partnerships with employed Primary Care Physicians (“PCPs,”), P3\noperated clinics, and wellness centers. Furthermore, unlike our peers, we offer a broad delegated care model in which we take on the responsibility to reshape the local\nhealthcare market to provide high quality care for patients throughout the care continuum.\nWe operate in the $944 billion Medicare market, which covers approximately 66 million eligible lives as of October 2023. Our core focus is the MA market, which\nmakes up approximately 51% of the overall Medicare market, or nearly 31 million Medicare eligible lives in 2023. Medicare beneficiaries may enroll in an MA plan, under\nwhich payors contract with the CMS to provide a defined range of healthcare services that are comparable to Medicare fee-for-service (“FFS”), which is also referred to as\n“traditional Medicare.”\nIn MA, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”) pays health plans a monthly sum per member to manage all health expenses of a participating\nmember. Our platform focuses on Medicare Advantage and manages the needs of our members through subscription-like per-member-per-month (“PMPM”) arrangements with\nhealth plans or payors. From there, the economics of our care model are further impacted by our ability to drive total cost of care savings\nP3 Health Partners Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 4\nTable of Contents\nand bend the cost curve. Our model allows us to “do well” while also “doing good.” We contract with health plans to provide capitated care services with respect to certain of\ntheir MA members. Our contracts with four health plans to provide capitated care services for their members collectively accounted for approximately 60% and 67% of our\ncapitated revenue for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nThe U.S. healthcare system is ripe for change and disruption, and we believe that the P3 Care Model is distinctly situated to address several pain points, including:\n• Unsustainable and rising healthcare costs. The United States spent $4.5 trillion, representing 17.3% of GDP, on healthcare in 2022. National health expenditures\nare projected to grow 5.4% per year from 2022 to 2031, according to CMS. While representing only 17% of the United States population, the 65 and older age group\naccounted for 21% of all healthcare spending in 2022, with an average spend of approximately $13,000 per person. This segment is growing faster than the rest of\nthe population and is projected to reach 22% of the United States population by 2050. Healthcare expenditures are particularly concentrated in this age group in\nlarge part due to the high rate of chronic conditions. Rising healthcare costs disproportionately impact low- and middle-income seniors, who often embrace\nMedicare Advantage plans. This is our area of focus given we believe we can have the greatest clinical and financial impact on this population. Improved care\nmanagement of seniors is critical to reducing the rapid growth in U.S. healthcare spending.\n• Inadequate access to primary care and PCP shortages. The current FFS reimbursement model leads to relatively lower pay for PCPs as well as fewer quality\ntouchpoints with patients. We believe that factors like these directly contribute to fewer physicians considering entering, or staying in, the field of primary care.\n• Sub-optimal quality of care and sub-optimal clinical outcomes.\n• PCP burnout and dissatisfaction. The traditional FFS model values quantity over quality, which has been shown to lead to physician burnout and jeopardizes the\nlong-term sustainability of the independent primary care business model. According to a 2023 Physicians Foundation report, six in 10 physicians show signs of\nburnout, compared to four in 10 in 2018. In addition, as average reimbursement rates decline in an FFS model, physicians would need to continually increase the\nnumber of patients seen to sustain their practice.\n• Difficulty in maintaining PCP independence. Small physician practices deliver the majority of care in the U.S.—with 51.8% of physicians working in practices with\n10 or fewer physicians, per a 2023 American Medical Association report. That report also found that 46.7% of PCPs worked in a practice that was wholly owned by\nphysicians (e.g., private practice) representing a continued decline since 2020 (49.1%), the first year in which the share of physicians in private practice became a\nminority. In our experience, physicians who have chosen to work at smaller practices throughout their careers tend to do so because they value their independence.\nGiven the increasingly significant financial and administrative burdens, these physicians are generally unable to maintain independence while effectively\ntransitioning to a VBC model. We believe that allowing them to maintain their independence increases their engagement with population health management\npractices, which is key to transforming the healthcare system.\n• Limited collaboration between PCPs and payors. Over the years, we have seen that payors recognize the importance of PCPs in directing and managing total cost of\ncare. Payors have attempted to increase their proximity to primary care physicians through acquisitions and investments in care delivery services and technologies.\nHowever, a payor’s ability to impact physician workflows continues to be structurally limited by the multi-payor nature of most physician practices. This makes it\nchallenging for any single payor to achieve the level of integration we believe is needed to improve clinical engagement and effectively manage healthcare costs.\nWe believe this creates significant opportunity for a platform to partner directly and create alignment between payors and physicians.\nWe aim to overcome these hurdles with a differentiated model that we believe is an attractive option for patients, physicians and payors. P3 honors the existing social\nand moral contract between patients and their PCPs, partnering with local physicians using an affiliate model. We risk-stratify our patients to help our physician partners\nprioritize care for those who need it the most. We also provide care teams to serve as an extension of the physician’s practice. These teams provide wraparound services to our\npatients and collaborate with the patients’ caregivers to ensure patients have the tools to successfully navigate their healthcare journey across the care continuum. We have made\nsignificant investments in technology to customize patient care management plans. Taken as a whole, our P3 Care Model helps facilitate enhanced\nP3 Health Partners Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 5\nTable of Contents\nclinical outcomes for our key stakeholders, resulting in a 98% physician retention rate from 2018 through December 31, 2023.\nWe are led by one of the most experienced management teams in population health. Our executive team has a track record of more than 20 years in the healthcare\nindustry. These years of experience have fostered strong relationships in the managed care, physician and payor segments. This is paired with a deep understanding of\nphysicians, patients, technology, payments and branding. Lastly, the core of our care model is based on their collective years of experience in medical cost management. We\nbelieve these critical facets position our team to successfully navigate and enable the shift to patient-centric, physician-led, VBC.\nWe Deliver VBC to the Fastest Growing Market in Healthcare\nA need for a new payment structure and an aging U.S. population\nHistorically, healthcare in the U.S. has been focused on reacting to acute events, which resulted in the development of the FFS payment model. The FFS model\nunintentionally incentivizes the volume of patients and services performed rather than the quality of services and care—resulting in a deprioritization of preventative services\nand overall health of the patient. Beyond sub-optimal clinical outcomes, FFS results in significant healthcare spend. As 10,000 seniors age into Medicare each day and\nprevalence of chronic conditions increases, the need for lower healthcare spend leads the push towards VBC and additional offerings such as Medicare Advantage.\nVBC and Medicare Advantage\nMedicare Advantage serves as an alternative to traditional Medicare. Medicare Advantage is an integrated plan that includes both Part A and Part B coverage. Most\nMedicare Advantage plans also offer Part D, vision, hearing, dental and other benefits. Typically, the out-of-pocket costs are lower for Medicare Advantage plans than\ntraditional Medicare, but patients are limited to seeing physicians within the plan’s network and some coverage of certain specialty services may require PCPs’ referrals and\nplan authorizations.\nMedicare Advantage has been well received since it was introduced, with penetration among Medicare beneficiaries increasing from 19% in 2007 to 51% in 2023 and\nis projected to increase to 62% by 2033. This trend reflects the understanding that Medicare Advantage plans are financially and clinically valuable to Medicare eligible\npatients.\nOur Market Opportunity\nWe believe there is significant white space opportunity. As of December 31, 2023, we have contracted with 2,750 primary care physicians. This represents less than\n1% of the total number of PCPs in the U.S. of approximately 520,000. The industry is primed for a platform like ours, which allows physicians to remain independent while\naccessing financial resources and infrastructure to support a VBC model.\nWe believe our total addressable market is represented by the approximately 66 million Americans (approximately 17% of the total population) who were enrolled in\neither traditional Medicare or Medicare Advantage nationally in 2023, which represented $944 billion of annual spend. Within this, we believe our core addressable market to\nbe the Medicare Advantage market, specifically within moderate-to-highly populated Medicare Advantage eligible dense counties, which we define as having greater than\n10,000 Medicare eligible lives. By multiplying these approximately 31 million Medicare Advantage members by an average $1,000 per member per month spend, we estimate\nthis represents a core addressable market size of over $300 billion.\nThe P3 Care Model\nPatient-Centric\nPatient wellness, not sickness. The VBC model rewards superior clinical outcomes and value delivered to the patient. With this in mind, we built our model to\nconsider the whole patient rather than individual illnesses as they arise. We work with our physician partners to develop a holistic view of a patient’s health over time to\nunderstand the most effective methods to empower their patients to actively participate in and better manage their health (e.g., medication adherence, complete understanding of\npotential impediments to receiving care).\nP3 Health Partners Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 6\nTable of Contents\nRobust care teams. We staff dedicated care managers and care navigators to help ensure end-to-end patient care across the full continuum. Care navigators are\nresponsible for day-to-day patient care (e.g., scheduling appointments, assisting with check-ins, etc.). Care managers, on the other hand, tend to have more medical\nresponsibilities (e.g., reviewing patient charts, coordinating care with PCPs, ensuring appropriate documentation, etc.) and serve as a communication point across care teams.\nTogether, they complement our network of physicians and enable the highest quality of care for our patients—ensuring they are being seen at the right time by the appropriate\nphysician and all corresponding documentation and communication has been streamlined.\nPersonalized care. Using our proprietary technology platform for integrated data reporting, physicians can stratify their patient panels based on risk. Identifying\npatients who are high risk (or rising risk) helps prioritize those patients who may need to be seen more often or require additional resources to improve their health.\nAdditionally, our tailored tech suite provides our physician partners with detailed insights to understand what is driving individual patient clinical outcomes and medical costs.\nLeveraging this data, we then collaborate with physicians to build individualized, longitudinal care plans, catered to the needs of individual patients.\nPhysician-Led\nCollaborative and supportive partnerships. As former physicians, we have a deep understanding of the way in which physicians are trained. In our experience, most\nphysicians not only understand the value of a VBC model, but also want to provide their patients with the highest quality care. However, the way in which most physicians\ntoday were trained caters to an FFS model. To support the VBC model, we provide training to physicians on best clinical practices based on nationally recognized care\nguidelines. As a result, we have seen physicians deliver cost saving, quality healthcare. Unlike some of our peers, we typically enter markets with our affiliate physician model\nand contract directly with physician groups or independent physicians to enter the P3 network rather than primarily building and staffing our own clinics or acquiring physician\npractices. By doing so, we preserve the existing patient-physician relationship and create a built-in patient panel on Day 1. Affiliate physicians retain their independence, while\ngaining access to P3’s teams, tools and technologies that are key to success in a VBC model. P3’s care teams become an extension of each physician’s office and support our\ncollective patients to navigate the health care system, collaborate with caregivers, and enable a successful health care journey. All P3 affiliated physicians must pass an annual\ncredentialing process and maintain compliance with all regulatory standards.\nAligned incentives. Our model properly aligns physicians’ incentives with clinical outcomes, designed so that patients receive the optimal care they deserve. To do\nthis, we offer several types of incentive-based payments to our affiliated physicians. First, as physicians join our network, we continue to pay them on an FFS basis per visit, or\nstructure a contract to offer a monthly, fixed, capitated payment for each patient paneled to their practice. Additionally, we provide quality incentive payments to our physician\npartners as they close quality gaps in care, enable patient access and improve documentation. Finally, as improved clinical outcomes result in reduced medical costs, we share\nthe savings between P3 and our physician partners. These contracts were built with the physician in mind, which is reflected in our results—a 98% physician retention rate from\n2018 through December 31, 2023. Aligning physician incentives with performance on growth, quality, patient disease documentation, and medical expense creates better\neconomics within their practices.\nBroad Delegated Care Model\nReshaping local healthcare. Our more than 20 years of experience in the population health management space has allowed us to build the capabilities to better control\nand manage the delivery of services across the full care continuum. Our team has the ability to take on additional services from our payor partners, including networking,\ncredentialing, utilization management and claims processing. In order to take on these functions, our teams must pass regular delegation audits by CMS as well as our payor\npartners. By assuming responsibility for the patient’s entire care experience, we can tailor care provision and coordination to their individual needs. We take on this added\nburden, as it allows us to reshape the local healthcare market and accelerate the shift from a FFS model to a VBC model.\nDelegated services. Through delegation, we can build local networks of physicians and specialists to meet the needs of our patients. By creating a captive network, we\nensure that our network of physicians and specialists are properly educated on best clinical practices based on national recognized care guidelines. Furthermore, delegation\nallows us to align incentives across the full continuum, not just the PCP office. With additional tools like utilization management, we ensure that quality care is delivered in the\nappropriate care setting. To help with care delivery effectiveness, we perform concurrent reviews to manage acute and post-acute hospitals for length of stay and\nappropriateness. Finally, by taking on\nP3 Health Partners Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 7\nTable of Contents\nresponsibility for processing and paying claims, we are able to ensure the appropriate payment for the appropriate care. Ownership over claims creates value and helps to\naccelerate the reduction of unnecessary medical costs.\nP3 Technology/Health Hub\nThe backbone of our P3 Care Model is our proprietary technology platform—P3 Technology/Health Hub—which enables physicians, care teams, patients and their\nfamily members to engage in the care journey. Our platform was purposefully built as a data and technology-enabled care ecosystem that drives preventive rather than reactive\ncare.\nP3 Technology/Health Hub integrates clinical and claims data from more than 250 disparate data points each month from payors, outpatient and inpatient facilities and\nother ancillary care settings. By using P3 Technology/Health Hub at the time of patient onboarding, we are able to assign patient risk levels using our proprietary risk\nstratification tool that leverages multiple parameters to prioritize patients who require additional resources. We continually collect data on patients from multiple sources so our\ncare teams can proactively and dynamically deliver individualized care based on changes to a patient’s health profile. For example, within approximately 12 hours of a\nhospitalization—even out of state—our physician partners are notified and alerted to the patient’s clinical status. Our care managers also monitor patient care and provide\nphysicians with insights to enable additional care across settings and locations. These factors create a positive feedback loop, whereby our technology accelerates clinical\noutcomes, improving strong performance, and further growing our business.\nThe P3 Technology/Health Hub is built on multiple products, including:\nProvider Portal. This physician-facing product enables our physician partners to understand, care for and monitor their patients. Physicians can access a risk stratified\npatient list based on historical diagnoses, suspect diagnoses, ER visits, chronic comorbidities and socio-economic factors, among others. By using this, P3 is able to present\nphysicians with care opportunities, Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set (“HEDIS®”) gaps in care and drug substitution opportunities, which directly translate\ninto stronger cost management. Analyzing the risk-stratified patient-level data helps physicians and office staff strategize patient scheduling to optimize their resources and\nwork hours to meet the healthcare needs of the patients that need the most care. Provider Portal also generates additional possible conditions that the physicians can screen for\nduring patient visits. This exercise gives physicians a longitudinal view of patients’ health and any potential medical conditions they may have developed since their last annual\nwellness visit. This represents an important opportunity for physicians to address the conditions which otherwise may have been missed during initial health reviews of the\npatient.\nProvider Portal is also used by our internal certified coders to review and reconcile claims data with electronic medical record and charts data. This provides P3 an\nopportunity to capture dropped or missed codes documented in the patient’s medical record that were not properly converted during the initial submission of claims by our\nphysician partner offices. This practice also ensures that the diagnosis data that is submitted to health plans is validated with appropriate supporting documentation for seamless\nacceptance by CMS for year-over-year risk calculation for our patients.\nP3 Care Connect. P3 Care Connect is a comprehensive management tool used by P3 care management, utilization management and concurrent review teams. P3 Care\nConnect enables P3 care managers to provide concierge and individualized care for specific, high-risk and special needs populations. This capability allows our platform and its\nconstituents to deliver highly impactful clinical programs aimed to reduce cost and improve clinical outcomes while optimizing efficiency. Care orchestration through a\ncombination of program management, cohort building, care plan and assessment builders help our care managers build more intelligent care plans. P3 Care Connect allows our\ncare and medical management teams to process prior authorizations, track P3 patient referrals within our network throughout the care continuum and manage a concurrent\nreview for inpatient services through an automated platform that improves efficiency and auditability of existing business workflows. This tool also enables a streamlined\ncommunication between P3 and primary care physicians, specialists and other ancillary care physicians who are involved in the care of our patients.\nAnalytic Management Tools. Analytic Management Tools is a business intelligence platform that converts data into visualizations and real-time metrics to empower\ndecision making at every level across the organization. It helps our administrative teams deliver a data driven approach for a better, more engaged physician experience and act\nas a support system to their practices.\nThis tool combines data management with data analysis to evaluate and transform complex data sets into meaningful, actionable information used to support effective\nstrategic, tactical and operational insights. It also provides\nP3 Health Partners Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 8\nTable of Contents\ncomprehensive information that drives performance to improve clinical outcomes and quality of care and creates physician profiles and cost analysis to improve healthcare\nmanagement. With an embedded Risk Adjustment engine, it allows the organization to determine the burden of illness for our patients while providing stratification clinical data\nto physicians.\nOur Value Proposition\nWe believe that our P3 Care Model is effective, differentiated and represents a ‘win’ for all key stakeholders.\nPatients\nOur P3 Care Model of partnering with local physicians allows patients to maintain their relationship with their existing physicians. We believe this is key to delivering\nstronger clinical outcomes and support for our patients. Our model deploys care teams for each individual patient to assist in the continuity and coordination of care. This\nsupport allows for seamless interactions across multiple physicians and various care settings. Connectivity reduces the risk of unnecessary progression of disease or downstream\ncare, which is evident in our results.\nPhysicians\nWe believe our model supports and empowers physicians, care teams, and practices in their transition from a traditional FFS model to a VBC model. Importantly, we\nenable physicians to implement VBC protocols while maintaining their independence. Additionally, our P3 Care Model leverages an innovative technology suite that provides\nphysicians with the tools to drive better clinical outcomes. Enabling physicians to own much of this process also allows for improved personal satisfaction on their journey to\nVBC, resulting in our 98% physician retention rate from 2018 through December 31, 2023 on our network of approximately 2,750 physicians as of December 31, 2023.\nPayors\nOur model is differentiated in our ability to also partner directly with payors. We have a proven ability to manage medical costs and improve clinical outcomes of our\nlives under management on behalf of our payor partners. This is evidenced by the receipt of inbound partnership requests from payors to improve growth, quality and\nprofitability in their markets. We believe there is a significant and growing demand from payors as they capitate risk and transition to VBC.\nCompetitive Differentiation\nBroad delegated care model\nUnder our at-risk model, we are financially responsible for the medical costs associated with our attributed patients across the care continuum. Our broad delegated\ncare model enables us to better manage and control critical aspects of care beyond the PCP office. By taking on additional, delegated services from our payor partners, including\nnetworking, credentialing, utilization management and claims processing, we can better control care delivery, align incentives across the care continuum, and ensure that quality\ncare is delivered and paid for in the appropriate care setting.\nRapidly scalable, capital efficient model\nWe have demonstrated the rapid scalability of our model with organic average annual revenue growth of 84% from 2018 to 2023. This is in part due to the capital\nefficiency of our affiliate model and in part due to our ability to grow through multiple channels. Because we primarily partner with physicians and physician groups or payors,\nwe do not need to build brick and mortar clinics or acquire practices to enter a new market; therefore, we require less upfront capital to enter a market and can take the time to\nestablish a market presence and build patient recognition and familiarity as well as other relationships before investing significant funds. While many of our competitors employ\nthe buy / build or joint-venture partnership model, our approach has a minimal “ramp-up” period and thus a faster expected near-term path to profitability. Furthermore, our\nability to effectively leverage existing physician bases across the U.S. accelerates our speed to scale.\nHighly experienced management team\nOur management team has extensive experience in population health management, the MA space, and leading the transition to VBC throughout the United States.\nP3 Health Partners Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 9\nTable of Contents\nOur executive team has worked hard to build cultural alignment around our vision to transform healthcare. Our vision and values are designed to permeate throughout\nour organization and to be embraced by our employees and partners. Furthermore, our executive team has been thoughtful and strategic about fostering a culture of mentorship\nto pass on their extensive industry knowledge to future P3 leaders.\nVirtuous growth cycle\nOur model incentivizes all constituencies across the care spectrum to work together by aligning incentives directly based on growth, care quality, patient disease\ndocumentation, and medical expense improvements. Our model creates better physician economics within their practices. When all constituencies benefit, we all capture the\nmeaningful value generated by the P3 Care Model by improving clinical outcomes and decreasing the cost of care. Our ability to drive savings allows us to continuously\ninnovate, support our physician partners and engage patients on the P3 platform.\nOur Growth Strategy\nWe intend to utilize our competitive strengths and capitalize on favorable industry trends to increase our footprint within our current markets and across new states and\ncounties to ultimately increase the number of physicians and patients we serve.\nAdditional membership through current relationships. Recent data suggests that the number of Medicare-eligible patients and Medicare Advantage penetration rates\nwill continue to increase in the upcoming years. We believe that this trend will translate into increased coverage by our current payor partners in our existing markets. As these\nnew patients enroll in Medicare Advantage through our payors, they become attributed to our platform with little incremental cost to us.\nFurthermore, we believe our physician partners will also increase their patient coverage as the number of available Medicare Advantage lives increases. We expect to\nbe favorably positioned to benefit from this source of growth, bolstered by the sticky physician-patient relationship and our platform’s ability to assist our physician partners in\nmore effectively managing healthcare quality, patient experience and cost.\nExpansion in current markets. Based on our ability to provide a compelling value proposition for physicians looking to shift to value-based care while remaining\nindependent, we believe there is significant opportunity to grow lives in our current markets in Arizona, California, Florida, Nevada, and Oregon. Additionally, we have the\nopportunity to expand our existing membership base through our payor partners’ presence in our current markets.\nExpansion into adjacent markets. Once we establish a presence in a geography, we are then able to leverage our regional infrastructure and our relationships with\npayors as we expand into adjacent geographies. We are more easily able to deploy this ‘land and expand’ strategy once we have established the P3 brand in a particular market.\nExpansion into new markets. We are constantly evaluating our pipeline of opportunities to continue growing our membership. Based on our analysis and experience\nto date, we have identified a list of target markets that we believe are ideal candidates for the P3 Care Model, whether across physicians or payors. We can facilitate this growth\nthrough new payor contracts, new network partnerships via joint ventures or expanding into a new market as part of an existing payor contract. We target entering three to five\nnew markets each year based on this proven strategy.\nExecute on accretive acquisitions. While our growth to date has been organic, we believe there are additional robust opportunities to acquire additional lives across\nboth physicians and payors.\nCompetition\nThe healthcare industry is highly competitive and fragmented. Our primary competition remains the status quo, FFS environment that much of the healthcare system\noperates in today. We currently face competition in every aspect of our business, including in offering a favorable reimbursement structure for existing physician partners and\nattracting payors and physician partners who are not contracted with us, from a range of large- and medium-sized local and national companies that provide care under a variety\nof models that could attract patients, providers and payors. Our primary competitors in the population health management space include Oak Street Health, Cano Health and\nagilon health, in addition to numerous local provider networks, hospitals and health systems. Moreover, large, well-financed payors have in some cases developed their own\nmanaged care services tools and may provide these services to their physicians and patients at discounted prices or may seek to expand their relationships with additional\ncompeting physicians or physician\nP3 Health Partners Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 10\nTable of Contents\nnetworks. Other organizations may also seek to apply specialized services or programs, including providing data analytics or disease-based programs, designed to enable\nphysicians or payors to operate successfully under VBC arrangements. Our competitors typically vary by geography, and we may also encounter competition in the future from\nother new entrants. Our growth strategy and our business could be adversely affected if we are not able to continue to access existing geographies, successfully expand into new\ngeographies or maintain or establish new relationships with payors and physician partners.\nSee the section titled “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and Industry—We operate in a competitive industry, and if we are not able to compete effectively,\nour business, financial condition and results of operations will be harmed.”\nThe principal competitive factors in our business include the nature and caliber of relationships with physicians; patient healthcare quality, outcomes and cost; the\nstrength of relationships with payors; the quality of the physician experience; local geography leadership position; and the strength of the underlying economic model. We\nbelieve our platform, partnership and network model enables us to compete favorably.\nIntellectual Property\nWe rely on a combination of trademark laws in the U.S. as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our trade secrets, including\nproprietary technology, databases and our brand.\nWe have a federal trademark registration application for “P3 Health Partners” in the U.S. We also have filed other applications to protect names and marks that are\nmeaningful to our business in the U.S. across various states and local jurisdictions, including for the use of the local brand created within each of our geographies, and will\npursue additional trademark registrations to the extent we believe it would be beneficial and cost-effective.\nWe are the controller of a variety of registered domain names that include “p3hp” and similar variations.\nWe have developed proprietary technology and processes that support our operational programs and clinical insights, including our P3 Technology/Health Hub, which\nis a proprietary system that aids in the aggregation and analysis of third-party data we collect. Our internally developed technology is continuously refined to support the needs\nof our platform and partners. Although we do not currently hold a patent for P3 Technology/Health Hub, we have filed provisional patent applications relating to the P3\nTechnology/Health Hub, and we continue to regularly assess the most appropriate methods of protecting our intellectual property and may decide to pursue available protections\nin the future.\nWe maintain our intellectual property and confidential business information in a number of ways. For instance, we have a policy of requiring all employees and\nconsultants to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of an employment or consulting relationship with us. Our employee agreements also require relevant\nemployees to assign to us all rights to any inventions made or conceived during their employment with us in accordance with applicable law. In addition, we have a policy of\nrequiring individuals and entities with which we discuss potential business relationships to sign non-disclosure agreements. Lastly, our contracts with physicians include\nconfidentiality and non-disclosure provisions.\nWe may be unable to obtain, maintain and enforce our intellectual property rights, and assertions by third parties that we violate their intellectual property rights could\nhave a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nHuman Capital\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had approximately 400 full-time employees. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good. None of our employees are\ncurrently represented by a labor union or party to a collective bargaining agreement.\nOur human capital resources objectives include sourcing, recruiting, developing, retaining, rewarding, recognizing and integrating our existing and prospective\nemployees. We recognize that attracting, motivating and retaining skilled and purpose-driven talent from all backgrounds at all levels is vital to continuing our success. By\nimproving employee retention and engagement, we also improve our ability to protect the long-term interests of our stakeholders and stockholders. We invest in our employees\nthrough what we consider to be high-quality benefits, various health and wellness initiatives, and\nP3 Health Partners Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 11\nTable of Contents\nsocial events that bring our employees together to support the communities in which we live and work. We believe we offer competitive compensation packages and work to\nensure fairness in internal compensation practices.\nPeople join P3 because of our mission: to ensure providers and their patients get the healthcare they deserve. Together with our employees and physician partners, we\nhave defined our core values as:\n• People: Our attitude is respecting and valuing everyone. Our community is strong and safe. We are “family” and we take care of each other with the same intensity\nas we take care of our patients.\n• Passion: Our heart is our patients. Our soul is our clinicians. Our strength is our people and culture.\n• Purpose: Our core is fixing health care. Our mindset is disciplined purposeful growth.\nOur human capital efforts are supported by our dedicated human resources team. This team supports the business in identifying and recruiting top talent, supporting the\nonboarding of new hires through an employee orientation program, providing a structured approach to performance management that allows leaders and employees to\ncollaborate to set organizational goals, chart plans, and assign targets such that it becomes a systematic process to achieving goals and objectives and having productive\nconversations about performance outcomes and career development. Our talent management framework is designed to help us meet the human capital and business needs within\nthe organization. From identification of critical roles to succession planning and retention management practices, the team provides resources and tools, and leads the processes\nand experiences to help us successfully execute on our talent management strategy.\nOur efforts to promote a positive employee experience and foster an inclusive culture are further supported and enhanced by local and national in-person and virtual\nevents, including town halls, in-office celebrations and employee activity committees. We have also developed a taskforce that seeks to drive diversity and inclusion efforts,\nincluding employee focus groups to encourage participation across the organization.\nGovernment Regulation\nRegulatory Licensing and Certification\nMany states, including Florida, require regulatory approval, including licensure and certification, before establishing certain types of clinics offering certain\nprofessional and ancillary services, including the services P3 offers. The operations of the P3 owned and managed clinics are subject to extensive federal, state and local\nregulation relating to, among other things, the adequacy of medical care, equipment, personnel, operating policies and procedures, and proof of financial ability to operate. Our\nability to operate profitably will depend in part on the ability of P3 owned and managed clinics and its providers to obtain and maintain all necessary licenses and other\napprovals, and maintain updates to their enrollment in the Medicare and Medicaid programs, including the addition of new clinic locations, providers and other enrollment\ninformation. In addition, certain ancillary services such as the provision of diagnostic laboratory testing require additional state and federal licensure and regulatory oversight,\nincluding oversight by CMS, under Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (“CLIA”) which requires all clinical laboratories to meet certain quality assurance,\nquality control and personnel standards, and comparable state laboratory licensing authorities. Standards for testing under CLIA are based on the complexity of the tests\nperformed by the laboratory, with tests classified as “high complexity,” “moderate complexity,” or “waived.” P3 owned and managed clinics hold CLIA Certificates of Waiver\nand perform certain CLIA-waived tests, which subjects such clinics to certain CLIA requirements. Sanctions for failure to comply with applicable state and federal licensing,\ncertification and other regulatory requirements include suspension, revocation or limitation of the applicable authorization, significant fines and penalties and/or an inability to\nreceive reimbursement from government healthcare programs and other third-party payors.\nWith respect to P3’s providers participating in its network, P3 providers must meet minimum requirements to apply for participation or continued participation with P3\nthrough a credentialing process, including, without limitation, having a valid, current medical license and Drug Enforcement Administration registration, if required for the\nprovider’s scope of practice, the absence of any debarment, suspension, exclusion or other restriction from receiving payments from any government or other third-party payor\nprogram, and clearing National Practitioner Data Bank of any reports and/or disciplinary actions. P3’s credentialing program is designed to meet CMS and the National\nCommittee for Quality Assurance (“NCQA”) credentialing requirements as well as applicable federal and state laws. P3’s credentialing committee is comprised of a group of\nmultispecialty providers with responsibilities for thoroughly reviewing each P3 provider’s qualifications and credentials. Providers are generally recredentialed every three\nyears or more often if necessary, which is\nP3 Health Partners Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 12\nTable of Contents\nconsistent with industry guidelines. In addition, network providers are required under their participating provider agreements with P3 to have established an ongoing quality\nassurance program. Moreover, P3’s contracts may allow P3 to withhold compensation from time to time based upon the providers meeting certain quality metrics, including\nHEDIS quality measures and care coordination metrics.\nState Corporate Practice of Medicine and Fee-Splitting Laws\nOur arrangements with our affiliated professional entities and other physician partners are subject to various state laws, commonly referred to as corporate practice of\nmedicine and fee-splitting laws, which are intended to prevent unlicensed persons from interfering with or influencing the physician’s professional judgment, and prohibiting\nthe sharing of professional service fees with non-professional or business interests. These laws vary from state to state, including those where the Company does business, and\nare subject to broad interpretation and enforcement by state regulators. For example, the corporate practice of medicine prohibition in Nevada has only been established through\nattorney general opinions and there is no statutory or regulatory fee-splitting prohibition in the state. Arizona’s corporate practice of medicine was established under older case\nlaw, and more recent legislation suggests that the prohibition may not be strictly enforced in the state. Oregon prohibits the corporate practice of medicine but has an exception\nfor professional corporations with majority physician ownership where a non-licensed person or entity may hold minority ownership interest in such professional corporation.\nFlorida does not prohibit the corporate practice of medicine but has professional fee-splitting laws, which prohibit the sharing of professional fees based on referrals for\nprofessional services.\nCalifornia’s corporate practice of medicine doctrine has been developed through statutes, case law and state attorney general opinions. The general prohibition on the\ncorporate practice of medicine arises out of the California Business and Professions Code, which has been enforced through case law and attorney general opinions. In\nCalifornia, physicians and certain licensed professionals cannot be employed by non-professional corporations, except under limited exceptions which do not apply to the\nCompany. Additionally, all clinical decisions and certain business or management decisions that result in control over a physician’s practice of medicine or a licensed\nprofessional’s clinical decisions must be made by a physician or licensed professional and not by an unlicensed person or entity. California also prohibits professional fee\nsplitting arrangements, but management fees based on a percentage of gross revenue or similar arrangement that is commensurate with fair market value of services provided by\nthe management company are generally permissible.\nWe believe we have structured our management services agreements with the our affiliated professional entities to comply with the corporate practice of medicine and\nfee-splitting laws of Nevada, and we expect to enter into similar agreements with affiliated professional entities in California and other states where we may operate in the\nfuture, where all clinical decisions and other business and management decisions that result in control over a physician’s practice of medicine or a licensed professional’s\nclinical decisions remain exclusively with the affiliated professional entities, their physician shareholders and the physicians and licensed professionals employed and contracted\nby such entities.\nA determination of non-compliance against us and/or our affiliated professional entities or other physician partners based on the reinterpretation of existing laws or\nadoption of new laws could lead to adverse judicial or administrative action, civil or criminal penalties, receipt of cease-and-desist orders from state regulators, loss of provider\nlicenses, and/or restructuring of these arrangements.\nHealthcare Fraud and Abuse Laws\nWe are subject to a number of federal and state healthcare regulatory laws that restrict certain business practices in the healthcare industry. These laws include, but are\nnot limited to, federal and state anti-kickback, false claims, self-referral and other healthcare fraud and abuse laws.\nThe federal Anti-Kickback Statute (“AKS”) prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration, directly or\nindirectly, in cash or kind, to induce or reward either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service, for which payment may\nbe made under federal and state healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent\nto violate it in order to have committed a violation.\nSeveral courts have interpreted the AKS’s intent requirement to mean that if any one purpose of an arrangement involving remuneration is to induce referrals of\nfederal healthcare covered business, the AKS has been violated.\nP3 Health Partners Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 13\nTable of Contents\nThe AKS includes statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors that protect certain arrangements. By way of example, the AKS safe harbor for value-based\narrangements and the safe harbor for arrangements between managed care organizations and downstream contractors both require, among other things, that the arrangement\ndoes not induce a person or entity to reduce or limit medically necessary items or services furnished to any patient. Failure to meet the requirements of an applicable AKS safe\nharbor, however, does not render an arrangement illegal. Rather, the government may evaluate such arrangements on a case-by-case basis, taking into account all facts and\ncircumstances, including the parties’ intent and the arrangement’s potential for abuse, and may be subject to greater scrutiny by enforcement agencies.\nThe Stark Law prohibits a physician who has a financial relationship, or who has an immediate family member who has a financial relationship, with entities\nproviding designated health services (“DHS”) from referring Medicare and Medicaid patients to such entities for the furnishing of DHS, unless an exception applies. The Stark\nLaw also prohibits the entity from billing for any such prohibited referral. Unlike the AKS, the Stark Law is violated if the financial arrangement does not meet an applicable\nexception, regardless of any intent by the parties to induce or reward referrals or the reasons for the financial relationship and the referral.\nThe federal False Claims Act (“FCA”) prohibits a person from knowingly presenting, or caused to be presented, a false or fraudulent request for payment from the\nfederal government, or from making a false statement or using a false record to have a claim approved. A claim includes “any request or demand” for money or property\npresented to the United States government. Moreover, the government may assert that a claim including items and services resulting from a violation of the AKS or the Stark\nLaw constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the civil FCA. Penalties for a violation of the FCA include fines for each false claim, plus up to three times the\namount of damages caused by each false claim. Private individuals also have the ability to bring actions under these false claims laws in the name of the government alleging\nfalse and fraudulent claims presented to or paid by the government (or other violations of the statutes) and to share in any amounts paid by the entity to the government in fines\nor settlement. Such suits, known as qui tam actions, are pervasive in the healthcare industry.\nFurther, the Civil Monetary Penalties Statute authorizes the imposition of civil monetary penalties, assessments and exclusion against an individual or entity based on a\nvariety of prohibited conduct, including, but not limited to offering remuneration to a federal health care program beneficiary that the individual or entity knows or should know\nis likely to influence the beneficiary to order or receive health care items or services from a particular provider. Moreover, in certain cases, providers who routinely waive\ncopayments and deductibles for Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries can also be held liable under the AKS and civil FCA. One of the statutory exceptions to the prohibition is\nnon-routine, unadvertised waivers of copayments or deductible amounts based on individualized determinations of financial need or exhaustion of reasonable collection efforts.\nThe U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) Office of Inspector General emphasizes, however, that this exception should only be used occasionally to address\nspecial financial needs of a particular patient. Although this prohibition applies only to federal healthcare program beneficiaries, the routine waivers of copayments and\ndeductibles offered to patients covered by commercial payors may implicate applicable state laws related to, among other things, unlawful schemes to defraud, excessive fees\nfor services, tortious interference with patient contracts and statutory or common law fraud.\nThe Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009\n(collectively, “HIPAA”), also established federal criminal statutes that prohibit, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to\ndefraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors, and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any\nmaterially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Similar to the AKS, a person or entity\ndoes not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation.\nSeveral states in which we operate have also adopted similar fraud and abuse laws as described above. The scope of these laws and the interpretations of them vary\nfrom state to state and are enforced by state courts and regulatory authorities, each with broad discretion. Some state fraud and abuse laws apply to items or services reimbursed\nby any payor, including patients and commercial insurers, not just those reimbursed by a federally funded healthcare program.\nViolation of any of these laws or any other governmental regulations that apply may result in significant penalties, including, without limitation, administrative civil\nand criminal penalties, damages, disgorgement, fines, additional reporting requirements and compliance oversight obligations, in the event that a corporate integrity agreement\nor other agreement is required to resolve allegations of noncompliance with these laws, the curtailment or restructuring of operations, exclusion from participation in\ngovernmental healthcare programs and/or individual imprisonment.\nP3 Health Partners Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 14\nTable of Contents\nHealthcare Reform\nIn the United States, there have been, and we expect there will continue to be, a number of legislative and regulatory changes to the healthcare system, many of which\nare intended to contain or reduce healthcare costs. By way of example, in the United States, the Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education\nReconciliation Act (collectively, the “ACA”), substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers. The ACA required, among other\nthings, CMS to establish a Medicare shared savings program that promotes accountability and coordination of care through the creation of Accountable Care Organizations\n(“ACOs”). The Medicare shared savings program allows for providers, physicians and other designated health care professionals and suppliers to form ACOs and voluntarily\nwork together to invest in infrastructure and redesign delivery processes to give coordinated high quality care to their Medicare patients, avoid unnecessary duplication of\nservices and prevent medical errors. ACOs that achieve quality performance standards established by CMS are eligible to share in a portion of the Medicare program’s cost\nsavings. ACO program methodologies and participation requirements are updated by CMS for each performance year and participants are expected to comply with such\nprogram requirements and required to report on performance after the close of the year. ACOs that fail to comply with such program requirements can face penalties or even\ntermination of their participation in the Medicare shared savings program.\nSince its enactment, there have been judicial, executive and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA. On June 17, 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court\ndismissed the most recent judicial challenge to the ACA without specifically ruling on the constitutionality of the ACA. Prior to the Supreme Court’s decision, President Biden\nissued an executive order initiating a special enrollment period from February 15, 2021 through August 15, 2021 for purposes of obtaining health insurance coverage through\nthe ACA marketplace. The executive order also instructed certain governmental agencies to review and reconsider their existing policies and rules that limit access to\nhealthcare.\nIn addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted. These changes included aggregate reductions to Medicare payments\nto providers, which went into effect on April 1, 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments to the statute, will remain in effect through the first six months of fiscal\nyear 2032, with the exception of a temporary suspension from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2022, unless additional Congressional action is taken. In addition, on January 2,\n2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was signed into law, which, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals, and\nincreased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years.\nAdditionally, the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation continues to test an array of value-based alternative payment models, including the Global and\nProfessional Direct Contracting Model to allow Direct Contracting Entities to negotiate directly with the government to manage traditional Medicare beneficiaries and share in\nthe savings and risks generated from managing such beneficiaries. Although we currently do not participate in these pilot payment models, we may choose to do so in the future.\nAdditional changes that may affect our business include the expansion of new programs such as Medicare payment for performance initiatives for physicians under the\nMedicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015, which first affected physician payment in 2019. At this time, it is unclear how the introduction of the Medicare quality\npayment program will impact overall physician reimbursement. In addition, there likely will continue to be regulatory proposals directed at containing or lowering the cost of\nhealthcare, as government healthcare programs and other third-party payors transition from FFS to value-based reimbursement models, which can include risk-sharing, bundled\npayment and other innovative approaches. It is possible that the federal or state governments will implement additional reductions, increases, or changes in reimbursement in the\nfuture under government programs that may adversely affect us or increase the cost of providing our services. The implementation of cost containment measures or other\nhealthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue or attain growth, any of which could have a material impact on our business.\nFurther, healthcare providers and industry participants are also subject to a growing number of requirements intended to promote the interoperability and exchange of\npatient health information. For example, on April 5, 2021, healthcare providers and certain other entities became subject to information blocking restrictions pursuant to the\nCures Act that prohibit practices that are likely to interfere with the access, exchange or use of electronic health information, except as required by law or specified by the HHS\nas a reasonable and necessary activity. Violations may result in penalties or other disincentives. It is unclear at this time what the costs of compliance with the new rules will be\nand what additional risks there may be to our business.\nP3 Health Partners Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 15\nTable of Contents\nData Privacy and Security Laws\nWe are subject to a number of federal and state laws and regulations that govern the collection, use, disclosure, and protection of health-related and other personal\ninformation, including health information privacy and security laws, data breach notification laws, and consumer protection laws and regulations.\nFailure to comply with these laws, where applicable, can result in the imposition of significant civil and/or criminal penalties and private litigation. Privacy and security\nlaws, regulations, and other obligations are constantly evolving, may conflict with each other to complicate compliance efforts, and can result in investigations, proceedings, or\nactions that lead to significant civil and/or criminal penalties and restrictions on data processing.\nFederal and State Insurance and Managed Care Laws\nRegulation of downstream risk-sharing arrangements, including, but not limited to, at-risk and other value-based arrangements, varies significantly from state to state.\nSome states require downstream entities and risk-bearing entities to obtain an insurance license, a certificate of authority, or an equivalent authorization, in order to participate\nin downstream risk-sharing arrangements with payors. In some states, statutes, regulations and/or formal guidance explicitly address whether and in what manner the state\nregulates the transfer of risk by a payor to a downstream entity. However, the majority of states do not explicitly address the issue, and in such states, regulators may nonetheless\ninterpret statutes and regulations to regulate such activity. If downstream risk-sharing arrangements are not regulated directly in a particular state, the state regulatory agency\nmay nonetheless require oversight by the licensed payor as the party to such a downstream risk-sharing arrangement. Such oversight is accomplished via contract and may\ninclude the imposition of reserve requirements, as well as reporting obligations. Further, state regulatory stances regarding downstream risk-sharing arrangements can change\nrapidly and codified provisions may not keep pace with evolving risk-sharing mechanisms and other new value-based reimbursement models. Certain of the states where we\ncurrently operate or may choose to operate in the future regulate the operations and financial condition of risk bearing organizations like us and our affiliated providers. By way\nof example, P3 recently acquired Medcore HP, a licensed health plan under the Knox Keene Act, which subjects the entity to certain capital requirements, licensing or\ncertification, governance controls, utilization review and grievance procedures, among others. While these regulations have not had a material impact on our business to date, as\nwe continue to expand, for example, through acquisitions or otherwise, these rules may require additional resources and capitalization and add complexity to our business.\nSeasonality\nOur business experiences some variability depending upon the time of the year. While new patients are attributed to our platform throughout the year, we experience\nthe largest portion of our at-risk membership growth during the first quarter. Operations in our new markets generally begin on January 1, at which time our payor partners\nattribute patients to our physician partners as our agreements with those payors in those geographies become effective. This coincides with the beginning of the Medicare\nprogram year, when plan enrollment selections made during the prior Annual Enrollment Period, which runs each year from October 15 to December 7, take effect.\nIn addition, in January of each year, CMS revises the risk adjustment factor for each patient based upon health conditions documented in the prior year, leading to an\noverall increase in per-member revenue. As the year progresses, our per-member revenue declines as new members join us typically with less complete or accurate\ndocumentation (and therefore lower risk-adjustment scores) and patient morbidity disproportionately impacts our higher-risk (and therefore greater revenue) members.\nMedical costs will vary seasonally depending on a number of factors, including the weather and the number of calendar working days in a given period. Certain\nillnesses, such as the influenza virus, are far more prevalent during colder months of the year, which will result in an increase in medical expenses during these time periods. We\ntherefore expect to see higher levels of per member medical costs in the first and fourth quarters.\nAvailable Information\nWe were incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware on August 20, 2020 under the name Foresight Acquisition Corp.

You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, together with all of the other information in\nthis Form 10-K. The occurrence of any of the events described below could harm our business, operating results, financial condition, liquidity, or prospects. In any such event,\nthe market price of our Class A common stock could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment. This Form 10-K also contains forward-looking statements that\ninvolve risks and uncertainties. See “Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.” Our actual results could differ materially and adversely from those\nanticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain important factors, including those set forth below.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Financial Results\nOur management has performed an analysis of our ability to continue as a going concern and has identified substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going\nconcern.\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had $36.3 million in cash available to fund future operations. Without additional funding, management believes that our existing cash\nresources are not sufficient to support planned operations for at least the next year from the issuance of the consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this Form\n10-K. Based on their assessment, our management has raised concerns about our ability to continue as a going concern. As substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a\ngoing concern exists, our ability to finance our operations through the sale and issuance of debt or equity securities or through bank or other financing could be impaired. Our\nability to continue as a going concern may depend on our ability to obtain additional capital. Management continues to explore raising additional capital through a combination\nof debt financing, other non-dilutive financing, and/or equity financing to supplement the Company’s capitalization and liquidity. Our ability to obtain financing on reasonable\nterms is subject to factors beyond the Company’s control, including general economic, political, and financial market conditions. The capital markets have in the past\nexperienced, are currently experiencing, and may in the future experience, periods of upheaval that could impact the availability and cost of equity and debt financing and there\ncan be no assurance that such financing will be available on terms commercially acceptable to the Company or at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital or generate cash\nflows necessary to fund our operations, we may not be able to compete successfully and may need to scale back, discontinue, or cease certain operations, which would harm our\nbusiness, financial condition, and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Operating History and Early Stage of Growth\nWe have a history of net losses. We expect to continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future and we may never achieve or maintain profitability.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, we incurred net losses of $186.4 million. As of December 31, 2023, we had an accumulated deficit of $367.3 million. We\nexpect to continue to incur net losses, comprehensive losses, and negative cash flows from operating activities in accordance with our operating plan. We expect that our\noperating expenses will continue to increase as we grow our business, build relationships with physician partners and payors, develop new services and comply with the\nrequirements associated with being a public company. Since our inception, we have financed our operations primarily through cash we obtained as a result of the Business\nCombinations, private placements of equity securities, issuances of promissory notes, payments received from various payors and borrowings under the Term Loan Facility (as\ndefined herein). We may not succeed in sufficiently increasing our revenue to offset these expenses. Consequently, we may not be able to achieve and maintain profitability for\nthe current or any future fiscal year. We may never be able to generate sufficient revenue to achieve or sustain profitability and our recent and historical growth should not be\nconsidered indicative of our future performance.\nP3 Health Partners Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 17\nTable of Contents\nWe may need to raise additional capital to fund our existing operations or develop and commercialize new services or expand our operations.\nWe may need to spend significant amounts to expand our existing operations, including expansion into new geographies, to improve our platform and to develop new\nservices. Based upon management’s assessment of the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern as described above in the risk factor entitled “Our management has\nperformed an analysis of our ability to continue as a going concern and has identified substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern,” we believe that our\nexisting cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash may not be sufficient to fund our operating and capital needs for at least the next 12 months. We maintain the majority of our\ncash, cash equivalents and restricted cash in accounts with major U.S. financial institutions, and our deposits at these institutions, at times, may exceed insured limits. Market\nconditions can impact the viability of these institutions. In the event of failure of any of the financial institutions where we maintain our cash, cash equivalents and restricted\ncash, there can be no assurance that we would be able to access uninsured funds in a timely manner or at all. Any inability to access or delay in accessing these funds could\nadversely affect our business and financial position.\nOur expectation regarding the sufficiency of funds is based on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could use our available capital resources sooner than\nwe currently expect. Until such time, if ever, as we can generate sufficient revenue, we may finance our cash needs through a combination of equity offerings and debt\nfinancings or other sources. In addition, we may seek additional capital due to favorable market conditions or strategic considerations, even if we believe that we have sufficient\nfunds for our current or future operating plans.\nOur present and future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including:\n• our ability to achieve revenue growth;\n• our ability to effectively manage medical expense amounts;\n• the cost of expanding our operations, including our geographic scope, and our offerings, including our marketing efforts;\n• our rate of progress in launching, commercializing and establishing adoption of our services; and\n• the effect of competing technological and market developments.\nTo the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, your ownership interest will be diluted, and the terms of these\nsecurities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect your rights as a securityholder. For example, in April 2023, we sold an aggregate of approximately\n69.2 million shares of our Class A common stock, warrants to purchase an aggregate of approximately 59.9 million shares of Class A common stock (the “Common Warrants”),\nand pre-funded warrants to purchase an aggregate of approximately 10.8 million shares of Class A common stock (the “Pre-Funded Warrants” and, together with the Common\nWarrants, the “Warrants”) in a private placement to certain purchasers, which included certain affiliated entities of Chicago Pacific Founders GP, L.P. (“CPF”) and our Chief\nMedical Officer and member of our board of directors. In addition, debt financing and preferred equity financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants\nlimiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends and these forms of financing may\nhave rights, preferences, and privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock. If we raise additional funds through collaborations, strategic alliances or marketing,\ndistribution or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may be required to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, intellectual property, or future revenue streams or\ngrant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. Furthermore, any capital raising efforts may divert our management from their day-to-day activities, which may\nadversely affect our ability to advance development activities. If we are unable to raise additional funds when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate\ndevelopment efforts.\nP3 Health Partners Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 18\nTable of Contents\nOur business and the markets in which we operate are new and rapidly evolving, which makes it difficult to evaluate our future prospects and the risks and challenges we\nmay encounter.\nOur business and the markets in which we operate are new and rapidly evolving which make it difficult to evaluate and assess the success of our business to date, our\nfuture prospects and the risks and challenges that we may encounter. These risks and challenges include our ability to:\n• attract new members and partner physicians to our platform and position our platform as a convenient and accepted way to access and deliver healthcare;\n• retain our current members, affiliated professional entities and other physician partners and encourage them to continue to utilize our platform and services;\n• gain market acceptance of our services and products with members and physicians and maintain and expand such relationships;\n• comply with existing and new laws and regulations applicable to our business and in our industry;\n• anticipate and respond to changes in Medicare reimbursement rates and the markets in which we operate;\n• react to challenges from existing and new competitors;\n• maintain and enhance our reputation and brand;\n• effectively manage our growth and business operations, including new geographies;\n• forecast our revenue, which includes reimbursements, and budget for, and manage, our expenses, including our medical expense amounts, and capital expenditures;\n• hire and retain talented individuals at all levels of our organization;\n• maintain and improve the infrastructure underlying our platform, including our data protection, intellectual property and cybersecurity; and\n• successfully update our platform and services, including expanding our services into different healthcare products and services, develop and update our software,\nofferings and services to benefit our members.\nIf we fail to understand fully or adequately address the challenges that we are currently encountering or that we may encounter in the future, including those challenges\ndescribed here and elsewhere in this “Risk Factors” section, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. If the risks and uncertainties\nthat we plan for when operating our business are incorrect or change, or if we fail to manage these risks successfully, our results of operations could differ materially from our\nexpectations and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur relatively limited operating history makes it difficult to evaluate our future prospects and the risks and challenges we may encounter.\nWe were established in 2017 and we are continuing to grow our marketing and management capabilities. Consequently, predictions about our future success or\nviability may not be as accurate as they could be if we had a longer operating history. If our growth strategy is not successful, we may not be able to continue to grow our\nrevenue or operations. Our relatively limited operating history, evolving business and rapid growth make it difficult to evaluate our future prospects and the risks and challenges\nwe may encounter, and we may not continue to grow at or near historical rates.\nIn addition, as a business with a limited operating history, we may encounter unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications, delays and other known and unknown\nchallenges. We are transitioning to a company capable of supporting commercialization, sales and marketing. We may not be successful in such a transition and, as a result, our\nbusiness may be adversely affected.\nP3 Health Partners Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 19\nTable of Contents\nWe may not be able to maintain compliance with our debt covenants in the future which could result in an event of default.\nOur Term Loan Facility (as defined herein) with CRG Partners (the “Lender”), the VGS Promissory Note and the VGS 2 Promissory Note (each as defined herein)\ncontain affirmative and negative covenants which, among other things, require us to maintain minimum liquidity and annual minimum revenue levels that increase over time\nand restrict P3 LLC’s ability and the ability of its subsidiaries from, among other things, incurring certain indebtedness and liens, and making certain restricted payments. If we\nbreach these or other financial covenants and fail to secure a waiver or forbearance from the lenders, such breach or failure could result in an event of default and accelerate the\nrepayment of the outstanding or the exercise of other rights or remedies that our lenders may have under applicable law. As of December 31, 2023, we were not in compliance\nwith its Term Loan Facility and VGS Promissory Note covenants related to issuance of the 2023 financial statements with an audit opinion free of a “going concern”\nqualification. The Term Loan Facility and VGS Promissory Note lenders have granted us a waiver of the covenant under the Term Loan Facility related to the existence of a\n“going concern” qualification in the audit opinion for our audited financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. We were in compliance with all other\ncovenants under the Term Loan Facility and VGS Promissory Note as of December 31, 2023; however, there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain compliance\nwith these covenants in the future or that the lenders under the Term Loan Facility, VGS Promissory Note or the lenders of any future indebtedness we may incur will grant any\nsuch waiver or forbearance in the future.\nWe may not recognize the anticipated benefits of recent and future acquisitions and any such acquisitions could disrupt our operations and have a material adverse effect\non our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe anticipated benefits of the Company’s Business Combinations, other acquisitions, and any future acquisitions may not be realized fully, or at all, and may take\nlonger to realize than expected. Anticipated benefits of any acquisition may be affected by, among other things, competition and our ability to grow and manage growth\nprofitably. Further, we may not be able to continue the operational success or successfully finance or integrate any businesses that we acquire. The integration of any acquisition\nmay divert management’s time and resources from our core business and disrupt our operations or may result in conflicts with our business. Any acquisition may not be\nsuccessful, may reduce our cash reserves, may negatively affect our earnings and financial performance and, to the extent financed with the proceeds of debt, may increase our\nindebtedness. We cannot ensure that any acquisition we make will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nA significant portion of our assets consists of other intangible assets, the value of which may be reduced if we determine that those assets are impaired.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the net carrying value of other intangible assets represented $666.7 million, or 77% of our total assets. Indefinite-lived intangible assets are\nevaluated for impairment annually, or more frequently if circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred. Definite-lived intangible assets totaling $666.0 million are\namortized over 10 years.\nDue to the decrease in the share price over the second and fourth quarters of 2022, the Company recorded a significant goodwill impairment charge of $1,315.0 million\nduring the year ended December 31, 2022. If future operating performance were to fall below current projections or if there are material changes to management’s assumptions,\nwe could be required to recognize additional non-cash charges to operating earnings for other intangible asset impairment, which could be significant.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nCOVID-19 has impacted, and may, along with future pandemics or epidemics, continue to impact, our operations and may materially and adversely affect our business and\nfinancial results.\nThere is continued uncertainty about the scope, duration, severity, trajectory, and lasting impact of COVID-19. We continue to monitor the impact of COVID-19 on\nour business. The extent to which COVID-19 or a new pandemic, epidemic, or outbreak of an infectious disease may directly or indirectly impact our operations and results of\noperations will depend on multiple factors, including, but not limited to the ultimate geographic spread of the disease, the duration and scope of the outbreak, the emergence of\nvariants, the availability and efficacy of vaccines, and government, social, business and other actions that are taken in response to the pandemic or outbreak. We may be unable\nto properly anticipate or prepare for these events and, as a result, our business may be materially adversely impacted.\nP3 Health Partners Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 20\nTable of Contents\nDue to COVID-19 or another pandemic or public health emergency, we have not been able to and in the future may not be able to document the health conditions of\nour members as completely as we have in the past. Medicare pays capitation using a “risk adjustment model,” which compensates providers based on the health status (acuity)\nof each individual member. Payers with higher acuity members receive more, and those with lower acuity members receive less. Medicare requires that a patient’s health issues\nbe documented annually regardless of the permanence of the underlying causes. Historically, this documentation was required to be completed during an in-person visit with a\npatient. As part of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (“CARES Act”), Medicare is now allowing documentation for conditions identified during video\nvisits with patients. However, given the disruption caused by COVID-19, it is unclear whether we will be able to document the health conditions of our members as\ncomprehensively as we did before COVID-19, which may adversely impact our revenue in future periods.\nDue to our recurring contracted revenue model, COVID-19 has not historically had a material impact on our revenue. Nearly 99% of our total revenue during the years\nended December 31, 2023 and 2022 is recurring, consisting of fixed per member per month capitation payments received from MA health plans. Because of the nature of\ncapitation arrangements, the full impact of the COVID-19 may not be fully reflected in our results of operations and overall financial condition until future periods.\nTo the extent COVID-19 adversely affects our business and financial results, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this “Risk\nFactors” section, including but not limited to the fact that our platform and the other systems or networks used in our business may experience an increase in attempted\ncyberattacks or targeted intrusion, ransomware, and phishing campaigns seeking to take advantage of shifts to employees working remotely using their household or personal\ninternet networks. The success of any of these unauthorized attempts could substantially impact our platform, the proprietary and other confidential data contained therein or\notherwise stored or processed in our operations, and ultimately our business, including but not limited to increased expenses incurred to improve our security controls and to\nremediate security vulnerabilities.\nWe rely on our management team and key employees and our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations could be harmed if we are unable to retain\nqualified personnel.\nOur success depends largely upon the continued services of key members of senior management and other key employees. Most key employees are at-will employees\nand therefore they may terminate employment with us at any time with no advance notice. We also rely on our leadership team in the areas of managed care, operations and\ngeneral and administrative functions. From time to time, there may be changes in our management team resulting from the hiring or departure of executives, which could\ndisrupt our business. The replacement of one or more of our executive officers or other key employees would likely involve significant time and costs and may significantly\ndelay or prevent the achievement of our business objectives. Our business would also be adversely affected if we fail to adequately plan for succession of our leadership or if we\nfail to effectively recruit, integrate, retain and develop key talent and/or align our talent with our business needs, in light of the current rapidly changing environment.\nCompetition for qualified personnel in our industry is intense due to the limited number of individuals who possess the required skills and experience. In particular, we\nface substantial competition for physicians and other healthcare providers. As a result, as we continue to grow and enter new geographies, it may be difficult for us to hire\nadditional qualified personnel with the necessary skills. We continued to experience labor shortages in 2023. A number of factors have and may in the future adversely affect\nthe labor force available to us or increase labor costs, including high employment levels, federal unemployment subsidies, increased wages offered by other employers, vaccine\nmandates and other government regulations. In addition, we have experienced high employee turnover and expect to continue to experience high employee turnover in the\nfuture. New hires require significant training and, in most cases, take significant time before such personnel achieve full productivity. New employees may not become as\nproductive as we expect, and we may be unable to hire or retain sufficient numbers of qualified individuals. If our retention efforts are not successful or our employee turnover\nrate increases in the future, our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations will be harmed.\nFinally, as job candidates often consider the value of the stock options or other equity instruments they are to receive in connection with their employment, the\nvolatility in the price of our stock may adversely affect our ability to attract or retain highly skilled personnel. Further, the requirement to expense stock options and other equity\ninstruments may discourage us from granting the size or type of stock option or equity awards that job candidates require to join our company. Failure to attract new personnel\nor failure to retain and motivate our current personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nP3 Health Partners Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 21\nTable of Contents\nOur growth depends in part on our ability to identify and develop successful new geographies, physician partners, payors and patients. If we are not able to successfully\nexecute upon our growth strategies, there may be a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nOur business depends on our ability to identify and develop successful geographies and relationships with physician partners and payors, and to successfully execute\nupon our growth initiatives to increase the profitability of our physician partners. In order to pursue our strategy successfully, we must effectively implement our platform,\npartnership and network model, including identifying suitable candidates and successfully building relationships with and managing integration of new physician partners and\npayors. We contract with a limited number of affiliated professional entities and other physician partners and rely on such physicians within each geography. Our growth\ninitiatives in our existing geographies depend, in part, on our physician partners’ ability to increase their capacity to service Medicare patients, and to effectively meet increased\npatient demand. Our affiliated professional entities and other physician partners may encounter difficulties in recruiting additional primary care physicians to their practices due\nto many factors, including significant competition in their geographies. Accordingly, the loss or dissatisfaction of any physician partners, our inability to recruit and integrate\nphysician partners into our model, or the failure of our affiliated professional entities or other physician partners to recruit additional primary care physicians or manage and\nscale capacity to timely meet patient demand, could substantially harm our brand and reputation, impact our competitiveness, inhibit widespread adoption of our platform,\npartnership and network model and impair our ability to attract new physician partners and maintain existing physician partnerships, both in new geographies and in geographies\nin which we currently operate, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nFurther, our growth strategy depends, in part, on securing and integrating new high-caliber physician partners and expanding into new geographies in which we have\nlittle or no operating experience. Integration and other risks can be more pronounced for larger and more complicated relationships or relationships outside of our core business\nspace, or if multiple relationships are pursued simultaneously. Additionally, new geographies may be characterized by stakeholder preferences for, and experience with, rates of\nMA enrollment, MA reimbursement rates, payor concentration and rates of unnecessary variability in and utilization of medical care that differ from those in the geographies\nwhere our existing operations are located. Likewise, new geographies into which we seek to expand may have laws and regulations that differ from those applicable to our\ncurrent operations. As an immature and rapidly growing company, we may be unfamiliar with the regulatory requirements in each geography that we enter, and we may be\nforced to incur significant expenditures to ensure compliance with requirements to which we are subject. If we are unable or unwilling to incur such costs, our growth in new\ngeographies may be less successful than in our current geographies.\nFurther, our growth to date has increased the significant demands on our management, operational and financial systems, infrastructure and human and capital\nresources. We must continue to improve our existing systems for operational and financial management, including our reporting systems, procedures and controls. These\nimprovements could require significant capital expenditures and place increasing demands on our management. We may not be successful in managing or expanding our\noperations or in maintaining adequate financial and operating systems and controls. If we do not successfully manage these processes, our business, financial condition, cash\nflows and results of operations could be harmed.\nIf growth in the number of patients and physician partners on our platform decreases, or the number of services that we are able to provide to physician partners and\nmembers decreases, due to legal, economic or business developments, our business, financial condition and results of operations will be harmed.\nSubstantially all of our total revenue relates to federal government healthcare programs. The policies and decisions made by the federal government regarding these\nprograms have a substantial impact on our profitability. Additionally, our future results of operations depend, in part, on our ability to expand our services and offerings,\nincluding broadening our continuum of care. As we grow our member base, we will need to maintain and grow our network of providers. Certain of our providers are permitted\nto provide services on other platforms, and therefore, our success will be dependent on our ability to retain and recruit highly trained and licensed physicians and other providers\nto our platform.\nThere are sometimes wide variations in the established per member reimbursement rates as a result of, among other things, members’ risk status, acuity levels and age,\nplan benefit design and geography. As the composition of our membership base changes, due to programmatic, competitive, regulatory, benefit design, economic or other\nchanges, there is a corresponding change to our premium revenue, costs and margins, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash\nflows and results of operations.\nP3 Health Partners Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 22\nTable of Contents\nAdditional factors that could affect our ability to sell products and services include, but are not limited to:\n• price, performance and functionality of our solution;\n• availability, price, performance and functionality of competing solutions;\n• our ability to develop and sell complementary services;\n• stability, performance and security of our hosting infrastructure and hosting services; and\n• changes in healthcare laws, regulations or trends.\nAny of these consequences could lower retention rate and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf the estimates and assumptions we use to project the size, revenue or medical expense amounts of our target geographies are inaccurate or the cost of providing services\nexceeds the amounts received by us, our future growth prospects may be impacted, and we may generate losses or fail to attain financial performance targets.\nWe often do not have access to reliable historical data regarding the size, revenue or medical expense levels of our target geographies or potential physician partners.\nAs a result, our market opportunity estimates and financial forecasts developed as we enter into a new geography, are subject to significant uncertainty, and are based on\nassumptions and estimates that may not prove to be accurate. The estimates and forecasts in this Form 10-K and our other public disclosures relating to the size and expected\ngrowth of the market for our services and the estimates of our market opportunity may prove to be inaccurate.\nPrincipal assumptions relating to our market opportunity include estimates of the total number and average length of relationships between MA patients and their\nphysicians, historical MA patient growth rates, amount of revenue and medical expenses associated with MA members expected to be attributed to our affiliated professional\nentities and other physician partners and historical experience that such physician partners have with a similar platform. Our opportunity is based on the assumption that our\nplatform, partnership and network model will be more attractive to potential physician partners than competing options. However, potential physician partners may elect to\npursue a different strategic option.\nChanges in our anticipated ratio of medical expense to revenue can significantly impact our financial results. Accordingly, the failure to adequately predict and control\nmedical costs and expenses could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Additionally, the medical expenses of\npatients may be outside of our affiliated providers’ control in the event that patients take certain actions that increase such expenses, such as unnecessary hospital visits.\nNumerous factors impact our ability to accurately estimate and control our medical expenses, many of which are not within our control. Factors that may cause medical\nexpenses to exceed estimates include:\n• the health status of our members;\n• higher levels of hospitalization among our members;\n• higher than expected utilization of new or existing healthcare services or technologies;\n• an increase in the cost of healthcare services and supplies, whether as a result of inflation or otherwise;\n• changes to mandated benefits or other changes in healthcare laws, regulations and practices;\n• increased costs attributable to specialist physicians, hospitals and ancillary providers;\n• changes in the demographics of our members and medical trends;\n• contractual or claims disputes with providers, hospitals or other service providers within and outside a health plan’s network;\nP3 Health Partners Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 23\nTable of Contents\n• the occurrence of catastrophes, major epidemics or pandemics, including COVID-19 and any variants thereof, or acts of terrorism; and\n• the reduction of health plan premiums.\nAdditionally, fluctuations in the magnitude of the hospital and physician network, including the discontinuation of a hospital or specialty or ancillary physician’s\nparticipation in our payors’ provider network, could adversely impact our business, financial condition, cash flows, and results of operations. If we underestimate or do not\ncorrectly predict the cost of the care our affiliated providers furnish to patients, we might be underpaid for the care that must be provided to patients, which could have a\nnegative impact on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe primarily depend on reimbursement by third-party payors, as well as payments by individuals, which could lead to delays, uncertainties and disagreements\nregarding the timing and process of reimbursement, including any changes or reductions in Medicare reimbursement rates or rules.\nThe reimbursement process is complex and can involve lengthy delays. Although we recognize revenue when we provide services to patients, we may from time to\ntime experience delays in receiving the associated capitation payments or, for patients on fee-for-service arrangements, the reimbursement for the service provided. In addition,\nthird-party payors may disallow, in whole or in part, requests for reimbursement based on determinations that the patient is not eligible for coverage, certain amounts are not\nreimbursable under plan coverage, were for services provided that were not medically necessary, or additional supporting documentation is necessary. Third-party payors are\nalso increasingly focused on controlling healthcare costs, and such efforts, including any revisions to reimbursement policies, may further reduce, complicate or delay our\nreimbursement claims. Further, the Medicare program and its reimbursement rates and rules, upon which many third-party payors base their reimbursement rate, are subject to\nfrequent change. Each year, CMS issues a final rule to establish the MA benchmark payment rates for the following calendar year. Any reduction to MA reimbursement levels\nmay have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Additionally, any delay or default by the government in making\nMedicare reimbursement payments could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRetroactive adjustments may change amounts realized from third-party payors. As described below, we are subject to audits by such payors, including governmental\naudits of our Medicare claims, and may be required to repay these payors if a finding is made that we were incorrectly reimbursed. Delays, uncertainties and disagreements\nregarding the reimbursement process may adversely affect accounts receivable, increase the overall costs of collection and cause us to incur additional borrowing and other costs\nrelated to resolving disagreements or uncertainties. For example, in July 2021, a discrepancy was identified in the service agreement with one of our health plans in the way the\nrevenue of Medicare Part C and Medicare Part D was being calculated compared to the definitions of “revenue” under the service agreement. This discrepancy resulted in a\ncontract dispute and a renegotiation of the service agreement. In January 2023, the renegotiation was settled and we reflected the known settlement of $5.0 million within health\nplan settlements payable on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2022. The remaining settlement balance of $3.0 million is recorded within health plan\nsettlements payable on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2023. See Note 20 “Commitments and Contingencies” to the consolidated financial statements\nincluded elsewhere in this Form 10-K for additional information on the impact of this discrepancy.\nIn addition, certain of our patients are covered under health plans that require the patient to cover a portion of their own healthcare expenses through the payment of\ncopayments or deductibles. We may not be able to collect the full amounts due with respect to these payments that are the patient’s financial responsibility, or in those instances\nwhere physicians provide services to uninsured individuals. To the extent permitted by law, amounts not covered by third-party payors are the obligations of individual patients\nfor which we may not receive whole or partial payment. Any increase in cost shifting from third-party payors to individual patients, including as a result of high deductible\nplans for patients, increases our collection costs and reduces overall collections, which we may not be able to offset with sufficient revenue.\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the CMS, the federal agency responsible for administering the Medicare program, made several changes in the manner in\nwhich Medicare pays for telehealth visits, many of which relax previous requirements, including site requirements for both the providers and patients, telehealth modality\nrequirements and others. State law applicable to telehealth, particularly licensure requirements, was also relaxed in many jurisdictions as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. It\nis unclear which, if any, of these changes will remain in place permanently and which will be rolled-back. If regulations change to restrict our ability to or prohibit us from\ndelivering care through telehealth modalities, our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nP3 Health Partners Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 24\nTable of Contents\nThe termination or non-renewal of the Medicare Advantage contracts held by the health plans with which we contract, or the termination or nonrenewal of our contracts\nwith those plans, could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and operations.\nWe contract with health plans to provide capitated care services with respect to certain of their MA members. Our operations are dependent on a concentrated number\nof payors with whom we contract to provide services to members. Our contracts with four health plans to provide capitated care services for their members collectively\naccounted for approximately 60% and 67% of our capitated revenue for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. If a plan with which we contract for these\nservices loses its MA contracts with CMS, receives reduced or insufficient government reimbursement under the MA program, decides to discontinue its MA and/or commercial\nplans, decides to contract with another company to provide capitated care services to its members, or decides to directly provide care, our contract with that plan could be at risk\nand we could lose revenue. In addition, certain of our contracts with health plans are terminable without cause. If any of these contracts were terminated, certain patients\ncovered by such plans may choose to shift to another PCP within their health plan’s network. Moreover, our inability to maintain our agreements with health plans, in particular\nwith key payors such as Centene Corporation, Atrio Health Plans, United Healthcare and Aetna, with respect to their MA members or to negotiate favorable terms for those\nagreements in the future, could result in the loss of patients and could have a material adverse effect on our profitability and business.\nThe healthcare industry has also experienced a trend of consolidation, resulting in fewer but larger payors that have significant bargaining power, given their market\nshare. Payments from payors are the result of negotiated rates. These rates may decline based on renegotiations and larger payors having significant bargaining power to\nnegotiate higher discounted fee arrangements with healthcare providers. As a result, payors increasingly are demanding discounted fee structures or the assumption by\nhealthcare providers of all or a portion of the financial risk related to paying for care provided through capitation agreements.\nWe are dependent on our affiliated professional entities and other physician partners and other providers to effectively manage the quality and cost of care and perform\nobligations under payor contracts.\nOur success depends upon our continued ability to collaborate with and expand a network of high-caliber affiliated professional entities and other physician partners\nwho can provide high quality of care, improve clinical outcomes and effectively manage healthcare costs, which are key drivers of our profitability. Our physician partners\ncould demand an increased payment arrangement or take other actions, or fail to take actions, that could result in higher medical costs, lower quality of care for our members,\nharm to our reputation or create difficulty meeting regulatory or other requirements. Likewise, our physician partners could take actions contrary to our instructions, requests,\npolicies or objectives or applicable law, or could have economic or business interests or goals that are or become inconsistent with our own. Further, our physician partners may\nnot engage with our platform to assist in improving overall quality of care and management of healthcare costs, which could produce results that are inconsistent with our\nestimates and financial models and negatively impact our growth.\nIn addition to receiving care from our affiliated professional entities and other physician partners, our members also receive care from an array of hospitals, specialists\nand ancillary providers who typically contract directly with our payors. We cannot guarantee the quality and efficiency of services from such providers, over which we have no\ncontrol. Members who receive sub-optimal healthcare from such providers may be dissatisfied with our physician partners, which would have a negative impact on member\nsatisfaction and retention. Any of these consequences could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe could also experience significant losses if the expenses incurred to deliver healthcare services to our attributed members exceed revenue we receive from payors in\nrespect of our attributed members. Under a capitation contract, a payor typically prospectively pays periodic capitation payments representing a prospective budget from which\nits physician partnerships manage healthcare expenses on behalf of the population enrolled with that physician partnership. To manage total medical services expense, we rely\non our affiliated professional entities’ and other physician partners’ ability to improve clinical outcomes, implement clinical initiatives to provide a better healthcare experience\nfor our members and accurately and sufficiently document the risk profile of our members. While our contracts vary, generally, if the cost of medical care provided exceeds the\ncorresponding capitation revenue we receive, we may realize operating deficits, which are typically not capped, and could lead to substantial losses.\nP3 Health Partners Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 25\nTable of Contents\nReductions in the quality ratings of the health plans we serve could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash\nflows.\nAs a result of the Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (the “ACA”), the level of reimbursement each health plan\nreceives from CMS is dependent, in part, upon the quality rating of the MA plan. Such ratings impact the percentage of any cost savings rebate and any bonuses earned by such\nhealth plan. Since a significant portion of our revenue is expected to be calculated as a percentage of CMS reimbursement received by these health plans with respect to our\npatients, reductions in the quality ratings of a health plan that we serve could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash\nflows.\nGiven each health plan’s control of its plans and the many other providers that serve such plans, we believe that we will have limited ability to influence the overall\nquality rating of any such plan. The Bipartisan Budget Act, passed in February 2018, implemented certain changes to prevent artificial inflation of star ratings for MA plans\noffered by the same organization. In addition, CMS has terminated plans that have had a rating of less than three stars for three consecutive years, whereas MA plans with five\nstars are permitted to conduct enrollment throughout almost the entire year. Because low quality ratings can potentially lead to the termination of a plan that we serve, we may\nnot be able to prevent the potential termination of a contracting plan or a shift of patients to other plans based upon quality issues which could, in turn, have a material adverse\neffect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe operate in a competitive industry, and if we are not able to compete effectively, our business, financial condition and results of operations will be harmed.\nOur industry is competitive and we expect it to attract increased competition, which could make it difficult for us to succeed. We currently face competition in various\naspects of our business, including in offering a favorable reimbursement structure for physician partners and potential physician partners and attracting payors and physician\npartners who are not contracted with us, from a range of companies that provide similar services under different care models that could attract patients, providers and payors,\nincluding hospitals, managed service organizations and provider networks and data analysis consultants. Further, individual physicians who are contracted within our network\nmay affiliate with our competitors. Competition from hospitals, managed service organizations and provider networks and data analysis consultants, payors and other parties\ncould result in payors changing the benefit structure that is offered to our members, which could negatively impact our profitability and market share.\nOur primary competitors include Oak Street Health, Inc., Cano Health, Inc. and agilon health, inc., in addition to numerous local provider networks, hospitals and\nhealth systems. Moreover, large, well-financed payors have in some cases developed their own managed services tools and may provide these services to their physicians and\npatients at discounted prices, or may seek to expand their relationships with additional competing physicians or physician networks, including in geographic areas we serve.\nThis may result in a more competitive environment and increased challenges to grow at the rates we have projected. We expect that competition will continue to increase as a\nresult of consolidation in the healthcare industry and increased demand for its services.\nSome of our competitors may have greater name recognition, particularly in local geographies, longer operating histories, superior products or services and\nsignificantly greater resources than we do. Further, our current or potential competitors may be acquired by or partner with third parties with greater resources than we have. As\na result, our competitors may be able to respond more quickly and effectively than we can to new or changing opportunities, technologies, standards or customer requirements\nand may have the ability to initiate or withstand substantial benefits structure and premium competition. In addition, current and potential competitors have established, and\nmay in the future establish, cooperative relationships with providers of complementary services, technologies or services to increase the attractiveness of their services.\nAccordingly, new competitors or alliances may emerge that have greater market share, a larger customer base, better data aggregation systems, greater marketing\nexpertise, greater financial resources and larger marketing teams than we have, which could put us at a competitive disadvantage. Our competitors could also be better\npositioned to serve certain segments of the healthcare delivery industry, which could create additional pressure on the premiums that our payors are able to charge. If we are\nunable to successfully compete, our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nP3 Health Partners Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 26\nTable of Contents\nOur future growth and the profitability of our business will depend in large part upon the effectiveness and efficiency of our marketing efforts, and our ability to develop\nbrand awareness cost-effectively.\nOur business success depends on our ability to attract and retain members, which significantly depends on our marketing practices. Our future growth and profitability\nwill depend in large part upon the effectiveness and efficiency of our marketing efforts, including our ability to:\n• create greater awareness of our brand;\n• identify the most effective and efficient levels of spending in each market, media and specific media vehicle;\n• determine the appropriate creative messages and media mix for advertising, marketing and promotional expenditures;\n• effectively manage marketing costs (including creative and media) to maintain acceptable consumer acquisition costs;\n• select the most effective markets, media and specific media vehicles in which to advertise; and\n• convert consumer inquiries into clients and members.\nWe believe that developing and maintaining widespread awareness of our brand in a cost-effective manner is critical to achieving widespread adoption of our services\nand attracting new clients and members. Our brand promotion activities may not generate consumer awareness or increase revenue, and even if they do, any increase in revenue\nmay not offset the expenses we incur in building our brand. If we fail to successfully promote and maintain our brand, or incur substantial expenses in doing so, we may fail to\nattract or retain members necessary to realize a sufficient return on our brand-building efforts or to achieve the widespread brand awareness that is critical for broad adoption of\nour brands.\nDevelopments affecting spending by the healthcare industry could adversely affect our business.\nThe U.S. healthcare industry has changed significantly in recent years, and we expect that significant changes will continue to occur. General reductions in\nexpenditures by healthcare industry participants could result from, among other things:\n• government regulations or private initiatives that affect the manner in which healthcare providers interact with patients, payors or other healthcare industry\nparticipants, including changes in pricing or means of delivery of healthcare products and services;\n• consolidation of healthcare industry participants;\n• reductions in government funding for healthcare; and\n• adverse changes in business or economic conditions affecting healthcare payors or providers or other healthcare industry participants.\nAny of these changes in healthcare spending could adversely affect our revenue. Even if general expenditures by industry participants remain the same or increase,\ndevelopments in the healthcare industry may result in reduced spending in some or all of the specific markets that we serve now or in the future. However, the timing and\nimpact of developments in the healthcare industry are difficult to predict. We cannot assure you that the demand for our solutions and services will continue to exist at current\nlevels or that we will have adequate technical, financial, and marketing resources to react to changes in the healthcare industry.\nWe and our affiliated professional entities and other physician partners may become subject to medical liability claims, which could cause us to incur significant expenses\nand may require us to pay significant damages if the claims are not covered by insurance.\nOur overall business entails the risk of medical liability claims. Successful medical liability claims could result in substantial damage awards that exceed the limits of\nour and those affiliated professionals’ insurance coverage. We carry or\nP3 Health Partners Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 27\nTable of Contents\nwill carry professional liability insurance for the Company and each of our healthcare professionals. Additionally, all of the network providers that contract or will contract with\nus separately carry or will carry professional liability insurance for themselves and their healthcare professionals. Professional liability insurance is expensive and insurance\npremiums may increase significantly in the future, particularly as we expand our services. As a result, adequate professional liability insurance may not be available to us and\nour affiliated professionals in the future at acceptable costs or at all, which may negatively impact our and our affiliated professionals’ ability to provide services to members,\nand thereby adversely affect our overall business and operations.\nAny claims made against us or our affiliated professionals that are not fully covered by insurance could be costly to defend against, result in substantial damage\nawards, and divert the attention of our management and our affiliated professional entities from our operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business,\nfinancial condition and results of operations. In addition, any claims may adversely affect our business or reputation.\nIf we or our affiliated professional entities or other physician partners fail to comply with applicable data interoperability and information blocking rules, our consolidated\nresults of operations could be adversely affected.\nThe 21st Century Cures Act (the “Cures Act”), which was passed and signed into law in December 2016, includes provisions related to data interoperability,\ninformation blocking and patient access. In March 2020, the HHS, Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology, (“ONC”), and CMS finalized and\nissued complementary rules that are intended to clarify provisions of the Cures Act regarding interoperability and information blocking, and include, among other things,\nrequirements surrounding information blocking, changes to ONC’s health IT certification program and requirements that CMS regulated payors make relevant claims/care data\nand provider directory information available through standardized patient access and provider directory application programming interfaces that connect to provider electronic\nhealth record systems. The companion rules will transform the way in which healthcare providers, health IT developers, health information exchanges/health information\nnetworks (“HIEs/HINs”), and health plans share patient information, and create significant new requirements for healthcare industry participants. For example, the ONC rule,\nwhich went into effect on April 5, 2021, prohibits healthcare providers, health IT developers of certified health IT, and HIEs/HINs from engaging in practices that are likely to\ninterfere with, prevent, materially discourage, or otherwise inhibit the access, exchange or use of electronic health information (“EHI”), also known as “information blocking.”\nTo further support access and exchange of EHI, the ONC rule identifies eight “reasonable and necessary activities” as exceptions to information blocking activities, as long as\nspecific conditions are met. In June 2023, the HHS Office of Inspector General (“OIG”) published its final rule implementing the statutory penalties for information blocking,\nwhich are up to $1 million per violation. Enforcement of information blocking penalties began on September 1, 2023. Further, in December 2023, ONC finalized its rule titled\nHealth Data, Technology, and Interoperability: Certification Program Updates, Algorithm Transparency, and Information Sharing (“HTI-1 Final Rule”). Among other things,\nthe HTI-1 Final Rule narrows the scope of entities that qualify as certified health IT developers, makes updates to its Health IT Certification Program requirements, a voluntary\nprogram for certifying health IT, and modifies the information blocking exceptions. Any failure to comply with these rules could have a material adverse effect on our business,\nresults of operations and financial condition.\nOur business and operations would suffer in the event of information technology system failures, security breaches, cyberattacks or other deficiencies in cybersecurity.\nOur information technology systems facilitate our ability to conduct our business. While we have disaster recovery systems and business continuity plans in place, any\ndisruptions in our disaster recovery systems or the failure of these systems to operate as expected could, depending on the magnitude of the problem, adversely affect our\noperating results by limiting our capacity to effectively monitor and control our operations. Despite our implementation of a variety of security measures, our information\ntechnology systems could be subject to physical or electronic break-ins, and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering or any weather-related disruptions where our\nheadquarters is located. In addition, in the event that a significant number of our management personnel were unavailable in the event of a disaster, our ability to effectively\nconduct business could be adversely affected.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we, our affiliated professional entities or other physician partners collect and store sensitive data, including personal\ninformation, protected health information (“PHI”), intellectual property and proprietary business information owned or controlled by us or our employees, members and other\nparties (collectively, “Confidential Information”). We manage and maintain our applications and data utilizing a combination of on-site systems and cloud-based data centers.\nWe utilize external security and infrastructure vendors to provide and manage parts of our information technology systems, including our data centers. These applications and\ndata encompass a wide variety of business-critical information, including research and development information, customer information, commercial\nP3 Health Partners Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 28\nTable of Contents\ninformation and business and financial information. We face a number of risks with respect to the protection of this Confidential Information, including loss of access,\ninappropriate use or disclosure, unauthorized access, inappropriate modification and the risk of being unable to adequately monitor and audit and modify our controls over our\nConfidential Information. This risk extends to the third-party vendors and subcontractors we use to manage this sensitive data or otherwise process it on our behalf. A breach or\nfailure of our or our third-party vendors’ or subcontractors’ network, hosted service providers or vendor systems could result from a variety of circumstances and events,\nincluding third-party action, employee negligence or error, malfeasance, malware (e.g., ransomware), misconfigurations, “bugs” or other vulnerabilities, computer viruses,\ncyberattacks by computer hackers such as denial-of-service and phishing attacks, failures during the process of upgrading or replacing software and databases, power outages,\nhardware failures, telecommunication failures, user errors, or catastrophic events. If these third-party vendors or subcontractors fail to protect their information technology\nsystems and our Confidential Information, we may be vulnerable to disruptions in service and unauthorized access to our Confidential Information and we could incur liability\nand reputational damage.\nThe secure processing, storage, maintenance and transmission of information are vital to our operations and business strategy, and we devote significant resources to\nprotecting such Confidential Information. Although we take reasonable measures to protect sensitive data from unauthorized access, use or disclosure, our information\ntechnology and infrastructure may still be vulnerable. We have in the past experienced, low-threat attacks by hackers or breaches due to employee error, malfeasance or other\nmalicious or inadvertent disruptions. For example, in April 2023 we were the target of a type of wire transfer fraud known as business email compromise (“BEC”) scam. BEC\nscams involve using social engineering to cause employees to wire funds to the perpetrators in the mistaken belief that the requests were made by a company executive or\nestablished vendor. While this fraud did not cause material losses to us, it reflects that we, like any company, are always at risk of being targeted for a cyberattack.\nAttacks upon information technology systems are increasing in their frequency, levels of persistence, sophistication and intensity, and are being conducted by\nsophisticated and organized groups and individuals with a wide range of motives and expertise. Furthermore, because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to, or to\nsabotage, systems change frequently and often are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate\npreventative measures against hacking, phishing, spoofing, BEC, employee error or manipulation, or other similar adverse events. We may also experience security breaches\nthat may remain undetected for an extended period. Even if identified, we may be unable to adequately investigate or remediate incidents or breaches due to attackers\nincreasingly using tools and techniques that are designed to circumvent controls, to avoid detection, and to remove or obfuscate forensic evidence.\nAny such breach or interruption could compromise our networks and the Confidential Information stored there could be accessed by unauthorized parties, publicly\ndisclosed, lost or stolen. Our information systems must also be continually updated, patched and upgraded to protect against known vulnerabilities. The volume of new\nvulnerabilities has increased markedly, as has the criticality of patches and other remedial measures. In addition to remediating newly identified vulnerabilities, previously\nidentified vulnerabilities must also be continuously addressed. Accordingly, we are at risk that cyberattackers exploit these known vulnerabilities before they have been\naddressed.\nIf a cyberattack or security incident were to occur and cause interruptions in our operations, it could result in legal claims or proceedings, and liability under federal or\nstate laws that protect the privacy of personal information, and corresponding regulatory penalties. In addition, we could face criminal liability, damages for contract breach and\nincur significant costs for remedial measures to prevent future occurrences and mitigate past violations. Notice of breaches may be required to be made to affected individuals\nor other state or federal regulators, and for extensive breaches, notice may need to be made to the media or State Attorneys General. Such a notice could harm our reputation and\nour ability to compete. Although we maintain insurance covering certain security and privacy damages and claim expenses, we may not carry insurance or maintain coverage\nsufficient to compensate for all liability and in any event, insurance coverage would not address the reputational damage that could result from a security incident. Despite our\nimplementation of security measures to prevent unauthorized access, our data is currently accessible through multiple channels, and there is no guarantee we can protect our\ndata from breach. Unauthorized access, loss or dissemination could also disrupt our operations and damage our reputation, any of which could adversely affect our business.\nActual or perceived failures to comply with applicable data protection, privacy and security laws, regulations, standards and other requirements could adversely affect our\nbusiness, financial condition and results of operations.\nNumerous state and federal laws, regulations, standards and other legal obligations, including consumer protection laws and regulations, which govern the collection,\ndissemination, use, access to, confidentiality, security and processing of\nP3 Health Partners Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 29\nTable of Contents\npersonal information, including health-related information, could apply to our operations or the operations of our partners. For example, HIPAA, as amended by the Health\nInformation Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009, and regulations implemented thereunder (collectively, “HIPAA”), imposes privacy, security and breach\nnotification obligations on certain healthcare providers, health plans, and healthcare clearinghouses, known as covered entities, as well as their business associates that perform\ncertain services that involve creating, receiving, maintaining or transmitting individually identifiable health information for or on behalf of such covered entities, and their\ncovered subcontractors. HIPAA requires covered entities, such as the affiliated professional entities or other physician partners, and business associates, such as us, to develop\nand maintain policies with respect to the protection of, use and disclosure of PHI, including the adoption of administrative, physical and technical safeguards to protect such\ninformation, and certain notification requirements in the event of a breach of unsecured PHI.\nAdditionally, under HIPAA, covered entities must report breaches of unsecured PHI to affected individuals without unreasonable delay, not to exceed 60 days\nfollowing discovery of the breach by a covered entity or its agents. Notification also must be made to the HHS Office for Civil Rights and, in certain circumstances involving\nlarge breaches, to the media. Business associates must report breaches of unsecured PHI to covered entities within 60 days of discovery of the breach by the business associate\nor its agents. A non-permitted use or disclosure of PHI is presumed to be a breach under HIPAA unless the covered entity or business associate establishes that there is a low\nprobability the information has been compromised consistent with requirements enumerated in HIPAA.\nEntities that are found to be in violation of HIPAA as the result of a breach of unsecured PHI, a complaint about privacy practices or an audit by HHS may be subject\nto significant civil, criminal and administrative fines and penalties and/or additional reporting and oversight obligations if required to enter into a resolution agreement and\ncorrective action plan with HHS to settle allegations of HIPAA non-compliance. HIPAA also authorizes state Attorneys General to file suit on behalf of their residents. Courts\nmay award damages, costs and attorneys’ fees related to violations of HIPAA in such cases. While HIPAA does not create a private right of action allowing individuals to sue\nus in civil court for violations of HIPAA, its standards have been used as the basis for duty of care in state civil suits such as those for negligence or recklessness in the misuse or\nbreach of PHI.\nThe Federal Trade Commission (the “FTC”) also has authority to initiate enforcement actions against entities that mislead customers about HIPAA compliance, make\ndeceptive statements about privacy and data sharing in privacy policies, fail to limit third-party use of personal health information, fail to implement policies to protect personal\nhealth information or engage in other unfair practices that harm customers or that may violate Section 5(a) of the FTC Act. Even when HIPAA does not apply, according to the\nFTC, violating consumers’ privacy rights or failing to take appropriate steps to keep consumers’ personal information secure may constitute unfair and/or deceptive acts or\npractices in violation of Section 5(a) of the Federal Trade Commission Act. The FTC expects a company’s data security measures to be reasonable and appropriate in light of the\nsensitivity and volume of consumer information it holds, the size and complexity of its business, and the cost of available tools to improve security and reduce vulnerabilities.\nWe expect even greater scrutiny by federal and state regulators, partners, and consumers of our collection, use and disclosure of health information. Additionally, federal and\nstate consumer protection laws are increasingly being applied by FTC and states’ attorneys general to regulate the collection, use, storage, and disclosure of personal\ninformation, through websites or otherwise, and to regulate the presentation of website content.\nFurther, certain states have also adopted comparable privacy and security laws and regulations which govern the privacy, processing and protection of health-related\nand other personal information. Such laws and regulations will be subject to interpretation by various courts and other governmental authorities, thus creating potentially\ncomplex compliance issues for us and our future customers and strategic partners. For example, the state of Nevada enacted a law that went into force on October 1, 2019 and\nrequires companies to honor consumers’ requests to no longer sell their data. Further, the California Consumer Privacy Act, as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act\n(collectively, the “CCPA”) requires covered businesses that process the personal information of California residents to, among other things: provide certain disclosures to\nCalifornia residents regarding the business’s collection, use, and disclosure of their personal information; receive and respond to requests from California residents to access,\ndelete, and correct their personal information, or to opt out of certain disclosures of their personal information, and enter into specific contractual provisions with service\nproviders that process California resident personal information on the business’s behalf. California’s Confidentiality of Medical Information Act (the “CMIA”) places\nrestrictions on the use and disclosure of health information, including PHI, and other personal information, and can impose a significant compliance obligation. Violations of the\nCMIA can result in criminal, civil and administrative sanctions, and the CMIA also provides individuals a private right of action with respect to disclosures of their health\ninformation that violate CMIA. In the event that we are subject to\nP3 Health Partners Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 30\nTable of Contents\nor affected by HIPAA, the CCPA, or other domestic privacy and data protection laws, any liability from failure to comply with the requirements of these laws could adversely\naffect our financial condition.\nWashington State also enacted a broadly applicable law to protect the privacy of personal health information known as the “My Health My Data Act,” which generally\nrequires affirmative consent for the collection, use, or sharing of any “consumer health data.” Consumer health data is defined to include personal information that is linked or\nreasonably linkable to a consumer and that identifies a consumer’s past, present, or future physical or mental health status; consumer health data also includes information that\nis derived or extrapolated from non-health information, such as algorithms and machine learning. Nevada has also passed a similar consumer health data law, and given the\nincreased focus on the use of health data by entities that are not subject to HIPAA, additional states are expected to pass consumer health privacy laws.\nAlthough we work to comply with applicable laws, regulations and standards, our contractual obligations and other legal obligations, these requirements are evolving\nand may be modified, interpreted and applied in an inconsistent manner from one jurisdiction to another, and may conflict with one another or other legal obligations with\nwhich we must comply. Any failure or perceived failure by us or our employees, representatives, contractors, consultants, collaborators, or other third parties to comply with\nsuch requirements or adequately address privacy and security concerns, even if unfounded, could result in additional cost and liability to us, damage our reputation, and\nadversely affect our business and results of operations.\nLegal proceedings in connection with the Business Combinations, the outcome of which is uncertain, could draw the attention of our management team away from the\noperation of our business.\nPrior to execution of the definitive agreements for the Business Combinations, Hudson Vegas Investment SPV, LLC, (“Hudson”), one of our existing equity holders,\nasserted that it had an option to purchase additional equity interests in P3 Health Group Holdings, LLC (“Legacy P3”) in connection with the pending transaction with Foresight\n(the “Purchase Option”). We do not agree that the Purchase Option applies to the Business Combinations. On June 11, 2021, Hudson filed an action in the Delaware Court of\nChancery (the “Hudson Action”), in which it challenged the Business Combinations. Specifically, Hudson purports to assert claims against Legacy P3, the members of the\nLegacy P3 Board of Managers, certain of the Legacy P3 officers and Chicago Pacific Founders Fund, L.P. (“CPF”), for breach of the Third Amended and Restated Limited\nLiability Company Agreement of Legacy P3, dated as of April 16, 2020 (the “Legacy P3 LLC Agreement”), (against Legacy P3 and CPF), breach of fiduciary duty (against\ncertain of Legacy P3’s officers) and breach of alleged contractual standards of conduct (against the Legacy P3 Board of Managers) in connection with the process leading up to,\nand approval of, the Business Combinations. In the Hudson Action, Hudson sought to enjoin the consummation of the Business Combinations, and seeks a declaration that the\nBusiness Combinations violate its rights under the Legacy P3 LLC Agreement, a declaration that the members of the Legacy P3 Board of Managers and certain of Legacy P3’s\nofficers breached their fiduciary duties, and money damages including attorneys’ fees.\nSee “Item 3. Legal Proceedings” for a description of the Hudson Class D Dispute proceedings.\nDefending or settling this lawsuit could draw the attention of our management team away from the operation of our business and while we are indemnified by the P3\nEquityholders for costs in connection with this lawsuit, it is possible that we could nonetheless incur financial losses if disputes arise with respect to the extent of the\nindemnification obligations.\nAny future litigation against us could be costly and time-consuming to defend.\nWe may become subject, from time to time, to legal proceedings, federal and state audits, government investigations, and payor audits, investigations, overpayments,\nand claims that arise in the ordinary course of business such as claims brought by our clients in connection with commercial disputes or employment claims made by our current\nor former associates. Litigation and audits may result in substantial costs and may divert management’s attention and resources, which may substantially harm our business,\nfinancial condition and results of operations. Insurance may not cover such claims, may not provide sufficient payments to cover all of the costs to resolve one or more such\nclaims and may not continue to be available on terms acceptable to us. A claim brought against us that is uninsured or underinsured could result in unanticipated costs, thereby\nreducing our earnings and leading analysts or potential investors to reduce their expectations of our performance, which could reduce the market price of our Class A common\nstock or publicly traded warrants.\nP3 Health Partners Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 31\nTable of Contents\nChanges in U.S. tax laws, and the adoption of tax reform policies or changes in tax legislation or policies in jurisdictions outside of the United States, could adversely affect\nour operating results and financial condition.\nWe are subject to federal and state income and non-income taxes in the United States. Tax laws, regulations, and administrative practices in various jurisdictions may\nbe subject to significant change, with or without notice, due to economic, political, and other conditions, and significant judgment is required in evaluating and estimating these\ntaxes.\nOur effective tax rates could be affected by numerous factors, such as entry into new businesses and geographies, changes to our existing business and operations,\nacquisitions and investments and how they are financed, changes in our stock price, changes in our deferred tax assets and liabilities and their valuation, and changes in the\nrelevant tax, accounting, and other laws, regulations, administrative practices, principles and interpretations. We are required to take positions regarding the interpretation of\ncomplex statutory and regulatory tax rules and on valuation matters that are subject to uncertainty, and tax authorities may challenge the positions that we take.\nOur quarterly results may fluctuate significantly, which could adversely impact the value of our Class A common stock and publicly traded warrants.\nOur quarterly results of operations, including our revenue, net loss and cash flows, has varied and may vary significantly in the future, and period-to-period\ncomparisons of our results of operations may not be meaningful. Accordingly, our quarterly results should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance. Our\nquarterly financial results may fluctuate as a result of a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control, including, without limitation, the following:\n• our ability to maintain and grow the number of members on our platform;\n• the demand for and types of services that are offered on our platform by providers;\n• the timing of recognition of revenue, including possible delays in the recognition of revenue due to sometimes unpredictable implementation timelines;\n• the amount and timing of operating expenses related to the maintenance and expansion of our business, operations and infrastructure;\n• our ability to effectively manage the size and composition of our network of healthcare providers relative to the level of demand for services from our members and\nour clients’ members and patients;\n• our ability to respond to competitive developments, including pricing changes and the introduction of new products and services by our competitors;\n• client and member renewal rates and the timing and terms of client and member renewals;\n• changes to our pricing model;\n• our ability to introduce new features and services and enhance our existing platform and our ability to generate significant revenue from new features and services;\n• the impact of outages of our platform and associated reputational harm;\n• security or data privacy breaches and associated remediation costs;\n• the timing of expenses related to the development or acquisition of technologies or businesses; and\n• the COVID-19 pandemic or other pandemics.\nAny fluctuation in our quarterly results may not accurately reflect the underlying performance of our business and could cause a decline in the trading price of our\nClass A common stock and publicly traded warrants.\nP3 Health Partners Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 32\nTable of Contents\nOur only significant asset is the ownership of a minority of the economic interest in P3 LLC, and such ownership may not be sufficient to generate the funds necessary to\nmeet our financial obligations or to pay any dividends on our Class A common stock.\nWe have no direct operations and no significant assets other than the ownership of a minority of the economic interests in P3 LLC. As of December 31, 2023, we\nowned approximately 37.2% of the economic interests in P3 LLC. We depend on P3 LLC and its subsidiaries for distributions, loans and other payments to generate the funds\nnecessary to meet our financial obligations, including to satisfy our obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement, or to pay any dividends with respect to our Class A\nCommon Stock. Legal and contractual restrictions in agreements governing the indebtedness of P3 LLC and its subsidiaries may limit our ability to obtain cash from P3 LLC.\nThe earnings from, or other available assets of, P3 LLC and its subsidiaries may not be sufficient to enable us to satisfy our financial obligations, including our obligations\nunder the Tax Receivable Agreement, or pay any dividends on our Class A common stock should we decide to do so. P3 LLC will be classified as a partnership for U.S. federal\nincome tax purposes and, as such, will generally not be subject to entity level U.S. federal income tax. Instead, taxable income will be allocated to holders of P3 LLC units,\nincluding us. As a result, we generally will incur taxes on our allocable share of any net taxable income generated by P3 LLC. Under the terms of the P3 LLC Amended and\nRestated Limited Liability Agreement (the “P3 LLC A&R LLC Agreement”), and the Tax Receivable Agreement, P3 LLC will be obligated to make tax distributions or\npayments to holders of its P3 LLC units, including us, except to the extent such distributions or payments would render P3 LLC insolvent or are otherwise prohibited by law or\nthe terms of any credit facility. In addition to our tax payment obligations, we will also incur expenses related to our operations and our interests in P3 LLC, including costs and\nexpenses of being a publicly traded company, all of which could be significant. To the extent that we require funds and P3 LLC or its subsidiaries are restricted from making\ndistributions under applicable law or regulation or under the terms of their financing arrangements, or are otherwise unable to provide such funds, it could materially adversely\naffect our liquidity and financial condition, including our ability to pay our income taxes when due.\nOur business could be adversely impacted by climate change, extreme weather conditions and natural disasters.\nThe intensifying effects of climate change present physical, liability, and transition risks with both macro and micro implications for companies and financial markets.\nThere is increasing concern that a gradual increase in global average temperatures due to increased concentration of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the\natmosphere are causing significant changes in weather patterns around the globe and an increase in the frequency and severity of natural disasters. Changes in weather patterns\nand an increased frequency, intensity and duration of extreme weather events (such as floods, droughts, wildfires and severe storms), whether as a result of climate change or\notherwise, could, among other things, disrupt our operations or damage or destroy our headquarters or owned or managed clinics, which may cause us to suffer losses and\nadditional costs to maintain or resume operations, which could have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations. In addition, implementing changes to mitigate\nrisks associated with such events may result in substantial short- and long-term additional operational expenses, which may materially affect our profitability.\nRisks Related to Our Legal and Regulatory Environment\nWe conduct business in a heavily regulated industry and if we fail to adhere to all of the complex government laws and regulations that apply to our business, we could\nincur fines or penalties or be required to make changes to our operations or experience adverse publicity, any or all of which could have a material adverse effect on our\nbusiness, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows, and reputation.\nThe U.S. healthcare industry is heavily regulated and closely scrutinized by federal, state and local governments. Comprehensive statutes and regulations govern the\nmanner in which we provide and bill for services and collect reimbursement from governmental programs and private payors, our contractual relationships and arrangements\nwith healthcare providers and vendors, our marketing activities and other aspects of our operations. Of particular importance are:\n• the federal Anti-Kickback Statute (the “AKS”), which prohibits the knowing and willful offer, payment, solicitation or receipt of any bribe, kickback, rebate or other\nremuneration for referring an individual, in return for ordering, leasing, purchasing or recommending or arranging for or to induce the referral of an individual or the\nordering, purchasing or leasing of items or services covered, in whole or in part, by any federal healthcare program, such as Medicare and Medicaid. Although there\nare several statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain common activities from prosecution, the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn\nnarrowly. By way of example, the AKS safe harbor for value-based arrangements requires,\nP3 Health Partners Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 33\nTable of Contents\namong other things, that the arrangement does not induce a person or entity to reduce or limit medically necessary items or services furnished to any patient. Failure\nto meet the requirements of a safe harbor, however, does not render an arrangement illegal, although such arrangements may be subject to greater scrutiny by\ngovernment authorities. Further, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it to have committed a violation;\n• the federal physician self-referral law (the “Stark Law”), which, subject to limited exceptions, prohibits physicians from referring Medicare or Medicaid patients to\nan entity for the provision of certain designated health services (“DHS”), if the physician or a member of such physician’s immediate family has a direct or indirect\nfinancial relationship (including an ownership interest or a compensation arrangement) with the entity, and prohibits the entity from billing Medicare or Medicaid\nfor such DHS. Unlike the AKS, the Stark Law is violated if the financial arrangement does not meet an applicable exception, regardless of any intent by the parties\nto induce or reward referrals or the reasons for the financial relationship and the referral;\n• the federal False Claims Act (the “FCA”), which imposes civil and criminal liability on individuals or entities that knowingly submit false or fraudulent claims for\npayment to the government or knowingly make, or cause to be made, a false statement in order to have a false claim paid, including qui tam or whistleblower suits.\nThere are many potential bases for liability under the FCA. The government has used the FCA to prosecute Medicare and other government healthcare program\nfraud; including alleged upcoding or improper coding of diagnosis codes under the risk-adjustment methodology, billing for services not provided, and providing\ncare that is not medically necessary or that is substandard in quality. In addition, we could be held liable under the FCA if we are deemed to “cause” the submission\nof false or fraudulent claims by, for example, providing inaccurate billing, coding or risk adjustment information to our affiliated professional entities and other\nphysician partners through Provider Portal and Analytic Management Tools, respectively. The government may also assert that a claim including items or services\nresulting from a violation of the AKS or Stark Law constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the FCA;\n• the Civil Monetary Penalties Statute, which prohibits, among other things, an individual or entity from offering remuneration to a federal healthcare program\nbeneficiary that the individual or entity knows or should know is likely to influence the beneficiary to order or receive healthcare items or services from a particular\nprovider;\n• the criminal healthcare fraud provisions of HIPAA and related rules that prohibit knowingly and willfully executing a scheme or artifice to defraud any healthcare\nbenefit program or falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any material false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the\ndelivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Similar to the AKS, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or\nspecific intent to violate it to have committed a violation;\n• reassignment of payment rules that prohibit certain types of billing and collection practices in connection with claims payable by the Medicare or Medicaid\nprograms;\n• similar state law provisions pertaining to anti-kickback, self-referral and false claims issues, some of which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any payor,\nincluding patients and commercial insurers;\n• laws that regulate debt collection practices;\n• a provision of the Social Security Act that imposes criminal penalties on healthcare providers who fail to disclose, or refund known overpayments;\n• federal and state laws that prohibit providers from billing and receiving payment from Medicare and Medicaid for services unless the services are medically\nnecessary, adequately and accurately documented, and billed using codes that accurately reflect the type and level of services rendered; and\n• federal and state laws pertaining to the provision of services by nurse practitioners and physician assistants in certain settings, physician supervision of those\nservices, and reimbursement requirements that depend on the types of services provided and documented and relationships between physician supervisors and nurse\npractitioners and physician assistants.\nP3 Health Partners Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 34\nTable of Contents\nThe laws and regulations in these areas are complex, changing and often subject to varying interpretations. As a result, there is no guarantee that a government\nauthority will find that we or our affiliated professional entities or other physician partners are in compliance with all such laws and regulations that apply to our business.\nFurther, because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of the statutory exceptions and safe harbors available, it is possible that some of the business activities\nundertaken by us or our affiliated professional entities or other physician partners could be subject to challenge under one or more of these laws, including, without limitation,\nour patient assistance programs that waive or reduce the patient’s obligation to pay copayments, coinsurance or deductible amounts owed for the services we provide to them if\nthey meet certain financial need criteria. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of such laws or any other governmental regulations that apply, we may be subject\nto significant penalties, including, without limitation, administrative, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, the curtailment or restructuring of operations,\nintegrity oversight and reporting obligations, exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs and imprisonment. In addition, any action against us or our\naffiliated professional entities or other physician partners for violation of these laws or regulations, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant\nlegal expenses, divert our management’s attention from the operation of our business and result in adverse publicity, or otherwise experience a material adverse impact on our\nbusiness, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows, reputation as a result.\nIf any of our affiliated professional entities, other physician partners or owned or managed clinics lose their regulatory licenses, permits, accreditations and/or\nregistrations, as applicable, or become ineligible to receive reimbursement under Medicare, Medicaid or other third-party payors, there may be a material adverse effect on\nour business, financial condition, cash flows, or results of operations.\nThe operations of our owned and managed clinics through our affiliated professional entities and other physician partners are subject to extensive federal, state and\nlocal regulation relating to, among other things, the adequacy of medical care, equipment, personnel, operating policies and procedures, fire prevention, rate-setting, compliance\nwith building codes and environmental protection and proof of financial ability to operate. Our owned and managed clinics and affiliated professional entities and other\nphysician partners are also subject to extensive laws and regulation relating to facility and professional licensure, conduct of operations, including financial relationships among\nhealthcare providers, Medicare, Medicaid and state fraud and abuse and physician self-referrals, and maintaining updates to our affiliated professional entities’ and other\nphysician partners’ enrollment in the Medicare and Medicaid programs, including the addition of new clinic locations, providers and other enrollment information. Our owned\nand managed clinics and affiliates professional entities are subject to periodic inspection by licensing authorities and accreditation organizations to assure their continued\ncompliance with these various standards. There can be no assurance that these regulatory authorities will determine that all applicable requirements are fully met at any given\ntime. Should any of our owned or managed clinics or affiliated professional entities be found to be noncompliant with these requirements, we could be assessed fines and\npenalties, could be required to refund reimbursement amounts or could lose our licensure or Medicare and/or Medicaid certification so that we or our affiliated professional\nentities and other physician partners are unable to receive reimbursement from such programs and possibly from other third-party payors, any of which could materially\nadversely affect our business, financial condition, cash flows or results of operations.\nIf our arrangements with our affiliated professional entities and other physician partners are found to constitute the improper rendering of medical services or fee splitting\nunder applicable state laws, our business, financial condition and our ability to operate in those states could be adversely impacted.\nOur contractual relationships with our affiliated professional entities and other physician partners may implicate certain state laws that generally prohibit non-\nprofessional entities from providing licensed medical services or exercising control over licensed physicians or other healthcare professionals (such activities generally referred\nto as the “corporate practice of medicine”) or engaging in certain practices such as fee-splitting with such licensed professionals. The interpretation and enforcement of these\nlaws vary significantly from state to state. There can be no assurance that these laws will be interpreted in a manner consistent with our practices or that other laws or\nregulations will not be enacted in the future that could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Regulatory authorities,\nstate boards of medicine, state attorneys general and other parties may assert that, despite the agreements through which we operate, we are engaged in the provision of medical\nservices and/or that our arrangements with our affiliated professional entities and other physician partners constitute unlawful fee-splitting. If a jurisdiction’s prohibition on the\ncorporate practice of medicine or fee-splitting is interpreted in a manner that is inconsistent with our practices, we would be required to restructure or terminate our\narrangements with our affiliated professional entities and other physician partners to bring our activities into compliance with such laws. A determination of non-compliance, or\nthe termination of or failure to successfully restructure these relationships could result in disciplinary action, penalties,\nP3 Health Partners Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 35\nTable of Contents\ndamages, fines, and/or a loss of revenue, any of which could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. State corporate\npractice and fee-splitting prohibitions also often impose penalties on healthcare professionals for aiding in the improper rendering of professional services, which could\ndiscourage physicians and other healthcare professionals from providing clinical services to members of the health plans with whom we contract.\nWe face inspections, reviews, audits and investigations under federal and state government programs and contracts. These audits could have adverse findings that may\nnegatively affect our business, including our results of operations, liquidity, financial condition and reputation.\nAs a result of our participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs, we are subject to various governmental inspections, reviews, audits and investigations to verify\nour compliance with these programs and applicable laws and regulations. Other third-party payors may also reserve the right to conduct audits. We also periodically conduct\ninternal audits and reviews of our regulatory compliance. An adverse inspection, review, audit or investigation could result in:\n• refunding amounts we have been paid pursuant to the Medicare or Medicaid programs or from payors;\n• state or federal agencies imposing fines, penalties and other sanctions on us;\n• temporary suspension of payment for new patients to the facility or agency;\n• decertification or exclusion from participation in the Medicare or Medicaid programs or one or more payor networks;\n• self-disclosure of violations to applicable regulatory authorities;\n• damage to our reputation;\n• the revocation of a facility’s or agency’s license;\n• criminal penalties;\n• a corporate integrity agreement with HHS’s Office of Inspector General; and\n• loss of certain rights under, or termination of, our contracts with payors.\nWe have in the past and will likely in the future be required to refund amounts we have been paid and/or pay fines and penalties as a result of these inspections,\nreviews, audits and investigations. If adverse inspections, reviews, audits or investigations occur and any of the results noted above occur, it could have a material adverse effect\non our business and operating results. Furthermore, the legal, document production and other costs associated with complying with these inspections, reviews, audits or\ninvestigations could be significant.\nOur records and submissions to a health plan may contain inaccurate or unsupportable information regarding risk adjustment scores of members, which could cause us to\noverstate or understate our revenue and subject us to various penalties.\nThe claims and encounter records that we submit to health plans may impact data that support the Medicare Risk Adjustment Factor (“RAF”) scores attributable to\nmembers. These RAF scores determine, in part, the revenue to which the health plans and, in turn, we or our affiliated professional entities or other physician partners are\nentitled for the provision of medical care to such members. The data submitted to CMS by each health plan is based, in part, on medical charts and diagnosis codes that we\nprepare and submit to the health plans. Each health plan generally relies on us and our affiliated professional entities or other physician partners to appropriately document and\nsupport such RAF data in our medical records. Each health plan also relies on us and our affiliated professional entities or other physician partners to appropriately code claims\nfor medical services provided to members. Erroneous claims and erroneous encounter records and submissions could result in inaccurate revenue and risk adjustment payments,\nwhich may be subject to correction or retroactive adjustment in later periods. This corrected or adjusted information may be reflected in financial statements for periods\nsubsequent to the period in which the revenue was recorded. We might also need to refund a portion of the revenue that we received, which refund, depending on its magnitude,\ncould damage our relationship with the applicable health plan and could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nP3 Health Partners Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 36\nTable of Contents\nAdditionally, CMS audits MA plans for documentation to support RAF-related payments for members chosen at random. The MA plans ask providers to submit the\nunderlying documentation for members that they serve. It is possible that claims associated with members with higher RAF scores could be subject to more scrutiny in a CMS\nor plan audit. There is a possibility that an MA plan may seek repayment from us should CMS make any payment adjustments to the MA plan as a result of its audits. The plans\nalso may hold us liable for any penalties owed to CMS for inaccurate or unsupportable RAF scores provided by us or our affiliated professional entities or other physician\npartners. In addition, we could be liable for penalties to the government under the federal FCA, that include a monetary penalty adjusted for inflation on an annual basis for each\nfalse claim, plus up to three times the amount of damages caused by each false claim, which can be as much as the amounts received directly or indirectly from the government\nfor each such false claim.\nCMS has indicated that payment adjustments will not be limited to RAF scores for the specific MA enrollees for which errors are found but may also be extrapolated\nto the entire MA plan subject to a particular CMS contract. Based on a recent final rule issued by CMS in January 2023, although 2011 to 2017 plan years are still subject to\naudit, overpayments to MA plans that are identified as a result of a Risk Adjustment Data Validation (“RADV”), audit will only be subject to extrapolation for plan year 2018\nand any subsequent plan year. In addition, CMS will not apply an adjustment factor, known as a FFS Adjuster, in RADV audits to account for potential differences in diagnostic\ncoding between the MA program and Medicare FFS program. We are continuing to assess the potential impact this final rule may have on our business and operations.\nOn March 31, 2023, CMS issued its final 2024 Medicare Advantage Rate Announcement, which implements a three-year phase-in of certain changes to the\nmethodology CMS will use to perform risk adjustment for plan years 2024 through 2026. Under the new risk adjustment model that was implemented in 2024, CMS has\nchanged the manner by which over 2,000 diagnosis codes, across a range of disease and condition categories, are considered for purposes of patient risk scoring, with certain of\nthese codes no longer impacting risk scoring. While the codes subject to changes represent only a fraction of the total number of conditions considered for purposes of risk\nadjustment, this change and any future changes to CMS’s risk adjustment methodology could impact the revenue we record from Medicare Advantage plans.\nThere can be no assurance that a health plan will not be randomly selected or targeted for review by CMS or that the outcome of such a review will not result in a\nmaterial adjustment in our revenue and profitability, even if the information we submitted to the plan is accurate and supportable.\nThe impact on us of recent healthcare legislation and other changes in the healthcare industry and in healthcare spending is currently unknown, but may adversely affect\nour business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe impact on us of healthcare reform legislation and other changes in the healthcare industry and in healthcare spending is currently unknown, but may adversely\naffect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our revenue is dependent on the healthcare industry and could be affected by changes in healthcare spending,\nreimbursement and policy. The healthcare industry is subject to changing political, regulatory and other influences. By way of example, the ACA, which was enacted in 2010,\nmade major changes in how healthcare is delivered and reimbursed, and it increased access to health insurance benefits to the uninsured and underinsured populations of the\nUnited States.\nSince its enactment, there have been judicial, executive and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA. On June 17, 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court\ndismissed the most recent judicial challenge to the ACA brought by several states without specifically ruling on the constitutionality of the ACA.\nOther legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted. These changes include aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to\nproviders, which began in 2013 and will remain in effect through the first six months of fiscal year 2032, with the exception of a temporary suspension from May 1, 2020\nthrough March 31, 2022, unless additional Congressional action is taken. In January 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was signed into law, which, among other\nthings, further reduced Medicare payments to several types of providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of\nlimitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. New laws may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other\nhealthcare funding, which may materially adversely affect consumer demand and affordability for our products and services and, accordingly, the results of our financial\noperations. Additional changes that may affect our business include the expansion of new programs such as Medicare payment for performance initiatives for physicians under\nthe Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015 (“MACRA”), which first affected physician payment in 2019. At this time, it is unclear how the introduction of the\nMedicare quality payment program will impact overall physician reimbursement.\nP3 Health Partners Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 37\nTable of Contents\nSuch changes in the regulatory environment may also result in changes to our payer mix that may affect our operations and revenue. In addition, certain provisions of\nthe ACA authorize voluntary demonstration projects, which include the development of bundling payments for acute, inpatient hospital services, physician services and post-\nacute services for episodes of hospital care. Further, the ACA may adversely affect payors by increasing medical costs generally, which could have an effect on the industry and\npotentially impact our business and revenue as payors seek to offset these increases by reducing costs in other areas.\nIn addition, new legislative proposals to reform healthcare and government insurance programs, along with the trend toward managed healthcare in the United States,\ncould result in reduced demand and prices for our services. We expect that additional state and federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which\ncould limit the amounts that federal and state governments and other third-party payers will pay for healthcare products and services, which could adversely affect our business,\nfinancial condition and results of operations.\nThe evolving regulation of value-based reimbursement models may have a material adverse effect on our operations.\nRegulation of downstream risk-sharing arrangements, including, but not limited to, global risk and other value-based arrangements, varies significantly from state to\nstate. Some states require downstream entities and risk-bearing entities to obtain an insurance license, a certificate of authority, or an equivalent authorization, in order to\nparticipate in downstream risk-sharing arrangements with payors. In some states, statutes, regulations and/or formal guidance explicitly address whether and in what manner the\nstate regulates the transfer of risk by a payor to a downstream entity. However, the majority of states do not explicitly address the issue, and in such states, regulators may\nnonetheless interpret statutes and regulations to regulate such activity. If downstream risk-sharing arrangements are not regulated directly in a particular state, the state\nregulatory agency may nonetheless require oversight by the licensed payor as the party to such a downstream risk-sharing arrangement. Such oversight is accomplished via\ncontract and may include the imposition of reserve requirements, as well as reporting obligations. Further, state regulatory stances regarding downstream risk-sharing\narrangements can change rapidly and codified provisions may not keep pace with evolving risk-sharing mechanisms and other new value-based reimbursement models. Certain\nof the states where we currently operate or may choose to operate in the future regulate the operations and financial condition of risk bearing organizations like us and our\naffiliated providers. These regulations can include capital requirements, licensing or certification, governance controls and other similar matters. As a result, new and existing\nlaws, regulations or guidance could have a material adverse effect on our operations and could subject us to the risk of restructuring or terminating our arrangements with our\naffiliated professional entities or other physician partners, as well as the risk of regulatory enforcement, penalties and sanctions, if state and federal enforcement agencies\ndisagree with our interpretation of these laws. While these regulations have not had a material impact on our business to date, as we continue to expand, these rules may require\nadditional resources and capitalization and add complexity to our business.\nRegulatory proposals directed at containing or lowering the cost of healthcare, including the Direct Contracting Model, and our participation, voluntary or otherwise, in\nsuch proposed models, could impact our business, financial condition, cash flows and operations.\nThe ACA also required CMS to establish a Medicare shared savings program that promotes accountability and coordination of care through the creation of ACOs. The\nMedicare shared savings program allows for providers, physicians and other designated healthcare professionals and suppliers to form ACOs and voluntarily work together to\ninvest in infrastructure and redesign delivery processes to give coordinated high quality care to their Medicare patients, avoid unnecessary duplication of services and prevent\nmedical errors. ACOs that achieve quality performance standards established by CMS are eligible to share in a portion of the Medicare program’s cost savings. We have an\nACO in Arizona participating in the Medicare Shared Savings Plan (“MSSP”), and is subject to ACO program methodologies and participation requirements that are updated by\nCMS for each performance year. We and our affiliated providers as ACO participants are expected to comply with such program requirements and are required to report to CMS\non performance after the close of the year. Failure to comply with such program requirements could subject us and our affiliated providers to significant penalties and, in some\ncases, termination from participating in MSSP.\nAdditionally, the CMS Innovation Center continues to test an array of value-based alternative payment models, including the Accountable Care Organization\nRealizing Equity, Access, and Community Health (“ACO REACH”) Model (formerly known as the Global and Professional Direct Contracting Model) to allow REACH ACOs\nto negotiate directly with the government to manage traditional Medicare beneficiaries and share in the savings and risks generated from managing such beneficiaries. Although\nwe currently do not participate in these pilot payment models, we may choose to do so in the future. Additional changes that may affect our business include the expansion of\nnew programs such as Medicare\nP3 Health Partners Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 38\nTable of Contents\npayment for performance initiatives for physicians under the MACRA, which first affected physician payment in 2019. At this time, it is unclear how the introduction of the\nMedicare quality payment program will impact overall physician reimbursement. In addition, there likely will continue to be regulatory proposals directed at containing or\nlowering the cost of healthcare, as government healthcare programs and other third-party payors transition from FFS to value-based reimbursement models, which can include\nrisk-sharing, bundled payment and other innovative approaches. It is possible that the federal or state governments will implement additional reductions, increases, or changes in\nreimbursement in the future under government programs that may adversely affect us or increase the cost of providing our services. The implementation of cost containment\nmeasures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue or attain growth, any of which could have a material impact on our business.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nWe have identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. If we fail to establish and maintain effective internal controls in\naccordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or file our periodic reports in a timely manner, which\nmay cause adverse effects on our business and may cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information and may lead to a decline in the price of our\nClass A common stock.\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the “Sarbanes-Oxley Act”) requires, among other things, that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal\ncontrol over financial reporting. We are required to furnish a report by management on, among other things, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting\npursuant to Section 404(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act in our annual reports. This assessment must include disclosure of any material weaknesses identified by our management\nin our internal control over financial reporting. As a result of no longer qualifying as an “emerging growth company” as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of\n2012, we are also required to comply with, among other requirements, the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.\nEffective internal control over financial reporting is necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports in a timely manner. When evaluating our internal control over\nfinancial reporting, we have identified, and we may in the future identify additional, material weaknesses that we may not be able to remediate in a timely manner. In connection\nwith the audits of our consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2019, 2020 and 2021, and, as previously reported, the restatement of our\nconsolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we concluded that there were material weaknesses in our internal control over financial\nreporting, which continued to exist as of December 31, 2023. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting,\nsuch that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. These\nmaterial weaknesses are specifically attributed to the following: (i) we did not have adequate policies and procedures or sufficient qualified resources with appropriate technical\nknowledge to maintain effective internal controls over the accounting related to significant accounts and related financial statement disclosures; (ii) we did not design and\nimplement a sufficient risk assessment process to identify and assess risks impacting internal control over financial reporting; (iii) we had ineffective evaluation and\ndetermination as to whether the components of internal control were present and functioning; (iv) we did not design and implement effective information technology general\ncontrols in the areas of user access related to certain information technology systems that support our financial reporting process, (v) we did not maintain sufficient segregation\nof duties over the performance of control activities for financial close and reporting, including over the review of account reconciliations and journal entries; (vi) we did not\ndesign and maintain effective management review controls at a sufficient level of precision over all financial statement areas. This material weakness resulted in certain\nmaterial corrections to the financial statements; and (vii) we did not design and maintain effective controls at a sufficient level of precision over the estimation of claims\nexpense and payable including controls over the review of historical claims data, including the completeness and accuracy of data used to determine the financial statement\namounts.\nWe have taken and are taking steps discussed under the heading “Remediation Activities” in Part II, Item 9A, “Controls and Procedures” to remediate these material\nweaknesses. However, we are still in the process of implementing these steps and cannot assure investors that these measures will significantly improve or remediate the\nmaterial weaknesses described above. We have identified other deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting that have not risen to the level of a material\nweakness, which we are in the process of remediating.\nOur failure to successfully remediate the material weaknesses and to implement and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could cause us to be\nunable to maintain compliance with securities law requirements\nP3 Health Partners Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 39\nTable of Contents\nregarding timely filing of periodic reports, could expose us to an increased risk of financial reporting fraud and the misappropriation of assets, could result in errors or\nmisstatements in our financial statements that could result in loss of investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports and a decline in our stock\nprice, and we could be subject to potential delisting from Nasdaq or to other regulatory investigations and civil or criminal sanctions or investigations by the SEC or other\nregulatory authorities.\nIn addition, even if we remediate the material weaknesses, we will be required to expend significant time and resources to further improve our internal controls over\nfinancial reporting, including by further expanding our finance and accounting staff to meet the demands placed upon us as a public company, including the requirements of the\nSarbanes-Oxley Act. If we fail to adequately staff our accounting and finance function to remediate our material weaknesses or fail to maintain adequate internal control over\nfinancial reporting, any new or recurring material weaknesses could prevent our management from concluding that our internal control over financial reporting is effective and\nimpair our ability to prevent material misstatements in our financial statements, which could cause our business to suffer.\nWe cannot predict the impact our dual-class structure may have on the stock price of our Class A common stock.\nWe cannot predict whether our dual-class structure will result in a lower or more volatile market price of our Class A common stock or in adverse publicity or other\nadverse consequences. Certain investors, including large institutional investors, may prefer companies that do not have multiple share classes or may have investment guidelines\nthat preclude them from investing in companies that have multiple share classes. In addition, certain index providers have previously implemented, and may in the future\ndetermine to implement, restrictions on including companies with multiple share classes in certain of their indices. For example, from July 2017 to April 2023, S&P Dow Jones\nexcluded companies with multiple share classes from the S&P Composite 1500 (composed of the S&P 500, S&P MidCap 400 and S&P SmallCap 600). Indices have discretion\nto reassess and implement such policies with respect to multi-class differing voting right structures. Under any such policies, our dual-class capital structure would make us\nineligible for inclusion in any of these indices. As a result, the market price of our Class A common stock could be materially adversely affected.\nDelaware law and our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain certain provisions, including anti-takeover provisions that limit the ability of stockholders to take\ncertain actions and could delay or discourage takeover attempts that stockholders may consider favorable.\nOur certificate of incorporation and bylaws, and the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (“DGCL”), contain provisions that could have the effect of\nrendering more difficult, delaying, or preventing an acquisition that stockholders may consider favorable, including transactions in which stockholders might otherwise receive\na premium for their shares. These provisions could also limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of Class A common stock, and therefore\ndepress the trading price of Class A common stock. These provisions could also make it difficult for stockholders to take certain actions, including electing directors who are not\nnominated by the current members of our board of directors or taking other corporate actions, including effecting changes in our management. Among other things, the\ncertificate of incorporation and the bylaws include provisions:\n• providing for a classified board of directors with staggered, three-year terms;\n• regarding the ability of the board of directors to issue shares of preferred stock, including “blank check” preferred stock and to determine the price and other terms\nof those shares, including preferences and voting rights, without stockholder approval, which could be used to significantly dilute the ownership of a hostile\nacquirer;\n• prohibiting cumulative voting in the election of directors, which limits the ability of minority stockholders to elect director candidates;\n• regarding the limitation of the liability of, and the indemnification of, directors and officers;\n• providing that certain transactions are not “corporate opportunities” and that, subject to certain exceptions, Foresight Sponsor Group, LLC, (the “Sponsor”) or the\nChicago Pacific Founders funds or their respective affiliates and any of their respective principals, members, directors, partners, stockholders, officers, employees or\nother representatives, or any director or stockholder who is not employed by us or our subsidiaries, are not subject to the doctrine of corporate opportunity and such\npersons do not have any\nP3 Health Partners Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 40\nTable of Contents\nfiduciary duty to refrain from engaging directly or indirectly in the same or similar business activities or lines of business as us or any of our subsidiaries;\n• regarding the ability of the board of directors to amend the bylaws, which may allow the board of directors to take additional actions to prevent an unsolicited\ntakeover and inhibit the ability of an acquiror to amend the bylaws to facilitate an unsolicited takeover attempt; and\n• regarding advance notice procedures with which stockholders must comply to nominate candidates to the board of directors or to propose matters to be acted upon at\na stockholders’ meeting, which could preclude stockholders from bringing matters before annual or special meetings of stockholders and delay changes in the board\nof directors and also may discourage or deter a potential acquirer from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect the acquirer’s own slate of directors or otherwise\nattempting to obtain control of our company.\nThese provisions, alone or together, could delay or prevent hostile takeovers and changes in control or changes in our board of directors or management.\nThe Sponsor and the Chicago Pacific Founders funds, and their respective affiliates and representatives, non-employee directors and other non-employee stockholders are\nnot limited in their ability to compete with us, and the corporate opportunity provisions in our certificate of incorporation could enable such persons to benefit from\ncorporate opportunities that might otherwise be available to us, which presents potential conflicts of interest.\nOur certificate of incorporation provides that subject to certain exceptions, the Sponsor and the Chicago Pacific Founders funds and their respective affiliates and any\nof their respective principals, members, directors, partners, stockholders, officers, employees or other representatives, or any director or stockholder who is not employed by us\nor our subsidiaries, would not be restricted from owning assets or engaging in businesses that compete directly or indirectly with us or any of our subsidiaries. In particular,\nsubject to the limitations of applicable law and the certificate of incorporation, these persons may among other things:\n• engage in a corporate opportunity in the same or similar business activities or lines of business in which we or our affiliates have a reasonable expectancy interest or\nproperty right;\n• purchase, sell or otherwise engage in transactions involving securities or indebtedness of us or our affiliates, provided that such transactions do not violate our\ninsider trading policies; and\n• otherwise compete with us.\nOne or more of these persons may become aware, from time to time, of certain business opportunities (such as acquisition opportunities) and may direct such\nopportunities to other businesses in which they have invested, in which case we may not become aware of or otherwise have the ability to pursue such opportunities. Further,\nsuch businesses may choose to compete with us for these opportunities, possibly causing these opportunities to not be available to us or causing them to be more expensive for\nus to pursue. As a result, our renunciation of our interest and expectancy in any business opportunity that may be from time to time be presented to such persons, could\nadversely impact our business or prospects if attractive business opportunities are procured by such parties for their own benefit rather than for ours.\nThe provision of our certificate of incorporation requiring exclusive forum in certain courts in the State of Delaware or the federal district courts of the United States for\ncertain types of lawsuits may have the effect of discouraging lawsuits against our directors and officers.\nOur certificate of incorporation requires, to the fullest extent permitted by law, that (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our company’s behalf, (ii) any\naction asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers or stockholders to our company or our stockholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim\nagainst our company arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL or the certificate of incorporation or our bylaws or (iv) any action asserting a claim against our company\ngoverned by the internal affairs doctrine will have to be brought in a state court located within the State of Delaware (or if no state court of the State of Delaware has\njurisdiction, the federal district court for the District of Delaware), in all cases subject to the courts having personal jurisdiction over the indispensable parties named as\ndefendants. The foregoing provision will not apply to claims seeking to enforce any liability or duty created by the Exchange Act.\nP3 Health Partners Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 41\nTable of Contents\nAdditionally, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the federal district courts of the United States of America shall be the exclusive\nforum for the resolution of any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act.\nAlthough we believe these exclusive forum provisions benefit our company by providing increased consistency in the application of Delaware law and federal\nsecurities laws in the types of lawsuits to which each applies, the exclusive forum provisions may limit a stockholder’s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds\nfavorable for disputes with us or any of our directors, officers or stockholders, which may discourage lawsuits with respect to such claims. Further, in the event a court finds\neither exclusive forum provision contained in our certificate of incorporation to be unenforceable or inapplicable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with\nresolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nAn active, liquid trading market for our Class A common stock may not be sustained.\nThere can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain an active trading market for our Class A common stock on Nasdaq or any other exchange in the future. If an\nactive market for our Class A common stock is not maintained, or if we fail to satisfy the continued listing standards of Nasdaq for any reason and our Class A common stock is\ndelisted, it may be difficult for our stockholders to sell their Class A common stock without depressing the market price for our Class A common stock, or at all. An inactive\ntrading market may also impair our ability to both raise capital by selling shares of capital stock, attract and motivate employees through equity incentive awards and acquire\nother companies, products, or technologies by using shares of capital stock as consideration.\nThere may be sales of a substantial amount of our Class A common stock in future by our stockholders, and these sales could cause the price of our Class A common stock\nto fall.\nAs of December 31, 2023, there were approximately 116.6 million shares of Class A common stock outstanding and an additional approximately 196.6 million shares\nof Class V common stock, which are exchangeable, together with P3 LLC units, for an equivalent number of shares of Class A common stock. Our issued and outstanding\nshares of Class A common stock are freely transferable, except for any shares held by our “affiliates,” as that term is defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act. As of\nDecember 31, 2023, approximately 65.1% of the outstanding shares of Class A common stock (on an as-converted and as-exchanged basis) were held by entities affiliated with\nus and our executive officers and directors.\nIn addition, pursuant to the Amended and Restated Registration Rights Agreement, as further amended, that we entered into with certain of our stockholders, we are\nobligated to register the resale of shares of Class A common stock held by such stockholders and issuable upon the exercise or exchange of securities held by such stockholders.\nIn addition, these stockholders are entitled to demand the registration of such shares of Class A common stock subject to certain minimum requirements and also have certain\n“piggyback” registration rights with respect to registration statements we file.\nUpon effectiveness of any registration statement we file for the resale of shares held by such stockholders, and upon the expiration of the lock-up periods applicable to\nsuch stockholders, these stockholders may sell large amounts of our Class A common stock in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions, which could have the\neffect of increasing the volatility in the share price of our Class A common stock or putting significant downward pressure on the price of our Class A common stock.\nSales of substantial amounts of our Class A common stock in the public market, or the perception that such sales will occur, could adversely affect the market price of\nour Class A common stock and make it difficult for us to raise funds through securities offerings in the future.\nThere can be no assurance that we will be able to comply with the continued listing standards of Nasdaq.\nIf Nasdaq delists our securities from trading on its exchange for failure to meet the listing standards, we could face significant material adverse consequences\nincluding:\n• a limited availability of market quotations for our securities;\n• reduced liquidity for our securities;\nP3 Health Partners Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 42\nTable of Contents\n• a determination that our Class A common stock is a “penny stock,” which will require brokers trading in our Class A common stock to adhere to more stringent\nrules and possibly result in a reduced level of trading activity in the secondary trading market for our securities;\n• a limited amount of news and analyst coverage; and\n• a decreased ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future.\nFor example, in each of May 2022 and August 2022, we received notifications from the listing qualifications department of Nasdaq indicating that as a result of our\ndelinquency in the filing of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021 and our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarterly periods\nended March 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, respectively, we were not in compliance with the requirements for continued listing under Listing Rule 5250(c)(1) (the “Listing\nRule”), which requires listed companies to timely file all required periodic financial reports with the SEC. In October 2022, we regained compliance with the Listing Rule\nfollowing the filing of our three delinquent periodic reports with the SEC; however, there is no assurance that we will remain in compliance with the listing requirements of\nNasdaq in the future. We cannot guarantee that any actions we take to prevent future non-compliance or to regain compliance with Nasdaq’s listing requirements in the future\nwill be successful.\nRisks Related to Our Warrants\nOur warrants may have an adverse effect on the market price of our Class A common stock.\nForesight issued 10.8 million warrants to purchase shares of our Class A common stock (the “Public Warrants”) as part of the units offered in its initial public offering\nand, simultaneously with the closing of its initial public offering, Foresight issued in a private placement an aggregate of 0.8 million units, including (i) an aggregate of 0.3\nmillion private placement warrants, each exercisable to purchase one share of Class A common stock at $11.50 per share, subject to adjustment (the “Private Placement\nWarrants”), and (ii) an aggregate of 0.8 million shares of Class A common stock.\nIn addition, on December 13, 2022, in connection with our issuance of the VGS Promissory Note (see Note 11 “Debt” to the consolidated financial statements included\nelsewhere in this Form 10-K), we issued to VGS warrants to purchase 0.4 million shares of Class A common stock.\nFurthermore, in the March 2023 Private Placement (as defined herein), we issued Common Warrants to purchase an aggregate of 59.9 million shares of Class A\ncommon stock and Pre-Funded Warrants to purchase an aggregate of 10.8 million shares of Class A common stock.\nTo the extent such warrants are exercised, additional shares of our Class A common stock will be issued, which will result in dilution to our stockholders and increase\nthe number of shares of Class A common stock eligible for resale in the public market. Sales of substantial numbers of such shares in the public market or the fact that such\nwarrants may be exercised could adversely affect the market price of our Class A common stock.\nWe may redeem your unexpired Public Warrants prior to their exercise at a time that is disadvantageous to you, thereby making your Public Warrants worthless.\nWe have the ability to redeem outstanding Public Warrants at any time after they become exercisable and prior to their expiration, at a price of $0.01 per Public\nWarrant if, among other things, the last reported sales price of our Class A common stock equals or exceeds $18.00 per share (as adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends,\nreorganizations, recapitalizations and the like) for any 20 trading days within a 30 trading-day period ending on the third trading day prior to the date we send the notice of such\nredemption to the Public Warrant holders. If and when the Public Warrants become redeemable by us, we may exercise our redemption right even if we are unable to register or\nqualify the underlying securities for sale under all applicable state securities laws. Redemption of the outstanding Public Warrants could force you (i) to exercise your Public\nWarrants and pay the exercise price therefor at a time when it may be disadvantageous for you to do so, (ii) to sell your Public Warrants at the then-current market price when\nyou might otherwise wish to hold your Public Warrants or (iii) to accept the nominal redemption price which, at the time the outstanding Public Warrants are called for\nredemption, is likely to be substantially less than the market value of your Public Warrants.\nIn addition, we may redeem your Public Warrants commencing 90 days after they become exercisable and prior to their expiration, at a price of $0.10 per Public\nWarrant if, among other things, the last reported sale price of our Class A\nP3 Health Partners Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 43\nTable of Contents\ncommon stock equals or exceeds $10.00 per share (as adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like) on the trading day prior to the\ndate on which we send the notice of redemption to the Public Warrant holders. In such a case, the holders will be able to exercise their Public Warrants for cash or on a cashless\nbasis prior to redemption and receive that number of shares of Class A common stock determined based on the redemption date and the fair market value of our Class A\ncommon stock. The value received upon exercise of the Public Warrants (1) may be less than the value the holders would have received if they had exercised their Public\nWarrants at a later time where the underlying share price is higher and (2) may not compensate the holders for the value of the Public Warrants, including because the number of\nshares of Class A common stock received in connection with such an exercise is capped at 0.361 shares of Class A common stock per whole Public Warrant (subject to\nadjustment) irrespective of the remaining life of the Public Warrants.\nNone of the Private Placement Warrants will be redeemable by us so long as they are held by the Sponsor or its permitted transferees.\nCertain of our warrants are accounted for as liabilities and the changes in value of these warrants could have a material effect on our financial results.\nOn April 12, 2021, the Acting Chief Accountant and Acting Director of the Division of Corporation Finance of the SEC published a statement on the SEC’s website\nindicating that the terms of the public and private warrants issued by many special purpose acquisition companies may need to be accounted for as liabilities, rather than as\nequity (the “SEC Warrant Accounting Statement”). As a result of the SEC Warrant Accounting Statement, Foresight, along with many other current and former special purpose\nacquisition companies, concluded that certain warrants should be presented as liabilities with subsequent fair value remeasurement and engaged a valuation firm to determine\nthe fair market value of its warrants. Accordingly, Foresight reevaluated the accounting treatment of the Public Warrants to purchase 10.8 million shares of Class A common\nstock and Private Placement Warrants to purchase 0.3 million shares of Class A common stock, and determined to classify all of the warrants as derivative liabilities measured\nat fair value, with changes in fair value each period reported in earnings.\nAs a result, included on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2023 contained elsewhere in this Form 10-K are derivative liabilities related to embedded\nfeatures contained within the warrants. Accounting Standards Codification 815, Derivatives and Hedging, provides for the remeasurement of the fair value of such derivatives at\neach balance sheet date, with a resulting non-cash gain or loss related to the change in the fair value being recognized in earnings in the statements of operations. As a result of\nthe recurring fair value measurement, our financial statements and results of operations may fluctuate quarterly, based on factors, which are outside of its control. Due to the\nrecurring fair value measurement, we expect that we will recognize non-cash gains or losses on our warrants each reporting period and that the amount of such gains or losses\ncould be material.\nRisks Related to the Tax Receivable Agreement\nOur sole material asset is our interest in P3 LLC, and, accordingly, we depend on distributions from P3 LLC to pay our taxes and expenses, including payments under the\nTax Receivable Agreement. P3 LLC’s ability to make such distributions may be subject to various limitations and restrictions.\nWe are a holding company and have no material assets other than our ownership in P3 LLC. As such, we have no independent means of generating revenue or cash\nflow, and our ability to pay taxes and operating expenses or declare and pay dividends in the future, if any, will be dependent upon the financial results and cash flows of P3\nLLC and its subsidiaries, and distributions we receive from P3 LLC. There can be no assurance that P3 LLC and its subsidiaries will generate sufficient cash flow to distribute\nfunds to us, or that applicable state law and contractual restrictions, including negative covenants in any debt agreements of P3 LLC or its subsidiaries, will permit such\ndistributions. The credit agreement governing P3 LLC’s credit facilities restrict its ability to make distributions to the Company, and future debt instruments or other agreements\nmay restrict the ability of P3 LLC to make distributions to the Company or of P3 LLC’s subsidiaries to make distributions to P3 LLC.\nP3 LLC will continue to be treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes and, as such, generally will not be subject to any entity-level U.S. federal\nincome tax. Instead, taxable income will be allocated to holders of P3 LLC Units, including us. Accordingly, we will incur income taxes on our allocable share of any net\ntaxable income of P3 LLC. Under the terms of the P3 LLC A&R LLC Agreement, P3 LLC will be obligated, subject to various limitations and restrictions, including with\nrespect to any debt agreements, to make tax distributions to holders of P3 LLC Units, including\nP3 Health Partners Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 44\nTable of Contents\nus. In addition to tax expenses, we will also incur expenses related to our operations, including payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement, which could be substantial. We\nintend, as its sole manager, to cause P3 LLC to make cash distributions to the owners of P3 LLC Units in an amount sufficient to (i) fund all of such owners’ tax obligations in\nrespect of taxable income allocated to such owners and (ii) cover our operating expenses, including payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement. However, P3 LLC’s ability\nto make such distributions may be subject to various limitations and restrictions, such as restrictions on distributions under contracts or agreements to which P3 LLC is then a\nparty, including debt agreements, or any applicable law, or that would have the effect of rendering P3 LLC insolvent. If P3 LLC does not have sufficient funds to pay tax or\nother liabilities or to fund its operations, it may have to borrow funds, which could materially adversely affect its liquidity and financial condition and subject it to various\nrestrictions imposed by any such lenders. To the extent that we are unable to make timely payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement for any reason, the unpaid amounts\nwill be deferred and will accrue interest until paid. Our failure to make any payment required under the Tax Receivable Agreement (including any accrued and unpaid interest)\nwithin 90 calendar days of the date on which the payment is required to be made will constitute a material breach of a material obligation under the Tax Receivable Agreement,\nwhich will terminate the Tax Receivable Agreement and accelerate future payments thereunder, unless the applicable payment is not made because (i) P3 LLC is prohibited\nfrom making such payment under the terms of the Tax Receivable Agreement or the terms governing certain of its indebtedness or (ii) P3 LLC does not have, and despite using\ncommercially reasonable efforts cannot obtain, sufficient funds to make such payment. In addition, if P3 LLC does not have sufficient funds to make distributions, its ability to\ndeclare and pay cash dividends will also be restricted or impaired.\nUnder the P3 LLC A&R LLC Agreement, P3 LLC will, from time to time, make distributions in cash to its equityholders (including us) pro rata, in amounts at least\nsufficient to cover the taxes on their allocable share of taxable income of P3 LLC. As a result of (i) potential differences in the amount of net taxable income allocable to us and\nto P3 LLC’s other equityholders, (ii) the lower tax rates currently applicable to corporations as opposed to individuals, and (iii) the favorable tax benefits that we anticipate from\nany purchase of P3 Existing Units in connection with the Business Combinations and future redemptions or exchanges by the P3 Equityholders of P3 LLC Units for Class A\ncommon stock or cash pursuant to the P3 LLC A&R LLC Agreement, tax distributions payable to us may be in amounts that exceed our actual tax liabilities with respect to the\nrelevant taxable year, including our obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement. Our board of directors will determine the appropriate uses for any excess cash so\naccumulated, which may include, among other uses, the payment of other expenses or dividends on our stock, although we will have no obligation to distribute such cash (or\nother available cash) to our stockholders. Except as otherwise determined by us as the sole manager of P3 LLC, no adjustments to the exchange ratio for P3 LLC Units and\ncorresponding shares of our Class A common stock will be made as a result of any cash distribution by us or any retention of cash by us. To the extent we do not distribute such\nexcess cash as dividends on our Class A common stock, we may take other actions with respect to such excess cash, for example, holding such excess cash or lending it (or a\nportion thereof) to P3 LLC, which may result in shares of our Class A common stock increasing in value relative to the value of P3 LLC Units. The holders of P3 LLC Units\nmay benefit from any value attributable to such cash balances if they acquire shares of our Class A common stock in exchange for their P3 LLC Units, notwithstanding that such\nholders may previously have participated as holders of P3 LLC Units in distributions by P3 LLC that resulted in such excess cash balances.\nWe will be required to make payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement for certain tax benefits we may claim, and the amounts of such payments could be significant.\nWe are party to the Tax Receivable Agreement with certain of the P3 Equityholders and P3 LLC. The Tax Receivable Agreement generally provides for the payment\nby us to the P3 Equityholders of 85% of the income tax benefits, if any, that we actually realize (or are deemed to realize in certain circumstances) in periods after the closing as\na result of: (i) increases in our proportionate share of the tax basis of P3 LLC’s assets resulting from Business Combinations, future redemptions or exchanges by the P3\nEquityholders of P3 LLC Units for our Class A common stock or cash and certain distributions (or deemed distributions) by P3 LLC; and (ii) certain other tax benefits resulting\nfrom payments we make under the Tax Receivable Agreement. We will retain the benefit of the remaining 15% of these cash savings. The amount of the cash payments that we\nmay be required to make under the Tax Receivable Agreement could be significant and is dependent upon significant future events and assumptions, including the timing of the\nexchanges of P3 LLC units, the price of our Class A common stock at the time of each exchange, the extent to which such exchanges are taxable transactions and the amount of\nthe exchanging P3 Equityholder’s tax basis in its P3 LLC units at the time of the relevant exchange. The amount of such cash payments is also based on assumptions as to the\namount and timing of taxable income we generate in the future, the U.S. federal income tax rate then applicable and the portion of our payments under the Tax Receivable\nAgreement that constitute interest or give rise to depreciable or amortizable tax basis. Moreover, payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement will be based on the tax\nreporting positions that we determine, which tax reporting positions are\nP3 Health Partners Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 45\nTable of Contents\nsubject to challenge by taxing authorities. We will be dependent on distributions from P3 LLC to make payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement, and we cannot\nguarantee that such distributions will be made in sufficient amounts or at the times needed to enable us to make our required payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement, or\nat all. Any payments made by us to the P3 Equityholders under the Tax Receivable Agreement will generally reduce the amount of overall cash flow that might have otherwise\nbeen available to us. The payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement are also not conditioned upon the P3 Equityholders maintaining a continued ownership interest in P3\nLLC or us.\nIn certain cases, payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement may be accelerated and/or significantly exceed the actual benefits, if any, we realize in respect of the tax\nattributes subject to the Tax Receivable Agreement.\nThe Tax Receivable Agreement provides that if we breach any of our material obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement, if we undergo a change of control or\nif, at any time, we elect an early termination of the Tax Receivable Agreement, then the Tax Receivable Agreement will terminate and our obligations, or our successor’s\nobligations, to make payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement would accelerate and become immediately due and payable. The amount due and payable in those\ncircumstances is determined based on certain assumptions, including an assumption that we would have sufficient taxable income to fully utilize all potential future tax benefits\nthat are subject to the Tax Receivable Agreement. We may need to incur debt to finance payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement to the extent our cash resources are\ninsufficient to meet our obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement as a result of timing discrepancies or otherwise.\nAs a result of the foregoing, (i) we could be required to make cash payments to the P3 Equityholders that are greater than the specified percentage of the actual benefits\nwe ultimately realize in respect of the tax benefits that are subject to the Tax Receivable Agreement, and (ii) we would be required to make a cash payment equal to the present\nvalue of the anticipated future tax benefits that are the subject of the Tax Receivable Agreement, which payment may be made significantly in advance of the actual realization,\nif any, of such future tax benefits. In these situations, our obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement could have a substantial negative impact on our liquidity and could\nhave the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing certain mergers, asset sales, other forms of business combination, or other changes of control due to the additional\ntransaction costs a potential acquirer may attribute to satisfying such obligations. There can be no assurance that we will be able to finance our obligations under the Tax\nReceivable Agreement.\nWe will not be reimbursed for any payments made to P3 Equityholders under the Tax Receivable Agreement in the event that any tax benefits are disallowed.\nWe will not be reimbursed for any cash payments previously made to the P3 Equityholders pursuant to the Tax Receivable Agreement if any tax benefits initially\nclaimed by us are subsequently challenged by a taxing authority and are ultimately disallowed. Instead, any excess cash payments made by us to a P3 Equityholder will be\nnetted against any future cash payments that we might otherwise be required to make under the terms of the Tax Receivable Agreement. However, a challenge to any tax\nbenefits initially claimed by us may not arise for a number of years following the initial time of such payment or, even if challenged early, such excess cash payment may be\ngreater than the amount of future cash payments that we might otherwise be required to make under the terms of the Tax Receivable Agreement and, as a result, there might not\nbe future cash payments from which to net against. The applicable U.S. federal income tax rules are complex and factual in nature, and there can be no assurance that the\nInternal Revenue Service or a court will not disagree with our tax reporting positions. As a result, it is possible that we could make cash payments under the Tax Receivable\nAgreement that are substantially greater than our actual cash tax savings.\nCertain of the P3 Equityholders may receive payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement, and their interests may conflict with yours.\nThe P3 Equityholders may receive payments from us under the Tax Receivable Agreement upon any redemption or exchange of their P3 LLC units, including the\nissuance of shares of our Class A common stock upon any such redemption or exchange. As a result, the interests of the P3 Equityholders may conflict with the interests of\nholders of our Class A common stock. For example, the P3 Equityholders may have different tax positions from us which could influence their decisions regarding whether and\nwhen to dispose of assets, whether and when to incur new or refinance existing indebtedness, especially in light of the existence of the Tax Receivable Agreement, and whether\nand when we should terminate the Tax Receivable Agreement and accelerate our obligations thereunder. In addition, the structuring of future transactions may take into\nconsideration tax or other considerations of P3 Equityholders even in situations where no similar considerations are relevant to us.\nP3 Health Partners Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 46\nTable of Contents\nGeneral Risk Factors\nWe may be subject to securities litigation, which is expensive and could divert management attention.\nThe market price of our securities may be volatile and, in the past, companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their securities have been subject to\nsecurities class action litigation. We may be the target of this type of litigation in the future. Securities litigation against us could result in substantial costs and divert\nmanagement’s attention from other business concerns, which could seriously harm its business.\nBecause we have no current plans to pay cash dividends on our Class A common stock for the foreseeable future, you may not receive any return on investment unless you\nsell your Class A common stock for a price greater than that which you paid for it.\nWe may retain future earnings, if any, for future operations, expansion and debt repayment and have no current plans to pay any cash dividends for the foreseeable\nfuture. Any decision to declare and pay dividends will be made at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on, among other things, our results of operations,\nfinancial condition, cash requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant. In addition, our ability to declare dividends may\nbe limited by restrictive covenants contained in any existing or future indebtedness. As a result, you may not receive any return on an investment in our Class A common stock\nunless you sell your Class A common stock for a price greater than that which you paid for it.\nThe market price and trading volume of our Class A common stock and Public Warrants may be volatile and could decline significantly.\nThe trading price of our securities may fluctuate substantially and may be lower than the price at which you purchase such securities. There can be no assurance that\nthe market price of Class A common stock and Public Warrants will not fluctuate widely or decline significantly in the future in response to a number of factors, including those\ndescribed in this “Risk Factors” section, many of which are beyond our control and may not be related to our operating performance, and which may limit or prevent investors\nfrom readily selling their Class A common stock or Public Warrants and may otherwise negatively affect the liquidity of the Class A common stock or Public Warrants. These\nfluctuations could cause you to lose all or part of your investment.\nFactors affecting the trading price of our securities may include:\n• actual or anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly financial results or the quarterly financial results of companies perceived to be similar to us;\n• changes in the market’s expectations about our operating results;\n• success of competitors;\n• our operating results failing to meet the expectation of securities analysts or investors in a particular period;\n• changes in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts concerning us or the health population management industry in general;\n• operating and stock price performance of other companies that investors deem comparable to us;\n• our ability to market new and enhanced products on a timely basis;\n• changes in laws and regulations affecting our business;\n• our ability to meet compliance requirements;\n• commencement of, or involvement in, litigation involving us;\n• changes in our capital structure, such as future issuances of securities or the incurrence of additional debt;\nP3 Health Partners Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 47\nTable of Contents\n• the volume of shares of our Class A common stock available for public sale;\n• any major change in our board of directors or management;\n• sales of substantial amounts of Class A common stock by our directors, executive officers or significant stockholders or the perception that such sales have or could\noccur; and\n• general economic and political conditions such as recessions, interest rates, fuel prices, international currency fluctuations, public health crises, and acts of war or\nterrorism.\nA loss of investor confidence in the market for retail stocks or the stocks of other companies which investors perceive to be similar to us could depress our stock price\nregardless of our business, prospects, financial condition or results of operations. A decline in the market price of our securities also could adversely affect our ability to issue\nadditional securities and our ability to obtain additional financing in the future.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, the price and trading volume of our securities\ncould decline.\nThe trading market for our securities depends in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. We do not control\nthese analysts, and the analysts who publish information about us may have relatively little experience with us or our industry, which could affect their ability to accurately\nforecast our results and could make it more likely that we fail to meet their estimates. If few or no securities or industry analysts cover us, the trading price for our securities\nwould be negatively impacted. If one or more of the analysts who covers us downgrades our securities, publishes incorrect or unfavorable research about us, ceases coverage of\nus, or fails to publish reports on us regularly, demand for and visibility of our securities could decrease, which could cause the price or trading volumes of our securities to\ndecline.\nWe will continue to incur significantly increased costs and devote substantial management time as a result of operating as a public company.\nAs a public company, we incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses. We are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act and are required to\ncomply with the applicable requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, as well as rules and regulations of\nthe SEC and Nasdaq, including the establishment and maintenance of effective disclosure and financial controls, corporate governance requirements and required filings of\nannual, quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and results of operations. Stockholder activism and the level of government intervention and regulatory reform\nmay lead to substantial new regulations and disclosure obligations, which may lead to additional significant compliance costs and impact the manner in which we operate our\nbusiness in ways we cannot currently anticipate. We expect that continued compliance with these requirements will increase our legal and financial compliance costs and will\nmake some activities more time-consuming and costly. In addition, we expect that our management and other personnel will need to continue to divert attention from\noperational and other business matters to devote substantial time to these public company requirements. In particular, we have incurred and expect to continue to incur\nsignificant expenses and devote substantial management effort toward ensuring compliance with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. We have hired\nadditional legal and accounting personnel and may in future need to hire additional accounting and financial staff with appropriate public company experience and technical\naccounting knowledge and may need to establish an internal audit function.\nBeing a public company has also made it more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance, and we may be required to accept reduced coverage or\nincur substantially higher costs to obtain coverage. This could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified people to serve on our board of directors, board\ncommittees or as executive officers.\nOur results of operations and financial condition are subject to management’s accounting judgments and estimates, as well as changes in accounting policies.\nThe preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions affecting the reported amounts of our assets, liabilities, revenues and\nexpenses. If these estimates or assumptions are incorrect, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. Generally accepted\naccounting principles in the U.S. are subject to interpretation by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, the American Institute of Certified Public\nP3 Health Partners Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 48\nTable of Contents\nAccountants, the SEC, and various bodies formed to promulgate and interpret appropriate accounting principles. A change in these principles or interpretations could have a\nsignificant effect on our reported financial results, and could affect the reporting of transactions completed before the announcement of a change.\nIncreased scrutiny of, and evolving expectations regarding, sustainability and environmental, social, and governance (“ESG”) matters could increase our costs, harm our\nreputation and adversely impact our financial results.\nWe, as with other companies, are facing increasing scrutiny related to our ESG practices and disclosures from certain investors, capital providers, shareholder\nadvocacy groups, other market participants, government entities, customers, and other stakeholder groups or third parties. For example, certain institutional and individual\ninvestors have requested various ESG-related information and disclosures as they increasingly incorporate ESG criteria in making investment and voting decisions. With this\nincreased focus, public reporting regarding ESG practices is becoming more broadly expected, which could lead to increased scrutiny of our ESG practices or lack thereof. Such\nincreased scrutiny may result in increased costs, increased risk of litigation or reputational damage relating to our ESG practices or performance, changes in demands for certain\nproducts, enhanced compliance or disclosure obligations, or other adverse impacts on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWhile we may at times engage in voluntary initiatives (such as voluntary disclosures, certifications, or goals, among others), such initiatives may be costly and may not\nhave the desired effect. For example, expectations around companies’ management of ESG matters continue to evolve rapidly, in many instances due to factors that are out of\nour control. In addition, we may commit to certain initiatives or goals and we may not ultimately be able to achieve such commitments or goals due to cost, technological\nconstraints, or other factors that are within or outside of our control. Moreover, actions or statements that we may take based on expectations, assumptions, or third-party\ninformation that we currently believe to be reasonable may subsequently be determined to be erroneous or be subject to misinterpretation. Even if this is not the case, our\ncurrent actions may subsequently be determined to be insufficient by various stakeholders. If our ESG practices and reporting do not meet investor, consumer, employee,\nregulator, or other stakeholder or third party expectations, which continue to evolve, our brand, reputation and customer retention may be negatively impacted, and we may be\nsubject to investor or regulator engagement regarding such matters, even if they are currently voluntary. Certain market participants, including major institutional investors, use\nthird-party benchmarks, ratings or scores to measure our ESG practices in making investment and voting decisions. Unfavorable ratings or scores of us or our industry may lead\nto negative investor sentiment and the diversion of investment to other companies or industries, which could have a negative impact on our stock price and our access to and\ncost of capital. As ESG best practices, reporting standards and disclosure requirements continue to develop, we may incur increasing costs related to ESG monitoring and\nreporting. In addition, new sustainability rules and regulations have been adopted and may continue to be introduced in various states and other jurisdictions. For example, we\nexpect to be subject to the requirements of the State of California’s Climate Corporate Data Accountability Act and Climate Related Financial Risk Act as well as the SEC’s\nclimate disclosure proposal, if finalized. Operating in more than one jurisdiction is likely to make our compliance with ESG and sustainability-related rules more complex and\nexpensive, and potentially expose us to greater levels of legal risks associated with our compliance. Our failure to comply with any applicable rules or regulations could lead to\npenalties and adversely impact our reputation, customer attraction and retention, access to capital and employee retention. Such ESG matters may also impact our suppliers and\ncustomers, which may augment or cause additional impacts on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nItem 1B.

Cybersecurity.\nCybersecurity Risk Management and Strategy\nWe have developed and implemented a cybersecurity risk management program intended to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of our critical\nsystems and information. Our cybersecurity risk management program includes a cybersecurity incident response plan.\nWe design and assess our program based on the HITRUST Common Security Framework. This does not imply that we meet any particular technical standards,\nspecifications, or requirements, only that we use the HITRUST Common Security Framework as a guide to help us identify, assess, and manage cybersecurity risks relevant to\nour business.\nP3 Health Partners Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 49\nTable of Contents\nOur cybersecurity risk management program is integrated into our overall enterprise risk management program, and shares common methodologies, reporting channels\nand governance processes that apply across the enterprise risk management program to other legal, compliance, strategic, operational, and financial risk areas.\nOur cybersecurity risk management program includes:\n• risk assessments designed to help identify material cybersecurity risks to our critical systems, information, products, services, and our broader enterprise IT\nenvironment;\n• a security team principally responsible for managing (1) our cybersecurity risk assessment processes, (2) our security controls, and (3) our response to cybersecurity\nincidents;\n• the use of external service providers, where appropriate, to assess, test or otherwise assist with aspects of our security controls;\n• cybersecurity awareness training of our employees, incident response personnel, and senior management;\n• a cybersecurity incident response plan that includes procedures for responding to cybersecurity incidents; and\n• a third-party risk management process for service providers, suppliers, and vendors that have access to our critical systems and information.\nWe have not identified risks from known cybersecurity threats, including as a result of any prior cybersecurity incidents, that have materially affected us, including our\noperations, business strategy, results of operations, or financial condition. We face risks from cybersecurity threats that, if realized, are reasonably likely to materially affect us,\nincluding our operations, business strategy, results of operations, or financial condition. See the section titled “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and Industry—Our\nbusiness and operations would suffer in the event of information technology system failures, security breaches, cyberattacks or other deficiencies in cybersecurity.”\nCybersecurity Governance\nOur Board considers cybersecurity risk as part of its risk oversight function and has delegated to the Audit Committee (the “Committee”) oversight of cybersecurity\nand other information technology risks. The Committee oversees management’s implementation of our cybersecurity risk management program.\nThe Committee receives periodic reports from management on our cybersecurity risks. In addition, management updates the Committee, as necessary, regarding any\nmaterial cybersecurity incidents, as well as any incidents with lesser impact potential.\nThe Committee reports to the full Board regarding its activities, including those related to cybersecurity. The full Board also receives briefings from management on\nour cyber risk management program. Board members receive presentations on cybersecurity topics from our Senior Vice President of Technology and Director of Information\nSystems Security or other internal security staff or external experts as part of the Board’s continuing education on topics that impact public companies.\nOur management team, including, but not limited to, our Senior Vice President of Technology, Director of Information Systems Security, and Director of Information\nSystems Governance Risk and Compliance, is responsible for assessing and managing our material risks from cybersecurity threats. The team has primary responsibility for our\noverall cybersecurity risk management program and supervises both our internal cybersecurity personnel and our retained external cybersecurity consultants. Our management\nteam’s experience spans over 20 years in all aspects of information technology including cybersecurity, IT operations (infrastructure engineering and architecture design), and\nIT governance audit compliance across industries such as energy, healthcare, pharmaceuticals, and finance.\nOur management team supervises efforts to prevent, detect, mitigate, and remediate cybersecurity risks and incidents through various means, which may include\nbriefings from internal security personnel; threat intelligence and other information obtained from governmental, public or private sources, including external consultants\nengaged by us; and alerts and reports produced by security tools deployed in the IT environment.\nP3 Health Partners Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 50\nTable of Contents\nItem 2.

Legal Proceedings.\nThe Company is a party to various claims, legal and regulatory proceedings, lawsuits and administrative actions arising in the ordinary course of business and\nassociated with the Business Combinations. The Company carries general and professional liability insurance coverage to mitigate the Company’s risk of potential loss in such\ncases. An accrual is established when a specific contingency is probable and estimable. The Company also faces contingencies that are reasonably possible to occur that cannot\ncurrently be estimated. The Company believes that disposition of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated financial position, net loss\nor cash flows. It is the Company’s policy to expense costs associated with loss contingencies, including any related legal fees, as they are incurred.\nBooks and Records Action\nOn April 19, 2021, two members of the P3 Board of Managers, Joseph Straus and Jonathan Bradburn, filed a lawsuit in the Delaware Court of Chancery captioned\nStraus et al v.

On May 21, 2021, P3 filed its\nanswer to the complaint in the Books and Records Action. On May 9, 2023, the Books and Records Action was dismissed with prejudice.\nHudson Class D Dispute\nOn June 11, 2021, Hudson Vegas Investment SPV, LLC (“Hudson”), a holder of P3’s Class D Units, filed an action in the Delaware Court of Chancery captioned\nHudson Vegas Investments SPV, LLC v. Chicago Pacific Founders Fund, L.P., et al., C.A. No. 2021-0518-JTL (the “Hudson Action”), in which it challenged the Business\nCombinations. Specifically, Hudson purports to assert claims against P3, certain managers that were on the P3 Board of Managers, certain of its officers, and Chicago Pacific\nFounders Fund, L.P. (“CPF”) for breach of P3’s then-existing LLC agreement (the “LLC Agreement”) (against P3 and CPF), breach of fiduciary duty (against certain of P3’s\nofficers) and breach of contract claims related to the then-existing LLC Agreement (against the P3 Board of Managers) in connection with the process leading up to, and\napproval of, the Business Combinations. In the Hudson Action, Hudson sought to enjoin the consummation of the Business Combinations and seeks a declaration that the\nBusiness Combinations violate its rights under the P3 then-existing LLC Agreement, a declaration that certain managers on the P3 Board of Managers and certain of P3’s\nofficers breached their fiduciary duties, and money damages including attorneys’ fees.\nOn June 13, 2021, P3 filed an action in the Delaware Court of Chancery captioned P3 Health Group Holdings, L.L.C. v. Hudson Vegas Investment SPV, LLC, C.A.\nNo. 2021-0519-JTL (the “P3 Action”). In the P3 Action, P3 seeks: (i) a declaration that the Business Combinations do not violate Section 3.10 of P3’s Existing LLC\nAgreement; and (ii) reformation of a provision of P3’s Existing LLC Agreement. The P3 Action was consolidated with the Hudson Action. The combined cases are captioned In\nre P3 Health Group Holdings, L.L.C, C.A. No. 2021-0518-JTL.\nOn June 22, 2021, Hudson filed a motion for expedited proceedings in the Hudson Action in which it sought expedited discovery and a hearing on its motion for\npreliminary injunction to enjoin the consummation of the Business Combinations. The defendants in the Hudson Action determined not to oppose Hudson’s motion for\nexpedited proceedings and engaged in expedited discovery in advance of a preliminary injunction hearing that took place September 9, 2021.\nOn September 14, 2021, the Court of Chancery issued an oral ruling denying Hudson’s motion for preliminary injunction due to the lack of probability of success on\nthe merits or, with respect to the Section 5.10 of the then-existing P3 LLC Agreement (the “Purchase Option”) only, lack of a showing of irreparable harm based on the\ncondition that the escrow described below be created. This ruling was made subject to the condition that Defendants memorialize their commitment to escrow, pending final\nresolution of this action, the consideration Hudson would be entitled to receive if it is\nP3 Health Partners Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 51\nTable of Contents\ndetermined that the Purchase Option can be validly exercised, in a stipulation filed with the Court. On September 17, 2021, Defendants filed a stipulation and proposed order\nand the Court entered the Order regarding escrow which confirmed their commitment to do so and to cause the Payment Spreadsheet (as that term is defined in Section 2.01(f)\nof the Merger Agreement) to provide that such consideration will be directed to such escrow.\nThe former members of P3 (other than Hudson) have agreed to indemnify the Company and P3 LLC following the Closing, for any damages, including reasonable\nattorney’s fees, arising out of matters relating to the dispute with Hudson.\nOn December 27, 2021, Hudson filed a Motion for Leave to Amend the Verified Complaint. The proposed Amended Complaint contains certain of Hudson’s original\nclaims and also adds additional claims, including bad faith breach of contract claims against certain of the former P3 Managers, an additional contractual claim against P3, and a\ntortious interference with contract claim against Foresight Acquisition Corp., Foresight Acquisition Corp. II, P3 Partners Inc., Sameer Mathur, and Greg Wasson. Defendants\ninformed Hudson that they did not oppose the Motion for Leave to Amend the Verified Complaint, and on February 4, 2022, Hudson filed its Verified Amended Complaint.\nFrom September 12, 2022 through November 7, 2022, the Court issued a series of Orders ruling on the Defendants’ Motions to Dismiss the Verified Amended\nComplaint. Such Orders provided for the dismissal with prejudice of, among other claims, (i) Hudson’s claim to a Purchase Option and (ii) part of Hudson’s claim to a priority\nright to cash distributed as a result of the transactions.\nThe Court granted in part and denied in part a motion to dismiss filed by Mr. Leisure, Mr. Kazarian, Mr. Abdou, Mr. Bacchus, Mr. Garrett, Mr. Price, Ms. Glisson, and\nMr. Leavitt (the “Manager Defendants”) with respect to Hudson’s claim for bad faith breach of contract under a variety of theories. The Court also granted in part and denied in\npart the Manager Defendants’ motion, permitting Hudson’s bad faith breach of contract claim to proceed against the Manager Defendants on certain theories, but dismissing\nother theories, including that the Manager Defendants committed a bad faith breach of contract by failing to act in good faith to facilitate the Purchase Option.\nOn November 7, 2022, the Court issued an order denying in part and granting in part the motion to dismiss the breach of fiduciary claims against the officer\nDefendants, including Mr. Kazarian, Mr. Abdou, Mr. Bacchus, Ms. Glisson, and Ms. Puathasnanon. On November 9, 2022, the Court issued an order denying the motion to\ndismiss the claim against Mr. Mathur for tortious interference with Hudson’s contract rights. On June 21, 2023, the Court entered a scheduling order for the case, pursuant to\nwhich, a five day trial will commence on July 22, 2024. The parties are now currently engaged in discovery on Hudson’s surviving claims.\nItem 4.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe following discussion and analysis is intended to provide the reader with an understanding of our business, including an overview of our results of operations and\nliquidity and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this\nForm 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements and involves numerous risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated\nin any forward-looking statements as a result of many factors, including those set forth under “Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements,” “Item 1A. Risk\nFactors” and elsewhere in this Form 10-K. Our historical results are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for any periods in the future.\nOverview\nP3 is a patient-centered and physician-led population health management company. We strive to offer superior care to all those in need. We believe that the misaligned\nincentives in the FFS healthcare payment model and the fragmentation between physicians and care teams has led to sub-optimal clinical outcomes, limited access, high\nspending and unnecessary variability in the quality of care. We believe that a platform such as ours, which helps to realign incentives and focuses on treating the full patient, is\nuniquely positioned to address these healthcare challenges.\nWe have leveraged the expertise of our management team’s more than 20 years of experience in population health management, to build our “P3 Care Model.” The\nkey attributes that differentiate P3 include: 1) patient-focused model, 2) physician-led model, and 3) our broad delegated model. Our model operates by entering into\narrangements with payors providing for monthly payments to manage the total healthcare needs of members attributed to our primary care physicians. In tandem, we enter into\narrangements directly with existing physician groups or independent physicians in the community to join our VBC network. In our model, physicians are able to retain their\nindependence and entrepreneurial spirit, while gaining access to the tools, teams and technologies that are key to success in a VBC model, all while sharing in the savings from\nsuccessfully improving the quality of patient care and reducing costs.\nWe operate in the $944 billion Medicare market, which covers approximately 66 million eligible lives as of October 2023. Our core focus is the MA market, which\nmakes up approximately 51% of the overall Medicare market, or nearly 31 million Medicare eligible lives in 2023. Medicare beneficiaries may enroll in an MA plan, under\nwhich payors contract with the CMS to provide a defined range of healthcare services that are comparable to Medicare FFS (which is also referred to as “traditional Medicare”).\nWe predominantly enter into capitated contracts with the nation’s largest health plans to provide holistic, comprehensive healthcare to MA members. Under the typical\ncapitation arrangement, we are entitled to PMPM fees from payors to provide a defined range of healthcare services for MA health plan members attributed to our PCPs. These\nPMPM fees comprise our capitated revenue and are determined as a percent of the premium (“POP”) payors receive from CMS for these members. Our contracted recurring\nrevenue model offers us highly predictable revenue, and rewards us for providing high-quality care rather than driving a high volume of services. In this capitated arrangement,\nour goals are well-aligned with payors and patients alike—the more we improve health outcomes, the more profitable we will be over time.\nUnder this capitated contract structure, we are generally responsible for all members’ medical costs across the care continuum, including, but not limited to emergency\nroom and hospital visits, post-acute care admissions, prescription drugs, specialist physician spend, and primary care spend. Keeping members healthy is our primary objective.\nWhen they need medical care, delivery of the right care in the right setting can greatly impact outcomes. When our members need care outside of our network of PCPs, we\nutilize a number of tools including network management, utilization management and claims processing to ensure that the appropriate quality care is provided.\nOur company was formed in 2017 and our first at-risk contract became effective on January 1, 2018. We have demonstrated an ability to rapidly scale, primarily\nentering markets with our affiliate physician model, and expanding to a PCP network of approximately 2,750 physicians, in 18 markets (counties) across five states in six full\nyears of operations as of December 31, 2023. Our platform has enabled us to grow our revenue by an average of 84% annually from December 31, 2018 to December 31, 2023.\nAs of December 31, 2023, our PCP network served approximately 108,900 at-risk members. We believe we have significant growth opportunities available to us across existing\nand new markets, with less than 1% of the 520,000 PCPs in the U.S. currently included in our physician network.\nP3 Health Partners Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 55\nTable of Contents\nKey Factors Affecting our Performance\nGrowing Medicare Advantage Membership on Our Platform\nMembership and revenue are tied to the number of members attributed to our physician network by our payors. We believe we have multiple avenues to serve\nadditional members, including through:\n• Growth in membership under our existing contracts and existing markets:\n◦ Patients who are attributed to our physician network who (a) age into Medicare and elect to enroll in MA or (b) elect to convert from Medicare FFS to MA.\n• Adding new contracts (either payor contracts or physician contracts) in existing markets.\n• Adding new contracts (either payor contracts or physician contracts) in adjacent and new markets.\nGrowing Existing Contract Membership\nAs new patients age-in to Medicare and enroll in MA through our payors, they become attributed to our network of physicians with little incremental cost to us.\nIn addition to age-ins, Medicare eligible patients can change their enrollment selections during select periods throughout the year. Our sales and marketing teams\nactively work with local community partners to connect with Medicare eligible patients and make them aware of their healthcare choices and the services that we offer with our\nVBC model, including greater access to their physicians and customized care plans catered to their needs. The ultimate effect of our marketing efforts is increased awareness of\nP3 and additional patients choosing us as their primary care provider. We believe that our marketing efforts also help to grow our payor partners’ membership base as we grow\nour own patient base and help educate patients about their choices on Medicare, further aligning our model with that of healthcare payors.\nGrowing Membership in Adjacent and New Markets\nOur affiliate model allows us to quickly and efficiently enter into new and adjacent markets in two ways: (1 )partnering with payors and (2) partnering with providers.\nBecause our model honors the existing patient-provider relationship, we are able to deploy our care model around existing physicians in a given a market. By utilizing the local\nhealthcare infrastructure, we can quickly build a network of PCPs to serve the healthcare needs of contracted members.\nOur business development and managed care teams maintain an active pipeline of new partnership opportunities for both providers and payors. These potential\nopportunities are developed through significant inbound interest and the deep relationships our team has developed with their more than 20 years of experience in the VBC\nspace and our proactive assessment of expansion markets. When choosing a market to enter, we make our decision on a county-by-county basis across the United States. We\nlook at various factors including: (i) population size, (ii) payor participants and concentration, (iii) health system participants and concentration, and (iv) competitive landscape.\nWhen entering a new market, we supplement the existing physician network with local market leadership teams and support infrastructure to drive the improvement in\nmedical cost and quality. When entering an adjacent market, we are able to leverage the investments we previously made to have a faster impact on our expanded footprint. As\nof December 31, 2023, we operate in 18 markets, markets being counties, across five states.\nGrowing Membership in Existing Markets\nOnce established in a market, we have an opportunity to efficiently expand both our provider and payor contracts. Given the benefits PCPs experience from joining our\nP3 Care Model, which offers providers the teams, tools and technologies to better support their patient base, we often experience growth in our affiliate network after entering a\nmarket. Because of the benefits, we have also historically experienced high retention with our affiliate providers. From 2018 through December 31, 2023, we experienced a\n98% physician retention rate in our affiliate provider network. By expanding our affiliate provider network and adding new physicians to the P3 network, we can quickly\nincrease the number of contracted at-risk members under our existing health plan arrangements.\nP3 Health Partners Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 56\nTable of Contents\nAdditionally, by expanding the number of contracted payors, we can leverage our existing infrastructure to quickly increase our share of patients within our physician\nnetwork.\nGrowing Capitated Revenue Per Member\nMedicare pays capitation using a risk adjusted model, which compensates payors based on the health status, or acuity, of each individual member. Payors with higher\nacuity members receive a higher payment and those with lower acuity members receive a lower payment. Moreover, some of our capitated revenue also includes adjustments\nfor performance incentives or penalties based on the achievement of certain clinical quality metrics as contracted with payors. Given the prevalence of FFS arrangements, our\npatients often have historically not participated in a VBC model, and therefore their health conditions are poorly documented. Through the P3 Care Model, we determine and\nassess the health needs of our patients and create an individualized care plan consistent with those needs. We capture and document health conditions as a part of this process.\nWe expect that our PMPM revenue will continue to improve the longer members participate in our care model as we better understand and assess their health status (acuity) and\ncoordinate their medical care.\nEffectively Managing Member Medical Expense\nOur medical claims expense is our largest expense category, representing 86% of our total operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2023. We manage our\nmedical costs by improving our members access to healthcare. Our care model focuses on maintaining health and leveraging the primary care setting as a means of avoiding\ncostly downstream healthcare costs, such as emergency department visits and acute hospital inpatient admissions. The power of our model is reflected in the relative\nperformance of our network when compared to local FFS benchmarks.\nAchieving Operating Efficiencies\nAs a result of our affiliate model and ability to leverage our existing local and national infrastructure, we generate operating efficiencies at both the market and\nenterprise level. Our local corporate, general and administrative expense, which includes our local leadership, care management teams and other operating costs to support our\nmarkets, are expected to decrease over time as a percentage of revenue as we add members to our existing contracts, grow membership with new payor and physician contracts,\nand our revenue subsequently increases. Our corporate general and administrative expenses at the enterprise level include resources and technology to support payor\ncontracting, quality, data management, delegated services, finance and legal functions. While we expect our absolute investment in our enterprise resources to increase over\ntime, we expect our investment will decrease as a percentage of revenue when we are able to leverage our infrastructure across a broader group of at-risk members. We expect\nour corporate, general and administrative expenses to increase in absolute dollars in the future as we continue to invest to support growth of our business, as well as due to the\ncosts required to operate as a public company, including insurance coverage, investments in internal audit, investor relations and financial reporting functions, fees paid to the\nNasdaq Stock Market, and increased legal and audit fees.\nImpact of Seasonality\nOur operational and financial results reflect some variability depending upon the time of year in which they are measured. This variability is most notable in the\nfollowing areas:\nAt-Risk Member Growth. While new members are attributed to our platform throughout the year, we experience the largest portion of our at-risk member growth\nduring the first quarter. Contracts with new payors typically begin on January 1, at which time new members become attributed to our network of physicians. Additionally, new\nmembers are attributed to our network on January 1, when plan enrollment selections made during the prior Annual Enrollment Period from October 15 through December 7 of\nthe prior year take effect.\nRevenue Per Member. Our revenue is based on percentage of premium we have negotiated with our payors as well as our ability to accurately and appropriately\ndocument the acuity of a member’s health status. We experience some seasonality with respect to our per member revenue as it will generally decline over the course of the\nyear. In January of each year, CMS revises the risk adjustment factor for each patient based upon health conditions documented in the prior year, leading to an overall increase\nin per-patient revenue. As the year progresses, our per-patient revenue declines as new patients join us typically with less complete or accurate documentation (and therefore\nlower risk-adjustment scores) and patients with more severe acuity profiles (and, therefore, higher per member revenue rates) expire.\nP3 Health Partners Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 57\nTable of Contents\nMedical Costs. Medical expense is driven by utilization of healthcare services by our attributed membership. Medical expense will vary seasonally depending on a\nnumber of factors, including the weather and the number of business days. Certain illnesses, such as the influenza virus, are far more prevalent during colder months of the year,\nwhich will result in an increase in medical expenses during these time periods. We would therefore expect to see higher levels of per-member medical expense in the first and\nfourth quarters. Business days can also create year-over-year comparability issues if one year has a different number of business days compared to another.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures and Key Performance Metrics\nWe use certain financial measures, which are not calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (“GAAP”), as well as key\nperformance metrics, to supplement our consolidated financial statements. The measures set forth below should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for,\nfinancial information presented in compliance with GAAP, and non-GAAP financial measures and key performance metrics as used by us may not be comparable to similarly\ntitled measures used by other companies. Our presentation of these measures should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or\nnon-recurring items. The presentation of non-GAAP financial measures and key performance metrics provides additional information to investors regarding our results of\noperations that our management believes is useful for identifying trends, analyzing and benchmarking the performance of our business.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nAdjusted EBITDA\nThe key non-GAAP metric we utilize to measure our profitability and performance is Adjusted EBITDA. We present Adjusted EBITDA because we believe it helps\ninvestors understand underlying trends in our business and facilitates an understanding of our operating performance from period to period because it facilitates a comparison of\nour recurring core business operating results.\nBy definition, EBITDA consists of net income (loss) before interest, income taxes, depreciation, and amortization. We define Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA, further\nadjusted to exclude the effect of certain supplemental adjustments, such as mark-to-market warrant gain/loss, premium deficiency reserves, equity-based compensation expense,\nand certain other items that we believe are not indicative of our core operating performance. Our definition of Adjusted EBITDA may not be the same as the definitions used in\nany of our debt agreements.\nAdjusted EBITDA is not a measure of performance or liquidity calculated in accordance with GAAP. It is unaudited and should not be considered an alternative to, or\nmore meaningful than, net income (loss) as an indicator of our operating performance. Uses of cash flows that are not reflected in Adjusted EBITDA include capital\nexpenditures, interest payments, debt principal repayments, and other expenses defined above, which can be significant. As a result, Adjusted EBITDA should not be\nconsidered as a measure of our liquidity.\nBecause of these limitations, Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for performance measures calculated in accordance with\nGAAP. We compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our GAAP results and using Adjusted EBITDA on a supplemental basis. You should review the\nreconciliation of net loss to Adjusted EBITDA set forth below and not rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business.\nP3 Health Partners Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 58\nTable of Contents\nThe following table sets forth a reconciliation of our net loss, the most directly comparable GAAP metric, to Adjusted EBITDA:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2023 2022\n(in thousands)\nNet loss $ (186,426) $ (1,561,557)\nInterest expense, net 15,985 11,404\nDepreciation and amortization expense 86,675 87,289\nProvision for income taxes 2,695 1,862\nMark-to-market of stock warrants (433) (9,865)\nPremium deficiency reserve (12,705) (11,461)\nEquity-based compensation 5,979 19,404\nTransaction and other related costs(1) 70 14,050\nGoodwill impairment — 1,314,952\nOther(2) 2,656 6,008\nAdjusted EBITDA loss $ (85,504) $ (127,914)\n_____________________________________________\n(1) Transaction and other related costs during the year ended December 31, 2023 consisted of legal fees incurred related to acquisition-related litigation and during the year ended December 31, 2022 consisted\nof accounting, legal, and advisory fees related to transactions that were completed, pending, or abandoned.\n(2) Other during the year ended December 31, 2023 consisted of (i) interest income offset by (ii) cybersecurity incident loss, (iii) restructuring and other charges, including severance and benefits paid to\nemployees pursuant to workforce reduction plans, (iv) the disposition of our Pahrump operations, (v) expenses for third-party consultants to assist us with the development, implementation, and\ndocumentation of new and enhanced internal controls and processes for compliance with Sarbanes-Oxley Section 404(b), (vi) a legal settlement outside of the ordinary course of business, and (vii)\nvaluation allowance on our notes receivable. Other during the year ended December 31, 2022 consisted of (i) income related to the release of indemnity funds previously escrowed as part of an acquisition\nin a prior year and (ii) interest income, offset by (iii) accounting, legal, and professional services expenses incurred related to the restatement of our consolidated financial statements for the years ended\nDecember 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018 and the condensed consolidated financial statements for the quarterly periods ended March 31, 2021, June 30, 2021, September 30, 2021, March 31, 2020, June 30,\n2020, and September 30, 2020, (iv) expenses for third-party consultants to assist us with the development, implementation, and documentation of new and enhanced internal controls and processes for\ncompliance with Sarbanes-Oxley Section 404(b), and (v) severance expense.\nMedical Margin\nMedical margin is a non-GAAP financial metric. We present medical margin because we believe it helps investors understand underlying trends in our business and\nfacilitates an understanding of our operating performance from period to period by facilitating a comparison of our recurring core business operating results.\nMedical margin represents the amount earned from capitation revenue after medical claims expenses are deducted. Medical claims expenses represent costs incurred\nfor medical services provided to our members. As our platform grows and matures over time, we expect medical margin to increase in absolute dollars; however, medical\nmargin PMPM may vary as the percentage of new members brought onto our platform fluctuates. New membership added to the platform is typically dilutive to medical margin\nPMPM.\nMedical margin should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. We compensate for these\nlimitations by relying primarily on our GAAP results and using medical margin on a supplemental basis. You should review the reconciliation of gross profit to medical margin\nset forth below and not rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business.\nP3 Health Partners Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 59\nTable of Contents\nThe following table presents our medical margin:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2023 2022\n(in thousands)\nCapitated revenue $ 1,252,309 $ 1,034,800\nLess: medical claims expense (1,117,258) (972,725)\nMedical margin $ 135,051 $ 62,075\nThe following table sets forth a reconciliation of our gross profit, the most directly comparable GAAP metric, to medical margin:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2023 2022\n(in thousands)\nGross profit $ 31,635 $ (7,753)\nOther patient service revenue (14,066) (14,671)\nOther medical expense 117,482 84,499\nMedical margin $ 135,051 $ 62,075\nKey Performance Metrics\nWe monitor the following operating metrics to help us evaluate our business, identify trends affecting our business, formulate business plans and make strategic\ndecisions.\nGross Profit\nGross profit represents the amount earned from total operating revenue less the sum of: (i) medical claims expenses and (ii) other medical expenses including physician\ncompensation expense related to surplus sharing and bonuses and other direct medical expenses incurred to improve care for our members. We believe this metric provides\ninsight into the economics of the P3 Care Model, as it includes all medical claims expense associated with our members’ care as well as partner compensation and additional\nmedical costs we incur as part of our aligned partnership model. Other medical expenses are largely variable and proportionate to the level of surplus in each respective market,\namong other cost factors.\nThe following table presents our gross profit:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2023 2022\n(in thousands)\nTotal operating revenue $ 1,266,375 $ 1,049,471\nLess: medical claims expense (1,117,258) (972,725)\nLess: other medical expense (117,482) (84,499)\nGross profit $ 31,635 $ (7,753)\nAt-Risk Membership\nAt-risk membership represents the approximate number of Medicare members for whom we receive a fixed percentage of premium under capitation arrangements as of\nthe end of the reporting period. We had 108,900 and 100,400 at-risk members as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nP3 Health Partners Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 60\nTable of Contents\nAffiliate Primary Care Physicians\nAffiliate primary care physicians represent the approximate number of primary care physicians included in our affiliate network, with whom members may be\nattributed under our capitation arrangements, as of the end of the reporting period. We had 2,750 and 2,800 primary care physicians as of December 31, 2023 and 2022,\nrespectively.\nPlatform Support Costs\nOur platform support costs, which include regionally-based support personnel and other operating costs to support our markets, are expected to decrease over time as a\npercentage of revenue as our physician partners add members and our revenue grows. Our operating expenses at the enterprise level include resources and technology to support\npayor contracting, clinical program development, quality, data management, finance, and legal functions. We exclude costs related to the operations of our owned medical\nclinics and wellness centers.\nThe table below represents costs to support our markets and enterprise functions, which are included in corporate, general and administrative expenses:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2023 2022\n(dollars in thousands)\nPlatform support costs $ 96,937 $ 119,167\n% of total operating revenue 7.7 % 11.4 %\nKey Components of Results of Operations\nRevenue\nCapitated revenue. We contract with health plans using an at-risk model. Under the at-risk model, we are responsible for the cost of all covered health care services\nprovided to members assigned by the health plans to the Company in exchange for a fixed payment, which generally is a POP based on health plans’ premiums received from\nCMS. Through this capitation arrangement, we stand ready to provide assigned MA members all their medical care via our directly employed and affiliated physician/specialist\nnetwork.\nThe premiums health plans receive are determined via a competitive bidding process with CMS and are based on the costs of care in local markets and the average\nutilization of services by patients enrolled. Medicare pays capitation using a “risk adjustment model,” which compensates providers based on the health status (acuity) of each\nindividual patient. MA plans with higher acuity patients receive higher premiums. Conversely, MA plans with lower acuity patients receive lesser premiums. Under the risk\nadjustment model, capitation is paid on an interim basis based on enrollee data submitted for the preceding year and is adjusted in subsequent periods after final data is\ncompiled. As premiums are adjusted via this risk adjustment model (using a Risk Adjustment Factor, “RAF”), our PMPM payments change commensurately with how our\ncontracted Medicare Advantage plans’ premiums change with CMS.\nThe transaction price for these contracts is variable as it primarily includes PMPM fees, which can fluctuate throughout the course of the year based on the acuity of\neach individual enrollee. In certain contracts, PMPM fees also include adjustments for items such as performance incentives or penalties based on the achievement of certain\nclinical quality metrics as contracted with payors. Capitated revenue is recognized based on a PMPM transaction price to transfer the service for a distinct increment of the series\nand is recognized net of projected acuity adjustments and performance incentives or penalties. We recognize revenue in the month in which attributed members are entitled to\nreceive healthcare benefits during the contract term. The capitation amount is subject to possible retroactive premium risk adjustments based on the member’s individual acuity.\nOther patient service revenue. Other patient service revenue is comprised primarily of encounter-related fees to treat patients outside of our at-risk arrangements at\ncompany owned clinics. Other patient service revenue also includes ancillary fees earned under contracts with certain payors for the provision of certain care coordination and\nother care management services. These services are provided to patients covered by these payors regardless of whether those patients receive their care from our directly\nemployed or affiliated medical groups.\nP3 Health Partners Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 61\nTable of Contents\nOperating Expense\nMedical expense. Medical expenses primarily include costs of all covered services provided to members by non-P3 employed providers. This also includes an estimate\nof the cost of services that have been incurred, but not yet reported (“IBNR”). IBNR is recorded as claims payable on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Estimates\nfor incurred claims are based on historical enrollment and cost trends while also taking into consideration operational changes. Future and actual results typically differ from\nestimates. Differences could result from an overall change in medical expenses per member, changes in member mix or simply due to the addition of new members. IBNR\nestimates are made on an accrual basis and adjusted in future periods as required. To the extent we revise our estimates of incurred but not reported claims for prior periods up\nor down, there would be a correspondingly favorable or unfavorable effect on our current period results that may or may not reflect changes in long term trends in our\nperformance.\nPremium deficiency reserve. Premium deficiency reserves (“PDR”) are recognized when it is probable that expected future health care costs and maintenance costs\nunder a group of existing contracts will exceed anticipated future premiums and stop-loss insurance recoveries on those contracts. PDR represents the advance recognition of a\nprobable future loss in the current period’s financial statements.\nCorporate, general and administrative expense. Corporate, general and administrative expenses include employee-related expenses, including salaries and related costs\nand equity-based compensation for our executive, technology infrastructure, operations, clinical and quality support, finance, legal, and human resources departments. In\naddition, general and administrative expenses include all corporate technology and occupancy costs.\nSales and marketing expense. Sales and marketing expenses consist of costs related to patient and provider marketing and community outreach. These expenses capture\nall costs for both our local and enterprise sales and marketing efforts.\nDepreciation and amortization expense. Depreciation expense is associated with our property and equipment, including leasehold improvements, computer equipment\nand software, furniture and fixtures, and internally developed software. Amortization expense is associated with definite lived intangible assets, including trademarks and\ntradenames, customer contracts, provider network agreements, and payor contracts.\nGoodwill impairment. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we recorded a $1,315.0 million goodwill impairment charge due to the presence of certain\nmacroeconomic and financial market conditions, industry-specific considerations, our performance, and the sustained decrease in the price of our Class A common stock. We\ndo not have any goodwill as of December 31, 2022.\nOther Income (Expense)\nInterest expense, net. Interest expense primarily consists of interest on our term loan facility and unsecured promissory note and amortization of debt issuance costs\nand original issue discount.\nMark-to-market of stock warrants. Mark-to-market of stock warrants consists of the change in the fair value on the revaluation of warrant liabilities associated with our\npublic and private placement Class A common stock warrants.\nOther. Other consists of gains and losses resulting from other transactions.\nIncome Taxes\nP3 LLC is treated as a partnership for U.S. federal and most applicable state and local income tax jurisdictions. As a partnership, P3 LLC is generally not subject to\ntaxes, other than entity level state income taxes. Any taxable income or loss generated by P3 LLC is passed through to and included within the taxable income or loss of its\nmembers, including us, on a pro rata basis. We are subject to U.S. federal income taxes, in addition to state and local income taxes with respect to our allocable share of any\ntaxable income or loss generated by P3 LLC.\nNon-controlling Interest\nWe consolidate the financial results of P3 LLC and report a non-controlling interest on our consolidated statements of operations, representing the portion of net\nincome or loss attributable to the non-controlling interest. The\nP3 Health Partners Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 62\nTable of Contents\nweighted average ownership percentages during the period are used to calculate the net income or loss attributable to P3 Health Partners Inc. and the non-controlling interest.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table sets forth our consolidated statements of operations data for the periods indicated.

This increase was primarily driven by a 12% increase in capitated revenue rates, due to increased premiums from patients with a higher average level of\nacuity, and an 8% increase in the total number of at-risk members from 100,400 at December 31, 2022 to 108,900 at December 31, 2023, which was in part a result of our\nparticipation in the Accountable Care Organization Realizing Equity, Access, and\nP3 Health Partners Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 63\nTable of Contents\nCommunity Health (“ACO REACH”) model, which began January 1, 2023.

Other patient service revenue was approximately 1% of total operating revenue for each of the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022.\nOperating Expense\nMedical Expense\nYear Ended December 31, Change\n2023 2022 Amount %\n(dollars in thousands)\nMedical expense $ 1,234,740 $ 1,057,224 $ 177,516 17 %\nMedical expense was $1,234.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, an increase of $177.5 million, or 17%, compared to $1,057.2 million for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022. The increase was primarily driven by an increase in the total number of at-risk members year-over-year resulting from our participation in the ACO\nREACH Model, which began January 1, 2023, and a new health plan contract as of April 1, 2023, partially offset by the termination and conversion of certain health plans from\nat-risk to upside-only risk.\nPremium Deficiency Reserve\nYear Ended December 31, Change\n2023 2022 Amount %\n(dollars in thousands)\nPremium deficiency reserve $ (12,705) $ (11,461) $ (1,244) 11 %\nPremium deficiency reserve was a benefit of $12.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, an increase of $1.2 million, or 11%, compared to a benefit of $11.5\nmillion for the year ended December 31, 2022. The change was due to management’s assessment of the profitability of contracts, wherein increased membership and the\nmaturation of our overall contractual arrangements are expected to reduce our future losses.\nCorporate, General and Administrative Expense\nYear Ended December 31, Change\n2023 2022 Amount %\n(dollars in thousands)\nCorporate, general and administrative expense $ 122,362 $ 157,284 $ (34,922) (22)%\nCorporate, general and administrative expense was $122.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, a decrease of $34.9 million, or 22%, compared to $157.3\nmillion for the year ended December 31, 2022. The decrease was primarily driven by decreases in equity-based compensation expense of $13.4 million, salary and related\nexpense of $9.4 million as headcount decreased 33% from December 31, 2022 to December 31, 2023, and professional fees of $8.1 million supporting our operations as a\npublic company and the absence of restatement-related costs.\nP3 Health Partners Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 64\nTable of Contents\nOther Income (Expense)\nYear Ended December 31, Change\n2023 2022 Amount %\n(dollars in thousands)\nOther (expense) income:\nInterest expense, net $ (15,985) $ (11,404) $ (4,581) 40 %\nMark-to-market of stock warrants 433 9,865 (9,432) (96)%\nOther (249) 2,757 (3,006) (109)%\nTotal other (expense) income $ (15,801) $ 1,218 $ (17,019) (1,397)%\nInterest expense, net was $16.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to $11.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. This increase was\nprimarily due to interest associated with the Company’s unsecured promissory note issued in December 2022.\nOther expense was $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, which consisted primarily of a cybersecurity incident loss of $1.0 million offset by an increase\nin interest income on our notes receivable of $0.7 million. Other income during the year ended December 31, 2022 primarily consisted of income from the release of indemnity\nfunds previously escrowed as part of an acquisition in a prior year totaling $2.5 million.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nP3 Health Partners Inc. is a holding company and has no material assets other than its ownership of equity interests in P3 LLC. As such, we have no independent\nmeans of generating revenue or cash flow, and our ability to pay taxes, make payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement (“TRA”), and to pay dividends will depend on the\nfinancial results and cash flows of P3 LLC and the distributions received from P3 LLC. Deterioration in the financial condition, earnings or cash flow of P3 LLC for any reason\ncould limit or impair P3 LLC’s ability to pay such distributions. Additionally, to the extent that we need funds and P3 LLC is restricted from making such distributions under\napplicable law or regulation or under the terms of any financing arrangements, or P3 LLC is otherwise unable to provide such funds, it could materially adversely affect our\nliquidity and financial condition. It is anticipated that the distributions we will receive from P3 LLC may, in certain periods, exceed the actual tax liabilities and obligations to\nmake payments under the TRA.\nCash Sources\nTo date, we have financed our operations principally through the cash we obtained as a result of the Business Combinations, private placements of our equity\nsecurities, payments from our payors, issuances of promissory notes, and borrowings under the Term Loan Facility (as defined below). We generate cash from our operations,\ngenerally from our contracts with payors. As of December 31, 2023, we had cash and restricted cash of $40.9 million.\nWe have experienced losses since our inception and net losses of $186.4 million and $1,561.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nWe expect to continue to incur operating losses and generate negative cash flows from operations for the foreseeable future due to the strong growth we have experienced over\nthe last six years and the investments we are making in expanding our business, which require up-front expenses. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors,\nincluding the pace of our growth, ability to manage medical costs, the maturity of our members, and our ability to raise capital. We may need to raise additional capital through\na combination of debt financing, other non-dilutive financing and/or equity financing and to the extent we are unsuccessful at doing so, we may need to adjust our growth\ntrajectory to accommodate our capital needs and look for additional ways to generate cost efficiencies.\nShelf Registration\nOn November 9, 2023, we filed a shelf Registration Statement on Form S-3 with a capacity of $250 million (the “Shelf Registration”), which was declared effective by\nthe SEC on November 20, 2023, and entered into an Open Market Sales Agreement (“Sales Agreement”) pursuant to which we may issue and sell, from time to time, through\nthe sales agent, shares of our Class A common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, with an aggregate value of up to $75 million. The sales agent will make commercially\nreasonable efforts, following our instructions, to sell shares over time, adhering to specified limits. Sales will be conducted through at-the-market offerings as defined by Rule\n415(a)(4) under the Securities Act.

Upon termination of the Sales Agreement, any unused portion will be available for sale in other offerings pursuant\nto the Shelf Registration. As of December 31, 2023, we have sold approximately 27,000 shares of our Class A common stock under the Sales Agreement for net proceeds of\napproximately $33,000.\nMarch 2023 Private Placement\nOn April 6, 2023, pursuant to a Securities Purchase Agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”), dated March 30, 2023 with the purchasers named therein (the\n“Purchasers”), which included certain affiliated entities of CPF and our Chief Medical Officer and member of our board of directors, we issued 79.9 million units at a price of\napproximately $1.12 per unit for institutional investors, and a purchase price of approximately $1.19 per unit for employees and consultants. Each unit consisted of one share of\nClass A common stock and 0.75 of a warrant to purchase one share of Class A common stock at an exercise price of $1.13. Certain institutional investors elected to receive pre-\nfunded warrants to purchase Class A common stock in lieu of a portion of their Class A common stock. In total, we sold (i) an aggregate of 69.2 million shares of our Class A\ncommon stock, (ii) Common Warrants to purchase an aggregate of 59.9 million shares of Class A common stock, and (iii) Pre-Funded Warrants to purchase an aggregate of\n10.8 million shares of Class A common stock to the Purchasers for aggregate proceeds of approximately $86.6 million, net of offering costs of approximately $2.9 million\n(collectively, the “March 2023 Private Placement”). See Note 13 “Capitalization” to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K for additional\ninformation about the March 2023 Private Placement.\nTerm Loan\nIn November 2020, we entered into a Term Loan and Security Agreement with CRG Servicing, LLC (as amended, the “Term Loan Agreement”) providing for funding\nof up to $100.0 million (the “Term Loan Facility”). The Term Loan Facility’s maturity date is December 31, 2025. As of December 31, 2023, we had $65.0 million of\nborrowings outstanding under the Term Loan Facility, and remaining availability under the Term Loan Facility ended upon termination of the commitment period on February\n28, 2022. Interest is payable at 12.0% per annum on a quarterly cycle (in arrears), which began on March 31, 2021. In March 2021, we elected to pay interest at 8.0% with the\nremaining interest at 4.0% being added to principal as paid in-kind (“PIK”) for a period of three years (or 12 payments).\nWe are required to remain in compliance with financial covenants such as minimum liquidity of $5.0 million and annual minimum revenue levels. In addition, the\nTerm Loan Agreement restricts our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to, among other things, incur indebtedness and liens. On an annual basis, we must post a minimum\namount of annual revenue equal to $525.0 million in 2023; $585.0 million in 2024 and $650.0 million in 2025. The maturity date may be accelerated as a remedy under the\ncertain default provisions in the Term Loan Agreement, or in the event a mandatory prepayment event occurs.\nIn connection with the issuance of the VGS Promissory Note (defined below) and entry into the 2022 Subordination Agreement (defined below), on December 13,\n2022, we entered into an amendment to the Term Loan Agreement to permit the issuance of the VGS Promissory Note and the entry into the 2022 Subordination Agreement.\nIn connection with the issuance of the VGS 2 Promissory Note (defined below) and entry into the 2024 Subordination Agreement (defined below), on March 22, 2024,\nwe entered into the Fourth Amendment to the Term Loan Agreement to permit the issuance of the VGS 2 Promissory Note and the entry into the 2024 Subordination Agreement.\nVGS Promissory Note\nOn December 13, 2023, we entered into a financing transaction with VBC Growth SPV LLC (“VGS”) which included the issuance of an unsecured promissory note\n(the “VGS Promissory Note”) to VGS and the entry into a warrant agreement and the 2022 Subordination Agreement (defined below). The VGS Promissory Note provided for\nfunding of up to $40.0 million. The maturity date of the VGS Promissory Note is May 19, 2026. As of December 31, 2023, we had $29.1 million of borrowings outstanding\nunder the VGS Promissory Note, and remaining availability under the VGS Promissory Note ended upon termination of the commitment period on February 3, 2023. We paid\nVGS an up-front fee of 1.5% and will pay a back-end fee of 9.0% at the time the VGS Promissory Note is paid. Interest is payable at 14.0% per annum on a quarterly cycle (in\narrears) beginning March 31, 2023. We may elect to pay interest of 6.0% in kind and 8.0% in cash, subject to certain limitations.\nP3 Health Partners Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 66\nTable of Contents\nThe VGS Promissory Note may be prepaid, at our option, either in whole or in part, without penalty or premium, at any time and from time to time, subject to the\npayment of the back-end fee; provided that prepayments must be in increments of at least $2.0 million. The VGS Promissory Note provides for mandatory prepayments with the\nproceeds of certain asset sales, and the Lender has the right to demand payment in full upon (i) a change of control of the Company and (ii) certain qualified financings (as\ndefined in the VGS Promissory Note).\nThe VGS Promissory Note restricts our ability to, among other things, incur indebtedness and liens, and make investments and restricted payments. The maturity date\nmay be accelerated as a remedy under the certain default provisions in the agreement, or in the event a mandatory prepayment event occurs.\nIn connection with the issuance of the VGS Promissory Note, we also entered into a subordination agreement, dated as of December 13, 2022 (the “2022 Subordination\nAgreement”) with VGS which subordinates VGS’s right of payment under the VGS Promissory Note to the right of payment and security interests of the lenders under the\nTerm Loan Facility. Under the terms of the 2022 Subordination Agreement, we will be required to pay all interest under the VGS Promissory Note in-kind. The VGS\nPromissory Note may be prepaid, at our option, either in whole or in part, without penalty or premium subject to certain conditions.\nAs of December 31, 2023, we were not in compliance with its Term Loan Facility and VGS Promissory Note covenants related to issuance of the 2023 financial\nstatements with an audit opinion free of a “going concern” qualification. The Term Loan Facility and VGS Promissory Note lenders have granted us a waiver of the covenant\nunder the Term Loan Facility related to the existence of a “going concern” qualification in the audit opinion for our audited financial statements for the fiscal year ended\nDecember 31, 2023. We were in compliance with all other covenants under the Term Loan Facility and VGS Promissory Note as of December 31, 2023; however, there can be\nno assurance that we will be able to maintain compliance with these covenants in the future or that the lenders under the Term Loan Facility, VGS Promissory Note or the\nlenders of any future indebtedness we may incur will grant any such waiver or forbearance in the future.\nVGS 2 Promissory Note\nOn March 22, 2024, we entered into a financing transaction with VBC Growth SPV 2, LLC (“VGS 2”), consisting of the issuance by P3 LLC of an unsecured\npromissory note (the “VGS 2 Promissory Note”) to VGS 2. The VGS 2 Promissory Note provides for funding of up to $25.0 million, available for draw by P3 LLC in two\ntranches, as follows: (i) a first tranche of $10.0 million which was immediately drawn on March 22, 2024, and (ii) a second tranche of $15.0 million available at our sole option\nin a single draw, on or around March 29, 2024, but no later than April 5, 2024. The VGS 2 Promissory Note matures on September 30, 2027. Interest is payable at 17.5% per\nannum on a quarterly cycle (in arrears) beginning June 30, 2024. We may elect to pay either (1) 8.0% cash interest and 9.5% PIK interest, or (2) 17.5% PIK interest, provided\nthat payment of cash interest will be permitted only to the extent permitted by the Term Loan Agreement and the 2024 Subordination Agreement, and if not so permitted, such\ninterest shall accrue as PIK interest. The VGS 2 Promissory Note provides for mandatory prepayments with the proceeds of certain asset sales, and VGS 2 has the right to\ndemand payment in full upon (i) a change of control of the Company and (ii) certain qualified financings (as defined in the VGS 2 Promissory Note).\nThe VGS 2 Promissory Note restricts P3 LLC’s ability and the ability of its subsidiaries to, among other things, incur indebtedness and liens, and make investments\nand restricted payments. The maturity date may be accelerated as a remedy under the certain default provisions in the agreement, or in the event a mandatory prepayment event\noccurs.\nIn connection with the issuance of the VGS 2 Promissory Note, we also entered into a subordination agreement, dated as of March 22, 2024 (the “2024 Subordination\nAgreement”) with VGS 2 which subordinates VGS 2’s right of payment under the VGS 2 Promissory Note to the right of payment and security interests of the lenders under the\nTerm Loan Facility. Under the terms of the 2024 Subordination Agreement, we will be required to pay all interest under the VGS 2 Promissory Note in-kind.\nWe paid VGS 2 an up-front fee of 1.5% of the aggregate principal amount of the loan in-kind. In addition, we will pay VBC 2 a back-end fee at the time the VGS 2\nPromissory Note is redeemed as follows: (i) if paid prior to June 30, 2024, 2.25%; (ii) if paid after June 30, 2024 and on or before September 30, 2024, 4.5%; (iii) if paid after\nSeptember 30, 2024 and on or before December 31, 2024,6.75% and (iv) if paid after December 31, 2024, 9.0%.\nP3 Health Partners Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 67\nTable of Contents\nRepurchase Promissory Note\nIn June 2019, we issued a share repurchase promissory note to a former equity investor for $15.0 million, which was subsequently amended in November 2020 (as\namended, the “Repurchase Promissory Note”). The Repurchase Promissory Note automatically matures and is due and payable on the earlier of June 30, 2026, a change in\ncontrol transaction, or an underwritten primary public offering, each as defined in the agreement. The Repurchase Promissory Note accrues PIK interest of 11.0% per year. The\nprincipal balance, accrued interest, and an exit fee of $0.6 million are due at maturity.\nCash Uses\nOur primary uses of cash include payments for medical expenses, administrative expenses, cost associated with our care model, debt service, and capital expenditures.\nFinal reconciliation and receipts of amounts due from payors are typically settled in arrears.\nPursuant to our election under Section 754 of the Internal Revenue Code (the “Code”), we expect to obtain an increase in our share of the tax basis in the net assets of\nP3 LLC when its units are redeemed or exchanged. We intend to treat any redemptions and exchanges of P3 LLC units as direct purchases of the units for U.S. federal income\ntax purposes. These increases in tax basis may reduce the amounts that we would otherwise pay in the future to various tax authorities. They may also decrease gains (or\nincrease losses) on future dispositions of certain capital assets to the extent the tax basis is allocated to those capital assets.\nIn connection with the Business Combinations, we entered into a TRA that provides for the payment by us of 85% of the amount of any tax benefits that we actually\nrealize, or in some cases are deemed to realize, as a result of (i) increases in our share of the tax basis in the net assets of P3 LLC resulting from any redemptions or exchanges\nof P3 LLC, (ii) tax basis increases attributable to payments made under the TRA, and (iii) deductions attributable to imputed interest pursuant to the TRA (the “TRA\nPayments”). We expect to benefit from the remaining 15% of any tax benefits that we may actually realize.\nThe estimation of a liability under the TRA is, by its nature, imprecise and subject to significant assumptions regarding a number of factors, including (but not limited\nto) the amount and timing of taxable income generated by the Company each year as well as the tax rate then applicable. The TRA liability is estimated to be $11.0 million as\nof December 31, 2023. Due to the Company’s history of losses, the Company has not recorded tax benefits associated with the increase in tax basis as a result of the Business\nCombinations. As a result, the Company determined that payments to TRA holders are not probable and no TRA liability has been recorded as of December 31, 2023.\nAs non-controlling interest holders exercise their right to exchange their units in P3 LLC, a TRA liability may be recorded based on 85% of the estimated future tax\nbenefits that the Company may realize as a result of increases in the tax basis of P3 LLC. The amount of the increase in the tax basis, the related estimated tax benefits, and the\nrelated TRA liability to be recorded will depend on the price of the Company’s Class A common stock at the time of the relevant redemption or exchange.\nP3 Health Partners Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 68\nTable of Contents\nThe following table summarizes current and long-term material cash requirements as of December 31, 2023:\nMaterial Cash Requirements\nLess than 1-3 3-5 More than\nTotal 1 year years years 5 years\n(in thousands)\nUnpaid claims(1) $ 178,009 $ 178,009 $ — $ — $ —\nLong-term debt, principal(2) 109,102 — 109,102 — —\nLong-term debt, interest(3) 59,311 5,882 53,429 — —\nOperating lease liabilities(4) 23,720 4,625 7,633 6,218 5,244\nTotal $ 370,142 $ 188,516 $ 170,164 $ 6,218 $ 5,244\n_____________________________________________\n(1) Represents unpaid claims due to third parties for health care services provided to members, including estimates for incurred but not reported claims. Estimates for incurred claims are based on historical\nenrollment and cost trends while also taking into consideration operational changes. Future and actual results typically differ from estimates.

See Note 16 “Leases” in our consolidated financial statements.\nLiquidity and Going Concern\nAs of the date of this Form 10-K, management believes that our existing cash resources are not sufficient to support planned operations for at least the next year from\nthe issuance of this Form 10-K. As a result, management has concluded that there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the\ndate the consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this Form 10-K are issued. In evaluating the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, management\nconsidered the Company’s current projections of future cash flows, current financial condition, sources of liquidity, and debt obligations for at least one year from the date of\nissuance of this Form 10-K in considering whether it has the ability to meet its obligations. This evaluation of our cash resources available over the next year from the date of\nissuance of this Form 10-K does not take into consideration the potential mitigating effect of our ongoing efforts to raise capital or management’s plans that have not been fully\nimplemented or the many factors that determine the Company’s capital requirements, including the pace of our growth, ability to manage medical costs and the maturity of our\nmembers. Management continues to explore raising additional capital through a combination of debt financing and equity issuances. If we raise funds by issuing debt securities\nor preferred stock, or by incurring loans, these forms of financing would have rights, preferences, and privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock. If we raise\ncapital through the issuance of additional equity, such sales and issuance would dilute the ownership interests of the existing holders of our Class A common stock. The\navailability and the terms under which we may be able to raise additional capital could be disadvantageous, and the terms of debt financing or other non-dilutive financing may\ninvolve restrictive covenants and dilutive financing instruments, which could place significant restrictions on our operations. Macroeconomic conditions and credit markets\ncould also impact the availability and cost of potential future debt financing. There can be no assurances that any additional debt, other non-dilutive and/or equity financing\nwould be available to us on favorable terms, or potentially at all. We expect to continue to incur net losses, comprehensive losses, and negative cash flows from operating\nactivities in accordance with our operating plan. If we are unable to obtain additional funding when needed, we will need to curtail planned activities in order to reduce costs,\nwhich will likely have an unfavorable effect on our ability to execute on our business plan, and have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and future\nprospects.\nThe audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern and\ndo not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of these uncertainties.\nOur independent registered public accounting firm, in its report on the Company’s consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023, has also\nexpressed substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nP3 Health Partners Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 69\nTable of Contents\nCash Flows\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2023 2022\n(in thousands)\nNet cash used in operating activities $ (76,028) $ (126,019)\nNet cash used in investing activities (1,827) (7,733)\nNet cash provided by financing activities 100,332 11,375\nNet change in cash $ 22,477 $ (122,377)\nOperating Activities\nNet cash used in operating activities was $76.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to net cash used in operating activities of $126.0 million for\nthe year ended December 31, 2022. Significant changes impacting net cash used in operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022 were primarily due to (i) cash sweeps of $30.8 million received in 2023, $20.3 million of which related to dates of service prior to 2023, (ii) $2.5 million in\ncash received in 2023 related to the release of indemnity funds previously escrowed as part of an acquisition in a prior year, and (iii) changes in working capital. As previously\ndisclosed, cash sweeps of $12.3 million were received in the comparative period in 2022, but were recognized in 2021 in accordance with our revenue recognition policy\nresulting from the extended reporting period related to the delayed 2021 audit.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities was $1.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, primarily consisting of purchases of property and equipment. Net cash\nused in investing activities was $7.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, primarily consisting of the acquisition of two medical practices, net of cash acquired, and\npurchases of property and equipment.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $100.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, consisting of proceeds from the March 2023 Private Placement,\nnet of offering costs, and borrowings on the VGS Promissory Note. Net cash provided by financing activities was $11.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2022,\nconsisting of proceeds from the issuance of the VGS Promissory Note, offset by debt repayments.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nThe discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in\naccordance with GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management use judgment in the application of accounting policies, including\nmaking estimates and assumptions that could affect assets and liabilities, revenue and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. Management bases its\nestimates on the best information available at the time, its experiences and various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could\ndiffer from those estimates. To the extent that there are differences between our estimates and actual results, our future financial statement presentation, financial condition,\nresults of operations, and cash flows will be affected. Below is a discussion of the critical accounting estimates that are particularly important to the portrayal of our financial\ncondition and results of operations and require the application of significant judgment by management.\nCapitated Revenue\nThe transaction price for our capitated payor contracts is variable as it primarily includes PMPM fees associated with unspecified membership. Medicare pays\ncapitation using a “risk adjustment model,” which compensates providers based on the health status (acuity) of each individual patient. Medicare Advantage plans with higher\nacuity patients receive higher premiums. Conversely, Medicare Advantage plans with lower acuity patients receive lesser premiums. Under the risk adjustment model,\ncapitation is paid on an interim basis based on enrollee data submitted for the preceding year and is\nP3 Health Partners Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 70\nTable of Contents\nadjusted in subsequent periods after final data is compiled. As premiums are adjusted via this risk adjustment model (via a RAF), our PMPM payments will change\ncommensurately with how our contracted Medicare Advantage plans’ premiums change with CMS. In certain contracts, PMPM fees also include adjustments for items such as\nperformance incentives or penalties based on the achievement of certain clinical quality metrics as contracted with payors.\nCapitated revenue is recognized based on an estimated PMPM transaction price to transfer the service for a distinct increment of the series (e.g., month), net of\nprojected acuity adjustments and performance incentives or penalties as management can reasonably estimate the ultimate PMPM payment of those contracts. We recognize\nrevenue in the month in which eligible members are entitled to receive healthcare benefits during the contract term. The capitation amount is subject to possible retroactive\npremium risk adjustments based on the member’s individual acuity.\nMedical Expense and Claims Payable\nThe cost of healthcare services is recognized in the period services are provided. Medical expense includes costs of all covered services provided to members assigned\nby the health plans under P3’s at-risk model. Medical expense includes the cost for third-party healthcare service providers, the cost for overseeing the quality of care and\nprograms, and from time to time, remediation of certain claims that might result from periodic reviews conducted by various regulatory agencies. This also includes an estimate\nof the cost of services that have been incurred, but not yet reported (“IBNR”).\nWe estimate our IBNR by applying standard actuarial methodologies, which utilize historical data, including the period between the date services are rendered and the\ndate claims received (and paid), denied claims activity, expected medical cost inflation, seasonality patterns, and changes in membership mix. Such estimates are subject to\nimpact from changes in both the regulatory and economic environments. Our claims payable represents management’s best estimate of its liability for unpaid medical costs. We\nhave included incurred but not reported claims of $178.0 million and $151.2 million on our consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nOur consolidated financial statements could be materially impacted if actual claims expense is different from our estimates. If our liability for incurred and not\nreported claims at December 31, 2023 were to differ by plus or minus 5%, the impact on medical claims expense would be approximately $8.9 million.\nPremium Deficiency Reserves\nA PDR is recorded when there is a probable future loss on unearned capitated premiums after estimated expected claim costs and claim adjustment expenses. Losses\nunder prepaid health care services contracts shall be recognized when it is probable that expected future health care costs and maintenance costs under a group of existing\ncontracts will exceed anticipated future premiums and stop-loss insurance recoveries on those contracts. To determine the need to recognize a loss, contracts shall be grouped in\na manner consistent with the provider’s method of establishing premium rates, for example, by community rating practices, geographical area, or statutory requirements, to\ndetermine whether a loss has been incurred. In our at-risk arrangements, the more we improve health outcomes and lower the overall cost of care, the more profitable we will be\nover time.\nWe assess the profitability of our at-risk arrangements to identify contracts where current operating results or forecasts indicate probable future losses. Management\nestimates the Company’s PDR by utilizing estimates of membership growth rates, changes in membership mix, estimated PMPM payments under contracts, historical claims\ndata, seasonality patterns, our ability to lower the overall cost of care and incremental medical costs, such as those related to COVID-19 admissions. Such estimates are subject\nto impact from changes in both the regulatory and economic environments. The Company’s PDR represents management’s best estimate of its probable future losses. We have\nincluded premium deficiency reserve liabilities of $13.7 million and $26.4 million on our accompanying consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2023 and 2022,\nrespectively.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 4 “Recent Accounting Pronouncements” in our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K for a description of recent accounting\nstandards issued and the anticipated effects on our consolidated financial statements.\nP3 Health Partners Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 71\nTable of Contents\nItem 7A.

(the “Company”) as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the related consolidated\nstatements of operations, stockholders’ equity and mezzanine equity, and cash flows for each of the years then ended, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the\n“consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the\nUnited States of America.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”), the Company’s internal control over\nfinancial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring\nOrganizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”) and our report dated March 28, 2024 expressed an adverse opinion thereon.\nGoing Concern Uncertainty\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 2 to the\nconsolidated financial statements, the Company has suffered recurring losses from operations that raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern.\nManagement’s plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 2. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the\noutcome of this uncertainty.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s consolidated\nfinancial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in\naccordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about\nwhether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing\nprocedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial\nstatements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of\nthe consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to\nbe communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially\nchallenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken\nas a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit\nP3 Health Partners Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 73\nTable of Contents\nmatters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\nEstimate of the Premium Deficiency Reserve\nAs described in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s consolidated premium deficiency reserve (“PDR”) balance was approximately $13.7 million at\nDecember 31, 2023. PDR is established when it is probable that expected future health care costs and maintenance costs under a group of contracts will exceed future premium\nand stop-loss insurance recoveries on those contracts. The Company assesses if a PDR is needed through review of current results and forecasts. For purposes of determining\npremium deficiency losses, contracts are grouped consistent with the Company’s method of acquiring, servicing, and measuring the profitability of such contracts based on the\nexpected medical loss ratio.\nWe identified the estimate of PDR as a critical audit matter. The principal consideration for this determination was the significant judgment used in developing certain\nassumptions used in the medical loss ratio (“MLR”). Auditing this element involved subjective auditor judgment due to the nature and extent of audit effort required to address\nthese matters, including the extent of specialized skills or knowledge needed.\nThe primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included:\n• Assessing the reasonableness of certain assumptions used in the expected MLR by evaluating these assumptions through comparison to the historical performance of the\nCompany and its peers to determine if contradictory evidence existed.\n• Utilizing personnel with specialized knowledge and skills in actuarial methods to assess the healthcare claims trend assumption in the expected MLR.\nValuation of Incurred but Not Reported Claims\nAs described in Notes 3 and 10 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s consolidated claims payable balance was approximately $178.0 million at December 31,\n2023. The Company’s claims payables primarily consist of the Company’s estimate for claims that have been incurred but have either not yet been received, processed, or paid\nand as such, not reported (“IBNR”). As discussed in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, management develops its IBNR liability estimate using standard actuarial\nmethodologies, which utilize historical data, including the period between the date services are rendered and the date claims are received and paid (the completion factor), per\nmember per month healthcare cost trends, denied claims activity, expected medical cost inflation, seasonality patterns, changes in membership mix, and a provision for adverse\ndeviation (“PAD”).\nWe identified the valuation of IBNR claims as a critical audit matter. The principal considerations for this determination were the significant judgments involved in: (i)\nevaluating the actuarial methodologies used, (ii) estimating the completion factors and per member per month cost based on historical payment patterns and consideration of\nhealth care cost trend factors, and (iii) determining the appropriate level of PAD. Auditing these elements involved subjective auditor judgments due to the nature and extent of\naudit effort required to address these matters, including the extent of specialized skills or knowledge needed.\nThe primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included:\n• Testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying reports used in estimating: (i) the completion factors by agreeing to underlying claims data and repricing certain\nclaims, and (ii) the per member per month cost by agreeing to underlying claims data and confirming member information with health plans.\n• Utilizing personnel with specialized knowledge and skills in actuarial methods to assist in: (i) evaluating the appropriateness and consistency of the actuarial\nmethodologies used, (ii) evaluating the reasonableness of the completion factors, per member per month healthcare cost trends factors, and the PAD used by the\nCompany’s management and its actuarial specialist by comparing our independently determined IBNR estimate to management’s recorded IBNR liability, and (iii)\nreviewing prior period estimates using subsequent claims development.\nP3 Health Partners Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 74\nTable of Contents\nDetermination of the Premium Risk Adjustment Revenue\nAs described in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s consolidated capitated revenue included approximately $27.7 million of estimated premium risk\nadjustment revenue during the year ended December 31, 2023. Medicare pays capitation using a “risk adjustment model,” which compensates providers based on the health\nstatus (acuity) of each individual patient, also known as the hierarchal condition categories (“HCC”). Medicare Advantage plans with higher acuity patients receive higher\npremiums. Conversely, Medicare Advantage plans with lower acuity patients receive lesser premiums. Under the risk adjustment model, capitation is paid on an interim basis\nbased on enrollee data submitted for the preceding year and is adjusted in subsequent periods after final data is compiled (using a Risk Adjustment Factor or “RAF”).\nWe identified the determination of Medicare Advantage RAF revenue as a critical audit matter. The principal considerations for this determination were the significant\ncomplexities involved in determining the HCC and the corresponding risk adjustment factor revenue. Auditing these elements involved especially challenging and complex\ncalculations due to the nature and extent of audit effort required to address these matters, including the extent of specialized skills or knowledge needed.\nThe primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included:\n• Assessing the reasonableness and accuracy of the underlying data used in the determination of the HCC by vouching samples to underlying support.\n• Utilizing personnel with specialized knowledge and skills in actuarial methods to assist in determining the HCC and the corresponding risk adjustment revenue.\n/s/ BDO USA, P.C.\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2021.\nLas Vegas, Nevada\nMarch 28, 2024\nP3 Health Partners Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 75\nTable of Contents\nP3 HEALTH PARTNERS INC. and SUBSIDIARIES\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\n(in thousands, except per share amounts)\nDecember 31,\n2023 2022\nASSETS\nCURRENT ASSETS:\nCash $ 36,320 $ 17,537\nRestricted cash 4,614 920\nHealth plan receivable, net of allowance for credit losses of 1$50 and $0, respectively 118,497 72,092\nClinic fees, insurance and other receivable 2,973 7,500\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets 3,613 2,643\nTOTAL CURRENT ASSETS 166,017 100,692\nProperty and equipment, net 8,686 8,839\nIntangible assets, net 666,733 751,050\nOther long-term assets 19,531 15,990\nTOTAL ASSETS (1) $ 860,967 $ 876,571\nLIABILITIES, MEZZANINE EQUITY, and STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY\nCURRENT LIABILITIES:\nAccounts payable $ 8,663 $ 11,542\nAccrued expenses and other current liabilities 36,884 16,647\nAccrued payroll 3,506 8,224\nHealth plan settlements payable 34,992 13,608\nClaims payable 178,009 151,207\nPremium deficiency reserve 13,670 26,375\nAccrued interest 23,648 14,061\nTOTAL CURRENT LIABILITIES 299,372 241,664\nOperating lease liability 13,622 11,516\nWarrant liabilities 1,085 1,517\nContingent consideration 4,907 4,794\nLong-term debt, net 108,319 94,421\nTOTAL LIABILITIES (1) 427,305 353,912\nCOMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES (Note 16 and Note 20)\nMEZZANINE EQUITY:\nRedeemable non-controlling interest 291,532 516,805\nSTOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY:\nClass A common stock, $0.0001 par value; 800,000 shares authorized; 116,588 and 41,579 shares issued and outstanding as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively 12 4\nClass V common stock, $0.0001 par value; 205,000 shares authorized; 196,569 and 201,592 shares issued and outstanding as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively 20 20\nAdditional paid in capital 509,442 315,375\nAccumulated deficit (367,344) (309,545)\nTOTAL STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY 142,130 5,854\nTOTAL LIABILITIES, MEZZANINE EQUITY, and STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY $ 860,967 $ 876,571\n____________________\n(1) The Company’s consolidated balance sheets include the assets and liabilities of its consolidated variable interest entities (“VIEs”).

(“P3”) is a patient-centered and physician-led population health management company and, for accounting purposes, the successor to P3\nHealth Group Holdings, LLC and its subsidiaries (collectively, “P3 LLC,” and together with P3, the “Company”) after the consummation of a series of business combinations in\n2021 with Foresight Acquisition Corp. (the “Business Combinations”). As the sole manager of P3 LLC, P3 operates and controls all of the business and affairs of P3 LLC.\nP3 LLC was founded on April 12, 2017 and began commercial operations on April 20, 2017 to provide population health management services on an at-risk basis to\ninsurance plans offering medical coverage to Medicare beneficiaries under Medicare Advantage programs. Medicare Advantage programs are insurance products created solely\nfor Medicare beneficiaries. Insurance plans contract directly with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”) to offer Medicare beneficiaries benefits that replace\ntraditional Medicare fee-for-service (“FFS”) coverage.\nThe Company’s contracts with health plans are based on an at-risk shared savings model. Under this model, the Company is financially responsible for the cost of all\ncontractually-covered services provided to members assigned to the Company by health plans in exchange for a fixed monthly “capitation” payment, which is generally a\npercentage of the payment health plans receive from CMS. Under this arrangement, Medicare beneficiaries generally receive all their healthcare coverage through the\nCompany’s network of employed and affiliated physicians and specialists.\nThe services provided to health plans’ members vary by contract. These may include utilization management, care management, disease education, and maintenance of\na quality improvement and quality management program for members assigned to the Company. The Company is also responsible for the credentialing of its providers,\nprocessing and payment of claims, and the establishment of a provider network for certain health plans.\nIn addition to the Company’s contracts with health plans, the Company provides primary healthcare services through its employed physician clinic locations. These\nprimary care clinics are reimbursed for services provided under FFS contracts with various payers and through capitated – per member, per month (“PMPM”) arrangements.\nNote 2: Going Concern and Liquidity\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern. The Company has experienced\nlosses since its inception and had net losses of $186.4 million and $1,561.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Such losses were primarily\nthe result of goodwill impairment charges with respect to the year ended December 31, 2022, and costs incurred in adding new members, building relationships with physician\npartners and payors, and developing new services. The Company anticipates operating losses and negative cash flows to continue for the foreseeable future due to the strong\ngrowth the Company has experienced over the last six years and the investments the Company is making in expanding its business, which require up-front expenses.\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company had $36.3 million and $17.5 million, respectively, in unrestricted cash and cash equivalents available to fund future\noperations. The Company’s capital requirements will depend on many factors, including the pace of the Company’s growth, ability to manage medical costs, the maturity of its\nmembers, and its ability to raise capital. The Company may need to use available capital resources and/or raise additional capital earlier than currently anticipated. When the\nCompany pursues additional debt and/or equity financing, there can be no assurance that such financing will be available on terms commercially acceptable to the Company. If\nthe Company is unable to obtain additional funding when needed, it will need to curtail planned activities in order to reduce costs, which will likely have an unfavorable effect\non the Company’s ability to execute on its business plan, and have an adverse effect on its business, results of operations, and future prospects. As a result of these matters,\nsubstantial doubt exists about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date the financial statements are issued. The accompanying\nconsolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of these uncertainties.\nP3 Health Partners Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 82\nTable of Contents\nNote 3: Significant Accounting Policies\nBasis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”)\nand include the accounts of the Company. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.\nThe Company periodically evaluates entities for consolidation either through ownership of a majority voting interest, or through means other than voting interest, in\naccordance with the Variable Interest Entity (“VIE”) accounting model. This evaluation includes a qualitative review of the design of the entity, its organizational structure,\nincluding decision making ability and financial agreements, as well as a quantitative review. The Company consolidates a VIE when it has a variable interest that provides it\nwith a controlling financial interest in the VIE, referred to as the primary beneficiary of the VIE.\nAs the sole managing member of P3 LLC, P3 has the right to direct the most significant activities of P3 LLC and the obligation to absorb losses and receive benefits.\nThe rights of the non-managing members of P3 LLC are limited and protective in nature and do not give substantive participation rights over the sole managing member.\nAccordingly, P3 identifies itself as the primary beneficiary of P3 LLC and began consolidating P3 LLC as of December 3, 2021, the closing date of the Business Combinations\n(the “Closing Date”), resulting in a non-controlling interest related to the common units of P3 LLC (“Common Units”) held by members other than P3. Additionally, as more\nfully described in Note 22 “Variable Interest Entities,” P3 LLC is the primary beneficiary of the following physician practices (collectively, the “Network VIEs”):\n• Kahan, Wakefield, Abdou, PLLC\n• Bacchus, Wakefield, Kahan, PC\n• P3 Health Partners Professional Services, P.C.\n• P3 Medical Group, P.C.\n• P3 Health Partners California, P.C. (f/k/a Omni IPA Medical Group, Inc.)\nComprehensive Loss\nComprehensive loss includes net loss to common stockholders as well as other changes in equity that result from transactions and economic events other than those\nwith stockholders. There was no difference between comprehensive loss and net loss to common stockholders for the periods presented.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of these consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that could affect the\nreported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of\nrevenue and expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its estimates, including, but not limited to, those related to allowance for credit\nlosses, revenue recognition, the liability for unpaid claims, equity-based compensation, premium deficiency reserves (“PDR”), fair value and impairment recognition of long-\nlived assets (including intangibles), fair value of liability classified instruments, and judgments related to deferred income taxes. The Company bases its estimates on the best\ninformation available at the time, its experiences, and various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ from those\nestimates.\nCommitments and Contingencies\nAn accrual is established for commitments and contingencies when management, after considering the facts and circumstances of each matter as then known to\nmanagement, has determined a specific contingency is probable and estimable. The Company also faces contingencies that are reasonably possible to occur that cannot\ncurrently be estimated. When only a range of amounts is reasonably estimable and no amount within the range is more likely than another, the low end of the range is recorded.\nThe Company expenses costs associated with loss contingencies, including any related legal fees, as they are incurred. Due to the inherent uncertainties surrounding gain\ncontingencies, the Company does not recognize potential gains until realized.\nP3 Health Partners Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 83\nTable of Contents\nNet Loss per Share\nBasic net loss per share attributable to common stockholders is computed by dividing the net loss attributable to common stockholders by the weighted-average\nnumber of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share attributable to common stockholders adjusts basic earnings per share for the\npotentially dilutive impact of warrants, stock options, restricted stock units, restricted stock awards, and Common Units convertible into shares of Class A common stock\nduring the period by applying the treasury stock method or if-converted method, as applicable.\nCash and Restricted Cash\nCash includes all cash and liquid investments with an initial maturity of three months or less. Cash deposits held in accounts at each financial institution are insured up\nto $250,000 by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”). The Company maintains its cash in bank deposit accounts that, at times, may exceed FDIC insured limits.\nManagement does not expect any losses to occur on such accounts.\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company had cash of $36.3 million and $17.5 million, respectively, deposited at banking institutions which are subject to the\nFDIC insured limit.\nRestricted cash is held for a specific purpose (such as payment of healthcare claims) and is thus not available to the Company for immediate or general business use.\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company had restricted cash of $4.6 million and $0.9 million, respectively.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company categorizes revenue based on various factors such as the nature of contracts as follows:\nYear Ended Year Ended\nDecember 31, December 31,\nRevenue Type 2023 % of Total 2022 % of Total\n(dollars in thousands)\nCapitated revenue $ 1,252,309 99 % $ 1,034,800 99 %\nOther patient service revenue:\nClinical fees & insurance revenue 5,192 0 6,158 0\nShared risk revenue — — 351 0\nCare coordination / management fees 8,301 1 7,924 1\nIncentive fees 573 0 238 0\nTotal other patient service revenue 14,066 1 14,671 1\nTotal revenue $ 1,266,375 100 % $ 1,049,471 100 %\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, four health plan customers each accounted for 10% or more of total revenue and collectively comprised 60% and\n66%, respectively, of the Company’s total revenue.\nCapitated Revenue\nThe Company contracts with health plans using an at-risk model. Under the at-risk model, the Company is responsible for the cost of all covered services provided to\nmembers assigned by the health plans to the Company in exchange for a fixed premium payment, which generally is a percentage of the health plans’ premiums (“POP”) paid\nby CMS. Through this capitation arrangement, the Company stands ready to provide assigned Medicare Advantage beneficiaries all their medical care via the Company’s\ndirectly employed and affiliated physician/provider network. Since the Company controls and provides medical care to its assigned members, the Company acts as a principal in\nthese capitation arrangements. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company had at-risk contracts in effect with 23 health plans and 24 health plans, respectively, across five\nstates.\nThe capitated revenue the Company receives is determined via a competitive bidding process with CMS and is based on the costs of care in local markets and the\naverage utilization of services by patients enrolled. Medicare pays capitation using a “risk adjustment model,” which compensates providers based on the health status (acuity)\nof each\nP3 Health Partners Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 84\nTable of Contents\nindividual patient, also known as hierarchal condition categories (“HCC”). Medicare Advantage plans with higher acuity patients receive higher premiums. Conversely,\nMedicare Advantage plans with lower acuity patients receive lesser premiums. Under the risk adjustment model, capitation is paid on an interim basis based on enrollee data\nsubmitted for the preceding year and is adjusted in subsequent periods after final data is compiled (using a Risk Adjustment Factor or “RAF”). The Company generally\nestimates transaction prices using the most likely methodology. Amounts are only included in the transaction price to the extent any significant uncertainty of reversal on\ncumulative revenue will not occur and is resolved. In certain contracts, PMPM fees also include adjustments for items such as performance incentives or penalties based on the\nachievement of certain clinical quality metrics as contracted with payors.\nCapitated revenue is recognized based on a PMPM transaction price to transfer the service for a distinct increment of the series (e.g., month), net of projected acuity\nadjustments and performance incentives or penalties. The Company recognizes revenue in the month in which eligible members are entitled to receive healthcare benefits during\nthe contract term. The capitation amount is subject to possible retroactive premium risk adjustments based on the member’s individual acuity. Premium risk adjustments\nrecorded in 2023 which relate to prior years were $20.3 million. Premium risk adjustments recorded in 2022 related to prior years were $3.3 million. In the fourth quarter of\n2023, the Company released a portion of the constraint applied in previous periods with respect to risk adjustment revenue for dates of service in 2022, which resulted in an\nincrease to capitation revenue in the amount of $27.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. As the period between the time of service and time of payment is typically\none year or less, the Company elected the practical expedient not to adjust for the effects of a significant financing component.\nThe Company’s contracts with health plans may include core functions and services for managing assigned patients’ medical care, the combination of which is offered\nas a single solution. Capitation contracts have a single performance obligation that is a stand ready obligation to perform healthcare services to the population of enrolled\nmembers and constitutes a series for the provision of managed healthcare services for the term of the contract, which is deemed to be one month since the mix of patients-\ncustomers can change month over month. The Company does not offer nor price each individual function as a standalone service to health plans.\nMonthly, each plan is contractually obligated to reserve for payment of medical claims equal to a defined POP attributable to members assigned to the Company. In\nturn, the Company administers medical claims for contractually covered services for assigned health plan members from that health plan’s reserve. On a quarterly or monthly\nbasis, health plans conduct a settlement of the reserve to determine any surplus or deficit amount. The reconciliation and distribution of the reserve occur within 120 days\nfollowing the end of each quarter. An annual settlement reconciliation and distribution occur within the period specified by the individual health plan’s contract (which can be\nup to 21 months following each year-end).\nThree health plan customers accounted for 10% or more of total health plan receivable each as of December 31, 2023 and 2022.\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2022, Management has deemed the Company’s settlement receivables to be fully collectible from those health plans where the\nCompany is not delegated for claims processing. Accordingly, a constraint on the variable consideration associated with settlement receivables was not recorded.\nOther Patient Service Revenue – Clinical Fees and Insurance Revenue\nClinical fees and insurance revenue relates to net patient fees received from various payors and direct patients under contracts in which the Company’s sole\nperformance obligation is to provide healthcare services through the operation of medical clinics. The Company recognizes clinic fees and insurance revenue in the period in\nwhich services are provided. Under FFS payment arrangements, revenue is recognized on the date of service using a portfolio approach. The Company’s performance\nobligations are typically satisfied in the same day services are provided. All the Company’s contracts with its customers under these arrangements include a single performance\nobligation.\nThe Company’s contractual relationships with patients, in most cases, also involve third-party payors (Medicare, Medicaid, managed care health plans and commercial\ninsurance companies, including plans offered through state-sponsored health insurance exchanges). Transaction prices for services provided are dependent upon specific rules in\nplace with third party payors–specifically, Medicare/Medicaid and pre-negotiated rates with managed care health plans and commercial insurance companies. Contractual\narrangements with third parties typically include payments at amounts which are less than standard charges. These charges generally have predetermined rates for diagnostic\nservice codes or discounted FFS rates. The Company perpetually reviews its contractual estimation processes to consider and incorporate updates to\nP3 Health Partners Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 85\nTable of Contents\nlaws, regulations, and frequent changes in the managed care system. Contractual terms are negotiated and updated accordingly upon renewal.\nClinical fees and insurance revenue is based upon the estimated amounts the Company expects to receive from patients and third-party payors. Estimates of explicit\nprice concessions under managed care and commercial insurance plans are tied to payment terms specified in related contractual agreements. Retroactively calculated explicit\nprice concessions tied to reimbursement agreements with third-party payers are recognized on an estimated basis in the period related services are rendered and adjusted in\nfuture periods as final payments are received. Revenue related to uninsured patients, uninsured co-payments, and deductibles (for patients with healthcare coverage) may also\nbe discounted. The Company records implicit price concessions (based on historical collection experience) related to uninsured accounts to recognize self-pay revenue at their\nmost likely amounts to be collected.\nThe Company deems FFS revenue to be variable consideration and its estimates of associated transaction prices will not result in a significant revenue reversal in the\nfuture.\nThe Company has elected the practical expedient not to adjust the transaction price for any financing components as those were deemed to be insignificant and to\nexpense all incremental customer contract acquisition costs as incurred as such costs are not material and would be amortized over a period less than one year.\nOther Patient Service Revenue – Care Coordination Fees and Management Fees\nThe Company’s delegated health plans may also pay a Care Coordination Fee (“CCF”) or management fee to the Company. CCFs and management fees are intended\nto fund the costs of delegated services provided to certain health plans. CCFs are specifically identified and separated in each monthly capitation payment the Company receives\nfrom these parties. None of the Company’s other health plans bifurcate CCFs nor are any of them contractually required to do so. Based on similarities of the terms of the care\ncoordination and administrative services, the Company uses a portfolio approach to record revenue from CCFs and management fees.\nPatient Fees Receivable\nSubstantially all client fees and insurance receivables are due under FFS contracts with third party payors, such as commercial insurance companies, government-\nsponsored healthcare programs, or directly from patients. The Company has agreements with third-party payors that provide for payments at amounts different from the\nestablished rates. Payment arrangements include prospectively determined rates per discharge, reimbursed costs, discounted charges, and per diem payments. Patient fees\nreceivable, where a third-party payor is responsible for the amount due, are recorded at the invoiced amount, net of any expected contractual adjustments and implicit price\nconcessions, and do not bear interest. Contractual adjustments arising under reimbursement arrangements with third-party payors are accrued on an estimated basis in the period\nthe related services are rendered and are adjusted in future periods as final settlements are determined. The Company continuously monitors activities from payors (including\npatients) and records an implicit price concession as a reduction of revenue based on specific contracts and actual historical collection patterns to reflect the estimated amounts\nthe Company expects to collect. Patient fees receivable of $0.7 million and $0.8 million are included in clinic fees, insurance and other receivable in the Company’s\nconsolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and are recorded net of contractual allowances.\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment is carried at acquisition cost, net of accumulated depreciation. Costs for repairs and maintenance of property and equipment, after such\nproperty and equipment has been placed in service, are expensed as incurred. Costs and related accumulated depreciation are eliminated when property and equipment is sold or\notherwise disposed. Sales and disposals may result in asset-specific gains or losses. Any such gains or losses are included as a component of operations. The Company records\ndepreciation using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives\nP3 Health Partners Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 86\nTable of Contents\nof the respective assets. The following table summarizes the estimated useful lives of the Company’s property and equipment:\nClassification Depreciation Cycle\nLeasehold improvements (cycle: lease term) 1 to 10 Years\nFurniture and fixtures 7 Years\nVehicles 5 Years\nComputer equipment 3 Years\nMedical equipment 7 Years\nSoftware 3 Years\nThe Company capitalizes certain costs incurred in connection with developing its own proprietary technology to serve core functions of its business operations such as\nrevenue and medical cost analysis, care management and various facets that promote impactful utilization. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company has capitalized\n$3.9 million and $3.5 million, respectively, to property and equipment for these software costs (specifically to work in progress). In 2022, $0.7 million of capitalized costs were\nplaced into service. No capitalized costs were placed into service in 2023. All costs associated with internally developed technology following deployment, or that otherwise do\nnot meet capitalization criteria, are expensed as incurred.\nFair Value Measurements\nThe Company uses valuation approaches that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs to the extent possible. The Company\ndetermines fair value based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability in the principal or most advantageous market. When considering\nmarket participant assumptions in fair value measurements, the following fair value hierarchy distinguishes between observable and unobservable inputs, which are categorized\nin one of the following levels (see Note 5 “Fair Value Measurements and Hierarchy” for further discussion):\nLevel 1 inputs: Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities accessible to the reporting entity at the measurement date.\nLevel 2 inputs: Other than quoted prices included in Level 1 inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term\nof the asset or liability.\nLevel 3 inputs: Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability used to measure fair value to the extent that observable inputs are not available, thereby allowing for\nsituations in which there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability at measurement date.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nThe Company reviews its long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate their carrying amounts may not be recoverable.\nRecoverability of an asset or asset group is measured by comparing its carrying amount to the future undiscounted net cash flows the asset or asset group is expected to generate.\nIf such assets are considered impaired (e.g., future undiscounted cash flows are less than net book value), an impairment charge is recognized, measured by the difference\nbetween the carrying value and the estimated fair value of the assets. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value assigned to tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed.\nGoodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis in the fourth quarter, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate the\ncarrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable (a “triggering event”). On the occurrence of a triggering event, an entity has the option to first assess qualitative factors to\ndetermine whether a quantitative impairment test is necessary. If it is more likely than not that goodwill is impaired, the fair value of the reporting unit is compared with its\ncarrying value. An impairment charge is\nP3 Health Partners Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 87\nTable of Contents\nrecognized for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, provided, the loss recognized cannot exceed the total amount of goodwill.\nIntangible Assets\nIntangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. In determining the estimated useful lives of definite-\nlived intangibles, the Company considers the nature, competitive position, life cycle position and historical and expected future operating cash flows of each acquired asset, as\nwell as its commitment to support these assets through continued investment and legal infringement protection.\nThe Company reviews intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be\nrecoverable. Determining whether an impairment loss occurred requires comparing the carrying amount to the sum of undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the\nasset. Such events and circumstances include the occurrence of an adverse change in the market involving the business employing the assets or a situation in which it is more\nlikely than not that the Company will dispose of such assets. If the comparison indicates that there is impairment, the impairment loss to be recognized as a non-cash charge to\nearnings is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value and the impaired asset is written down to its fair value or, if fair value is not\nreadily determinable, to an estimated fair value based on discounted expected future cash flows.\nLeases\nThe Company determines whether a contract is or contains a lease at the inception of the contract. For leases with terms greater than 12 months, the Company records\nthe related operating or finance right-of-use asset and lease liability at the present value of lease payments over the lease term. The Company is generally not able to readily\ndetermine the implicit rate in the lease and therefore uses the determined incremental borrowing rate at lease commencement to compute the present value of lease payments.\nThe incremental borrowing rate represents an estimate of the market interest rate the Company would incur at lease commencement to borrow an amount equal to the lease\npayments on a collateralized basis over the term of a lease. Renewal options are not included in the measurement of the right-of-use assets and lease liabilities unless the\nCompany is reasonably certain to exercise the optional renewal periods. Some leases also include early termination options, which can be exercised under specific conditions.\nAdditionally, certain leases contain incentives, such as construction allowances from landlords, which reduce the right-of-use asset related to the lease.\nCertain of the Company’s leases contain rent escalations over the lease term. The Company recognizes expense for operating leases on a straight-line basis over the\nlease term. The Company’s lease agreements contain variable payments for common area maintenance and utilities. The Company has elected the practical expedient to\ncombine lease and non-lease components for all asset categories; therefore, the lease payments used to measure the lease liability for these leases include fixed minimum rentals\nalong with fixed non-lease component charges. Variable lease payments are excluded from the measurement of right-of-use assets and lease liabilities and are recognized in the\nperiod in which the obligation for those payments is incurred. The Company does not have significant residual value guarantees or restrictive covenants in its lease portfolio.\nBusiness Combinations\nThe price tendered in business combinations is allocated using the acquisition method of accounting among the identifiable tangible and intangible assets and assumed\nliabilities and non-controlling interests, all of which are based on estimates of corresponding fair value as of the acquisition date. The Company applies valuation methods which\nare ultimately used in the Company’s purchase price allocations. Goodwill is recorded based on the difference between the fair value of consideration exchanged and the fair\nvalue of the net assets and liabilities assumed. Such fair values that are not finalized for reporting periods following the acquisition date are estimated and recorded as\nprovisional amounts. Adjustments to these provisional amounts during the measurement period (defined as the date through which all information required to identify and\nmeasure the consideration transferred, the assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and the non-controlling interests obtained, limited to one year from the acquisition date) are\nrecorded when identified.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company acquired two medical practices in separate transactions. The total cash purchase price was $5.5 million, net of\ncash acquired, and was allocated primarily to goodwill.\nP3 Health Partners Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 88\nTable of Contents\nEquity-Based Compensation\nEquity-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date for all equity-based awards based on the fair value of the awards. For equity awards that vest subject to\nthe satisfaction of service-based conditions, compensation cost is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which varies by award. For equity awards\nthat vest subject to the satisfaction of performance-based conditions, the Company evaluates the probability of achieving each performance-based condition at each reporting\ndate and recognizes compensation cost when it is deemed probable that the performance-based condition will be met on an accelerated basis over the requisite service period,\nwhich varies by award. Equity-based compensation is recorded within corporate, general and administrative expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.\nThe Company accounts for forfeitures as they occur.\nThe Company uses the Black-Sholes option-pricing model to determine the fair value of the Company’s stock option awards. The risk-free interest rate estimate was\nbased on constant maturity, which is the theoretical value of a U.S. Treasury that is based on recent values of auctioned U.S. Treasuries with remaining terms similar to the\nexpected term of the stock option awards. The expected dividend yield was based on the Company’s expectation of not paying dividends in the foreseeable future. The expected\nterm was calculated using the “simplified” method; whereby, the expected term equals the arithmetic average of the vesting term and the original contractual term of the stock\noption due to P3’s lack of sufficient historical data. The expected volatility was estimated using an average of the historical volatilities of a peer group comprised of publicly\ntraded companies in the same industry. The Company assesses the impact of material nonpublic information on its share price or expected volatility, as applicable, at the time of\ngrant.\nThe Company’s restricted stock and restricted stock unit awards are measured based on the fair market value of the underlying shares of Class A common stock on the\ndate of grant.\nWarrant Liability\nThe Company has public and private placement warrants of Class A common stock classified as liabilities as well as warrants of Class A common stock issued to a\nlender classified as equity. The Company classifies as equity any equity-linked contracts that (1) require physical settlement or net-share settlement or (2) give the Company a\nchoice of net-cash settlement or settlement in the Company’s own shares (physical settlement or net-share settlement). Warrants classified as equity are initially measured at fair\nvalue. Subsequent changes in fair value are not recognized as long as the warrants continue to be classified as equity.\nThe Company classifies as assets or liabilities any equity-linked contracts that (1) require net-cash settlement (including a requirement to net-cash settle the contract if\nan event occurs and if that event is outside the Company’s control) or (2) give the counterparty a choice of net-cash settlement or settlement in shares (physical settlement or\nnet-share settlement). For equity-linked contracts that are classified as liabilities, the Company records the fair value of the equity-linked contracts at each balance sheet date and\nrecords the change in the statements of operations as a gain (loss) from change in fair value of warrant liability. The Company’s public warrant liability is valued using\nobservable market prices for those public warrants. The Company’s private placement warrants are valued using a binomial lattice pricing model when the warrants are subject\nto the make-whole table, or otherwise are valued using a Black-Scholes pricing model. The Company’s warrants issued to a capital provider are valued using a Black-Scholes-\nMerton pricing model based on observable market prices for public shares and warrants. The assumptions used in preparing these models include estimates such as volatility,\ncontractual terms, discount rates, dividend yield, expiration dates and risk-free rates.\nThe Company accounts for warrants as either equity-classified or liability-classified instruments based on an assessment of the warrant’s specific terms. The\nassessment considers whether the warrants are freestanding financial instruments, meet the definition of a liability, and whether the warrants meet all of the requirements for\nequity classification, including whether the warrants are indexed to the Company’s own ordinary shares, among other conditions for equity classification. This assessment,\nwhich requires the use of professional judgment, is conducted at the time of warrant issuance and as of each subsequent quarterly period end date while the warrants are\noutstanding.\nPremium Deficiency Reserve\nPDR liabilities are established when it is probable that expected future health care costs and maintenance costs under a group of existing contracts will exceed\nanticipated future premiums and stop-loss insurance recoveries on those contracts. The Company assesses if a PDR liability is needed through review of current results and\nforecasts. For purposes of determining premium deficiency losses, contracts are grouped consistent with our method of acquiring, servicing, and\nP3 Health Partners Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 89\nTable of Contents\nmeasuring the profitability of such contracts based on the expected medical loss ratio. The Company grouped its Medicare Advantage health plan contracts together as a single\ngroup as it operates in one line of business. The Company further concluded that the costs to administer these contracts are based on centralized and shared service functions. As\nof December 31, 2023 and 2022, the PDR liability was $13.7 million and $26.4 million, respectively, which represented its estimate of probable contract losses expected to be\ngenerated by the Company’s health plans.\nMedical Expense and Claims Payable\nThe cost of healthcare services is recognized in the period services are provided. This also includes an estimate of the cost of services that have been incurred, but not\nyet reported (“IBNR”). Medical expense also includes costs for overseeing the quality of care and programs, which focus on patient wellness. Additionally, medical expense can\ninclude, from time to time, remediation of certain claims that might result from periodic reviews conducted by various regulatory agencies.\nManagement estimates the Company’s IBNR by applying standard actuarial methodologies, which utilize historical data, including the period between the date\nservices are rendered and the date claims are received and paid, the completion factor, per member per month healthcare trends, denied claims activity, expected medical cost\ninflation, seasonality patterns, changes in membership mix, and a provision for adverse deviation. IBNR estimates are subject to the impact from changes in both the regulatory\nand economic environments. Such estimates are made on an accrual basis and adjusted in future periods as required. Future and actual results typically differ from estimates.\nDifferences could result from an overall change in medical expenses per member, changes in member mix or simply due to the addition of new members. Any adjustments to\nprior period estimates are included in the current period.\nThe Company’s claims payable represents management’s best estimate of its liability for unpaid medical costs as of December 31, 2023 and 2022.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the\ndifferences between the financial reporting and the tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the\ndifferences are expected to reverse.\nDeferred tax assets are evaluated for future realization and reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent the Company believes it is more likely than not that they will\nnot be realized. The Company considers all available positive and negative evidence, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected future\ntaxable income, tax-planning strategies, carryback potential if permitted under tax law, and results of recent operations.\nThe Company records uncertain tax positions on the basis of a two-step process in which (1) the Company determines whether it is more likely than not that the tax\npositions will be sustained on the basis of the technical merits of the position and (2) for those tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, the\nCompany recognizes the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement with the related tax authority. The Company\nconsiders many factors when evaluating its uncertain tax positions during the course of the year through a review of policies and procedures, reviews of customary and regular\ntax filings, and discussions with third party experts. This review can involve significant judgment and may require periodic adjustments. The resolution of these uncertain tax\npositions in a manner inconsistent with management’s expectations could have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. The Company recognizes\ninterest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as a component of its provision for income taxes. Accrued interest and penalties are included with the related tax liability.\nSee Note 12 “Income Taxes” for further information.\nAdvertising Expense\nThe Company uses advertising primarily to promote the health plans with which it conducts business as well as its physician clinics throughout the geographic areas it\nserves. Advertising costs are charged directly to operations as incurred. Advertising expense totaled $3.2 million and $4.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2023 and\n2022, respectively.\nP3 Health Partners Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 90\nTable of Contents\nReclassifications\nCertain amounts in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been reclassified to be consistent with the current period\npresentation. These reclassifications had no impact on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations, or net cash flows.\nNote 4: Recent Accounting Pronouncements\nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\nASU 2021-08, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers (“ASU 2021-08”)\nAccounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2021-08 requires that an entity (acquirer) recognize and measure contract assets and contract liabilities acquired in a business\ncombination in accordance with Topic 606. At the acquisition date, an acquirer should account for the related revenue contracts as if it had originated the contracts. In the fourth\nquarter of 2023, the Company adopted ASU 2021-08 effective January 1, 2023. The guidance will be applied to future business combinations.\nASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments (“ASU 2016-13”)\nASU 2016-13 introduced a new model for recognizing credit losses on financial instruments based on an estimate of current expected credit losses. The new current\nexpected credit losses model generally calls for the immediate recognition of all expected credit losses and applies to loans, accounts and trade receivables as well as other\nfinancial assets measured at amortized cost, loan commitments and off-balance sheet credit exposures, debt securities and other financial assets measured at fair value through\nother comprehensive income, and beneficial interests in securitized financial assets. The new guidance replaced the current incurred loss model for measuring expected credit\nlosses, requires expected losses on available for sale debt securities to be recognized through an allowance for credit losses rather than as reductions in the amortized cost of the\nsecurities, and provides for additional disclosure requirements. In April 2019, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued ASU 2019-04, which, among other\namendments, allowed for certain policy elections and practical expedients related to accrued interest on financial instruments. In May 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-05,\nwhich granted targeted transition relief by allowing entities to irrevocably elect the fair value option for certain financial assets previously measured at amortized cost. In\nNovember 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-10 and ASU 2019-11, which addressed certain aspects of the guidance related to effective dates, expected recoveries, troubled\ndebt restructurings, accrued interest receivables, and financial assets secured by collateral. The Company adopted ASU 2016-13 and related amendments as of January 1, 2023\non a modified retrospective basis. The adoption of this standard did not have a material effect on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted\nASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures (“ASU 2023-09”)\nASU 2023-09 enhances the transparency and decision usefulness of income tax disclosures, in response to investors’ feedback, indicating the need for improved\ninformation to assess an entity’s operations, tax risks, and planning opportunities, particularly in understanding exposure to jurisdictional tax changes and their impact on cash\nflows. The amendments address these concerns by improving income tax disclosures, primarily related to the rate reconciliation and income taxes paid information. The\namendments in this update are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024 and should be applied prospectively. Early adoption and retrospective\napplication is permitted. The Company is evaluating the effect ASU 2023-09 will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures (“ASU 2023-07”)\nASU 2023-07 improves the disclosures about a public entity’s reportable segments and addresses requests from investors for additional, more detailed information\nabout a reportable segment’s expenses. The amendments in this update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years\nbeginning after December 15, 2024. The amendments require retrospective application to all prior periods presented in the financial statements. Upon transition, the segment\nexpense categories and amounts disclosed in the prior periods should be based on\nP3 Health Partners Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 91\nTable of Contents\nthe significant segment expense categories identified and disclosed in the period of adoption.

The effective date for each amendment will be the date on which the SEC’s removal of that related disclosure from\nRegulation S-X or Regulation S-K becomes effective, with early adoption prohibited. The amendments in this update should be applied prospectively. If by June 30, 2027, the\nSEC has not removed the applicable requirement from Regulation S-X or Regulation S-K, the pending content of the related amendment will be removed from the Codification\nand will not become effective for any entity. The Company is evaluating the effect ASU 2023-06 will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nASU 2020-06, Debt – Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging — Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40),\nAccounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity’s Own Equity (“ASU 2020-06”)\nASU 2020-06 eliminates two of the three models in ASC 470-20 that require issuers to separately account for embedded conversion features and eliminates some of\nthe requirements for equity classification in ASC 815-40-25 for contracts in an entity’s own equity. The guidance also requires entities to use the if-converted method for all\nconvertible instruments in the diluted earnings per share calculation and generally requires them to include the effect of potential share settlement for instruments that may be\nsettled in cash or shares. As a smaller reporting company, the amendments in this update are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim\nperiods therein. The Company does not expect the adoption of ASU 2020-06 to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nNote 5: Fair Value Measurements and Hierarchy\nInformation about the Company’s financial liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis is presented below:\nLevel 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total\n(in thousands)\nWarrant liability as of December 31, 2023 $ 1,056 $ — $ 29 $ 1,085\nWarrant liability as of December 31, 2022 $ 1,477 $ — $ 40 $ 1,517\nThe key Level 3 inputs into the option pricing model related to the private placement warrants to purchase Class A common stock were as follows:\nDecember 31,\n2023 2022\nVolatility 75 % 55 %\nRisk-free interest rate 4.01 % 4.11 %\nExercise price $ 11.50 $ 11.50\nExpected term 2.9 Years 3.9 Years\nGenerally, an increase in the market price of the Company’s shares of common stock, an increase in the volatility of the Company’s shares of common stock, and an\nincrease in the remaining term of the warrants would each result in a directionally similar change in the estimated fair value of the Company’s warrant liabilities. Such changes\nwould increase the associated liability while decreases in these assumptions would decrease the associated liability. An increase in the risk-free interest rate would result in a\ndecrease in the estimated fair value measurement and thus a decrease in the associated liability. The Company has not, and does not plan to, declare dividends on its common\nstock and, as such, there is no change in the estimated fair value of the warrant liabilities due to the dividend assumption.\nP3 Health Partners Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 92\nTable of Contents\nThe following table sets forth a summary of changes in the fair value of the Company’s private placement warrants to purchase Class A common stock, which are\nconsidered to be Level 3 fair value measurements:\nDecember 31,\n2023 2022\n(in thousands)\nBeginning balance $ 40 $ 502\nMark-to-market adjustment of stock warrants (11) (462)\nEnding balance $ 29 $ 40\nThe Company recorded gains on the changes in the fair value of public warrants of $0.4 million and $9.4 million during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022,\nrespectively.\nThe book value of cash; clinic fees, insurance receivables, and other receivables; accounts payable; and accrued expenses and other current liabilities approximate fair\nvalue because of the short maturity and high liquidity of these instruments.\nNote 6: Property and Equipment\nThe Company’s property and equipment balances consisted of the following:\nDecember 31,\n2023 2022\n(in thousands)\nLeasehold improvements $ 2,933 $ 1,810\nFurniture & fixtures 1,165 1,262\nComputer equipment & software 3,699 3,206\nMedical equipment 1,106 1,067\nSoftware (development in process) 3,877 3,460\nVehicles 654 618\nOther 33 37\n13,467 11,460\nLess: accumulated depreciation (4,781) (2,621)\nProperty and equipment, net $ 8,686 $ 8,839\nTotal depreciation of property and equipment recognized on the consolidated statements of operations was $2.3 million and $2.4 million for the years ended\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nP3 Health Partners Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 93\nTable of Contents\nNote 7: Goodwill\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of goodwill and accumulated goodwill impairment losses as of (in thousands):\nBalance at December 31, 2021\nGoodwill $ 1,309,750\nAccumulated goodwill impairment losses —\n1,309,750\nAcquisitions 5,202\nImpairment losses (1,314,952)\nBalance at December 31, 2022\nGoodwill 1,314,952\nAccumulated goodwill impairment losses (1,314,952)\n$ —\nIn the second quarter of 2022, the Company identified indicators of impairment related to goodwill due to a significant deterioration in the overall market and a\nsustained decrease in the price of the Company’s Class A common stock. As a result, the Company performed an interim assessment for impairment as of June 30, 2022 and\nnoted that the Company’s share price (i) was significantly lower than its opening price on December 2, 2021, (ii) had not surpassed its opening price since December 15, 2021,\nand (iii) had steadily declined through the end of the second quarter of 2022, which did not follow the overall rebound pattern in the healthcare industry. Management\nconcluded that, given the macroeconomic and financial market conditions, industry-specific considerations, the decline in the Company’s performance as a result of higher than\nexpected medical expenses due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and the sustained decrease in share price, it was more likely than not that the Company’s fair value was less than its\ncarrying amount at June 30, 2022. Accordingly, management performed the impairment test by estimating the Company’s fair value using a weighted combination of (i)\ndiscounted cash flows, using Level 3 inputs such as revenue, profit margin, and discount rate and (ii) market-based approach, using Level 3 inputs such as comparable\ncompanies’ market multiples. Based on management’s comparison of the Company’s weighted estimated fair value to its carrying amount, an $851.5 million goodwill\nimpairment charge was recorded for the three months ended June 30, 2022.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2022, the Company identified indicators of impairment related to goodwill due to the Company’s overall financial performance and a sustained\ndecrease in the price of the Company’s Class A common stock. As a result, the Company performed an assessment for impairment as of December 31, 2022 and noted that the\nCompany’s share price closed at its lowest price in its trading history and had steadily declined through the end of December 31, 2022, which was not consistent or was\nsignificantly worse when compared to the performance of its peers and the healthcare industry as a whole. Management concluded that, given the decline in the Company’s\nperformance and the sustained decrease in its share price, it was more likely than not that the Company’s fair value was less than its carrying amount at December 31, 2022.\nAccordingly, management performed the impairment test by estimating the Company’s fair value using a weighted combination of (i) discounted cash flows, using Level 3\ninputs such as revenue, profit margin, and discount rate; and (ii) market-based approach, using Level 3 inputs such as comparable companies’ market multiples.

Accrued interest was $11.7 million and $9.0 million as of\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nTerm Loan Facility\nIn November 2020, the Company entered into a Term Loan Agreement and Security Agreement with a commercial lender (as amended, the “Term Loan Agreement”),\nwhich provided funding up to $100.0 million (the “Term Loan Facility”), of which $65.0 million was drawn as of December 31, 2023 and 2022. The Company’s access to\nadditional borrowings under the Term Loan Facility ended upon termination of the commitment period on February 28, 2022. The Term Loan Agreement was amended on\nNovember 16, 2021 to provide for certain modifications and to obtain consent from the lenders to consummate the Business Combinations. The Term Loan Agreement was\namended on December 21, 2021 to provide for certain modifications and to permit the consummation of an acquisition in a prior year and related transactions. The Term Loan\nAgreement was amended on December 13, 2022 to provide for certain modifications and to permit the issuance of the Unsecured Promissory Note (defined below) and related\ntransactions. The Security Agreement provides the lenders collateral in 100% of the Company’s pledged stock, its subsidiaries (including tangible and intangible personal\nproperty), and bank accounts.\nThe principal balance is due in full on the maturity date, which is December 31, 2025. This maturity date may be accelerated as a remedy under certain default\nprovisions in the agreement or in the event a mandatory prepayment trigger occurs. Interest is payable at 12.0% per annum on a quarterly cycle (in arrears). The Company has\nelected to pay interest of 8.0% per annum in cash with the remaining 4.0% per annum being added to principal as PIK interest for a period oft hree years (or 12 payments). The\nPIK is subject to acceleration in the event certain occurrences in the Term Loan Facility’s agreement are triggered. Accrued interest was $7.9 million and $5.0 million as of\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nThe Term Loan Facility includes certain restrictive covenants, including restrictions on the payment of cash dividends. The Company must remain in compliance with\nfinancial covenants such as minimum liquidity of $5.0 million and annual minimum revenue levels. On an annual basis, the Company must post a minimum amount of annual\nrevenue equal to or greater than $525.0 million in 2023, $585.0 million in 2024, and $650.0 million in 2025. The Company is also subject to certain restrictions that include\nindebtedness and liens.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company was not in compliance with its Term Loan Facility covenants related to issuance of the 2023 financial statements with an audit\nopinion free of a “going concern” qualification. The Term Loan Facility lenders granted a waiver of the covenant under the Term Loan Facility related to the existence of a\n“going concern” qualification in the audit opinion for our audited financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31,\nP3 Health Partners Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 97\nTable of Contents\n2023. The Company was in compliance with all other covenants under the Term Loan Facility as of December 31, 2023; however, there can be no assurance that the Company\nwill be able to maintain compliance with these covenants in the future or that the lenders under the Term Loan Facility or the lenders of any future indebtedness the Company\nmay incur will grant any such waiver or forbearance in the future.\nVGS Promissory Note\nIn December 2022, the Company entered into a related party financing transaction (see Note 21 “Related Parties”) with VBC Growth SPV LLC (“VGS”) which\nincluded the issuance of an unsecured promissory note (the “VGS Promissory Note”) to VGS; warrant agreement, pursuant to which the Company issued warrants to purchase\n0.4 million shares of Class A common stock at an exercise price of $4.26 per share to VGS (see Note 9 “Warrants”); and a subordination agreement (the “2022 Subordination\nAgreement”), pursuant to which VGS agreed to subordinate its right of payment under the VGS Promissory Note to the right of payment and security interests of the lenders\nunder the Term Loan Facility. The VGS Promissory Note provided for funding of up to $40.0 million, which ended upon the termination of the commitment period on February\n3, 2023. The Company paid VGS an up-front fee of 1.5% at the time of each draw. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, $29.1 million and $15.0 million had been drawn on the\nVGS Promissory Note, respectively, and the Company had recorded debt issuance costs and original issue discount of $0.8 million and $0.6 million, respectively.\nThe VGS Promissory Note matures on May 19, 2026. Interest is payable at1 4.0% per annum on a quarterly cycle (in arrears) beginning March 31, 2023. The\nCompany may elect to pay interest 6.0% in kind and 8.0% in cash, but if the terms of the 2022 Subordination Agreement do not permit the Company to pay interest in cash,\ninterest will be paid entirely in-kind. Accrued interest was $4.0 million and $0.1 million as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nThe Company will pay VGS a back-end fee of 9.0% at the time the VGS Promissory Note is paid. The VGS Promissory Note may be prepaid, at the Company’s\noption, either in whole or in part, without penalty or premium, at any time and from time to time, subject to the payment of the back-end fee; provided that prepayments must be\nin increments of at least $2.0 million.\nThe VGS Promissory Note restricts the Company’s ability and the ability of its subsidiaries to, among other things, incur indebtedness and liens, and make investments\nand restricted payments. The maturity date may be accelerated as a remedy under the certain default provisions in the agreement, or in the event a mandatory prepayment event\noccurs.\nAs of December 31, 2023, long-term debt maturities are as follows (in thousands):\n2024 $ —\n2025 65,000\n2026 44,102\n109,102\nLess: unamortized debt issuance costs and original issue discount (783)\n$ 108,319\nNote 12: Income Taxes\nAs a result of the Business Combinations, substantially all the Company’s assets and operations are held and conducted by P3 LLC and its subsidiaries, and the\nCompany’s only assets are equity interests in P3 LLC. P3 LLC is treated as a partnership for U.S. federal and most applicable state and local income tax jurisdictions. As a\npartnership, P3 LLC is generally not subject to taxes, other than entity level state income taxes. Any taxable income or loss generated by P3 LLC is passed through to and\nincluded within the taxable income or loss of its members in accordance with the terms of the P3 LLC Amended & Restated Limited Liability Agreement dated as of the\nClosing Date (“P3 LLC A&R LLC Agreement”). Prior to the Business Combinations, the income and losses of P3 LLC were passed through to its members and nontaxable to\nP3 LLC.\nThe Company is taxed as a corporation and pays corporate federal, state, and local taxes on income allocated to it from P3 LLC based on the Company’s economic\ninterest held in P3 LLC. While the Company consolidates P3 LLC for financial purposes as a VIE, the Company will not be taxed on the earnings attributed to the non-\ncontrolling interests. As a result, the income tax burden on the earnings taxed on the non-controlling interests is not reported by the Company in its consolidated financial\nstatements.\nP3 Health Partners Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 98\nTable of Contents\nThe components of loss before income taxes were as follows:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2023 2022\n(in thousands)\nDomestic $ (183,731) $ (1,559,695)\nForeign — —\nTotal $ (183,731) $ (1,559,695)\nThe components of income tax expense were as follows:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2023 2022\n(in thousands)\nCurrent income taxes:\nFederal $ 170 $ 111\nState 2,525 1,751\nTotal current income taxes 2,695 1,862\nDeferred income taxes:\nFederal — —\nState — —\nTotal deferred income taxes — —\nTotal income tax expense $ 2,695 $ 1,862\nA reconciliation of the statutory federal income tax to the Company’s provision for income taxes is as follows:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2023 2022\n(dollars in thousands)\nTax at federal statutory rate $ (38,584) $ (327,536)\nNon-controlling interest and nontaxable income 24,486 260,020\nChange in valuation allowance 29,781 33,961\nInvestment in P3 LLC (20,420) 35,147\nReturn to provision 4,134 —\nDeferred tax adjustments 1,754 —\nOther reconciling items 1,544 270\nTotal $ 2,695 $ 1,862\nEffective tax rate (1.5)% (0.1)%\nThe Company’s tax rate is affected primarily by the recognition of a valuation allowance and the portion of income and expense allocated to the non-controlling\ninterest.

The realization of tax benefits of net\ndeferred tax assets is dependent upon future levels of taxable income, of an appropriate character, in the periods the items are expected to be deductible or taxable. Based on the\navailable evidence as of December 31, 2023, the Company believes that it is more likely than not that the tax benefits of the U.S. losses incurred will not be realized.\nAccordingly, the Company has recorded a valuation allowance against the tax benefits of the U.S. losses incurred. The Company intends to maintain the valuation allowance on\nthe U.S. net deferred tax assets until sufficient positive evidence exists to support a reversal of, or decrease in, the valuation allowance.\nThe Company has recognized no deferred taxes in connection with its subsidiary, Medcore Health Plan Inc. (“MHP”). Because MHP does not file a consolidated\ncorporate income tax return with the Company, the deferred tax assets of MHP are separately assessed for realizability. Based on the weight of all available evidence as of\nDecember 31, 2023, including cumulative losses in recent years, the Company believes that it is more likely than not that the tax benefits of the deferred tax assets of MHP will\nnot be realized. Accordingly, the Company has recorded a valuation allowance against the tax benefits of the related deferred tax assets.\nThe Company has recognized no deferred taxes in connection with the Network VIEs. Because the Network VIEs do not file a consolidated corporate income tax\nreturn with the Company, the deferred tax assets are separately assessed for realizability. Based on the weight of all available evidence as of December 31, 2023, including\ncumulative losses in recent years, the Company believes that it is more likely than not that the tax benefits of the deferred tax assets of the Network VIEs will not be realized.\nAccordingly, the Company has recorded a valuation allowance against the tax benefits of the related deferred tax assets.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company has recognized a deferred tax asset with an offsetting valuation allowance in connection with its investment in P3 LLC.\nDuring 2023, the Company adjusted the deferred taxes on the investment in P3 LLC for changes in methodology and other adjustments recognized through entity.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company has U.S. federal income tax net operating loss carryforwards of $94.7 million available to offset future taxable income, all of\nwhich will be carried forward indefinitely, but utilization is limited to 80% of taxable income in any given year. The Company also has state net operating loss carryforwards of\n$33.9 million,\nP3 Health Partners Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 100\nTable of Contents\nof which $1.5 million will expire in 2033, $4.5 million will expire in 2034, $6.5 million will expire in 2035, $5.5 million will expire in 2039, $0.1 million will expire in 2041,\n$2.3 million will expire in 2042, $0.5 million will expire in 2043, and $13.0 million will be carried forward indefinitely.\nThe federal and state net operating loss carryforwards may be subject to limitations under Section 382 and Section 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the\n“Code”) and similar provisions under state law. The Tax Reform Act of 1986 contains provisions that limit the federal net operating loss carryforwards that may be used in any\ngiven year in the event of special occurrences, including significant ownership changes. The Company has completed a Section 382 analysis covering the period January 1, 2018\nthrough September 30, 2023. The Section 382 analysis tested the Company’s stock for each occurrence of stock issuance during the covered period. Through the analysis\nperiod, ownership changes were identified resulting in annual limitations to tax attributes; however, due to the indefinite carryforward of U.S. federal income tax net operating\nlosses, no such carryforwards have been derecognized.\nThe Company did not record any penalties or interest related to income taxes or uncertain tax positions, as management has concluded that no such positions exist, on\nthe consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2023 and 2022. In addition, the Company did not record any penalties or interest related to income taxes on the consolidated\nstatements of comprehensive income during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022.\nThe Company is subject to examination for tax years beginning with the year ended December 31, 2020. The Company is not currently under any U.S. federal or state\nincome tax audits for any tax year.\nTax Receivable Agreement\nIn connection with the Business Combinations, the Company entered into a TRA that provides for the payment by the Company of 85% of the amount of any tax\nbenefits that are realized, or in some cases are deemed to realize, as a result of (i) increases in the Company’s share of the tax basis in the net assets of P3 LLC resulting from\nany redemptions or exchanges of P3 LLC, (ii) tax basis increases attributable to payments made under the TRA, and (iii) deductions attributable to imputed interest pursuant to\nthe TRA. The Company expects to benefit from the remaining 15% of any tax benefits that are realized.\nPursuant to the Company’s election under Section 754 of the Code, the Company expects to obtain an increase in its share of the tax basis in the net assets of P3 LLC\nwhen Common Units are redeemed or exchanged. The Company intends to treat any redemptions and exchanges of Common Units as direct purchases of the units for U.S.\nfederal income tax purposes. These increases in tax basis may reduce the amounts that the Company would otherwise pay in the future to various tax authorities. They may also\ndecrease gains (or increase losses) on future dispositions of certain capital assets to the extent the tax basis is allocated to those capital assets.\nThe estimation of liability under the TRA is, by its nature, imprecise and subject to significant assumptions regarding a number of factors, including the timing and\namount of taxable income generated by the Company each year, as well as the tax rate then applicable, among other factors. Actual tax benefits realized by the Company may\ndiffer from tax benefits calculated under the TRA as a result of the use of certain assumptions in the TRA, including the use of an assumed weighted-average state and local\nincome tax rate to calculate tax benefits.\nThe payment obligation under the TRA is an obligation of the Company and not of P3 LLC. The payments that the Company will be required to make will generally\nreduce the amount of the overall cash flow that might have otherwise been available, but the Company expects the cash tax savings realized from the utilization of the related\ntax benefits will exceed the amount of any required payments.\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the TRA liability is estimated to be $11.0 million and $4.6 million, respectively; however, due to the full valuation allowance\nrecorded by the Company, which results in no tax benefits that are to be realized related to the amortization of the step-up, the Company determined that payments to TRA\nholders are not probable and no TRA liability has been recorded as of December 31, 2023 and 2022. As non-controlling interest holders exercise their right to exchange their\nCommon Units, a TRA liability may be recorded based on 85% of the estimated future tax benefits that the Company may realize as a result of increases in its tax basis of P3\nLLC. The amount of the increase in the tax basis, the related estimated tax benefits, and the related TRA liability to be recorded will depend on the price of a share of the\nCompany’s Class A common stock at the time of the relevant redemption or exchange.\nP3 Health Partners Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 101\nTable of Contents\nNote 13: Capitalization\nAs of December 31, 2023, under the Company’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation dated August 20, 2020, the Company is authorized to issue: (i)\n800 million shares of Class A common stock with a par value of $0.0001 per share, (ii) 205 million shares of Class V common stock with a par value of $0.0001 per share, and\n(iii) 10 million shares of preferred stock with a par value of $0.0001 per share, of which no shares were issued or outstanding as of December 31, 2023 and 2022.

The declaration, amount, and payment\nof any future dividends on shares of Class A common stock will be at the discretion of the Company’s Board of Directors and will depend upon many factors, including the\nCompany’s results of operations, financial condition, capital requirements, restrictions in its debt agreements, and other factors that the Company’s Board of Directors deems\nrelevant. Holders of shares of Class A common stock are entitled to receive such dividends declared by the Company’s Board of Directors. Holders of shares of Class V\ncommon stock are not entitled to participate in any such dividends declared by the Company’s Board of Directors.

The Letter Agreement provides, pursuant to certain stipulations, that CPF\nwill be entitled to designate one additional independent member of the Company’s board of directors and that CPF will be entitled to certain information rights and protective\nprovisions. As of the date of the issuance of these consolidated financial statements, CPF has not exercised its right to designate a director under the terms of the Letter\nAgreement. CPF Parties also agreed to a standstill restriction from the date of the closing of the March 2023 Private Placement to June 30, 2024 that limits the ownership of the\nCPF Parties to 49.99% of the Company’s Class A common stock and Class V common stock.\nP3 Health Partners Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 102\nTable of Contents\nShelf Registration\nOn November 9, 2023, the Company filed a shelf Registration Statement on Form S-3 with a capacity of $250 million (the “Shelf Registration”), which was declared\neffective by the SEC on November 20, 2023, and entered into an Open Market Sales Agreement (“Sales Agreement”) pursuant to which the Company may issue and sell, from\ntime to time, through the sales agent, shares of the Company’s Class A common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, with an aggregate value of up to $75 million.

As the non-controlling interest holders had an\napproximate 63% and 83% voting interest in the Company through their Class V common stock as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and appointed most of the\nmembers to the Board of\nP3 Health Partners Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 108\nTable of Contents\nDirectors, the ability to elect cash settlement upon redemption is outside of the control of the Company. As a result, the Common Units held by outside shareholders have been\nclassified as redeemable non-controlling interest and presented as temporary equity in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets.\nThe redeemable non-controlling interest was initially measured at its fair value on the Closing Date. Net income or loss is attributed to the redeemable non-controlling\ninterest during each reporting period based on a daily weighted average ownership percentage. In subsequent periods, the redeemable non-controlling interest is measured at its\nfair value (i.e., based on the five-day volume-weighted average price of a share of Class A common stock) at the end of each reporting period, with the remeasurement amount\nbeing no less than the initial value, as adjusted for the redeemable non-controlling interest’s share of net income or loss and ownership changes. The offset of any fair value\nadjustment is recorded to additional paid in capital, with no impact to net income or loss. As of December 31, 2023, there was a $20.6 million remeasurement adjustment\nrecorded as the fair value of redeemable non-controlling interest was greater than the carrying value. As of December 31, 2022, there was no remeasurement adjustment\nrecorded as the fair value of redeemable non-controlling interest was less than the carrying value.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, there were an aggregate of5 .4 million shares of Class A common stock issued to P3 LLC members in connection with\nsuch members’ redemptions of an equivalent number of Common Units and corresponding cancellation and retirement of an equivalent number of Class V common stock. Such\nretired shares of Class V common stock may not be reissued. The redemptions occurred pursuant to the terms of the P3 LLC A&R LLC Agreement. There was no Common\nUnit exchange or redemption activity during the year ended December 31, 2022.\nAs the P3 LLC A&R LLC Agreement states that P3 LLC will maintain at all times a one-to-one ratio between the number of Common Units owned by the Company\nand the number of outstanding shares of Class A common stock, there were an aggregate of 69.2 million Common Units issued to the Company resulting from the March 2023\nPrivate Placement during the year ended December 31, 2023.\nNote 19: Segment Reporting\nThe Company’s operations are organized under one reportable segment. The Chief Executive Officer, who is the Company’s chief operating decision maker, manages\nthe Company’s operations and reviews financial information on a consolidated basis. Decisions regarding resource allocation and assessment of profitability are based on the\nCompany’s responsibility to deliver high quality primary medical care services to its patient population. For the periods presented, all the Company’s revenue was earned in the\nUnited States. Likewise, all the Company’s long-lived assets were located in the United States.\nNote 20: Commitments and Contingencies\nThe Company is a party to various claims, legal and regulatory proceedings, lawsuits, and administrative actions arising in the ordinary course of business and\nassociated with the Business Combinations. The Company carries general and professional liability insurance coverage to mitigate the Company’s risk of potential loss in such\ncases. The Company believes that disposition of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated financial position, net loss or cash flows.\nIn 2021, a discrepancy was identified in the service agreement with one of the Company’s health plans resulting in a renegotiation of the agreement. In January 2023,\nthe renegotiation was settled and the Company reflected the known settlement of $5.0 million within health plan settlements payable as of December 31, 2022. The remaining\nsettlement balance of $3.0 million is recorded within health plan settlements payable as of December 31, 2023.\nUncertainties\nThe healthcare industry is subject to numerous laws and regulations of Federal, state, and local governments. These laws and regulations include, but are not limited\nto, matters of licensure, accreditation, government healthcare program participation requirements, reimbursement for patient services, and Medicare / Medicaid Fraud, Waste\nand Abuse Prevention. Recently, government activity has increased with respect to investigations and allegations concerning possible violations of Fraud, Waste and Abuse\nstatutes and regulations by healthcare providers. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in expulsion from government healthcare programs together with\nimposition of significant fines and penalties as well as significant repayment for patient services billed.\nP3 Health Partners Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 109\nTable of Contents\nManagement believes the Company is compliant with Fraud, Waste and Abuse regulations as well as other applicable government laws. While no regulatory inquiries\nhave been made, compliance with such laws and regulations is subject to government review and interpretation, as well as other regulatory actions which might be unknown at\nthis time.\nHealthcare reform legislation at both the Federal and state levels continues to evolve. Changes continue to impact existing and future laws and rules. Such changes may\nimpact the manner in which the Company conducts business, restrict the Company’s revenue growth in certain eligibility categories, slow down revenue growth rates for certain\neligibility categories, increase certain medical, administrative and capital costs, and expose the Company to increased risk of loss or further liabilities. As a result, the\nCompany’s consolidated financial position could be impacted by such changes.\nNote 21: Related Parties\nAtrio Health Plans\nCPF, a principal equity holder of the Company, has an equity investment in Atrio Health Plans (“Atrio”).

The MSAs provide that the P3 LLC will furnish\nadministrative personnel, office supplies and equipment, general business services, contract negotiation, and billing and collection services to the Network VIEs. Fees for these\nservices are the excess of the Network VIEs’ revenue over expenses. Per the deficit funding agreements, P3 LLC is obligated to advance funds, as needed, to support the\nNetwork VIE’s working capital needs to the extent operating expenses exceed gross revenue. These advances accrue interest at a rate of prime plus 2%. Net advances made to\nthe Network VIEs and accrued interest on those advances are presented within due to consolidated entities of P3 in the table below. Additionally, P3 LLC entered into stock\ntransfer restriction agreements with the practice shareholders of the Network VIEs, which, by way of a call option, unequivocally permit P3 LLC to appoint successor\nphysicians if a practice shareholder vacates their ownership position. Accordingly, P3 LLC identifies itself as the primary beneficiary of the Network VIEs. Practice\nshareholders, who are employees of P3 LLC, retain equity ownership in the Network VIEs, which represents nominal non-controlling interests; however, the non-controlling\ninterests do not participate in the profit or loss of the Network VIEs.\nP3 LLC, directly or indirectly via its wholly owned subsidiaries, may not use or access any net assets of the Network VIEs to settle its obligations or the obligations of\nits wholly owned subsidiaries. Additionally, the creditors of the Network VIEs do not have recourse to the net assets of P3 LLC.\nSince P3 LLC represents substantially all the assets and liabilities of the Company, the following tables provide a summary of the assets, liabilities, and operating\nperformance of only VIEs held at the P3 LLC level.\nDecember 31,\n2023 2022\n(in thousands)\nASSETS\nCash $ 6,491 $ 1,759\nClinic fees, insurance and other receivable 138 1,178\nHealth plan receivable 571 —\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets 1,261 121\nProperty and equipment, net 23 44\nOther long-term assets 153 —\nDue from consolidated entities of P3 — 3,012\nTOTAL ASSETS $ 8,637 $ 6,114\nLIABILITIES AND MEMBERS’ DEFICIT\nAccounts payable $ 5,073 $ 7,800\nAccrued expenses and other current liabilities 515 262\nAccrued payroll 3,141 1,885\nClaims payable 3,973 —\nOther long-term liabilities 946 —\nDue to consolidated entities of P3 44,200 36,025\nTOTAL LIABILITIES 57,848 45,972\nMEMBERS’ DEFICIT (49,211) (39,858)\nTOTAL LIABILITIES AND MEMBERS’ DEFICIT $ 8,637 $ 6,114\nP3 Health Partners Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 111\nTable of Contents\nYear Ended December 31,\n2023 2022\n(in thousands)\nRevenue $ 39,551 $ 55,237\nExpense 45,999 69,638\nNet loss $ (6,448) $ (14,401)\nNote 23: Subsequent Events\nVGS 2 Promissory Note\nOn March 22, 2024, P3 LLC entered into a related party financing transaction with VBC Growth SPV 2, LLC (“VGS 2”), consisting of the issuance by P3 LLC of an\nunsecured promissory note (the “VGS 2 Promissory Note”) to VGS 2.

Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of\nconsolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP.\nOur management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria set forth in “Internal Control –\nIntegrated Framework (2013)” issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.\nBased on this assessment, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of December 31, 2023 due to the material\nweaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting described below.\nA material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a\nmaterial misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.\nAs previously reported, management has identified the following material weaknesses in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting, which continued to\nexist as of December 31, 2023:\n• We did not have adequate policies and procedures or sufficient qualified resources with appropriate technical knowledge to maintain effective internal controls over\nthe accounting related to significant accounts and related financial statement disclosures;\n• We did not design and implement a sufficient risk assessment process to identify and assess risks impacting internal control over financial reporting;\n• We had ineffective evaluation and determination as to whether the components of internal control were present and functioning;\n• We did not design and implement effective information technology general controls in the areas of user access related to certain information technology systems\nthat support our financial reporting process;\n• We did not maintain sufficient segregation of duties over the performance of control activities for financial close and reporting, including over the review of account\nreconciliations and journal entries;\n• We did not design and maintain effective management review controls at a sufficient level of precision over all financial statement areas; and\nP3 Health Partners Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 113\nTable of Contents\n• We did not design and maintain effective controls at a sufficient level of precision over the estimation of claims expense and payable including controls over the\nreview of historical claims data, including the completeness and accuracy of data used to determine the financial statement amounts.\nRemediation activities\nIn response to these material weaknesses, with oversight from the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, we have continued to implement significant changes to\nimprove our internal control structure. Specifically, we have:\n• engaged an external advisor to assist with documenting internal controls, including (i) enhancing controls to ensure proper communication of critical information,\nreview and approvals, (ii) evaluating effectiveness of internal controls, and (iii) assisting with the remediation of deficiencies and training of personnel, as necessary;\n• formalized enhanced policies, procedures, and documentation for significant areas of accounting, including each area where a material weakness was identified;\n• hired qualified accounting, financial reporting, information technology, and other key management personnel with public company experience;\n• implemented a revised information technology general controls framework that is customized to our application landscape and information risks inherent in the\nfinancial reporting process;\n• implemented user access reviews across all significant information technology applications, standardized and improved the change management process to mitigate\nexecution risks, and provided training to control owners; and\n• designed a segregation of duties risk framework in order to establish a technology-enabled process to identify and evaluate user roles to mitigate segregation of\nduties conflicts.\nWe are committed to maintaining a strong internal control environment. We are still in the process of implementing these steps and cannot assure investors that these\nmeasures will significantly improve or remediate the material weaknesses described above. The material weaknesses cannot be considered remediated until the newly designed\ncontrol activity operates for a sufficient period of time and management has concluded, through testing, that the control is operating effectively. We may also conclude that\nadditional measures may be required to remediate the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, which may necessitate additional implementation and\nevaluation time. We will continue to assess the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and take steps to remediate the known material weaknesses\nexpeditiously.\nThe effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023 has been audited by BDO USA, P.C., an independent registered public\naccounting firm, as stated in their attestation report, which is included below.\nChanges in internal control over financial reporting\nOther than the actions taken to remediate our material weaknesses, described above, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined\nin Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended December 31, 2023 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially\naffect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nItem 9B.

In our opinion, the\nCompany did not maintain, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on the COSO criteria.\nWe do not express an opinion or any other form of assurance on management’s statements referring to any corrective actions taken by the Company after the date of\nmanagement’s assessment.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”), the consolidated balance sheets of the\nCompany as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders’ equity and mezzanine equity, and cash flows for the years then\nended, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”) and our report dated March 28, 2024 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over\nfinancial reporting, included in the accompanying Item 9A, Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an\nopinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be\nindependent with respect to the Company in accordance with U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission\nand the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit of internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit\nto obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an\nunderstanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of\ninternal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit\nprovides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nA material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material\nmisstatement of the company’s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Material weaknesses have been identified and\ndescribed in management’s assessment. The material weaknesses related to the following: (1) The Company did not have adequate policies and procedures or sufficient\nqualified resources with appropriate technical knowledge to maintain effective internal controls over the accounting related to significant accounts and related financial\nstatement disclosures; (2) The Company did not design and implement a sufficient risk assessment process to identify and assess risks impacting internal control over financial\nreporting; (3) The Company had ineffective evaluation and determination as to whether the components of internal control were present and functioning; (4) The Company did\nnot design and implement effective information technology general controls in the areas of user access related to certain information technology systems that support the\nfinancial reporting process; (5) The Company did not maintain sufficient segregation of duties over the performance of control activities for financial close and reporting,\nincluding over the review of account reconciliations and journal entries; (6) The Company did not design and maintain effective management review controls at a sufficient\nlevel of precision over all financial statement areas; and (7) The Company did not design and maintain effective controls at a sufficient level of precision over the estimation of\nclaims expense and payable including controls over the review of historical claims data, including the completeness and accuracy of data used to determine the financial\nstatement amounts. These material weaknesses were considered in determining the nature, timing, and extent of audit tests applied in our audit of the 2023 financial statements,\nand this report does not affect our report dated March 28, 2024 on those financial statements.\nP3 Health Partners Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 116\nTable of Contents\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of\nfinancial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those\npolicies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the\ncompany; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted\naccounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company;\nand (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material\neffect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to\nfuture periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures\nmay deteriorate.\n/s/ BDO USA, P.C.\nLas Vegas, Nevada\nMarch 28, 2024\nP3 Health Partners Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 117\nTable of Contents\nPART III\nItem 10.

POLICY FOR RECOVERY OF\nERRONEOUSLY AWARDED COMPENSATION\nThe Board of Directors (the “Board”) of P3 Health Partners Inc. (the “Company”) has adopted this Policy for Recovery of Erroneously\nAwarded Compensation (the “Policy”), effective as of December 1, 2023 (the “Effective Date”). Capitalized terms used in this Policy but not\notherwise defined herein are defined in Section 11.\n1. Persons Subject to Policy\nThis Policy shall apply to current and former Officers.\n2. Compensation Subject to Policy\nThis Policy shall apply to Incentive-Based Compensation received on or after the Effective Date. For purposes of this Policy, the date\non which Incentive-Based Compensation is “received” shall be determined under the Applicable Rules, which generally provide that Incentive-\nBased Compensation is “received” when the relevant Financial Reporting Measure is attained or satisfied, without regard to whether the grant,\nvesting or payment of the Incentive-Based Compensation occurs after the end of that period.\n3. Recovery of Compensation\nIn the event that the Company is required to prepare a Restatement, the Company shall recover, reasonably promptly, the portion of any\nIncentive-Based Compensation that is Erroneously Awarded Compensation, unless the Committee has determined that recovery would be\nImpracticable. Recovery shall be required in accordance with the preceding sentence regardless of whether the applicable Officer engaged in\nmisconduct or otherwise caused or contributed to the requirement for the Restatement and regardless of whether or when restated financial\nstatements are filed by the Company. For clarity, the recovery of Erroneously Awarded Compensation under this Policy will not give rise to\nany person’s right to voluntarily terminate employment for “good reason,” or due to a “constructive termination” (or any similar term of like\neffect) under any plan, program or policy of or agreement with the Company or any of its affiliates.\n4. Manner of Recovery; Limitation on Duplicative Recovery\nThe Committee shall, in its sole discretion, determine the manner of recovery of any Erroneously Awarded Compensation, which may\ninclude, without limitation, reduction or cancellation by the Company or an affiliate of the Company of Incentive-Based Compensation or\nErroneously Awarded Compensation, reimbursement or repayment by any person subject to this Policy of the Erroneously Awarded\nCompensation, and, to the extent permitted by law, an offset of the Erroneously Awarded Compensation against other compensation payable\nby the Company or an affiliate of the Company to such person. Notwithstanding the foregoing, unless otherwise prohibited by the Applicable\nRules, to the extent this Policy provides for recovery of Erroneously Awarded Compensation already recovered by the Company pursuant to\nSarbanes-Oxley Act Section 304 or Other Recovery Arrangements, the amount of Erroneously Awarded Compensation already recovered by\nthe Company from the recipient of such Erroneously Awarded Compensation may be credited to the amount of Erroneously Awarded\nCompensation required to be recovered pursuant to this Policy from such person.\n1\n5. Administration\nThis Policy shall be administered, interpreted and construed by the Committee, which is authorized to make all determinations\nnecessary, appropriate or advisable for such purpose. The Board may re-vest in itself the authority to administer, interpret and construe this\nPolicy in accordance with applicable law, and in such event references herein to the “Committee” shall be deemed to be references to the\nBoard. Subject to any permitted review by the applicable national securities exchange or association pursuant to the Applicable Rules, all\ndeterminations and decisions made by the Committee pursuant to the provisions of this Policy shall be final, conclusive and binding on all\npersons, including the Company and its affiliates, stockholders and employees. The Committee may delegate administrative duties with respect\nto this Policy to one or more directors or employees of the Company, as permitted under applicable law, including any Applicable Rules.\n6. Interpretation\nThis Policy will be interpreted and applied in a manner that is consistent with the requirements of the Applicable Rules, and to the\nextent this Policy is inconsistent with such Applicable Rules, it shall be deemed amended to the minimum extent necessary to ensure\ncompliance therewith.\n7. No Indemnification; No Liability\nThe Company shall not indemnify or insure any person against the loss of any Erroneously Awarded Compensation pursuant to this\nPolicy, nor shall the Company directly or indirectly pay or reimburse any person for any premiums for third-party insurance policies that such\nperson may elect to purchase to fund such person’s potential obligations under this Policy. None of the Company, an affiliate of the Company\nor any member of the Committee or the Board shall have any liability to any person as a result of actions taken under this Policy.\n8. Application; Enforceability\nExcept as otherwise determined by the Committee or the Board, the adoption of this Policy does not limit, and is intended to apply in\naddition to, any other clawback, recoupment, forfeiture or similar policies or provisions of the Company or its affiliates, including any such\npolicies or provisions of such effect contained in any employment agreement, bonus plan, incentive plan, equity-based plan or award\nagreement thereunder or similar plan, program or agreement of the Company or an affiliate or required under applicable law (the “Other\nRecovery Arrangements”). The remedy specified in this Policy shall not be exclusive and shall be in addition to every other right or remedy at\nlaw or in equity that may be available to the Company or an affiliate of the Company.\n9. Severability\nThe provisions in this Policy are intended to be applied to the fullest extent of the law; provided, however, to the extent that any\nprovision of this Policy is found to be unenforceable or invalid under any applicable law, such provision will be applied to the maximum extent\npermitted, and shall automatically be deemed amended in a manner consistent with its objectives to the extent necessary to conform to any\nlimitations required under applicable law.\n2\n10. Amendment and Termination\nThe Board or the Committee may amend, modify or terminate this Policy in whole or in part at any time and from time to time in its\nsole discretion. This Policy will terminate automatically when the Company does not have a class of securities listed on a national securities\nexchange or association.\n11.

The “Three-Year Period” also includes any\ntransition period (that results from a change in the Company’s fiscal year) within or immediately following the three completed fiscal years\nidentified in the preceding sentence. However, a transition period between the last day of the Company’s previous fiscal year end and the first\nday of its new fiscal year that comprises a period of nine to 12 months shall be deemed a completed fiscal year.\n4"

EBITDA is defined as GAAP net income (loss) before (i)\ninterest, (ii) income taxes and (iii) depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA, further adjusted to exclude the effect of certain supplemental adjustments, such as (i) mark-to-market\nwarrant gain/loss, (ii) premium deficiency reserves, (iii) equity-based compensation expense and (iv) certain other items that we believe are not indicative of our core operating performances. Adjusted EBITDA\nPMPM is defined as Adjusted EBITDA divided by the number of Medicare Advantage members each month divided by the number of months in the period. We believe these non‐GAAP financial measures provide\nan additional tool for investors to use in evaluating ongoing operating results and trends and in comparing our financial measures with other similar companies. Medical margin represents the amount earned from\ncapitation revenue after medical claims expenses are deducted and medical margin PMPM is defined as medical margin divided by the number of Medicare Advantage members each month divided by the number\nof months in the period. Medical claims expenses represent costs incurred for medical services provided to our members. As our platform grows and matures over time, we expect medical margin to increase in\nabsolute dollars; however, medical margin PMPM may vary as the percentage of new members brought onto our platform fluctuates. New membership added to the platform is typically dilutive to medical margin\nPMPM. Adjusted operating expense is defined as operating expense adjusted to exclude the effect of certain supplemental adjustments, such as (i) mark-to-market warrant gain/loss, (ii) premium deficiency\nreserves, (iii) equity-based compensation expense and (iv) certain other items that we believe are not indicative of our core operating performance. Adjusted operating expense PMPM is defined as adjusted\noperating expense divided by the number of Medicare Advantage members each month divided by the number of months in the period. We do not consider these non‐ GAAP measures in isolation or as an\nalternative to financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures are subject to inherent limitations as they reflect the exercise of judgments by management about which\nexpense and income are excluded or included in determining these non‐GAAP financial measures. In addition, other companies may calculate non-GAAP financial measures differently or may use other measures to\nevaluate their performance, all of which could reduce the usefulness of our non-GAAP financial measures as tools for comparison.The tables in the Appendix to this presentation present reconciliations of Adjusted\nEBITDA to net income (loss), medical margin to gross profit, and adjusted operating expense to operating expense, which are the most directly comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.\nWe have also provided revenue, Adjusted EBITDA, medical margin and medical margin PMPM guidance for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 and guidance as to our long-term Adjusted EBITDA\nmargin target. A reconciliation of the Company’s forecasted full-year 2023 and 2024 Adjusted EBITDA, medical margin and medical margin PMPM, and forecasted long-term Adjusted EBITDA margin to the most\ndirectly comparable GAAP financial measures cannot be provided without unreasonable efforts and are not provided herein because of the inherent difficulty in forecasting and quantifying certain amounts that are\nnecessary for such reconciliations.\nIndustry and Market Data\nCertain information contained in this presentation relates to or is based on studies, publications, surveys and other data obtained from third-party sources and the Company’s own internal estimates and\nresearch. While the Company believes these third-party sources to be reliable as of the date of this presentation, it has not independently verified, and makes no representation as to the adequacy, fairness, accuracy\nor completeness of, any information obtained from third-party sources. In addition, all of the market data included in this presentation involves a number of assumptions and limitations, and there can be no\nguarantee as to theaccuracy or reliability of such assumptions.
