Each Unit consists of one Class A ordinary share, one Class 1 Warrant and one-half of one Class 2 redeemable warrant.

No fractional warrants will be issued upon separation of the Units and only whole warrants will trade. Holders of Units will need to have their brokers contact VStock Transfer, LLC, the Company's transfer agent, in order to separate the holders' Units into Class 1 redeemable warrants and new units.\n\nThe Units were initially offered by the Company in an underwritten offering.
