(the “Company”) to be known as the Compensation Committee (the “Committee”). The Committee shall be composed of at least two directors, each of whom must be an independent director as defined under Rule 5605(a)(2) of the NASDAQ Stock Market Rules (the “NASDAQ Rules”).\n\nThe members of the Committee shall be appointed annually by a majority vote of the Board and shall serve until such member’s successor is duly appointed and qualified or until such member’s earlier resignation or removal. The members of the Committee may be removed at any time by the Board by a majority vote. Vacancies on the Committee shall be filled by the Board, at the next meeting of the Board following the occurrence of the vacancy. The Board shall also designate one member of the Committee to serve as Chair of the Committee. The Committee may form and delegate authority to subcommittees as appropriate and in accordance with applicable law, regulation or the NASDAQ Rules.\n\nThis Charter is intended as a component of the flexible governance framework within which the Board, assisted by its committees, directs the affairs of the Company. While it should be interpreted in the context of all applicable laws, regulations and the NASDAQ Rules, as well as in the context of the Company’s Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws, in each case as amended or restated from time to time, it is not intended to establish by its own force any legally binding obligations.\n\n**Statement of Purpose**\n\nThe purpose of the Committee shall be to establish salaries, incentives and other forms of compensation for executive officers (which for purposes of this Charter shall have the same meaning as “officer” as such term is defined in Rule 16a-1(f) of the Exchange Act) and directors of the Company and to administer incentive compensation and benefit plans provided for employees of the Company. The Committee’s policy is to ensure that compensation programs contribute directly to the success of the Company, including enhanced shareholder value.\n\n**Meetings**\n\nThe Committee shall establish an agenda for the ensuing year and hold such regular meetings as may be necessary and such special meetings as may be called by the Chair of the Committee or at the request of the Board. A majority of the members then serving on the Committee shall constitute a quorum, and actions at meetings may be approved by a majority of the members present. The Committee may also act by unanimous written consent, which may be provided electronically. The Committee shall submit the minutes of all meetings of the Committee to, and discuss the matters discussed at each Committee meeting with, the Board with such recommendations as the Committee may deem appropriate.\n\n**Responsibilities and Duties of the Committee**\n\nIn furtherance of the Committee’s purpose, and in addition to any other responsibilities or duties that may be properly assigned by the Board from time to time, the Committee shall have the following responsibilities and duties:\n\n  1. Review the powers and duties of the Committee and report and make recommendations to the Board on these responsibilities.\n  2. Periodically review, at least once a year, whether any steps should be taken to improve the operation of the Company’s executive officer compensation, director compensation, and incentive compensation and benefit plans for employees. Review and consider, among other things, the following:\n    1. whether the Committee’s policy, strategy and philosophy regarding executive compensation is still appropriate;\n    2. whether the compensation levels for executive officers or directors should be adjusted;\n    3. whether incentive compensation and benefits to employees pursuant to benefit plans are being properly administered; and\n    4. whether the meetings of the Committee may be made more effective.\n  3. Review and determine the compensation levels (including any salary, bonus, incentive compensation, equity incentives, direct or indirect benefits or similar arrangements regardless of whether such arrangement is performance based) for executive officers and directors. In performing this responsibility, the Committee will (a) review and approve the executive officer compensation levels recommended by the Chief Executive Officer, based on evaluations of the individual executive’s past and expected future performance and such other factors as the Committee may determine, (b) review and determine the compensation level for the Chief Executive Officer based on the Committee’s assessment of his past performance and its expectations as to his future performance in leading the Company and such other factors as the Committee may determine, and (c) review and determine the director compensation levels based on such factors as the Committee may determine. In reviewing, determining and/or approving compensation levels, the Committee may, among other things, identify any corporate and/or individual goals or objectives for bonuses and/or incentive compensation and establish the targets for such goals or objectives. No member of the Committee will act to establish his or her own compensation except for uniform compensation to directors for their service as a director. The Chief Executive Officer may not be present during voting or deliberations regarding his or her compensation. The Committee will evaluate the administration of incentive compensation and benefits to employees pursuant to benefit plans based on such factors as the Committee may determine.\n  4. Review and approve any proposed employment agreement with any executive officer of the Company and any proposed modification or amendment thereof. Review and approve any consulting, severance, retention, change in control, or other termination arrangement proposed to be made to any current or former executive officer of the Company except for any such payment made in accordance with a plan previously approved by the Board or the Committee.\n  5.

Propose the adoption, amendment and termination of stock option plans, pension and profit sharing plans, stock bonus plans, stock purchase plans, bonus plans, deferred compensation plans, and other similar programs (“Compensation Plans”) and administer the Compensation Plans in accordance with their terms.\n  7. Grant rights, participations and interests in Compensation Plans to eligible participants and administer such rights, participations and interests in accordance with the Compensation Plans.\n  8. Annually conduct a risk assessment of executive compensation plans and programs.\n  9.

Recommend for approval by the Board how frequently the Company should conduct advisory shareholder votes on executive compensation, taking into account the results of any prior shareholder votes regarding the subject.\n  12. Maintain and administer the executive Compensation Plans.\n  13.

Prior to the selection, or receiving of advice from, any compensation consultant, legal counsel or other advisor to the Committee, other than in-house legal counsel, the Committee must assess the consultant’s, counsel’s or advisor’s independence by taking into account, among other factors, (i) the provision of other services to the Company by the consultant, counsel or advisor, or the employer of such consultant, counsel or advisor, (ii) the amount of fees received from the Company by the employer of the consultant, counsel or advisor, as a percentage of such employer’s total revenue, (iii) the policies and procedures of the consultant’s, counsel’s or advisor’s employer that are designed to prevent conflicts of interest, (iv) any business or personal relationship of the consultant, counsel or advisor with a member of the Committee, (v) any stock of the Company owned by the consultant, counsel or advisor, and (vi) any business or personal relationship of the consultant, counsel or advisor or such person’s employer with an executive officer of the Company.\n  14. Annually evaluate the Committee’s performance and report its findings to the Board.\n  15. Annually review the adequacy of this Charter and recommend any proposed changes to the Board for approval.\n  16.

The Company shall provide for appropriate funding, as determined by the Committee, for payment of reasonable compensation to a compensation consultant, legal counsel or any other advisor retained by the Committee.\n\n_Approved by the Board of Directors on September 5, 2017_\n\n### Site\n\n  * [ Home ](https://dolphinentertainment.com)\n  * [ About ](/about/)\n  * [ Divisions ](/#divisions)\n  * [ Investor Relations ](/investor-relations/)\n  * [ Press ](/press/)\n  * [ Contact ](/contact/)\n\n\n\n### Socials\n\n  * [ LinkedIn ](https://www.linkedin.com/company/dolphin-entertainment-inc/)\n  * [ X | Twitter ](https://twitter.com/DlpnEnt)\n  * [ Instagram ](https://www.instagram.com/dolphinentertainmentco?igsh=YjUxZWRxMGJiNXUz)\n\n\n\nCopyright © Dolphin Entertainment 2024\n\n[ ![](https://dolphinentertainment.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Logo-Wordmark.png) ](https://dolphinentertainment.com)\n\nScroll to Top\n"

          "content": "Press Alt+1 for screen-reader mode, Alt+0 to cancel[Accessibility Screen-Reader Guide, Feedback, and Issue Reporting](https://accessibe.com/blog/knowledgebase/screen-reader-guide) [ Skip to content](#content \"Skip to content\")\n\n[ ![](https://dolphinentertainment.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Logo-Wordmark.svg) ](https://dolphinentertainment.com)\n\n[ ![](https://dolphinentertainment.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Logo-Wordmark.svg) ](https://dolphinentertainment.com)\n\n![](https://dolphinentertainment.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/close.svg)\n\n## Follow\n\n[ Linkedin-in ](https://www.linkedin.com/company/dolphin-entertainment-inc/) [ X-twitter ](https://twitter.com/DlpnEnt) [ Instagram ](https://www.instagram.com/dolphinentertainmentco/?igsh=YjUxZWRxMGJiNXUz)\n\nIntroduction\n\nAll directors, officers and employees of Dolphin Entertainment, Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively, the “Company”) are expected to conduct themselves with the highest degree of honesty, integrity and ethics and within the confines of the law when acting on behalf of the Company. This Code of Conduct is designed to (i) promote honest and ethical conduct, including fair dealing and the ethical handling of conflicts of interest; (ii) promote full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure; (iii) promote compliance with applicable laws and governmental rules and regulations; (iv) ensure the protection of the Company’s legitimate business interests, including corporate opportunities, assets and confidential information; and (v) deter wrongdoing. It is in no way exhaustive of all of the issues that you could be faced with in your activities on behalf of the Company, but merely general guidelines that you are required to follow. This Code of Conduct applies to every director, officer and employee of the Company. Should you find yourself faced with an issue not directly outlined in this Code of Conduct and you are not sure how to proceed, you are both encouraged and required to bring the issue to the attention of the Chief Operating and Financial Officer. Your commitment to this Code of Conduct is appreciated and required as part of your continued relationship with the Company.\n\nReporting Violations\n\nOne of your most important responsibilities at the Company is the obligation to report a possible violation of this Code of Conduct. It may at times seem difficult to report a violation because of the fear or uncertainty of the effects that disclosure may have. However, despite this conflict you may feel, it is important to remember that the Company has an obligation to its shareholders and others to only conduct itself within the highest standards of ethical conduct, and great harm can come to the Company, its employees and shareholders by you not disclosing concerns that you are faced with or violations that you discover.\n\nTherefore, in the event that you know of a violation or suspected violation of this Code of Conduct you are both encouraged and required to promptly report the situation to the Chief Operating and Financial Officer. In the event that the violation relates to conduct by the Chief Operating and Financial Officer, the situation should be reported to the Chief Executive Officer.\n\nComplaints relating to violations of this Code of Conduct will be reviewed under the direction and oversight of the Chief Operating and Financial Officer, or such other persons as the Chief Operating and Financial Officer determines to be appropriate.\n\nNon-retaliation Policy\n\nThe Company will not discharge, demote, suspend, threaten, harass or in any manner discriminate against any director, officer or employee in the terms and conditions of service or employment based upon any lawful actions of such director, officer or employee with respect to good faith reporting of violations of this Code of Conduct.\n\nCompliance with Laws Regarding Improper Payments and Bribery\n\nIt is the Company’s fundamental policy to comply with all applicable U.S. and non-U.S. anti-bribery and anti- corruption laws, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”). The giving or acceptance of any type of payment or inducement, other than payments for salary and bonuses directly from the Company or payments directed by the Company with proper authority, has the potential to influence, or can be reasonably interpreted to influence, impartiality. Therefore, the Company restricts the giving and receiving of payments or other inducements for commercial advantage as outlined in this Code of Conduct.\n\nYou are prohibited from, directly or indirectly, giving, offering to give, promising to give, or authorizing, bribes, kickbacks, improper or illegal payments, internships/employment, any remuneration, any consideration or anything else of value to any individual or organization in order to obtain or retain business for the Company, to prevent or defer losing business to any competitor, to induce the recipient to take or refrain from taking action that would bestow a commercial benefit or advantage, or to receive something of personal value in return. You are prohibited from permitting a third party to do any of the foregoing on your or the Company’s behalf.\n\nYou are also prohibited from, directly or indirectly, giving, offering to give, promising to give, or authorizing, any payment, gift, or anything of value, in cash, property, services or goods, to a government representative. This prohibition exists regardless of whether it is known that any portion of the payment, gift or thing of value is being paid to influence any official or employee of any governmental entity for the purpose of facilitating his or her position or influence, to obtain or retain business for the Company, to prevent or defer losing any business to any competitor, or to induce the recipient to take or refrain from taking action that would bestow a commercial benefit or advantage. You are prohibited from permitting a third party to do any of the foregoing on your or the Company’s behalf.\n\nIn addition, the solicitation for or acceptance of any cash gift, regardless of how such is labeled from an existing or prospective competitor, distributor or client is absolutely prohibited and will be grounds for removal from the Board of Directors of the Company (the “Board”) or termination of employment.\n\nFurthermore, the acceptance of gifts, benefits, entertainment or other things of value from any person or entity doing business or prospectively doing business with the Company is not encouraged. You should decline any gift or benefit for which the acceptance might either raise even the slightest suggestion of improper influence or induce you to take or refrain from taking action that would bestow a commercial benefit or advantage on such person or entity. In all cases, good business judgment should be exercised in the acceptance of anything of value from any company or person doing business or looking to do business with the Company and must be consistent with the Company’s requirement that all directors, officers and employees act with the highest degree of honesty, integrity and ethics, and for the express purpose of enhancing a business relationship.\n\nAny director, officer or employee who receives anything of more than nominal value should return it immediately and report it to the Chief Operating and Financial Officer, in the case of directors and officers, to the Chief Executive Officer, in the case of the Chief Financial and Operating Officer and to his or her supervisor, in the case of other employees. If the immediate return of the gift is not practical, it should also be reported to the Chief Operating and Financial Officer or Chief Executive Officer as the case may be.\n\nAny question that you have regarding the propriety or legality of giving or accepting anything of value should be directed to the Company’s Chief Operating and Financial Officer, who will seek the advice of outside legal counsel as needed.\n\nPolitical Contributions and Activities\n\nFederal, state and local political contributions and spending are in many cases prohibited or are otherwise carefully regulated by law. Each director, officer and employee is individually free to pursue political activities including contributions or spending he or she deems appropriate; however, individual contributions or spending must not be made with the Company’s funds, or be reimbursed by the Company. Directors, officers and employees who participate in partisan political activities should not in any way suggest or state that they speak or act on behalf of the Company. Where corporate political contributions or spending are allowed under federal, state or local laws, such contributions or spending shall be made only with the prior authorization of the Company’s Chief Executive Officer.\n\nCorporate Opportunities\n\nDirectors, officers and employees may not take advantage of a business opportunity, personally or through a third party, that would serve a present or prospective corporate purpose. This obligation to the Company arises even if the director, officer or employee learned of the opportunity in a personal capacity. Directors, officers and employees may only take such opportunity if the Company has already been offered the opportunity and turned it down, and, in the case of a director or executive officer, the Board, or, in the case of all other employees, the Chief Executive Officer, has approved the taking of the business opportunity by the director, officer or employee.\n\nConflicts of Interest\n\nA conflict of interest arises when your private interest interferes or has the potential to interfere with the interests of the Company. The Company recognizes that you may take part in legitimate financial, business and other activities outside of your employment or relationship with the Company. However, every director, officer or employee should avoid business, financial or other direct or indirect interests, relationships or activities which would (1) be or have the appearance of being unlawful, hostile, adverse or competitive with the Company, (2) result or have the appearance of resulting in a conflict with the interests of the Company or (3) divide or have the appearance of dividing his or her loyalty to the Company.\n\nEmployees are required to promptly disclose to your immediate supervisor your outside activities, financial interests or relationships (particularly with family members, household members or close friends) that may present a possible conflict of interest or the appearance of a conflict of interest. Officers and directors must disclose such activities, financial interests or relationships to the Chief Operating and Financial Officer. You are to avoid actions or relationships which might conflict or appear to conflict with your responsibilities at the Company or the interests of the Company, and avoid holding financial interests in any company where you could personally affect or benefit from the Company’s business with that company. No director, officer or employee of the Company should ever be in a situation where he or she is receiving compensation from a supplier, contractor or other business entity with whom he or she is conducting business on behalf of the Company.\n\nIn addition, you are not permitted to accept employment with, or become directly or indirectly involved as an independent contractor or consultant to, any Company competitor or client, without the prior written consent of the Chief Operating and Financial Officer.\n\nFinally, you should not take personal advantage of opportunities that you become aware of through your relationship with the Company.\n\nCompliance with Laws\n\nThe Company takes the obligation to comply with all governmental laws and regulations very seriously. Failure to do so may result in immediate termination of employment or removal from the Board. You are expected to be familiar with the laws that apply to your specific job function and level of responsibility. If you are not sure whether a law or policy applies, or whether one exists at all, you are encouraged and expected to seek advice from the Company’s legal department.\n\nYou are strictly prohibited from trading in our stock or other securities while in the possession of material, nonpublic information about the Company or obtained in the performance of your duties on behalf of the Company. In addition, you are strictly prohibited from recommending, “tipping” or suggesting that anyone else buy or sell our stock or other securities, on the basis of material, nonpublic information. Information is material if there is a substantial likelihood that a reasonable investor would consider it important in making a decision to buy, sell or hold the Company’s stock or where the information is likely to have a significant effect on the market price of the Company’s stock. Any information that could affect the Company’s stock price, whether it is positive or negative, should be considered material. For more information regarding the Company’s policies in this regard, please carefully read the “Dolphin Entertainment, Inc. Statement of Policies and Procedures Governing Stock Trading in General, Material Non-Public Information and the Prevention of Insider Trading” policy in full and contact our Chief Operating and Financial Officer if you have questions about it.\n\nAny director, officer or employee who has a concern about any legal issue is responsible for consulting with the Company’s legal department before any potentially illegal acts have taken place.\n\nProtecting the Company’s Assets; Intellectual Property and Confidential Information\n\nIt is the responsibility of all directors, officers and employees to safeguard and protect all of the Company’s assets. The Company’s assets and technological resources, including financial assets, scripts, office supplies, equipment, computers, computer software, voice mail, e-mail and Internet may only be used for proper purposes in a manner consistent with this Code of Conduct and all other Company policies.\n\nDo not loan, borrow, donate, sell or dispose of any of the Company’s property unless specifically authorized by an individual in management with authority to approve such an action. You may not use Company property or information for personal gain.\n\nIn addition, the Company takes great strides to protect its intellectual property and confidential information, and you must not disclose confidential information to anyone outside of the Company, nor to anyone within the Company, who does not have a business reason to know such information. Confidential information may include, for example, unpublished financial information, relationships with client, technical data, strategic marketing information, scripts, and production and distribution information. Take precautions against accidental disclosure of confidential information. Never keep such information lying around your office or leave it in a public place. Also, avoid talking about such information where others outside the Company can overhear. If you have access to the Company’s information systems, you are responsible for taking the precautions necessary to prohibit unauthorized access to the system, including safeguarding your passwords or other means of entry.\n\nAccuracy of Books and Records\n\nShareholders make business decisions based on the Company’s records. All financial books, records and accounts must accurately reflect transactions and events and conform to both generally accepted accounting principles and to the Company’s system of internal controls. It is never acceptable to make false claims on an expense report or time sheet, to falsify safety results, to record false revenues or to record them early, to understate or overstate liabilities or assets, to maintain undisclosed or unrecorded funds or “off the books” assets, or to defer recording items that should be expensed. No entry may be made that intentionally hides or disguises the true nature of any transaction.\n\nIf you believe that the Company’s books and records are not being maintained in accordance with this Code of Conduct, or any other deficiency exists, you should report the matter to the Chief Operating and Financial Officer.\n\nPublic Comment\n\nFor both business and legal reasons, the Company must send a consistent message about its current events and future plans. The Company has a centralized communication team responsible for issuing public information. If the media or any outsider contacts you for information about the Company, please explain that the Company does not permit you to comment and direct them to Mirta A Negrini, Chief Operating and Financial Officer.\n\nPenalties for Violations\n\nPersons who violate the spirit or letter of this Code of Conduct are subject to disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment or removal from the Board. The following are examples of conduct that may result in discipline:\n\nActions that violate this Code of Conduct,Requesting others to violate this Code of Conduct,Failure to promptly notify the Company’s Chief Operating and Financial Officer in the event of knowledge of a violation or suspected violation of this Code of Conduct,Failure to cooperate in an investigation of an alleged violation of this Code of Conduct, andRetaliation against a director, officer or employee of the Company for reporting a violation or suspected violation of this Code of Conduct.\n\nViolations of this Code of Conduct could also be a violation of the law, subjecting you or the Company to criminal penalties or civil sanctions.\n\nWaiver or Amendment\n\nAny waiver of any provision of this Code of Conduct must be approved as provided for in this Code of Conduct. With regard to any waiver of any provision of this Code of Conduct for a director or executive officer, such waiver must be approved by the Board. With regard to any waiver of any provision of this Code of Conduct for an employee who is not a director or executive officer, such waiver must be approved by the Chief Operating and Financial Officer. Amendments to this Code of Conduct must be approved by the Board.\n\nThe Company reserves the right to modify, revise or alter any policy, procedure or condition related to this Code of Conduct at its sole discretion and at any time without notice. The contents of this Code of Conduct do not constitute the terms of a contract of employment, and nothing contained in this Code of Conduct should be construed as a guarantee of continued employment. Employment at the Company is on an at-will basis, unless you are a party to a specific written employment agreement between you and the Company.\n\nIn addition, the requirements of this Code of Conduct are in addition to any other restrictions contained in any other agreement that you may have with the Company.\n\nCertification of Compliance\n\nNot less than annually, all directors and officers of the Company and its subsidiaries and such employees of the Company and its subsidiaries as shall be designated by the Company’s Chief Operating and Financial Officer (which designation shall be reported to the Audit Committee of the Board) shall execute such certifications as may be required by the Company to document the fact that he or she has received and reviewed this Code of Conduct, that he or she understands this Code of Conduct, that he or she undertakes, as a condition to his or her present and continued employment at the Company or any of its affiliates, to comply fully with this Code of Conduct, and, commencing the first year following the adoption of this Code of Conduct, that he or she during the preceding calendar year has complied fully with this Code of Conduct.\n\nApproved by the Board of Directors on September 5, 2017\n\n### Site\n\n  * [ Home ](https://dolphinentertainment.com)\n  * [ About ](/about/)\n  * [ Divisions ](/#divisions)\n  * [ Investor Relations ](/investor-relations/)\n  * [ Press ](/press/)\n  * [ Contact ](/contact/)\n\n\n\n### Socials\n\n  * [ LinkedIn ](https://www.linkedin.com/company/dolphin-entertainment-inc/)\n  * [ X | Twitter ](https://twitter.com/DlpnEnt)\n  * [ Instagram ](https://www.instagram.com/dolphinentertainmentco?igsh=YjUxZWRxMGJiNXUz)\n\n\n\nCopyright © Dolphin Entertainment 2024\n\n[ ![](https://dolphinentertainment.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Logo-Wordmark.png) ](https://dolphinentertainment.com)\n\nScroll to Top\n"

(the “Company”) amended the\nCompany’s Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation (the “Articles of Amendment”) to effectuate a\nreverse stock split of the Company’s issued and outstanding common stock, par value $0.015 per share\n(“Common Stock”), on the basis of two (2) old shares for one (1) new share (the “Reverse Stock Split”),\nproviding that the Reverse Stock Split would become effective under Florida law on September 14, 2017.\nImmediately after the Reverse Stock Split, the number of authorized shares of Common Stock was\nreduced from 400,000,000 shares to 200,000,000. As a result, each shareholder’s percentage ownership\ninterest in the Company and proportional voting power remained unchanged. Any fractional shares\nresulting from the Reverse Stock Split were rounded up to the nearest whole share of Common Stock.\nPart II, Line 15: Under IRC §358(a), a shareholder’s aggregate tax basis in the post-split shares of\ncommon stock the shareholder received in the reverse stock split will be the same as the shareholder’s\naggregate tax basis in the pre-split shares of common stock the shareholder surrendered in exchange\ntherefor, decreased and increased by certain property received.\nAs a result, a shareholder’s tax basis in one share of the Issuer’s common stock after the reverse stock\nsplit should equal the shareholder’s tax basis in the two shares of the common stock exchanged in the\nreverse stock split. Pursuant to Treasury Regulation (Treas. Reg.) §1.358-2, the basis of the shares of\ncommon stock surrendered should be allocated to the shares of common stock received in a manner\nreflecting, to the greatest extent possible, that a share of stock received is received in respect of shares of\nstock that were acquired on the same date and at the same price. To the extent it is not possible to\nallocate basis in this manner, the basis of the shares of stock surrendered should be allocated to the\nshares of stock received in a manner that minimizes the disparity in the holding periods of the\nsurrendered shares of stock whose basis is allocated to any particular share of stock received.\nPart II, Line 16: The reverse stock split involved the receipt by shareholders of one (1) common stock for\nevery two (2) shares of existing, or pre-split, common stock owned. The market value of the common\nstock was not applicable in determining the calculation of shareholders’ tax basis in the shares received\nin the stock split.\n(cid:0)(cid:2)(cid:3)(cid:0)(cid:4)(cid:3)(cid:4)(cid:2)(cid:0)(cid:5) (cid:6)(cid:7)(cid:8)(cid:9)(cid:10)(cid:11)(cid:12)(cid:13)(cid:14)\n#$%&’()*+,-,./.01&(’230,456789#:,;<,4=#>?=#>6\n,\n,@ABCDCE,FGHIDJ\n,\n,\nKLMNOP@Q,RS,KT@UVT@UM\nMR,MW@\nKT@UV@V,KUV,L@QMKM@V,KLMNOP@Q,RS,NUORLXRLKMNRU\nRS\n, VRPXWNU,@UM@LMKNUT@UMY,NUOG\n,\nZ[\\][^_3,3‘,32a,/\\‘bc]c‘_],‘d,:ae3c‘_],fgh’g(-&,^_.,fgh’(ggf,‘d,32a,<i‘\\c.^,*[]c_a]],8‘\\/‘\\^3c‘_,4e3j,32c],<i‘\\c.^,8‘\\/‘\\^3c‘_,kcii,^.‘/3\n,32a,d‘ii‘kc_l,^0a_.0a_3,)32a,m4\\3ceia],‘d,40a_.0a_3n+,3‘,c3],^\\3ceia],‘d,c_e‘\\/‘\\^3c‘_j,^],^0a_.a.,^_.,\\a]3^3a.,)32a,m4\\3ceia],‘d\n7_e‘\\/‘\\^3c‘_n+,‘_,:a/3a0oa\\,(pj,-g(hq\n(’ 62a,_^0a,‘d,32a,e‘\\/‘\\^3c‘_,c],?‘i/2c_,#_3a\\3^c_0a_3j,7_e’,)32a,m8‘0/^_rn+’\n,\n-’ 62a]a,4\\3ceia],‘d,40a_.0a_3,ka\\a,^.‘/3a.,or,32a,o‘^\\.,‘d,.c\\ae3‘\\],‘d,32a,8‘0/^_r,‘_,4[l[]3,(gj,-g(h,kc32‘[3,]2^\\a2‘i.a\\\n^e3c‘_,^_.,]2^\\a2‘i.a\\,^e3c‘_,k^],_‘3,\\as[c\\a.’\n,\n&’ 4\\3ceia,777,‘d,32a,4\\3ceia],‘d,7_e‘\\/‘\\^3c‘_,c],2a\\aor,^0a_.a.,or,\\a/i^ec_l,32a,dc\\]3,/^\\^l\\^/2,‘d,:ae3c‘_,4,32a\\a‘d,kc32,32a\nd‘ii‘kc_lq\n,\nm62a,3‘3^i,_[0oa\\,‘d,]2^\\a],‘d,^ii,ei^]]a],‘d,]3‘et,32^3,32a,8‘\\/‘\\^3c‘_,]2^ii,2^ba,32a,^[32‘\\c3r,3‘,c]][a,c],6k‘,u[_.\\a.,6a_\n=ciic‘_,)-(gjgggjggg+,]2^\\a]j,‘d,k2ce2,6k‘,u[_.\\a.,=ciic‘_,)-ggjgggjggg+,]2^\\a],]2^ii,oa,8‘00‘_,:3‘etj,/^\\,b^i[a,vg’g(w,/a\\\n]2^\\a,)m8‘00‘_,:3‘etn+,^_.,6a_,=ciic‘_,)(gjgggjggg+,]2^\\a],]2^ii,oa,Z\\ada\\\\a.,:3‘etj,2^bc_l,^,/^\\,b^i[a,‘d,vg’gg(,/a\\,]2^\\a\n)mZ\\ada\\\\a.,:3‘etn+’,62a,*‘^\\.,‘d,?c\\ae3‘\\],c],ax/\\a]]ir,^[32‘\\cya.,3‘,/\\‘bc.a,d‘\\,32a,ei^]]cdce^3c‘_,^_.,\\aei^]]cdce^3c‘_,‘d,^_r\n[_c]][a.,]2^\\a],‘d,8‘00‘_,:3‘et,‘\\,Z\\ada\\\\a.,:3‘et,^_.,32a,c]][^_ea,32a\\a‘d,c_,‘_a,‘\\,0‘\\a,ei^]]a],‘\\,]a\\ca],kc32‘[3,32a\n, ^//\\‘b^i,‘d,32a,]3‘et2‘i.a\\],‘d,32a,8‘\\/‘\\^3c‘_’,;d,32a,Z\\ada\\\\a.,:3‘etj,wgjggg,]2^\\a],2^ba,oaa_,.a]cl_^3a.,:a\\ca],8,8‘_ba\\3coia\nZ\\ada\\\\a.,:3‘etj,/^\\,b^i[a,vg’gg(,/a\\,]2^\\a’n\np’ 4\\3ceia,777,‘d,32a,4\\3ceia],‘d,7_e‘\\/‘\\^3c‘_,c],2a\\aor,^0a_.a.,or,^..c_l,32a,d‘ii‘kc_l,/^\\^l\\^/2,^3,32a,a_.,‘d,:ae3c‘_,4,32a\\a‘dq\n,\nm;_,32a,ei‘]a,‘d,o[]c_a]],‘_,:a/3a0oa\\,(pj,-g(hj,)32a,m:ae‘_.,#ddae3cba,?^3an+j,a^e2,3k‘,)-+,]2^\\a],‘d,8‘00‘_,:3‘et,c]][a.\n^_.,‘[3]3^_.c_l,‘\\,2ai.,or,32a,8‘0/^_r,c_,3\\a^][\\r,]3‘et,c00a.c^3air,/\\c‘\\,3‘,32a,:ae‘_.,#ddae3cba,?^3a,]2^iij,^[3‘0^3ce^iir\n^_.,kc32‘[3,^_r,^e3c‘_,‘_,32a,/^\\3,‘d,32a,\\a]/ae3cba,2‘i.a\\],32a\\a‘d,‘\\,32a,8‘0/^_rj,oa,e‘0oc_a.,^_.,e‘_ba\\3a.,c_3‘,‘_a,)(+\n]2^\\a,‘d,8‘00‘_,:3‘etj,][ozae3,3‘,32a,3\\a^30a_3,‘d,d\\^e3c‘_^i,]2^\\a,c_3a\\a]3],^],.a]e\\coa.,oai‘k,)32a,m:ae‘_.,5aba\\]a,:3‘et\n:/ic3n+’,>‘,d\\^e3c‘_^i,]2^\\a],‘d,8‘00‘_,:3‘et,]2^ii,oa,c]][a.,c_,e‘__ae3c‘_,kc32,32a,:ae‘_.,5aba\\]a,:3‘et,:/ic3’,5^32a\\j\nd\\^e3c‘_^i,]2^\\a],e\\a^3a.,^],^,\\a][i3,‘d,32a,:ae‘_.,5aba\\]a,:3‘et,:/ic3,]2^ii,oa,\\‘[_.a.,[/,3‘,32a,_ax3,k2‘ia,_[0oa\\j,][e2,32^3j,c_\nica[,‘d,d\\^e3c‘_^i,]2^\\a]j,a^e2,]2^\\a2‘i.a\\,k2‘,k‘[i.,2^ba,‘32a\\kc]a,oaa_,a_3c3ia.,3‘,\\aeacba,^,d\\^e3c‘_^i,]2^\\a,‘d,8‘00‘_,:3‘et\n, ^],^,\\a][i3,‘d,32a,:ae‘_.,5aba\\]a,:3‘et,:/ic3,]2^ii,c_]3a^.,oa,a_3c3ia.,3‘,\\aeacba,^,k2‘ia,]2^\\a,‘d,8‘00‘_,:3‘et,c_,\\a]/ae3\n32a\\a‘d’n\n,,\n(cid:15)(cid:14)(cid:14)(cid:10)(cid:16)(cid:17)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:18)(cid:18)(cid:18)(cid:19)(cid:16)(cid:9)(cid:20)(cid:19)(cid:21)(cid:22)(cid:23)(cid:3)(cid:24)(cid:11)(cid:20)(cid:15)(cid:12)(cid:23)(cid:9)(cid:16)(cid:3)(cid:9)(cid:25)(cid:21)(cid:26)(cid:11)(cid:3)(cid:25)(cid:26)(cid:14)(cid:26)(cid:3)(cid:0)(cid:4)(cid:27)(cid:4)(cid:4)(cid:4)(cid:28)(cid:3)(cid:2)(cid:2)(cid:2)(cid:0)(cid:29)(cid:30)(cid:28)(cid:31)(cid:30)(cid:28)(cid:0)(cid:5)(cid:2)(cid:2)(cid:27)(cid:30)(cid:27)(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:25)(cid:10)(cid:25) !\"(cid:0)(cid:19)(cid:15)(cid:14) (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:4)\n(cid:0)(cid:2)(cid:3)(cid:0)(cid:4)(cid:3)(cid:4)(cid:2)(cid:0)(cid:5) (cid:6)(cid:7)(cid:8)(cid:9)(cid:10)(cid:11)(cid:12)(cid:13)(cid:14)\n# #\n$%#&$’%())#&*(+(,-.#/0121#34/56712#89#3:1;<:1;/#/8#/01#3:1;<1<#=;<#+12/=/1<#34/56712#89#$;684>84=/58;#89#?87>05;\n#(;/14/=5;:1;/.#$;6@#0=A1#B11;#1C16D/1<#BE#=#<D7E#=D/0845F1<#8995614#89#/052#G8:>=;E#8;#)1>/1:B14#HI.#JKHL.#=;<#M577#B168:1#19916/5A1#8;\n)1>/1:B14#HN.#JKHL@\n#\n# #

[Operator Instructions] Please note, this conference is being\nrecorded.\nI will now turn the conference over to your host Mr. James Carbonara with Hayden IR. Sir, the\nfloor is yours.\nJames Carbonara - Investor Relations, Hayden IR\nThank you, operator. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us for Dolphin Entertainment’s\nsecond quarter 2024 earnings call. Before we begin, I’d like to remind everyone that during the\ncourse of this conference call management may make forward-looking statements within the\nmeaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are based on\nmanagement’s current expectations and beliefs and involve risks and uncertainties that could\ndiffer materially from actual events. Please refer to the cautionary text regarding forward-looking\nstatements contained in the earnings release published earlier today as well as the most recent\nSEC filings and reports.\nDuring the call today, management will also discuss non-GAAP financial measures, including\nadjusted operating income or loss. The company believes these will provide helpful information\nfor investors. Reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP measures are provided in the\nearnings release.\nNow, I would like to turn the call over to Bill O’Dowd, Chief Executive Officer of Dolphin. Bill,\nplease go ahead.\nBill O’Dowd - Chairman & CEO, Dolphin Entertainment, Inc.\nThanks, James, and welcome everyone. I’ll start by reviewing some of the key financial and\nTranscript Provided by\noperating highlights from our record setting second quarter of 2024, and then Mirta will provide\na more detailed financial overview before we open it up for Q&A.\nStarting with the headlines, well, as you may have seen in our earnings release of a few minutes\nago, total revenue for Q2 was $11.4 million, bringing first half revenue to $26.6 million. We\nexpect the second half of the year to be even stronger than the first half, positioning Dolphin well\nfor fiscal year 2024 revenue to exceed our goal of $50 million, as we aim for more than 20%\nyear-over-year growth.\nOn the bottom line, our Q2 adjusted operating loss was $100,000, and in first half 2024, we\ngenerated a positive adjusted operating income of approximately $900,000. As you would\nexpect, we remain on target to report positive adjusted operating income for full year 2024 and\nbeyond. Thus, we expect to enjoy the next phase of financial flexibility for Dolphin, as we no\nlonger have the singular focus of the acquisition strategy that we’ve employed since uplisting to\nNASDAQ in 2017, and now expand our focus to growing margins and cash flow, while we build\nbusinesses such as sports and seize opportunities, including within our Ventures strategy. More\non that in a little bit.\nTurning to operating updates, just last month in what is technically our third quarter, we\nannounced the acquisition of Elle Communications. Elle is a leading PR agency specializing in\nsocial and environmental impact. Elle joins our publicity and marketing group as a division of\n42West, and will work well and share clients alongside our other preeminent PR firms, Shore\nFire Media and The Door, our influencer marketing agency, the Digital Department, and\ncelebrity and booking event agency Special Projects. All of them are going to benefit from\nhaving Elle as a sister agency.\nBased in Los Angeles and New York, Elle works at the intersection of Impact PR and the\nentertainment industry with a client roster of mission-centered brands, non-profits, philanthropic\nfoundations, including, I might add, celebrity foundations, social enterprises, CSR teams,\nsustainably and ethically made products, activists and leaders. Elle Communications brings 16\nyears of experience and unmatched relationships to the Dolphin Entertainment family. Many of\nour existing clients already care about using their celebrity influence or access to pop culture to\nattempt to put good out in the world or to amplify the messages of those that already do.\nWith Elle, we now have greater resources to keep this work in-house and to greatly expand it\nwith our referrals and relationships. Thus, this acquisition further strengthens Dolphin’s\ncapabilities in the rapidly growing impact investing industry, which currently manages over $1.1\ntrillion worldwide.\nMany of you on the call know also it’s a passion point of mind as I’m blessed to sit on the Board\nof United Way Worldwide as well as the Leadership Council of United Way. And those\npositions have allowed me to witness the work that many of the non-profits, large and small, do\nboth in the United States and globally. And we’re excited to be able to bring some of the power\nof the celebrity and influencers and access to pop culture as I just mentioned to this world in a\nmore organized way with Elle. We’re excited to welcome the passionate and innovative minds of\nthe Elle Communications entire senior leadership team and staff to Dolphin Entertainment.\nTranscript Provided by\nShifting to the subsidiary highlights in Q2. All right, well, 42West led multiple award-winning\ncampaigns at the 2024 Tribeca Festival, a film festival with clients winning best performance in\nthe U.S. narrative feature and best screenplay in an international narrative feature.\nAlso during the festival, 42West marketed the premiere of HBO’s new documentary feature,\n“Wise Guy: David Chase and The Sopranos”, directed by Alex Gibney. Love that show. 42West\nalso supported the world premiere of “Megalopolis”, the new feature from longtime client\nFrancis Ford Coppola, and GKIDS’ “Ghost Cat Anzu,” at the 77th Cannes Film Festival. And\nwe’ve had a real run at Cannes the last few years. Many people will remember that two years\nago, we had “Top Gun” premiere in there, and last year was “Killers of the Flower Moon.” So\nthat’s three years in a row we’ve had a major release at Cannes.\nAnd during the 2024 Television Upfronts, 42West championed clients receiving renewals,\nincluding “The Boys,” “Conan O’Brien Must Go,” “The Conners,” and “Lopez vs. Lopez.”\nAdditionally, 42West Fandoms and Franchises Division, led by the incomparable Shawna\nLynch, spearheaded highly successful campaigns for three AAA video games, namely “Funko\nFusion,” “Alien: Rogue Incursion” and “MultiVersus.”\nShore Fire, our music PR firm, also kept up the beat as clients celebrated several milestones,\nwith the Dave Matthews Band being successfully nominated for induction into the Rock & Roll\nHall of Fame, and Kylie Minogue making Time magazine’s esteemed TIME 100 list. Warren\nZeiders won Breakthrough Male Video of the Year at the 2024 Country Music Awards, and\nBrittany Spencer delivered a stellar performance with Parker Mccollum at the same event. Shore\nFire also announced the promotion of five staff members to key leadership positions, reflecting\ntheir growth and expanding roster.\nThe Door’s tastes were also, once again, exquisite and charitable in Q2. Client campaigns\nincluded promoting the launch of Newman’s Own, “Pay What You Want” pizza truck, with all\nproceeds benefiting the Newman’s Own Foundation. Four Twenty Five, a Jean-Georges\nRestaurant, became one of the newest additions to the Michelin Guide. The Door also supported\nCarbone Fine Food’s launch of “The Sales Rep’ Jacket.” I know many people on the call are\nfrom New York and know Carbone and Jean-Georges Restaurant.\nThe Sales Rep’ Jacket was the first piece of an exclusive capsule collection. And Staple Gin, a\nDolphin partnership with the longtime Door client Rachel Ray, also landed a spot on Vine Pair’s\n“30 Best Gins in the World,” receiving a rating of 94, the highest score received. More on Staple\nGin in a minute.\nThe Digital Department, or TDD as we call them, was once again highly influential. I love what\nJames Carbonara does there with the wordplay. Executing the comprehensive influencer strategy\nfor Crocs’ latest product line, the Getaway Sandals, garnering impressive results. TDD was also\nselected to join Ulta Beauty’s 2024 Beauty Collective. And further TDD talents Mariyah and\nPeter Gerber, very nice people, launched their new clothing collection, the Match Me Boutique\non Amazon.\nTranscript Provided by\nAnd finally, our Special Projects team made their mark on the CHANELTribeca Festival Arts\nDinner, supported Infatuation’s EatsCon L.A., and led an incredible night at the Peabody\nAwards, in each case booking notable celebrities and industry leaders to attend the events.\nThese achievements demonstrate the exceptional work being done across our subsidiaries, and I\ncommend the whole Dolphin family for their dedication and success. It never ceases to amaze\nme the consistent output of work they do for leading entertainment clients.\nShifting gears, I’ll now provide updates on some of our Ventures. As a reminder for those new to\nthe Dolphin story, Ventures will provide us ownership stakes in assets wherein our form of\nmarketing can provide the greatest influence on the likelihood of success. Specifically, while we\nare open to a wide range of opportunities, the assets we are most interested in are content\ncreation, consumer products, and live experiences. Notably, it’s worth repeating that we\nanticipate Dolphin securing ownership stakes in many of these endeavors without the necessity\nof any cash outlay.\nFirst, our film “Blue Angels”, oh wow, what a run, has achieved a remarkable milestone in Q2.\nWe released it the week before Memorial Day weekend in IMAX theaters crossed the $2 million\nmark at the box office. A very, very strong result for a documentary. I believe it’s the best\nopening weekend of the year for a documentary, and it debuted at number one on Amazon Prime\nVideo over the Memorial Day holiday frame. That’s of all movies on Amazon, not just\ndocumentaries. It’s always nice to start a multi-year partnership with a hit right out of the box.\nBoth IMAX and ourselves are thrilled with the results of “Blue Angels” and, of course, this is\nonly the start of the film generating returns for Dolphin. Later this year, we expect to begin\nputting the film in the IMAX institutional theaters around the country, generating an annuity for\nDolphin for years to come. You may recall that these are the theaters and museums and cultural\ninstitutions like the Smithsonian.\nWe are delighted with “Blue Angels” and hope to have a follow-up project to announce on our\nnext earnings call after the fall film festival and development season. Congratulations though to\nEmerson Davis and all the hard-working people at Dolphin Films. That project was a real hit. It’s\nalways nice to have a home run on your first at bat in a new partnership.\nNext, I’m thrilled to announce the launch of Staple Gin, the first product developed by Dolphin\nin partnership with one of the A-list celebrities on our talent rosters. This recipe driven spirit\ncreated by culinary icon Rachel Ray and crafted in New York’s Catskills region, won double\ngold and a 96-point rating at the 15th Annual New York International Spirits Competition, which\nwe announced this morning, and is now available nationally via e-commerce at\nwww.staplegin.com and in New York State at bars, restaurants, and retail destinations via\nSouthern Glazer’s Wine & Spirits with additional markets to follow.\nAs I’m sure everyone on the call knows, Southern Glazer’s Wine & Spirits is the world’s\npreeminent distributor of beverage alcohol. Southern is the largest wine and spirits distributor in\nthe United States with operations in 44 states and Washington, D.C. with 24,000 employees and\nTranscript Provided by\n$26 billion in revenue as of 2023. I’d also like to point out they’re a proud Miami-based\ncompany, as is Dolphin.\nI’m also very pleased to announce that we selected Oak View Group, thank you Lois O’Neill, a\nglobal leader in venue development, management, premium hospitality services, and 360-degree\nsolutions to manage operations at Mastercard Midnight Theater. This strategic partnership with\nOak View Group will ensure the highest level of service and experience for our patrons at this\niconic venue. Oak View is almost finished with the renovations, the Mastercard Midnight\nTheater will be fully open for lunch and dinner with a full slate of shows in the theater right after\nLabor Day.\nLooking ahead, we anticipate making an announcement later this year regarding the first of\nDolphin’s owned or co-owned live events set to take place either late this year or in 2025. This\nmarks a significant step in our strategy to expand our presence in the live entertainment sector\nand create new revenue streams. Also, our entry into live events will mark the final vertical of\nassets to own in our Ventures strategy along with content like Blue Angels and consumer\nproducts like Staple Gin. These developments underscore Dolphin Entertainment’s commitment\nto delivering exceptional content, products, and experiences across multiple platforms. By\nleveraging our talented roster, by forging strategic partnerships, and by exploring new\nopportunities, we are well positioned for continued growth and success.\nIn addition to the exciting Venture developments, we expect the second half of this year we’ll\nwitness Dolphin’s strategic expansion into sports as a new vertical. This will also mark a new era\nfor Dolphin, one in which we can build businesses as well as buy them. Of course, we believe\nthe sports industry is as large and dynamic as the entertainment industry, and that the two go\ntogether like peanut butter and jelly. We expect that launching our services into the sports world\nwill also provide a vast array of fresh Ventures opportunities with sports-related content, sports-\nrelated consumer products, and sports-related live events to be developed.\nWe believe that expanding into sports and acquiring Elle to create immediate growth and impact\nPR are two examples of Dolphin demonstrating its agility and adaptability in a rapidly changing\nmarket. We are excited about the opportunities that we expect both sports and impact to bring to\nour existing businesses and vice versa, and remain committed to delivering exceptional results\nfor our clients and stakeholders. We look forward to providing more details on our sports\ninitiative following a formal announcement prior to our Q3 earnings call. Excited for Sports says\nthe seven-foot man on this call.\nIn conclusion, we believe that Dolphin Entertainment’s record-breaking financial performance\nand impressive subsidiary achievements in Q2 2024 demonstrate our unwavering commitment to\norganic growth. Furthermore, we believe that our acquisition of Elle and expansion into sports\ndemonstrate our commitment to growth through opportunity and innovation. As we continue to\ndeliver exceptional content, services, and experiences across multiple platforms, we remain\nsteadfast in our mission to create long-term value for our clients, partners, and shareholders.\nWith a strong foundation, a talented team, and a clear vision for the future, we believe Dolphin\nEntertainment is poised for continued success in the years to come.\nTranscript Provided by\nWith that said, let me turn it over to Mirta to review the quarter’s financial details. Mirta?\nMirta Sanchez Negrini - CFO & COO, Dolphin Entertainment, Inc.\nThank you, Bill, and good afternoon, everyone. I’ll now dive into Q2 2024 financial results in\nmore detail. Total revenue for the second quarter of 2024 was $11.4 million, representing a 4%\nincrease from the second quarter of 2023. Operating expenses for the three months ended June\n30, 2024, were $12.6 million, including approximately $600,000 of depreciation and\namortization, and $191,000 related to the impairment of goodwill. This compares to operating\nexpenses of $18.5 million for the same period in 2023, which included approximately $500,000\nof depreciation and amortization and $6.5 million of impairment of goodwill.\nNet loss for the quarter ended June 30, 2024 with approximately $1.6 million and included\napproximately $600,000 of depreciation and amortization, a $191,000 of impairment of\ngoodwill, and $500,000 of interest expense. This compares to a net loss of $7.8 million for the\nsame period in 2023, which included approximately $500,000 of depreciation and amortization,\n$6.5 million of impairment of goodwill, $500,000 of interest expense, and $100,000 of equity\nlosses in unconsolidated affiliates.\nLoss per share of $0.08 per share based on 19.4 million weighted average shares outstanding for\nbasic loss per share, and 19.6 million weighted average shares outstanding for diluted loss per\nshare for the three months ended June 30, 2024. For the three months ended June 30, 2023, loss\nper share was $0.60 based on 13.2 million weighted average shares outstanding for both basic\nand fully diluted loss per share.\nCash and cash equivalents were $9.8 million as of June 30, 2024, compared to $7.6 million as of\nDecember 31, 2023.\nI will now ask the operator to open the phone line for questions. Operator, would you please poll\nfor questions.\nOperator\nThank you. At this time, we’ll be conducting our question-and-answer session. [Operator\nInstructions] Thank you. We have a question from Allen Klee with Maxim Group. Your line is\nlive.\nQ: Yes. Hi. Good quarter. Good job. Could you remind us how to think about seasonality if there\nis any third quarter versus fourth quarter?\nBill O’Dowd - Chairman & CEO, Dolphin Entertainment, Inc.\nSure. Yeah, thank you, Allen. I appreciate that. We feel good about our quarter too. Obviously,\nit’s nice to keep going up year-over-year. Well, Q4 is our best quarter every year and always will\nbe because as our influencer marketing company grows and it’s roughly between 20% and 25%\nof our revenue, it’s heavily weighted to the second half of the year and, specifically, into Q4,\nbecause so many influencer campaigns – or so many companies want to run influencer\ncampaigns for the holiday season.\nTranscript Provided by\nSo we tilt into the fourth quarter and we dip in the first half of the year. Of course, Q1 this year\nwas enhanced by much, not all, but much of the Blue Angels revenue. And Q2 improved year-\nover-year, but Q3 should be stronger and then Q4, of course, is our best quarter. So there’s a\nlittle bit of seasonality that will tilt us in Q4 favorably.\nQ: Okay. That’s great. You also mentioned the plan to go into sports. Is the thought to do that\norganically? I thought I heard you say that.\nBill O’Dowd - Chairman & CEO, Dolphin Entertainment, Inc.\nYeah.\nQ: Okay. And it’s like from a PR perspective or in other things too?\nBill O’Dowd - Chairman & CEO, Dolphin Entertainment, Inc.\nThank you for that question. It’s worth me reiterating. This is a business we’ll build. We’re\nhappy with what we’ve got with our acquisitions. We love the group that we’ve assembled and\nthere’s no acquisition in the works, which is for the first time since 2016. So maybe it’s time to\nsee if the rust is on the golf clubs or something.\nBut with that said, with sports, , we wanted to build it anyway, but there just aren’t many\nmanagement companies for athletes and that’s going to be our angle on this. To start, we’re\ngoing to treat sports and the athletes as influencers, which they are today and really launch into\nthat business, which will be directly analogous to our influencer marketing agency, where we\nrepresent the athletes or broadcasters, sportscasters, and typically take a percentage of their\nrevenue for the deals we bring them in the neighborhood of about 20%. So that’s going to be our\nentry point into sports.\nBut, of course, the great thing about an industry that large besides tremendous growth is simply\nthe fact that those athletes will, as they start becoming brand ambassadors, will want PR services.\nAnd we can run events and/or bring them to events that we’re running in the entertainment\nworld. There’s just tremendous crossover. As it has been true since Michael Jordan, or even\nbefore, right, with Gatorade commercials, but it’s at a different level now. And, I think, with the\nSupreme Court’s ruling three years ago on the NIL laws, those college athletes are influencers.\nAnd that’s how they get paid. So we’re excited to be entering into that business. And we’re\nsharing it on this call, because we plan to have an announcement before the next call outlining\nwho we’re launching with and our plans in that space in further detail, but we’re very excited for\nit.\nQ: Yeah, it’s pretty incredible like with the Olympics how positive that it was and like the\nbrands of certain athletes, a lot of them had grants, but it was really like just grew it in a nice way\nthat you might do.\nBill O’Dowd - Chairman & CEO, Dolphin Entertainment, Inc.\nOh, yeah, and the world’s just changed. I mean, just a riff on that one second and wouldn’t it be\ngreat if Dolphin launched with an Olympic athlete or two, Allen. Let’s see what happens. When I\nsay the world changed, I alluded to being tall earlier in this call. This is an aside. But, I played\nTranscript Provided by\ncollege basketball at Creighton and there was no, you couldn’t receive any money. You weren’t\neven allowed to take summer jobs, right? So the world’s upside down in terms of compensation\nof these college athletes and good for them and being able to take influencer dollars.\nBut the same thing’s true at the Olympics. I mean, Paris is widely regarded as an extremely\nsuccessful Olympics, but the IOC changed their rules. Remember how strict they used to be.\nThey would sue anybody and everybody for just mentioning the word Olympics, which they still\ndo to some degree. I mean, they enforce it as they should. It’s the cornerstone of their trademark\nin their IP. But you as an athlete, you were never allowed to share posts or go on social media\nduring the games and now you can pretty much do it as you wish. Except live streaming from the\nvillage or for the competitions.\nSo, the rules are relaxing is all I’m saying and seen as a positive for the games. Having Simone\nBiles get ready for big competitions is just hyping up the game. So there’s just a lot of\nopportunity in sports and the merging of brands wanting to use social media to promote their\nproduct, whether it be with celebrities, influencers, or athletes, I don’t know that the brands see a\ndifference. And I don’t know that we should either. They’re all capable of bringing audiences is\nthe point.\nQ: Makes sense. Okay. And I was curious that this is a very theoretical, I probably can’t exactly\nanswer this, but like you mentioned that you’d like to announce another IMAX partnership. Is\nthere a rule of thumb that if you announced one on a certain date, reasonably how to think about\nhow long it takes to get that produced and then hopefully make some money?\nBill O’Dowd - Chairman & CEO, Dolphin Entertainment, Inc.\nYeah. Great question. Of course, it depends on the length of the subject matter. But, Blue Angels\nwas a little longer, because we were following the squadron for a full season, which is a whole\ncalendar year. So you’re filming all year. Documentaries are a little quicker than that usually, if\nyou announce something in the second half of the year, you may be looking to have the film\nfinished by the second half of next year and in theaters, within six months after that. So, we may\nbe looking at something that could be in theaters first half of 2026, and try and speed up our\npipeline after that if we’re lucky, but there’s also a world with documentaries, you could be in\ntheaters in the fourth quarter of next year if you announce something at the end of this year. It all\ndepends on what you need to film versus archival footage, et cetera.\nQ: Got it. Okay. And then, as you also just said another thing, you can’t exactly answer,\nalthough you did it well on the last one, the live event that you don’t have yet. Is the way to think\nof that as potentially kind of a recurring revenue type of – there’s a way to think about it, if that\nworks and like how, if that could be meaningful and the margins of it relative to your base\nbusiness today?\nBill O’Dowd - Chairman & CEO, Dolphin Entertainment, Inc.\nSure. Yeah, we’re still less than a year with the blessing that is Special Projects in our company.\nThey came in October 2nd of last year. It’s funny. I don’t have kids. And I remember the\nbirthdays of every one of our companies, right? The date that they came into the family. But with\nthat said, I think we’ve got them fully integrated at this point with all of our PR firms and\nTranscript Provided by\ninfluencer marketing agency. Everyone’s working very well together and the client referrals are\nhappening in both directions. So, obviously, the next step in starting in the spring and throughout\nthis summer is working to design the first event in partnership or most likely in partnership with\nmedia publications to help bring additional awareness.\nSo the goal is to have events that are almost like Ventures or, well, they are Ventures. But to\nyour point to create recurring revenue, can you launch something that in success you have every\nyear the same event, same time of year and when you do then you’ve got an annuity like what\nBlue Angels is going to give us. And you have recurring revenue, I guess, I should say it’s more\nthan annuity and then heaven forbid you do a second or third or fourth and you build a real nice\nbusiness that way.\nAnd, obviously, events come in all shapes and sizes just like movies do. So there are events\nwhere your total cost may be $1 million and you’re hoping to make $0.5 million. And I’m not\nsaying that’s Dolphin’s cost, I’m just saying the cost of the event. And you have events where it\nmight be $5 million and you’re hoping for $2 million of profits and up and up and up. So Comic-\nCon was recently, and I just think about where that started and where it is now in terms of over\n100,000 attendees and the revenue that that generates over 4 days in San Diego.\nSo, yeah, long answer to a short question. Yes, we’re thinking about events that can be annual\ninstead of one time and that could be recurring revenue.\nQ: Okay, great. On the last call, you talked about that you could potentially also look at\nlaunching like another skin or beauty product and maybe another liquor-related product. Are\nthose things you’re still thinking about?\nBill O’Dowd - Chairman & CEO, Dolphin Entertainment, Inc.\nYeah, I was alluding to that when I said I think we’ll have a second consumer product venture to\nannounce before the end of the year, so the second half of the year. We committed to building a\nslate of these over the next three years or four years and getting to more than half dozen, around\na dozen maybe, we’ll see. But with liquor, we could do one a year for sure and skincare was\ngoing to start in 2025. So most likely it’ll be liquor for us, right? A second one of this year we\ncould probably identify and announce. But we’re excited to have another consumer product\nbefore the end of the year.\nAnd then they’re the Keith Goodman specials. They’re products that we have a real expertise in\nmarketing and those are two primary ones, categories, liquor and skincare, but there are others,\nand that we can partner. We have a knowledge of the industry so we can create partnerships with\nthe manufacturers and the distributors, and we don’t put up any cash. And we get an ownership\nstake and a success stake in those ventures and we build them to consumer products with the\nintent to sell them. And whether it takes three years, four years, five years, but that’s the point.\nAnd they’re in industries where those sales happen.\nWe all know so many of the liquor brands that sold whether they’re celebrity fronted or not,\nthere’s just a real active market in liquor startups being bought every year, multiple brands, but\npretty much by every major distillery. So, skincare, same way, and people that remember our\nTranscript Provided by\ncalls, we brought in Susan Yara and her group in January, and after Susan has exited the brand\nshe started in the summer of 2020, she exited in September of 2023 from startup three years,\nthree months later, she exited for $355 million and as a skincare line that she promoted with\ninfluencer remarketing. So, her and her group came into Dolphin and we couldn’t be more proud\nof that. So, with that expertise, we want to have skincare products by next year.\nSo, yeah, we expect to have a couple this year, Staple Gin being the first, of course, and then,\nGod willing, we’ll have two to three more next year and every year thereafter. And within a\ncouple of years, you’ve got a decent size slate going. With exits coming a year or two later,\nthat’d be fantastic.\nQ: So, following up on your comments on the liquor category, is there any public source that we\ncan look at to track how Staple Gin is doing?\nBill O’Dowd - Chairman & CEO, Dolphin Entertainment, Inc.\nThat’s a great question, Allen. I mean, yeah, there would be, usually under subscription services,\nI would believe, but Marvin Shanken’s got some great publications in that world. And the impact\nnewsletter being one of them. We’ve known Marvin for years, and he’s a very good man and,\nobviously, an authority in that space. So, we can get you some additional sources of information\non that, but it’s also a good start. I like to tell people using an Olympic analogy, we couldn’t be\nmore proud. We’re three months in, it’s winning so many awards, and it’s got the distribution in\nNew York, and then announcing Southern today. I mean, that runs the risk of going under the\nradar a little bit of just how big a deal that is. I mean, that’s the 800-pound gorilla in liquor\ndistribution in the United States. They’re just easily the biggest, and just pretty much have a\nnational reach with 44 states.\nBut the Olympic analogy, I like to use is, you’ve got a great 12-year-old gymnast, and she’s\nwinning every competition in her state. And she may be an Olympian one day, but you’re not\ngoing to know for three years. And that’s where we are with Staple Gin. Every indication is that\nit’s, the one thing I think we can say definitively three months in is that the product is incredible.\nIf you need quality of product as a cornerstone for any successful consumer product, we’ve got\nthat -- the number of awards it’s winning, three months in the market is just incredible. So,\npeople that would know, and that does not include me, believe that this tastes incredibly well for\ngin.\nAnd so, when you’ve got a good product to sell, and you’ve got somebody that can market it\nbetween The Door and Rachel Ray. And then you got somebody that can distribute it in\nSouthern, then, no pun intended, you’ve got a recipe to give the best chance of influencing that\nproduct’s likelihood of success. And so, it’ll be an interesting ride for the next couple of years\nwith that product, because it’s off to a charmed start for sure. But these are early innings and\nneed to win with a few more quarters too.\nQ: Thank you. My last question is how do you think about operating leverage in terms of like\nwhat you’re thinking about for growth in expenses relative to what’s going on with revenue?\nTranscript Provided by\nBill O’Dowd - Chairman & CEO, Dolphin Entertainment, Inc.\nYeah, I think what we’re at the point now with acquisition strategy no longer being our focus,\nthen we’re going to see, and we expect to see margin expansion and growth in cash flow, which\nis exciting, right? I mean, you’ve got your base. So if we can increase revenues by X percent,\nmuch higher margin is going to fall to the bottom-line. So, we’re focused on that as a company\nand really see the spider web of internal referrals, and then in organic growth increase year-over-\nyear.\nYou’re seeing it now -- look at again by how we measure ourselves. Q2 last year, almost, it was\na fine quarter, but it had an adjusted operating loss, I believe, of $500,000 through the first half\nof last year, we had an adjusted operating loss of $1.9 million versus this year we have an\noperating profit of $900,000, adjusted operating profit, right? So, that’s almost a $3 million\nswing year-over-year for the first six months of this year.\nAnd, yes, Blue Angels impacted that, but basic operations impacted that. And we’re going to see\nthat in the second half of the year too. So our goal has been pointing to the finishing of the group\nat the end of 2023 would lead to, we believed, adjusted operating income for full year 2024, and\nrevenue of $50 million or more. Well, we had over $26 million revenue in the first half of the\nyear, and we’ve almost got $1 million of adjusted operating profit in the first half of the year.\nWe think we’re going to hit both those goals this year, and each subsequent year should only\ngrow. And that’s without Ventures. That’s without any of these lottery tickets working. But,\nobviously, once we get two or three years from now, and we start exiting, we believe then all\nbets are off at that point. So, yeah, that’s how we think about it. And we’re focused on margins\nand cash flow, and it’s really nice to be able to say that.\nI think to further answer that question, I think I said last year, it’s just really nice to just be able\nto not worry about financing for the next acquisition or financing for certain aspects of\noperations. We feel very good about where we’re at in this environment, in the micro-cap\nenvironment. We think we’ve got a great story to tell, because of just that factor alone. So, yeah,\nthanks for that question. So I went on a tangent there, but it’s obviously important to a lot of\npeople on the call.\nQ: No, that’s great. You’re putting together a nice, everything you’re doing, it’s all gelling now.\nSo, that’s great. Congratulations.

At this time, all participants are on a listen-only mode, and the floor will be open\nfor questions and comments following the presentation. Please note, this call is being recorded.\nIt is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Mr. James Carbonara, Investor\nRelations. Sir, the floor is yours.\nJames Carbonara - Hayden IR, Investor Relations\nThank you, operator. Good afternoon, everyone and thank you for joining us today for Dolphin\nEntertainment’s first quarter 2024 earnings call.\nBefore we begin, I’d like to remind everyone that during the course of this conference call,\nmanagement may make forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities\nLitigation Reform Act of 1995.\nThese statements are based on management’s current expectations and beliefs and involve risks\nand uncertainties that could differ materially from actual events. Please refer to the cautionary\ntext regarding forward-looking statements contained in the earnings release published earlier\ntoday, as well as the most the recent SEC filings and reports.\nDuring the call today, management will also discuss non-GAAP financial measures, including\nadjusted operating income or loss. The company believes these will provide helpful information\nfor investors. Reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP measures are provided in the\nearnings release.\nNow, I would like to turn the call over to Bill O’Dowd, Chief Executive Officer of Dolphin\nEntertainment. Bill?\nTranscript Provided by\nBill O’Dowd - Chief Executive Officer, Dolphin Entertainment, Inc.\nThanks, James and welcome everyone. I’ll start by reviewing some of the key financial and\noperating highlights from our record setting first quarter of 2024, and then Mirta will provide a\nmore detailed financial overview before we open it up for Q&A.\nStarting with the headlines. Well, as you may have seen in our earnings release of a few minutes\nago, total revenue for Q1 was $15.2 million, increasing 54% compared to Q1 last year, and\nwhich was also a significant increase of 27% over our previous quarterly revenue record of $12\nmillion established one quarter earlier in Q4 of 2023.\nOn the bottom line, we delivered positive adjusted operating income of $1 million. For those\nunfamiliar, adjusted operating income strips out non-cash and non-recurring items and is the\nprimary metric we used to evaluate our performance. Reporting positive adjusted operating\nincome is tremendously gratifying and validates the success of our strategy, especially compared\nto the $1.9 million adjusted operating loss in Q1 of 2023.\nOur positive adjusted operating income of $1 million also represents another significant\nsequential increase of 236% over the positive operating income of $0.3 million we reported for\nQ4 of 2023. By concentrating on organic expansion among our top tier marketing entities and\nlaunching complementary ventures at a steady pace, we believe we are strategically positioned\nfor sustained growth in both revenue generation and adjusted operating income, the crucial\nfinancial metric against which we gauge our performances I said earlier.\nWe believe that this accelerating growth we’ve reported today highlights the powerful combo of\nour industry-leading marketing and publicity services firms firing on all cylinders, coupled with\ntangible payoff as we begin to commercialize our premium content ventures, with Blue Angel\nsimply being the first venture to monetize and have an exponential impact on our financial\nresults.\nNow that our full group of marketing companies has been assembled with the acquisition of\nSpecial Projects last October and we are developing Ventures opportunities in earnest, we expect\nthe Amplifying Impact will grow significantly as the Dolphin Ventures portfolio expands. We\nbelieve this strategy will unlock compounding returns and continuous value creation by\nsustainably getting paid for services, while accumulating equity stakes, many times without any\ncapital required from Dolphin.\nBut before getting into Ventures, we’ll start with some subsidiary highlights. At 42West, the\nmovie promotion teams help secure four Oscar wins for clients, including Best Animated Film\nfor the Boy and the Heron, and Best Visual Effects for Godzilla Minus One. They drove massive\nbuzz and box office returns throughout the valuable awards season corridor.\nMeanwhile, Shore Fire Media continued its Grammy dominance, representing clients who won a\ncollective nine Grammys and over two dozen total nominations, spanning genres like Pop, R&B,\nJazz and more. Both firms played pivotal roles, supporting marquee clients at leading film\nfestivals like South by Southwest and event shows like the Golden Globes.\nTranscript Provided by\nThe Door also supported clients of South by Southwest, including Giada De Laurentiis, the\nEmmy Award winning television personality, New York Times’ best-selling cookbook author,\nrestaurateur and entrepreneur, and promotion of her Italian lifestyle brand, Giadzy.\nThe Digital Department, our specialized influencer marketing division, made two strategic\nmoves to expand their capabilities. First, they inked a deal with GlowLab and Founder, Susan\nYara to create a new skincare and dermatology influencer practice. Secondly, they partnered\nwith legendary youth talent agency Osbrink to establish a Young Adult division focused on Gen\nZ and Gen Alpha influencers across TikTok and YouTube.\nFinally, Special Projects continue the strong momentum, collaborating with luxury brands like\nCHANEL, Gucci and Valentino on product launches and fashion week activations. Also, they\nhad another extremely busy Oscar season, running five significant events during Oscar’s Week,\nincluding separate events for such blue chip clients as Apple, Versace and W Magazine.\nShifting gears, I’ll now provide updates on some of our ventures. As a reminder for those new to\nthe Dolphin story, Ventures will provide us ownership stakes and assets, wherein our form of\nmarketing can provide the greatest influence on the likelihood of success. Namely content\ncreation, consumer products and live experiences. Notably, it’s worth repeating that we\nanticipate Dolphin securing ownership stakes in many of these endeavors without the necessity\nof a cash outlet.\nOkay, it’s a big week at Dolphin on multiple ventures fronts. Let’s start with our flagship Blue\nAngels documentary. We are incredibly excited for the film’s upcoming theatrical debut in\nIMAX theaters this weekend. The marketing campaign is in full swing with the exclusive trailer\npremiere on the Today Show generating massive buzz and wedding audience appetite. Blue\nAngels has already delivered a substantial financial contribution in Q1.\nDuring the quarter, we monetized a significant portion of the streaming distribution rights,\ngenerating $3.4 million in revenue. The film will become available for streaming on Amazon\nPrime starting May 23rd, perfectly timed to capitalize on the Memorial Day viewing period,\nwhich, by the way, is the same weekend that Top Gun Maverick was released two years ago,\nstarring our client, Tom Cruise.\nAnd there’s another tie between the two films. Glenn Powell, who’s about as hot as any actor in\nHollywood right now, ain’t that the truth, played Hangman in Top Gun Maverick and is also a\nproducer with us on Blue Angels, which certainly helps with the promotion. Oh, and by the way,\nBlue Angels is a perfect example of a venture driving business back to our super group, since\n42West is handling the PR for the movie.\nImportantly, in addition to the traditional theatrical window, Blue Angels represents an annuity\nrevenue stream from its extended run in institutional IMAX theaters at museums, science centers\nand other educational venues around the globe. This institutional theater distribution channel\nprovides a lucrative multi-year box office tail. So that’s coming this Friday.\nTranscript Provided by\nWhat’s that? This Friday is too far away for some of you on this call. You can’t wait three days\nfor a catalyst at Dolphin? What are you, James Carbonara? The week of his birthday? Okay,\nokay, okay. Well, today, like right now fast enough for you? Because consumers can now place\npre-orders for Staple Gin on the official website and shipments are available starting, you\nguessed it, right now, today to 43 states.\nIn addition to the online launch, Staple Gin is making its way across the State of New York,\nbeing introduced in retail stores, bars and restaurants. As a matter of fact, Charlie Dougiello, who\nis leading the charge for Dolphin in this venture, just spotted Staple Gin at Union Square Wine &\nSpirits not even two hours ago.\nAnd again, for those new to the Dolphin story, Staple Gin is a new spirit developed by the team\nat The Door and our client, Rachel Ray, and crafted in New York’s Catskills region by Do Good\nSpirits. Dolphin is partnered with Rachael Ray and Do Good Spirits, whereby Dolphin is the\nofficial creative marketing partner. And let me just say, Rachel has really knocked this one out of\nthe park.\nStaple Gin has already gained recognition, being ranked as the highest-rated American gin in\nVinePair’s 30 Best Gins for 2024 Guide with an impressive rating of 94 points. Please remember\nfolks, this gin was rated the 4 going to market and it received the highest score given by an\nindustry heavyweight publication. That is an incredible result. Oh, and that’s all with its retail\nprice point suggested as only $39.99. Needless to say, this gin has caught the attention of gin\nenthusiasts and has been praised for its clarity of aromas and flavors.\nThe partnership between Dolphin and Staple Gin signifies a strong alliance between the\nentertainment marketing industry and the world of spirits. We believe that our collaboration will\nelevate the brand and bring Staple Gin to a wider audience through innovative and creative\nmarketing strategies. The enthusiasm for monetization in the liquor space has been palpable,\ndriven by the remarkable success stories of celebrity-backed spirit brands like Ryan Reynolds’\nAviation Gin and George Clooney’s Tequila Casamigos.\nThese high profile exits have demonstrated the immense potential for substantial returns on\ninvestment and have fueled excitement and interest in the industry. Investors and entrepreneurs\nare eager to capitalize on the growing demand for unique and premium spirits, making the liquor\nspace an enticing landscape for lucrative exits. We believe this is an exciting new area of growth\nfor Dolphin and we are well positioned to create significant value for our shareholders through\nour marketing expertise and innovative deal structure. We have incredibly high hopes for Staple\nGin, as you can imagine. Fingers crossed that we’ve got a hit on our hands.\nAnd finally, in talking about our ventures, I would like to say a few brief words about\nMastercard Midnight Theatre. As you heard me say on our Q4 earnings call just a few weeks\nago, we have narrowed down all of our choices for a new operating partner for the restaurant and\ntheater to a favorite group. We are in the final stages of working on that deal and anticipate we\ncan make an announcement within the month of May. That will be an equally exciting piece of\nnews for us.\nTranscript Provided by\nSo how’s that for the anticipation of three major ventures milestones, all in one month. To recap,\nQ1 2024 achieved record setting financial results, while making meaningful strides in\nmonetizing our equity ventures. Moreover, those results are just beginning. Going forward, as we\nsecure equity ownership in an increasing number of new ventures, we believe the growth\npotential becomes exponential.\nAs we seek to enter multiple ventures opportunities in the next two to three years, this unique\nmodel allows us to rapidly scale a portfolio of equity-owned opportunities with minimal cash\ninvestments required, which is to say that while we believe that today’s results validate our\nstrategy, we are really just getting started. Envision the Amplifying Impact on our top and\nbottom lines, as our Ventures portfolio expands to include a dozen or more ownership stakes\nusing this low-cost approach. Simply put, and in one sentence, we believe that our ability to\nsustainably replicate this strategy unlocks a future of compounding returns and value creation.\nWith that said, let me turn it over to Mirta to review the quarter’s financial details. Mirta?\nMirta Sanchez Negrini - CFO & COO, Dolphin Entertainment, Inc.\nThank you, Bill and good afternoon, everyone. I’ll start by echoing Bill’s comments, we are\nextremely pleased with our record first quarter financial performance. I’ll now dive into Q1 2024\nfinancial results in more detail.\nTotal revenue of $15.2 million represents a 54% increase from $9.9 million of revenue in Q1\n2023. During the first quarter of 2024, we generated $3.4 million of revenue from the Blue\nAngels.\nOperating expenses for the three months ended March 31st, 2024 were $15.1 million, including\napproximately $600,000 of depreciation and amortization, and $1.8 million of amortization of\ncapitalized production costs related to the Blue Angels, compared to $12.5 million of operating\nexpenses for the three months ended March 31st, 2023, including approximately $500,000 of\ndepreciation and amortization.\nNet loss for the quarter ended March 31st, 2024 was approximately $300,000 and includes\napproximately $600,000 of depreciation and amortization, and $1.8 million of amortization of\ncapitalized production costs related to the Blue Angels and $500,000 of interest expense. This\ncompares to the net loss of $3 million for the same period in 2023, which includes approximately\n$500,000 of depreciation and amortization, $400,000 of interest expense and $100,000 of equity\nlosses in unconsolidated affiliates.\nLoss per share was $0.02 per share based on 18,477,825 weighted average shares outstanding for\nbasic loss per share and 18,605,702 weighted average shares for fully diluted loss per share for\nthe three months ended March 31st, 2024. For the three months ended March 31st, 2023, loss per\nshare was $0.23 based on 12,640,285 weighted average shares outstanding for both basic and\nfully diluted loss per share.\nTranscript Provided by\nCash and cash equivalents were $7.5 million as of March 31st, 2024, compared to $7.6 million as\nof December 31st, 2023. That concludes my financial remarks. I will now ask the operator to\nopen the phone line for questions. Operator, would you please poll for questions?\nOperator\nThank you. Ladies and gentlemen, the floor is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions]\nThank you. We have a question from Allen Klee with Maxim Group. Your line is live.\nQ: Yes, hi. Congratulations on a very strong quarter. That handling beat my estimates. A couple\nof questions on – starting with Blue Angels. You said that it added $3.4 million of revenues. I\nmissed what you said about what the production costs were. But could you give just based on the\ncontractual amount that you’re expected to get, what’s the incremental amount that you can get\nand the cost that you would expect in the next quarter or two?\nBill O’Dowd - Chief Executive Officer, Dolphin Entertainment, Inc.\nSure –\nMirta Sanchez Negrini - CFO & COO, Dolphin Entertainment, Inc.\nSo –\nBill O’Dowd - Chief Executive Officer, Dolphin Entertainment, Inc.\nAnd thank you, Allen. Thank you for the kind words at the start of this. Yeah, we’re very proud\nof this quarter. It feels great, right. In terms of Blue Angels, I think the next couple of quarters,\nwe may not add revenue or much revenue and much expenses, but where we really kick in is,\nwhen we can put the film in theaters, IMAX institutional theaters, which we can contractually do\nsix months after its – it premieres on Amazon Prime, then we’ll get more revenue and allocate\nmore of the production costs against that revenue in a bigger way.\nObviously, we still have revenue from – there will be revenue generated from theaters this\nweekend and next week. But we see the big value and the additional revenue for years to come,\nhopefully two decades to come from having this movie play in IMAX theaters around the globe,\nin science museums and aviation museums and the Smithsonian and other institutional theaters\nlike that. And we’ll continue to recognize that revenue each quarter as that money comes in.\nQ: Are you able to say how many institutional theaters you’re hoping or you are contracted with\nIMAX for?\nBill O’Dowd - Chief Executive Officer, Dolphin Entertainment, Inc.\nSure. Yeah, we think they’ll be. This film will play in 150 to 200 of those theaters and hopefully\nin perpetuity. Of course, we’re prejudiced, Allen, but this is a major motion picture documentary,\nright. It’s going in big IMAX, going into Memorial Day. It looks great. I’ve seen it, of course, a\nfew times now, and it’s just a stunning documentary.\nSo if it’s already best-in-class, we feel for a theatrical experience. You can imagine how it\ncompares to the average science documentary in a museum. It’s night and day and it’s very\nTranscript Provided by\ncontemporary. It’s very now. So we shot with IMAX cameras of today and not cameras of 20\nyears ago. So that weren’t IMAX cameras. So we think it’s going to have a very, very, very long\ntail, is my point.\nQ: That’s great. So if I – your revenue was – if I take your revenue, which was $15.2 million,\nand if I take out –\nBill O’Dowd - Chief Executive Officer, Dolphin Entertainment, Inc.\nBlue Angels?\nQ: Blue Angels. Yeah. You were still. It was still like $11.8 million, which was above –\nBill O’Dowd - Chief Executive Officer, Dolphin Entertainment, Inc.\nYeah versus $9.9 million a year before –\nQ: Right, almost a year before. Whereas would you highlight was outperformance and maybe\nfollowing-up –\nBill O’Dowd - Chief Executive Officer, Dolphin Entertainment, Inc.\nYou’re saying versus your estimate, right, right –\nQ: This is a quarter where, go ahead, sorry.\nBill O’Dowd - Chief Executive Officer, Dolphin Entertainment, Inc.\nNo, my apologies. I didn’t mean to be speaking over you. But yeah, year-over-year we’d still be\nup over 20% or about 20%, I should say. So yeah, we just – it’s all starting to come together, my\nfriend, right. We got a full group. They’re cross-selling.\nI will point out in Q1, I’d give a special shout out to Amanda Lundberg in 42West, the movie\ndivision of that company had a very strong first quarter with all the Oscar Awards and campaigns\nthey were running. That can be a lucrative business. We’re proud to have Martin Scorsese, our\nclient filmed Killers of the Flower Moon, which obviously did not win the Oscar, but was\nnominated in a lot of categories.\nAnd then the team and fandoms and franchises and the movie division team there again did a\ngreat job with Boy and the Heron, which won Best Animated Film. You heard that in my\nprepared remarks. That was an upset over the Spider-Man animation movie. And then Godzilla\nMinus One. I mean, that I think I pointed that out on the 10-K call.\nI mean, that was just an unbelievable campaign they ran, which won for Best Visual Effects,\nconsidering that the entire budget of that movie was $15 million in Japanese, a movie. And it\nwon the Best VFX Oscar over competition, where the VFX budget alone was more than the\nentire movie for Godzilla Minus One.\nSo they just had a tremendous quarter. But great work’s done across all these firms. They’re\nmarket leaders for a reason. You also heard me highlight Special Projects. I mean, they’re\nTranscript Provided by\nrunning events at New York Fashion Week that five, six events in a week with blue chip clients.\nThey’re doing the same thing, Oscar’s Week. When you got clients like Apple and Versace and\nW Magazine and other times of the year, they got the Motion Picture Academy and Wall Street\nJournal Conde Nast. I mean, these are very much blue chip clients and you’re bringing the\nbiggest celebrities in the world to these events. So they had a very strong first quarter, especially\nduring those two weeks.\nQ: Thank you. So the Digital Department, which is social influencing, is, I think 4Q is the\nstrongest, but then maybe it usually drops off in 1Q. But you’ve added these two new verticals,\nSkincare and Young Adult. And I’m wondering maybe how that – how you think about those\ntwo new areas of how meaningful they could potentially be?\nBill O’Dowd - Chief Executive Officer, Dolphin Entertainment, Inc.\nSure. Yeah. I mean, we chose those two and we’ve got a third one coming, Allen. I know you\nbelieve we would, right. But because they can have big impact, right. I’ll give Susan Yara and\nOlivia, who runs that division for us now, a lot of credit, because that was an existing business.\nSo they kind of plug and played into our platform and immediately day one created revenue and\nprofit and it really was kind of brand adjacent.\nWe’re very strong in female Instagram, a full roster of influencers there. Skincare tends to skew\nfemale, both in the influencers themselves and the followers. Instagram heavy content along with\nsome YouTube and some TikTok. But they could just go right in and play well, because they\nwere an existing group of 15 influencers already that were being managed. And we just brought\nin the manager and the influencers. So they had an immediate impact.\nAnd in time, that group is nearing the biggest vertical we have anyway. But there’s very large\nroom for expansion, because we’re talking about, we could probably double the size of the\nskincare group by itself. But then you can get into the other verticals of beauty, right. So big,\n$100 billion plus beauty market out there. That includes cosmetics, that includes hair care, which\nmight be the biggest category of all, Allen.\nAnd why did I just blank on the other one? But it’ll come back to me in a second. But the – so\neach of those verticals is as big as skincare. So this has a lot of room to run. And bringing in a\npremier group like that establishes us as a major player right away.\nAnd then in the Young Adult business, why we partnered with Osbrink is because it probably\nshaved half the time off what it would take us to build it by ourselves. I mean, Osbrink is just the\nbiggest group in young talent. And while we’re building the relationship with brands that want to\nwork with young talent, we have a great roster of young talent to work with.\nSo, GlowLab came in with their own brands that are already doing business with them and their\ndermatologists. We’re building that in the Young Adult space. But when we do, then I think\nprobably everyone on the call has heard of influencers that are teenagers, that have been wildly\nsuccessful from Kylie Jenner being the youngest billionaire listed on Forbes because of her\ncosmetics line. And Kylie Jenner is an influencer, right. She’s not an actress. She’s not a singer.\nTranscript Provided by\nShe’s an influencer and down to college athletes or stars from the Disney Channel. So, that\nsegment has tremendous potential as we build our relationship with the brands.\nQ: That’s great. Could you – for Staple Gin, can you talk a little? I think you said you’re\npartnered with The Door, and they have their own – and there’s another partner. Just kind of\nwhat’s going on, on the marketing side and how you feel about that?\nBill O’Dowd - Chief Executive Officer, Dolphin Entertainment, Inc.\nSure. Yeah and what happened there, Charlie Dougiello and the team at The Door, they really\ndeveloped this product with Rachel. I think I may have shared in previous quarters, and if I\nhaven’t, please forgive me, but I’ve learned a lot in this process. And I learned that gin is made\nfrom a recipe, for example.\nAnd what better liquor to start, a consumer products category for us than one in which we have,\nwe think, the most popular chef in America, Rachel Ray. She’s beloved by tens of millions of\nAmericans, right. She’s been on Daytime Talk Shows and 30 Minute Meals for going on 20\nyears, I guess, and just signed a huge deal with A+E Networks for hundreds of hours of\nprogramming a year.\nSo if you talk about somebody that’s authentic to writing a recipe, Rachael Ray, is it? So she\nwrote the recipe for Staple Gin and then is writing recipes to cook with the Staple Gin, right. But\nGod bless her, she kind of crushed it coming out of the gate because those rankings from\nVinePair, again, I – Charlie was very bold to submit it. You’re submitting a gin that isn’t in the\nmarket and for it to get the highest score.\nAnd in fairness, there were a couple other gins that tied it for the highest score. But that’s just\nincredible. And it’s a tribute to Rachel really took her time and worked to get the flavor exactly\nas she wanted it. And a really cool twist. Many people know Rachel lives in upstate New York.\nShe also has a home. She spends virtually as much time in Italy, and she married the ingredients\nfor Staple Gin come from those two regions.\nSo when the team was looking for the right distillery, they picked Do Good, which is a distillery\nin upstate New York, where Rachel lives when she’s in America. And that local distillery took\nthe recipe and ran with it, and here we are. Now you can go buy yourself a bottle, Allen, up there\nin Manhattan.\nQ: That’s great. How do you feel about the ability of manufacturing and distribution and where\nwill it be in the retail in New York?\nBill O’Dowd - Chief Executive Officer, Dolphin Entertainment, Inc.\nSure. Yeah. Well, we’ll have now. And I think a lot of investors are particularly excited about\nthis because, quite frankly, this isn’t speculative. This isn’t an industry where like, oh, if you do\nwell, can you exit? Like these are products that are built to exit, right. So, there are dozens of\nexamples in the last ten years of successful exits.\nTranscript Provided by\nAnd The Door, quite frankly, has promoted their fair share of those products that were conceived\nwhile they were the marketing partner and sold while they were the marketing partner. So, it’s a\nprocess that our team is familiar with. With that said, we’ll have a regular cadence of\nannouncements, because probably the next thing that you’ll hear from us on this is the\nannouncement of the national distribution partner.\nI think people that follow Rachel and follow the liquor industry probably have a very strong\nguess as to who that partner is based on previous relationships. But still, that’ll be a nice big\nannouncement for us. We think in the near-term, next few weeks, that’ll be a partner that can put\nthe gin on a national scale right away.\nIn New York, that – same partner is putting it out in, that’s the work that’s happening now,\nputting it out in what will become hundreds of Doors in the State of New York. As I was saying,\nCharlie was just down in Union Square, visited three stores, he told me earlier today, and two of\nthem were already carrying Staple Gin, which is great. Now, it usually comes in cycles, right.\nLike some stores, you get the order to place the bottle on their shelves, but they don’t swap out\ntheir shelves for four weeks or six weeks. So it’s kind of a rolling start, if you will.\nBut we’ll be announcing our distributor. We’ll be announcing the number of Doors probably in\nNew York, or certainly the widespread nature in New York. And then with success, we’ll be\nopening up other markets around the country. And when people start seeing that, that’s your clue\nthat we’re getting to scale where interested parties want to buy the brand, because it’s already got\ntraction in the marketplace. And these exits are not small, as you heard.\nRyan Reynolds sold his gin for $610 million, I believe. And we all know what Clooney did with\nCosamigos and his billion dollar check. And the Rock is going to beat them both, by all\naccounts, with his tequila. So and there are a lot of other examples that are between $100 million\nand $500 million. So, we’re excited for this and it’s the start of a whole portfolio of these types\nof liquor brands for us, we think. So we’re excited.\nQ: That’s great. If I look at your different companies that you own and the divisions, I think I\nheard you say that your movies and acting was strong and you were strong within Blue Angels.\nAs we think just seasonally, is there any reason to think that any of the segments might show\nsome seasonality in the next two quarters compared to this quarter? Or do you think it is kind of\nlike steady type of type of growth?\nBill O’Dowd - Chief Executive Officer, Dolphin Entertainment, Inc.\nWell, the first half of the year is always never typically as strong as the second half of the year\nfor us across most of our companies. That’s just a fact we’ll live with for the next 20 years,\nprobably of our core business. Now, as we start doing these ventures, it’s going to smooth that\nout a little bit, right.\nAs we – Imagine if we have half a dozen of these ventures. Sure, you can have great exits like\nwe just had tremendous success out of the gate with Blue Angels. We’ve already made a\nhandsome profit and the film isn’t even in theaters yet, so that’s a good result. But as we get\nsteady income developing from the different ventures, and again, worth pointing out is, I think I\nTranscript Provided by\nsaid twice in my prepared remarks, many of those we don’t have to put up a penny. We receive\nthe ownership stake for our group marketing and typically also receive some form of cash were\ntaken out every month in addition to that.\nBut as we have those ventures coming in and it’ll smooth out our revenue a little bit, but that’s\ngoing to take a couple of years. We typically see second half of the year stronger. And in\ninfluencer marketing, that’s always going to be the case. I don’t know that we’ll ever – just\nbecause it’s not that the rest of the year is weak, particularly Q1 a little bit. But it’s the fact that\nQ4 is so strong, because every brand wants to use influencers to drive holiday sales.\nSo, we will see some seasonality to that effect, but on an annual basis, which is also how we like\nto look at it, we feel very good about this year, both from a revenue standpoint and adjusted\noperating income, which is how we measure ourselves, as you heard me say, on that basis as\nwell. And with Q1 off to such a strong start, it’s hard to imagine we won’t have a good year.\nQ: Thank you. I have a financial question. If I look at what you did for operating expenses in 1Q,\nare there any areas that are overall you think we should think about that might go up or down as\nwe go out – go through the year?\nMirta Sanchez Negrini - CFO & COO, Dolphin Entertainment, Inc.\nWell, in the direct cost. Sorry?\nBill O’Dowd - Chief Executive Officer, Dolphin Entertainment, Inc.\nRight, and I was going to say the same thing –\nMirta Sanchez Negrini - CFO & COO, Dolphin Entertainment, Inc.\nYeah, I would say is the direct cost, yeah, because those correlate with the revenues of the film.\nSo, for instance, in this quarter, we’ve got $3.4 million of revenue for Blue Angels and we have\n$1.8 million of the amortization of the deferred production costs. So that number is going to vary\ndepending on the revenues that we recognized.\nQ: That amortization of deferred – of the deferred cost, that happens over what time period?\nMirta Sanchez Negrini - CFO & COO, Dolphin Entertainment, Inc.\nOver the time period that we expect the revenues to be recorded. So it’s a – it’s based on a ratio\nof the revenue that you are reporting in this period over what you estimate the total revenues for\nthe project are going to be. So whenever we report revenues, we apply that formula to what’s left\nof the deferred production cost, and that’s what gets expensed.\nQ: Does this get added back to adjusted operating income?\nMirta Sanchez Negrini - CFO & COO, Dolphin Entertainment, Inc.\nNo, we did not add that back.\nQ: But it’s a non-cash cost or it’s a cost –\nTranscript Provided by\nMirta Sanchez Negrini - CFO & COO, Dolphin Entertainment, Inc.\nIt’s a cost that we –\nQ: Or I guess, yeah.\nMirta Sanchez Negrini - CFO & COO, Dolphin Entertainment, Inc.\nYou’re correct, correct. We’ve reported in the past that we had invested over $2 million in the\nproject. So, that’s already been paid for and it’s capitalized in our balance sheet under capitalized\nproduction costs.\nQ: Okay. So you had invested over $2 million and you recognized $1.48 million of the\namortization this quarter and the rest of it will be over whatever the life is of the assumed life of\nthe project.\nMirta Sanchez Negrini - CFO & COO, Dolphin Entertainment, Inc.\nCorrect. Whenever we report revenues.\nQ: Okay, got it. Okay, just, so just let me wrap up on a couple other things. I’m thinking just in\nterms of how you’re thinking about maybe, do you think this year you might potentially identify,\nthe next Blue Angels type of partnership with IMAX? And then Special Projects, how do you\nthink about like how that business is going to go going forward and just how you feel generically\nabout additional ventures that you could make investments in, in ‘24?\nBill O’Dowd - Chief Executive Officer, Dolphin Entertainment, Inc.\nSure. Well, taking the middle question. Yeah, we love Special Projects. It’s a beautiful little\ncompany. I say little, because it’s eleven people between New York and LA, but they do the\nbiggest events in our industry, right. They’re the best at what they do in our entire industry.\nAnd I’ve said it before, but Nicole Vecchiarelli and Andrea Oliveri are the model of executives\nthat we hope to have within Dolphin. They’re smart, they’re strategic, they’re good people. Just a\nlot of good things to say. So they also are going to have an increased role within Dolphin,\nbecause you heard me say that, when we think about Ventures, we think content like Blue\nAngels. We think consumer products like Staple Gin.\nAnd the third category is, we think Live Events, Live Experiences. And while all of our\nmarketing companies, all of our PR firms, the Digital Department, all have experience with live\nevents, either promoting them or throwing them like the Digital Department does. This is what\nSpecial Projects does day in, day out.\nSo the strategic acquisition of Special Projects back in October was because they complement\nour core offering, our 1.0 by cross-selling very nicely with our existing clients, but also because\nthey can help us ideate, develop and produce events that either we own or co-own. So I’m on the\nrecord of saying we expect to be able to announce our first one before the end of the year or very\nearly in the New Year. But I feel pretty good about before the end of the year, and Special\nProjects will be right there as the reason why that happened. So that’s Special Projects and why\nthat was a strategic acquisition, of course.\nTranscript Provided by\nIn terms of the next Blue Angels. Well, if I’m being honest, I wish I could announce it today.\nThat would have been the right time to do it. The week you have this one going in theaters, you\nwant the next one out – next one announced, and it would have been great. This is Cannes Film\nFestival Week. We’ve had some pretty good years over the last couple of years. We have our\nclient, Francis Ford Coppola, has got the Thursday Night Film in two nights over there. And, one\nof our other clients, Studio Ghibli, is getting a Career Achievement Award for an animation\nstudio, that’s tremendous, right.\nWith that said, it would have been a great announcement week. We’re just not prepared to do it\nyet. The one we most want, we can’t talk about yet. And we have a default. Like if it just doesn’t\nwork out, we’re thinking of filming James Carbonara and a go-kart. We figure that might look\ngood up in an IMAX Great.\nBut in all seriousness, we obviously too, are building a production pipeline so we can have not\njust the next one, but hopefully the one right after it as well. But we’re very, very confident in the\nbusiness plan, because what Blue Angel showed us is if we can put a spectacle documentary in\ntheaters, it has tremendous value for streaming platforms.\nIt wasn’t just like Amazon was the only one that wanted it. It’s fair to say that four streaming\nservices were very aggressive. And that’s something that just doesn’t exist in the market. There\njust aren’t other people putting documentaries in theaters, let alone IMAX theaters. So we feel\nvery good about what we got. We just want that next one to be able to talk about as much as you\ndo.\nIn terms of your third question, of the three, other ventures. Well, Charlie Dougiello doesn’t slow\ndown The Door. We do have. We are evaluating opportunities. We have opportunities to\nevaluate is how I should have said it, in the liquor space. I think it’s – we feel very confident we\ncan meet our stated goal of having one new venture in the liquor space every year. But there can\nbe some years and maybe even this year where we can do two. That’s exciting.\nWe are working hard to make sure we have a skincare product that we can put in market in 2025.\nSo we have one of those a year or as close to it as we can going forward, starting next year. And\nthen we will announce that next live event, our first live event, excuse me, this year I really\nbelieve that. And that’ll be something like liquor, where we’ll have one a year, but – or some\nyears two.\nBut it’s not like you do a live event and then it’s over. We’re trying to design live events to\nwhere they become an annual tradition – for each of those events. So once you get to, by the time\nyou’re doing your fourth or fifth live event in success, you’ve got the next year you’re starting\nwith five events, if that makes sense, and you’re adding a sixth in a different category. So, live\nevents will be the last thing added to our portfolio of ventures. But they’ll be equally important,\nin my mind, to the content strategy and the consumer product strategy.\nQ: Okay, great. Well, thank you so much.\nTranscript Provided by\nBill O’Dowd - Chief Executive Officer, Dolphin Entertainment, Inc.\nNo, thank you, Allen. You always ask the most insightful questions and allow me to expand on\nour strategy. So, thank you.\nOperator\nThank you. As we have no further questions on the lines at this time, I will hand it back to Mr.\nO’Dowd for any closing comments you may have.\nBill O’Dowd - Chief Executive Officer, Dolphin Entertainment, Inc.\nWell, thank you, everybody that’s listening. Obviously we’re very proud of this quarter. It is the\nfirst quarter of the year. It’s the first quarter where we’ve had our whole group together. This is\nour first full quarter. We obviously had a blowout quarter. It’s not going to happen very often\nwhere you set a revenue record by 25% over the previous record.\nSo, we know that we will have a glass of Staple Gin and celebration and go right back to work,\nright. We’re excited as I said on the last couple of calls, we see ourselves at the starting line and\nwe’re not even there yet. Honestly, we’re building to get to the starting line in live events, and\nit’s only going to get better from here in consumer products and content.\nSo, we know we’ve got with our company. We’re very, very proud of our company. We’re\nexcited for our company, and this quarter proved it of what we can do when we have the whole\ngroup together and we start monetizing some of these ventures. So for a company of our size, we\nthink we’re as exciting an opportunity as there is in the market. So thank you all for the time and\nappreciate it, and look forward to speaking again with Q2 in August. Thank you, everybody.\nOperator\nThank you, ladies and gentlemen. This does conclude today’s event. You may disconnect your\nlines at this time and have a wonderful day. And we thank you for your participation.\nTranscript Provided by"

Thank you for joining us today. As always, we'll start with a\nreview of some financial and operating highlights, followed by a full financial review, and then\nopen it up for Q&A.\nSo, from a financial highlights perspective, revenue for Q4 was a record $12 million, quarterly\nrevenue record for Dolphin Entertainment, an increase of 8% year-over-year. I'm immensely\nproud of the Dolphin team who managed to achieve its best revenue quarter ever despite\nenduring two prolonged industry-wide strikes. Even more impressively on the bottom line, the\nteam delivered positive adjusted operating income of $300,000 in the face of such headwinds.\nThis is very important to note, so I'm going to pause here and add that adjusted operating income\nis the primary metric by which we measure our business. It's what I look at first in any P&L I\nreceive from Mirta. We define adjusted operating income as our operating income or loss after\nremoving any non-cash or non-recurring income or expenses. In other words, if you go to our\nreported operating income or loss and back out all non-cash and non-recurring items, how did we\ndo?\nReporting positive adjusted operating income is extremely gratifying, obviously, and now that\nwe have our Super Group, complete with the acquisition of Special Projects and with our\nexpectation of continued synergies and organic growth, combined with the launch of our\nVentures in earnest, we believe that we will continue to have and expand positive adjusted\noperating income on a continuous annual basis. Very exciting and it's good to share with\neveryone how we look at our business and the metric, even if it's a non-GAAP metric that we\nuse.\nSo, speaking of Special Projects, I know we discussed the acquisition at length on our Q3 call,\nbut the transaction did happen in Q4, so just a couple of more bullets on them. As a brief\nrefresher, I'll just point out the Special Projects, founded by the amazing industry leaders Nicole\nVecchiarelli and Andrea Oliveri, is a leading agency in talent booking and celebrity-curated\nevent production, with offices in Los Angeles and New York. Their impressive client roster\nincludes top brands like Apple, CHANEL, Condonast [Phonetic], Wall Street Journal, among\nmany, many others. With this strategic addition, Dauphin aims to launch or partner on our own\nlive events, as well as capitalize on cross-selling opportunities and synergies across our various\ncompanies.\nAnd speaking of our other companies, I'll now turn to some operating highlights. 42West helped\nclients secure four wins at the 96th Academy Awards and received two dozen nominations while\nboosting global interest for The Boy and the Heron and Godzilla Minus One. I'm going to go off\nscript for a second because I just got to give a public round of applause to the 42West movie\npromotion team, The Boy and the Heron was a tremendous achievement to win an Oscar in the\nanimated motion picture category. I don't know if that's the first time or must be one of the first\ntimes that a movie that wasn't American won that category. To beat out Spiderman animated\nmovie was a real achievement, congratulations to that 42West team. And a separate team was\npromoting Godzilla Minus One, Best Visual Effects Oscar is what they won for. That entire\nTranscript Provided by\nmovie had a budget of $15 million, and I think every movie they were competing against had a\nvisual effects budget of bigger than $15 million. Tremendous job getting the academy to see the\nmovie and promoting the highlights of the visual effects. So great job 42West.\nMoving to Shore Fire. Shore Fire, which also continuously does great elite PR work, represented\nclients who collectively received nine Grammy awards and over two dozen nominations across\nvarious categories, showcasing its roster’s diversity in multiple genres. At major industry events\nthat recognize both film and music, each of 42West and Shore Fire Media regularly represent\ntheir clients. This was evident in Q4 and year-to-date with both agencies orchestrating over half a\ndozen PR campaigns for clients at The 2024 South by Southwest Film Festival a couple of weeks\nago. And they also achieved notable success at the 81st Golden Globes, contributing to clients\nsecuring multiple awards and receiving over a dozen nominations. Love it when our agencies\nwork together and have success at award shows like that.\nThe Door, switching to them, celebrated eight consecutive years representing the Food Network\nNew York City Wine & Food Festival presented by Capital One. Additionally, they added new\nclient Giadzy from Giada De Laurentiis, an Emmy-award winning television personality, a New\nYork Times bestselling cookbook author. What does she do? Restaurateur, entrepreneur. They\nadded Giadzy and Giada to its growing roster of elite culinary clients and lifestyle brands.\nSpecial shout out to Charlie and Lois who will come up on this call.\nOkay, now let's talk about The Digital Dept. I pointed out in our letter to shareholders in January\nthat this will be the subsidiary of focus for expansion during the next few quarters at least. We\nbelieve that there is such an opportunity in the marketplace to establish the first fully-scaled\ninfluencer management company with the ability to service brands and creators of all age groups\non all major social media platforms and in a variety of specialties. To that end, we had two major\nannouncements in Q1. First, The Digital Dept. brought in the influencer roster of Glowlab to\nintroduce a specialized talent management division catering to skincare experts and\ndermatologists, led by Glowlab's Founder, Susan Yara. Susan is an extremely successful skincare\ninfluencer herself, with her own YouTube channel, and she is also founder of Naturium, a\nskincare product line which was sold for the low, low price of $355 million to E.L.F. Beauty in\nSeptember 2023. I point that out because part of the strategy of inviting Susan and her roster to\njoin The Digital Dept. is to help us conceive and develop partnerships to launch skincare\nproducts in which we have an ownership stake. Obviously, Susan had a very successful exit\nherself in just over three years. In other words, Naturium launched in June of 2020 and was sold\nin September of 2023 for $355 million. It's also worth mentioning that Naturium’s marketing\nduring those three years was almost exclusively influencer marketing and PR, both of which are\nobviously strengths of Dolphin. I'll dispel any myth. We did not enter into the agreement with\nSusan to put James Carbonara as the face of a new skin care product line, but we are excited to\nlaunch skincare products.\nIn addition to bringing in Glowlab, The Digital Dept. also established a young adult division, YA\ndivision, as we call it, in partnership with the Osbrink Agency. This was also a highly strategic\nmove for us. You probably saw the announcement in February. Glowlab was back in January. It\nimmediately enhances our reach across TikTok and YouTube to complement our current strength\non Instagram, and it launches an entirely new age group of influencers for us, teens and young\nTranscript Provided by\nadults. We did so in partnership with the Osbrink Agency, which is Hollywood's premier talent\nagency for that age group. Cindy Osbrink, someone I'm proud to call a friend, the Founder of the\nOsbrink Agency is nothing short of a legend, having launched the careers of hundreds of young\nactors over the past 25 plus years, including Dakota and Elle Fanning, and literally dozens of\nlead actors across Nickelodeon, Disney Channel, and feature films.\nUnlike 25 years ago, or even more recently when we were producing movies and series for\nNickelodeon, there's now a thing called social media. I'm joking, of course. I'm sure you've heard\nof it and so many of those same talented teenagers and young adults of today have TikTok feeds\nand YouTube channels of their own. Simply put, we want to represent them and we want to\nintroduce them to brands and by partnering with the Osbrink Agency, we just saved years of\ndevelopment time for that division and went from zero to 60, maybe even to 100, in the snap of\nour fingers. We announced the partnership, as I said, last month, and we already have more than\nthree dozen of these young, talented social media stars on our roster, and we can't wait to\nintroduce them to our existing brand partners and to new brand partners we will meet who will\nwant to reach this important demographic.\nViewpoint Creative announced an extensive partnership with the Massachusetts State Lottery,\nspecializing in digital graphic design and animation services, and they also received congrats,\nDave and the team, four Muse Awards for extraordinary craft that shapes compelling narratives\nand leaves a lasting impact on audiences. And finally, Special Projects hit the ground running at\nDolphin. Partnering with the Academy Museum of Motion Pictures for its third annual gala and\ncontinued collaborations with the Wall Street Journal magazine's Innovator Awards, great job\nbooking Travis Kelce again and as the Talent Booking Partner and Entertainment Consultant for\nTown & Country's Annual Philanthropy Summit, which I attended, by the way, going off script\nagain, and a special shout out to Charlize Theron and the great work she's doing in her native\nSouth Africa. It was very impressive. They also collaborated with CHANEL, Gucci and\nValentino on their respective boutique openings and events during New York Fashion Week in\nFebruary, as well as an entire slate of events during Oscar’s week, which we'll highlight on our\nQ1 earnings call in six weeks. You got to save something, right?\nShifting gears, I'll now provide updates on some of our Ventures in which Dolphin and its\nshareholders participate. So I'm going to turn first to Blue Angels because what a week for that,\nright? As some may recall, Dolphin entered into a multi-year agreement to jointly finance the\ndevelopment and production of a slate of feature length documentaries for the global market. The\nfirst project greenlit was the Blue Angels. We announced it a couple years ago at the Cannes\nFilm Festival, developed and co-produced by J.J. Abrams and his company, Bad Robot\nProductions, and Glen Zipper and his company, Zipper Brothers Films.\nWe then announced that Amazon Studios had acquired worldwide rights to the Blue Angels,\nwherein we expected to generate approximately $3.75 million to Dolphin from the acquisition\nagreement, which would result in 75% ROI before the inclusion of any revenues to Dolphin from\nthe ticket sales from IMAX institutional theaters, providing powerful validation for our model of\nalso taking equity in projects we market. We're very excited for this film. It has turned out great,\nand so are our partners. Amazon secured an exclusive trailer debut and promotion on The Today\nShow last Wednesday. Thank you, our partners at Amazon. Very well reviewed clip that is\nTranscript Provided by\nextremely -- that type of promotion, by the way, for those curious, that is extremely rare for a\ndocumentary. I just ask any of you, when was the last time you saw a trailer drop or a\ndocumentary on a morning show? When you remember, please let me know.\nAnd let me tell you, the trailer has been a hit. Over 1.7 million views occurred in the first 24\nhours and, as of today, a week later, we're over 9 million views. I believe this has to be one of the\nhighest totals, if not the highest total, for documentary feature in the 28 years I've been in this\nbusiness. And of course, this does not count the number of times the trailer has been viewed\nahead of movies and theaters. IMAX has placed the trailer ahead of Ghostbusters in many\nlocations this past week, and it will be ahead of the Godzilla King Kong movie that premieres\ntonight in many locations across the country as well. This precedes the beginning of an exclusive\nrun in IMAX theater starting May 17. What do you do on May 17? I hope you go into the movie\ntheater seeing Blue Angels. It's a Friday, you'll love it. With availability for streaming on Prime\nVideo beginning May 23, right ahead of Memorial Day weekend.\nOur success with Blue Angels is the result of a deliberate strategy to create event documentaries\non subject matters you want to see in IMAX theaters. Putting an IMAX camera in a fighter jet\ncockpit and literally seeing the neighboring jet only twelve inches away, I cannot describe it.\nFingers crossed, we think we have something special, and the importance of a theatrical release\nin enhancing a film's value for streaming platforms cannot be overstated, given the pre-\nestablished audience awareness a theatrical release provides.\nOur deal with IMAX is significant for two main reasons. Firstly, it laid the groundwork for the\nrobust streaming sale, which has been extraordinary. Secondly, there's an annuity benefit due to\nIMAX's ownership of theaters and museums, and generally institutional theaters, as we call it.\nWe are eligible to showcase our film in IMAX institutional theaters six months after it premieres\non Amazon. This means that as of November 23, the film can be presented at the Smithsonian\nAviation Museum and an additional 150 theaters across America. This arrangement creates a\nsteady income stream and annuity, which is quite remarkable. I wanted to make sure everyone\nunderstands the significance of this. In terms of financials, we retain a high percentage of ticket\nsales, roughly 25%, since there's no distributor involved. For instance, in a theater with 200\nseats, each ticket sold at $10, that's $2,000 in revenue, from which we would earn $500. That's\njust from one showing in one theater, and there are 150 theaters in the country and 365 days in a\nyear. So considering the film's potential to run for part of or the entire year in various museums,\nthis is expected to continue for the next decade or two to come, given the scarcity of this type of\ncontent in institutional venues.\nFurthermore, with the version of the film being shown in institutional theaters being only 44\nminutes long versus the normal 90 minutes that we'll have on May 17 in traditional theaters, we\ncan fit in more showings per day. These details are crucial for stakeholders to understand the\nfinancial implication. You might ask, what's the value of the moving institutional theaters? And\nwhile it's challenging to specify an exact figure, we anticipate this could generate hundreds of\nthousands of dollars annually, if not more, contributing directly to the bottom line since the film\nhas already recouped its investment. So in addition to the 75% ROI from the streaming sale and\nour participation in ticket sales from the initial theatrical run beginning May 17, we also gained\nTranscript Provided by\nthis annuity post streaming run beginning in November. Very excited for Blue Angels, and if you\nhaven't seen the trailer yet, I hope you get a chance to check it out online right now.\nSwitching gears to Mastercard Midnight Theater. For those unfamiliar, Mastercard Midnight\nTheater is a state-of-the-art, contemporary variety theater and restaurant experience in the heart\nof Manhattan in a neighborhood dubbed Manhattan West. Dolphin is the managing member in\nthe venue and is responsible for the marketing of both the theater and the accompanying\nrestaurant. We have a meaningful ownership stake in Mastercard Midnight Theater as well. I’d\nsay it's been very gratifying to see the venue attracting high profile events and partnerships with\nmajor brands like Mastercard. The star studded premieres with Jessica Chastain, Pete Davidson,\nKaley Cuoco and Kevin Durant showcase the theater's ability to draw top talent and create\nexciting synergies with our PR firms.\nHowever, since our grand opening last September, and especially in the typically slower first\nquarter period, operations across the restaurant, the cafe downstairs and the theater have not met\nour expectations and as well understood that without a profitable restaurant is challenging to\nmake the venue successful. So we have prioritized our search for a new operator with a new\nrestaurant concept that can best attempt to revitalize the space going into the key summer and fall\nseasons. While there's no assurance that any deal will close, we have identified the group that we\nwould like to bring in and we are working hard to close a deal in the next few weeks.\nAcknowledging the challenges of the past six months and facing the uncertainty brought about\nby this potential change, or whether we can make a change at all, we decided to impair the asset\nvalue we had on our books, viewing it as an opportunity to reset and potentially avoid future\nfinancial overhangs.\nTurning to our newest venture, we are proud to share that Dolphin Entertainment has partnered\nwith renowned culinary personality and client Rachael Ray and the esteemed Do Good Spirits\nDistillery to launch Staple Gin. This collaboration brings together Rachael's culinary expertise,\nDo Good Spirits’ craftsmanship and Dolphins marketing prowess to create a unique and\npromising addition to the spirits market. Staple Gin is the result of Rachael Ray's passion for\ncreating flavorful experiences and her decades of culinary knowledge. The botanical recipe\ndeveloped by Rachael herself promises a balanced and intriguing flavor profile that reflects\nRachael’s signature style.\nOur subsidiary, The Door, which is represented Rachael Ray since 2008 and Charlie and Lois\nhave worked with her since 2005, has been instrumental in bringing this project to life. The\nDoor’s team has leveraged their extensive experience in marketing, wine, spirits and consumer\npackaged goods, as well as their long-standing relationships with culinary personalities and\nrestaurants to contribute to all stages of Staple Gin's development. From branding to marketing,\nPR and trade relations, The Door has played a crucial role in positioning Staple Gin for success.\nTo generate buzz in anticipation for the launch, Staple Gin made its first public debut at two\nprestigious events, the New York City Wine & Food Festival and the South Beach Wine & Food\nFestival. Rachael Ray herself was present at these events, pouring sips for attendees while Do\nGood Spirits mixed up the Staple Gin cocktails. The response from those who had the\nopportunity to taste Staple Gin has been overwhelmingly positive, further validating our\nconfidence in this new venture.\nTranscript Provided by\nStaple Gin is set to come to market here in Q2, initially in New York State at bars, restaurants\nand retail destinations, with plans to expand to additional markets in the future. We are thrilled to\nbe part of this collaboration and to utilize the full range of marketing and PR capabilities that\nDolphin Entertainment offers. We believe that Staple Gin has the potential to become a staple,\nno pun intended, that was too easy, right, in home bars and a go-to-choice for classic cocktails\nlike the gin and tonic or a perfect martini. We are incredibly excited about the potential of Staple\nGin and our partnership with Rachael Ray. She was just absolutely lovely.\nAs you may know, celebrity backed spirits brands have seen tremendous success in recent years;\njust look at the example of Ryan Reynolds' Aviation Gin exit of more than half a billion dollars\nand George Clooney's Tequila brand, which sold for a billion. Moreover, it was reported last\nmonth that the potential value of toying the Rock Johnson's Teremana Tequila may be\nsignificantly higher since it is moving over 170,000 cases per month, which is a staggering\nnumber; good for him. So as you can see in success, big numbers are possible with celebrity\nbacked liquors; may we be as lucky. While we can't promise the same results, of course, we\nbelieve we are playing in the same space and have the marketing expertise to give Staple Gin the\nbest possible chance for success.\nAnd I just want to add that our fantastic team at The Door, and again, Charlie really\nspearheading this, has its own share of experience and success stories in the space. Working with\nliquor brands from creation through successful exit, including recent examples of Jefferson's\nBourbon, which sold to Pernod Ricard in 2019, and 21 Seeds Tequila, which sold to Diageo in\n2022. So we're not exactly foreign to the journey and, as many of you know, our company is\nalways looking for innovative ways to leverage our marketing experience and expertise and\ncreate value for our shareholders. The Staple Gin partnership is a perfect example of this strategy\nand action, and I want to emphasize that this venture, like many of our other ventures, does not\nrequire any capital expenditure from Dolphin. We anticipate this will be the first of many\nVentures in the alcoholic beverage phase for Dolphin, and we expect to pursue similar deal\nstructures in the future where we provide our marketing services in exchange for a share of the\nupside without capital investment.\nAs we continue to pursue these types of ventures, we believe the economic benefits at Dolphin\nwill be substantial. We look forward to sharing more details on the Staple Gin partnership and\nour other upcoming ventures in the spirit space. We believe this is an exciting new area of\ngrowth for Dolphin and we are well-positioned to create significant value for our shareholders\nthrough our marketing expertise and innovative deal structures. There will be much more to\ncome on Staple Gin on our Q1 earnings call.\nOkay, those are some highlights about our Ventures division and circling back then, in summary,\nin Q4 Dolphin Entertainment achieved record quarterly revenue of $12 million and positive\nadjusted operating income of $300,000, despite the impact of twin industry strikes for the first\ntime in over 60 years. All of our subsidiaries secured high-profile clients and partnerships, and\nwe also acquired Special Projects. That's the highlight of the quarter for me, which completes the\noriginal vision of what we now call the Super Group. And lastly, with Special Projects added to\nthe fold, we have positioned the company and our shareholders for upside from all three\nTranscript Provided by\ncategories of Dolphin Ventures; content, consumer products and live events. The first piece of\ncontent, the Blue Angels documentary, hits theaters in six weeks and is already profitable from\nour sale of streaming rights to Amazon Prime, where it debuts on May 23, as I mentioned. For\nthe consumer product category, we have Staple Gin hitting the market here in Q2 and we\ncouldn't be more excited. And for the live events category, we are actively ideating with Special\nProjects, Nicole and Andrea and expect to be able to announce the idea for our first owned event\nby the end of this year or in early 2025. All of these ventures will leverage our marketing\nexpertise and we expect the majority of them, like Staple Gin, will not require capital investment\nfrom us. So for all of these reasons, Dolphin Entertainment is well-positioned for growth and\nsuccess. We believe focusing on creating shareholder value through innovative partnerships and\ndeal structures while running a sustainable operating company focused on generating increasing\nadjusted operating income.\nThank you for your continued support and I now turn it over to Mirta.\nMirta Negrini - Chief Financial Officer & Chief Operating Officer, Dolphin\nEntertainment, Inc.\nThank you, Bill, and good afternoon everyone. I will now discuss financial results. Total revenue\nfor the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2023 was $12 million, an increase of 8% over the\nsame period in prior year. Adjusted operating income, as defined in our earnings release, for the\nthree months ended December 31, 2023 was approximately $300,000 as compared to adjusted\noperating income of approximately $100,000 for the three months ended December 31, 2022.\nOperating expenses for the three months ended December 31, 2023 were approximately $20\nmillion, including approximately $8.3 million of non-cash or non-recurring expenses, compared\nto $14.1 million of operating expenses for the three months ended December 31, 2022, including\napproximately $3.1 million of non-cash or non-recurring expenses. Operating expenses for the\nquarter ended December 31, 2023 are composed of direct costs, payroll and benefits, selling,\ngeneral and administrative expenses, acquisition costs, goodwill, impairment costs, depreciation\nand amortization, write-off of notes receivable, and legal and professional fees.\nDirect costs for the quarter ended December 31, 2023 were approximately $300,000, compared\nto approximately $600,000 for the quarter ended December 31, 2022. Payroll costs were\napproximately $8.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2023, compared to approximately $8 million\nin the fourth quarter of 2022. SG&A expenses were approximately $2.4 million in the fourth\nquarter of 2023, compared to $1.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. Acquisition costs were\napproximately $100,000 in the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to $200,000 in the fourth quarter\nof 2022. During the fourth quarter of 2023, we impaired goodwill by approximately $3 million\nas compared to $900,000 impaired in the fourth quarter of 2022. Legal and professional fees\nwere approximately $500,000 in the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to $600,000 in the fourth\nquarter of 2022.\nOperating loss and net loss for the quarter ended December 31, 2023 of approximately $8 million\nand $9.6 million, respectively, include non-cash or non-recurring items of approximately $8.3\nmillion and $9 million, respectively. These include a $3 million impairment of goodwill,\nTranscript Provided by\napproximately $600,000 of depreciation and amortization, $400,000 of bad debt write-off,\n$100,000 of acquisition costs, and write off of our notes receivable in Midnight Theatre in the\namount of approximately $4.1 million. The net loss also includes losses from equity investments\nof approximately $700,000. This compares to an operating loss and net loss for the quarter ended\nDecember 31, 2022 of $3 million and $3.3 million, respectively, which included non-cash and\nnon-recurring items from depreciation and amortization of $500,000, $900,000 of goodwill\nimpairment, $200,000 of acquisition costs, and $1.4 million of changes in the fair value of\ncontingent consideration. Net loss also included approximately $100,000 in losses from equity\ninvestments and affiliates.\nLoss per share was $0.54 per share based on 17,632,822 weighted average shares outstanding for\nboth basic loss per share and fully diluted loss per share for the three months ended December\n31, 2023. Loss per share was $0.29 per share based on 11,256,578 weighted average shares\noutstanding for basic and fully diluted loss per share for the three months ended December 31,\n2022. Cash and cash equivalents of $6.4 million as of December 31, 2023, as compared to $6.1\nmillion as of December 31, 2022.\nThat concludes my financial remarks. I will now ask the operator to open the phone lines for\nquestions. Operator, would you please poll for questions?\nOperator\nCertainly. Thank you. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Allen Klee with\nMaxim. Please proceed.\nQ: Good afternoon. Congratulations on the quarter. Starting off with 42West and you mentioned\nthat despite headwinds from the two strikes, you still performed well. How do you think about\nhow that business will normalize in 2024 and maybe how much of the headwinds there were in\n2023 and maybe how much might go away in 2024 if you had?\nBill O'Dowd - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Dolphin Entertainment, Inc.\nSure and thanks, Allen, for the kind words. Yeah, we feel we had a great quarter, too. Well, the\nwriter strike that started in May didn't really -- wasn't as impactful to our business. The actors\nstrike that started in July was very impactful to our business because actors weren't allowed to\npromote movies, so the studio had double whammy on us because some of the actors took hiatus.\nThey had nothing to promote, they weren't allowed to promote, so they went on hiatus from our\ntalent division. But then our movie division, many of the studio films and independent films that\nwere going to be released in the fall were pushed till 2024. It pushed everything back. So if I'm\njust being honest, it's a little remarkable to me that the fourth quarter finished as well as it did,\nalmost a million dollars more than any previous quarter of the company, because so much of our\njuggernaut movie business was pushed out. Obviously, nobody wants to release a movie if the\nactors in the movie can't promote it, right. So even though the strikes ended in November, many\nof those movies that pushed out of the fall, September through December weren't even put into\nthe theaters in January or in Q1. It'll probably fully normalize by the end of Q2 is my guess, and\nTranscript Provided by\nwe're doing fine. The impact is lessening every month, but it was an impact in Q4 and very\nproud of the team for the results against those headwinds.\nQ: That's great. For The Digital Dept., fourth quarter is usually the seasonally strongest. Can you\ntalk about how you felt about the performance in the quarter and then with the addition of Glow\nand YA, how do you -- can those be meaningful contributors to the department and the company\noverall in 2024, in your view?\nBill O'Dowd - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Dolphin Entertainment, Inc.\nYes. I'll go nowhere. You asked the questions, but a resounding yes on the second one. Yeah,\nDigital Dept. had a strong Q4. They hit their goal. I'm also proud of that team, too. Ali Grant,\nSarah Boyd, Kirsten Weinberg, Belinda Strom [Phonetic], because we merged them, Be Social\nand Socialyte, in September. That's a heavy lift. Anybody that tells you differently just has never\ndone the process, and it's a big distraction to management. And they -- we really wanted it to be\ndone in September because going into that fourth quarter, which is the heavy selling season, you\ndidn't want that hanging over your head, and you certainly didn't want to do a merger in Q4 and\nrebrand the company. And so they did all of that work and then still maintained a very steady\nship in Q4; very happy with the results of The Digital Dept. at the end of the year there. Going\nforward, I really tried to make it an emphasis and kind of signal to the market that this is an\nemphasis for us, is the growth of The Digital Dept. because it has so much growth potential. I've\ntalked about it on many previous earnings calls. We're starting to realize that, the growth now,\nbecause Glowlab, as an example, that's when you bring in a team. And Susan Yara built a nice\nlittle influencer marketing company with 15 dermatologists or so, and that just immediately\nestablishes a skincare group and brands pay big for credible, authentic voices in that space, and\nwe think there's room to grow in that space. The beauty category in general, skincare is a big\ncomponent, but hair care is even bigger. Cosmetics is a separate category. Just to give you a\nsense of how big this could get for us and we're excited to expand that group by itself. And then I\nmade a point to mention that Susan created a product, launched it in COVID, and sold it three\nyears later for a great exit, because she's living proof of what we're trying to do with our\nVentures. And skincare is going to be one of the two pillars, and beauty and cosmetics generally,\nas well beauty category broadly, will be one of the two pillars for us, along with liquor, where\nwe feel like once we get it up and running, we can be launching a product a year. So it was a\nhighly strategic move for us to bring Susan and her group in, and very blessed about that. That\nwill be immediate revenue. There are 15 influencers, that's immediate revenue for us, plug and\nplay.\nIn the YA space, thankfully, for that partnership with Osbrink, because while we very much\nwanted to add teens and young adults to The Digital Dept., if we had built it one influencer at a\ntime, hire in a manager and do that, it could have taken us no less than a year, probably closer to\n18 months, to 24 months, just to have a viable roster of ten or twelve working clients that are\nmeaningful in that space. With Osbrink, we feel like we just represent that roster for digital.\nOvernight, you've got two dozen teens and young adults that are on TV shows or movies, and it's\njust such an advantage because they all have social profiles too. So we're excited to be able to\nstart monetizing that probably in earnest here in Q2 as we put the roster together between\nFebruary and March, I'd say that's the timing of those two and when they'd have an impact.\nTranscript Provided by\nQ: Thank you. One follow up on The Digital Dept., and this is -- I don't know how you answer\nthis or what the probability is, but our government's talking about potentially maybe banning\nTikTok or making it harder for them to operate here. How do you think about that? Like, if that\nhappened, it's probably -- well, I don't know how to put out, but how do you think about if that\nhappened or what impact that might have?\nBill O'Dowd - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Dolphin Entertainment, Inc.\nWell, for us -- yeah, I take no position on whether it will or won't, as you gather, too, I don't\nknow, but it'll really come down to individual creators. Let me back up. The Digital Dept. has\nthree divisions. We manage individual talent and take a percentage of their revenue. We have a\nbrands division where we represent brands and design influencer marketing campaigns for them\nand execute them, and we have an events division. On the events division, platforms don't impact\nus. On the brand side, the brands will just adapt and shift their ad dollars from a TikTok\ncampaign to an Instagram campaign or a YouTube campaign, and we'd be managing it anyway.\nIt won't have an impact. On the talent side, there will be some talent out there in the world that\nare only on TikTok or primarily on TikTok that will be impacted because they'll have to transfer\ntheir following over, most likely to either, well, most likely YouTube as a video platform, and\nthat may take some time or for their followers to move over with them. But in today's world,\ntime might be a day, four days. But fortunately for The Digital Dept., we're weighted heavily on\na platform but that platform is Instagram, and what we want to do with moves like this YA roster\nis diversify and get a little bit more balanced with TikTok and YouTube, and if there is no\nTikTok, then YouTube and whatever comes next. Fortunately, it shouldn't have much of an\nimpact on us at all if TikTok goes away.\nQ: Thank you. And I'm excited about Blue Angels coming out, as a lot of people are. I'm curious\nif it looks like the time that it'll be in the IMAX theaters is shorter than what I thought. Was there\na different thinking of how long it would be in IMAX versus then going to Prime?\nBill O'Dowd - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Dolphin Entertainment, Inc.\nWell, that's not that -- and I apologize we could have made that clearer, Allen. It's not that it\nleaves theaters; it's just that it's only in theaters for that first week and then it can continue its run.\nAnd I understand Amazon at first was debating is it a July 4 release or a Memorial Day release?\nAnd Memorial Day weekend is such, it's the kickoff of movie watching and movie going, and\nit'll be on top of mind for everybody. It's generally the kickoff of the summer season, right, not\nthat some of the Avengers movies didn't come out earlier and some of the big temples are again\nthis year. So they just didn't want to lose the Memorial Day weekend for their opportunity as\nwell. So we certainly understand that that's the weekend we premiered Top Gun two years ago.\nMay fighter jets be in Vogue again this Memorial Day. And the Blue Angels themselves have\nsome high profile shows in real life over that weekend as well. So we know we can promote the\nsugar out of this film on that weekend. So the thought was launch it exclusively in IMAX May\n17, let it run as long as it intends to run in other theaters potentially, too, after that first week\nwhen it's only available on IMAX but then have Amazon be able to have viewership numbers\nthat capture that type of excitement around the film.\nTranscript Provided by\nQ: That explains it well, thank you. And then with IMAX, how are you thinking about maybe\nthe next partnership, the next movie? Is that likely a 2025 event or how do you think about that?\nBill O'Dowd - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Dolphin Entertainment, Inc.\nYeah, we think so, too, Allen. Yes, we do think that way. Shockingly, as I'm sure for yourself,\nbig surprise, you're not the first person to ask; oh, man, this is so great, what's next. And we're\nexcited to hopefully share what the next partner movie with IMAX will be as soon as we can.\nYou can imagine with this, and there's no shortage of people looking to partner because maybe\nit's going -- maybe to go back a step, it's worth noting, too, I think I said it on those earnings calls\nwhen we formed this partnership, I'm unaware there is -- to my knowledge, there's no other deal\nin the market -- in the industry where there's a guaranteed theatrical release for a documentary.\nAnd with IMAX and Dolphin, we're both thinking about how can we bring something new to the\nmarketplace and this idea of, for lack of a better word, big spectacle documentaries, we're going\nto have to come up with a catchy phrase for that, but like, with Super Group, but the idea of Blue\nAngels or something like that in IMAX, This is Not Your Father's Oldsmobile, it's not your\nfather's true crime documentary, it's theatrical. It's big and this movie delivers on that promise.\nIt's a great first movie in that slate. So when you've got a hit out of the gate and you've got\nsomething different like that, then it's really just a matter of choosing what do you want that next\nbig one to be that hopefully you don't suffer a sophomore slump, right and it's as eye grabbing as\nseeing fighter jets twelve inches apart from a camera that's twelve inches apart, not from the\nground, right. So, yeah, we think that we'll have an announcement, obviously, this year for what\ncould either be filmed or released in 2025 and start getting to a regular cadence with it.\nQ: That's great. Thank you. For Mastercard Midnight Theater and Hidden Leaf, your comments\nthere of looking to change the venue of Midnight -- of Hidden Leaf. When you're saying that\ndidn't perform to expectations, were you referring just to the restaurant or the restaurant and\nMastercard Midnight Theater?\nBill O'Dowd - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Dolphin Entertainment, Inc.\nWell, we really do want to try and bring in an operator for the restaurant. You know, it's very\nhard to have a successful venue, including theater, if the restaurant's not hitting its goals. And so\nit's an opportunity to kind of re-conceptualize and maybe bring in a bigger operator, especially\nbecause you're coming out of the historically slow Q1. Restaurants in Manhattan and anywhere\nin the northern city don't do as well in the winter as they would in the summer or fall, right, so\npeople just don't go out as much, so it felt like the right time to put in a new concept, if we can.\nSo that's why we've prioritized the search and we are talking to groups and actively now to see if\nwe can come up with a new concept for the key summer and fall seasons. Now, there's no\nassurance that a deal will close, but we have identified the first group that we'd like to bring in\nand working hard to close a deal in the next few weeks.\nQ: That's great. Okay, I'll just finish up quick with a few financial questions. I know you haven't\ngiven guidance. Are you able to give anything qualitatively if you think you might be able to\ngrow revenue? And if so, what would be the drivers to that?\nTranscript Provided by\nBill O'Dowd - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Dolphin Entertainment, Inc.\nSure. Well, I'm happy we beat our beloved analyst expectations for Q4, so we hope to be able to\ndo that again here in Q1 and the two drivers, which won't come as a surprise, given our prepared\nremarks for the last three years, right. Each year we've added a new member of our group, it\nexponentially increases the amount of collaborations that can occur, right. I think Tim Johnson\nfrom Bard pointed out to me the mathematical formula to it. When you only have one company,\nyou can't cross sell with anybody and when you have two, it can only go in two directions, but by\nthe time you get to three, there's like six different strings to the Spiderweb. Well, now we're up to\neffectively six marketing companies and an operating film production division. So we're\nexponentially more intricate and Special Projects plugs in beautifully as an additional offering.\nThere's been, oh, goodness, I think, no less than half a dozen introductions to potential new\nclients for Special Projects in the last week or two alone. I attended one of them and it was\nextremely well received. So the idea to organically grow our subsidiaries through cross-selling\nand through new introductions is just very, very real. And that's why we wanted a live event\ncompany that comes out of Hollywood instead of, let's say, a non-entertainment live event\ncompany, because Special Projects, when they're doing the Motion Picture Academy, the Oscars\npeople, right, they're gala, and that's a direct hit to somebody calling card for any number of\npeople that 42West could introduce them to. So, organic growth will be strong, we feel, but then\nnow look where we are with our Ventures, we've talked about it for a couple of years, but now\nwe have all the pieces in place to have a really strong pipeline of Ventures.\nQ2 is going to be pretty big. That next earnings call, May 15, we think we're having a strong Q1.\nWe have a film coming out two days later from May 15. We'll have a liquor in market probably\nby the time we're on the call, in which case they want to give a sample to everybody on the call\nright. So it's happening. Now we're moving to the point where these earnings calls are giving\nupdates on those types of opportunities for Dolphin. Each one of those can represent very large\nrevenue exits in time or immediate, like Blue Angels, and that will certainly be jolts of growth\nthat we just didn't have in past years as we were building this group, right. And we have a couple\nof them in May, we might have those two and a couple more later in the year and soon you're\ntrying to keep everybody abreast of hopefully six, eight, ten, 12 ventures in a couple of years,\nand that's very exciting for us.\nQ: Great. Okay, that's it for me. Thank you very much.\nBill O'Dowd - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Dolphin Entertainment, Inc.\nAnd to springboard off that one idea too, Allen, I'm sorry, I should have said too on The Digital\nDept., we announced Susan Yara and Glowlab in January. We announced the YA in February.\nWe don't think we're done. So let's see if there's another announcement or two this year and\nthere's just so much growth in new spaces for The Digital Dept. And each of those, they're not as\nbig as a Blue Angels or heaven forbid, a successful Staple Gin with Rachael Ray, but they're\nmeaningful and they could launch new businesses for us as well. So there'll be some\nannouncements on that front as well, too we think. So, thank you for your time and questions,\nAllen.\nTranscript Provided by\nQ: Thank you.\nOperator\nOkay, we have no further questions in queue. I will now turn the call over to Bill O'Dowd for\nclosing remarks.\nBill O'Dowd - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Dolphin Entertainment, Inc.\nWell, thank you. Thank you everyone, for listening. It's nice to be here at the 10-K for 2023. I'll\nreiterate, welcome to Special Projects. It's a company that has, in a short period of time, grown to\nbe very special in my heart. I just think the world of Nicole and Andrea and their entire team. I'd\nshout them all down by name if I was given the time, right. Very high quality people, very strong\nworkers, and they built a beautiful company. So excited for what will come with Special\nProjects, which will be more of a feature of these calls probably in the second half of the year.\nOverall, obviously, the company's got a little bit of a buzz about it, a little bit of a swagger, given\nBlue Angels and the drop of the trailer and the fact that it's in theaters in just a few weeks and the\nQ1 earnings call, the duking out between what we lead with either Blue Angels or Rachael’s gin,\nand some updates on both of those fronts. Thank you, everybody, for joining today and thank\nyou for the journey. I know it's a Thursday night before a holiday weekend, but we couldn't be\nmore excited for the company and look forward to the next call. So thank you all very much.\nOperator\nThis concludes today's conference, and you may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you\nfor your participation.\nTranscript Provided by"

Bill, please proceed.\nWilliam O’Dowd – CEO, Dolphin Entertainment, Inc.\nThanks, James. And hi, everyone, and good afternoon. And thank you for joining us today. As\nalways, we'll start with a review of some financial and operating highlights, followed by a full\nfinancial review and then open it up for Q&A. So from a financial highlights perspective,\nrevenue for Q3 was $10.2 million or an increase of 3% year-over-year. I'm very proud of the\nteam at Dolphin, which achieved this increase in revenue despite enduring two prolonged\nindustry-wide strikes and the distraction of an internal merger for essentially the entire quarter.\nOn the bottom line, our Q3 operating loss of $2.1 million includes approximately $1.2 million in\nnoncash charges.\nThus, the cash operating loss was approximately $900,000. We believe if it were not for the\nimpact of the two strikes and the onetime costs associated with the internal merger of our\ninfluencer marketing subsidiaries, be social and social it to create the digital department, we\nwould have achieved a cash operating profit in Q3. And that would have been without the benefit\nof special projects, which we acquired at the start of Q4. Thus, going forward, once the industry\nresumes normal operations post strikes and with the addition of the revenues and profits of\nspecial projects, we expect to have consistent cash operating profits. The effects of the strikes\nwill be felt into Q1 as many movies and TV series have already been pushed out of 2023 and\ninto the spring and summer of next year. But make no mistake, the industry is excited to get back\nto work and Dolphin has not been sitting idle.\nQuite contrary, as we have achieved the following highlights all since our last earnings call in the\nmiddle of August. First, as I just mentioned, we created a market-leading influencer marketing\nagency, the digital department by merging Social and social life. Second, we hosted the grand\nopening of Midnight Theater, now open seven days a week and signed our multiyear partnership\nwith Blue Chip marketer, Mastercard. And third, we completed our 7-year journey to build an\nentertainment marketing earned media Super Group with the acquisition of the best-in-class\ntalent booking and celebrity live event firm special projects. We believe each of these is a\ncatalyst for our company in its own right, and I'll spend a few words on each. And as an aside, on\na personal note, I can unequivocally say that this run post Labor Day has been the busiest period\nof my entire career, just one big ticket item after another. Okay. So first, the merger be social and\nsocial life to create the digital department. I'll be brief on this topic since we alluded to it coming\nin September at length during our Q2 earnings call. The short-term pain of management\ndistractions in both cash and intangible costs are all behind us now, and we've assembled a\nbeautiful company that is a platform for us in the fastest-growing area of marketing that we\nknow. The launch events we hosted for our talent and brand partners in New York and Los\nAngeles were nothing short of electric. The New York event was at Midnight Theater, I might\nadd.\nThe incoming calls to work with the digital department are exactly what we hoped for, and the\nexcitement about its expansion prospects is comparable. There's just tremendous momentum,\nboth internally and externally around building what we think will be the flagship influencer\nTranscript Provided by\nmarketing agency in the country out of the entertainment space. Simply put, the digital\ndepartment will be a strong growth catalyst amongst our core businesses as we add new verticals\nof expertise. Right now, we are market leaders in female-focused fashion, beauty, wellness and\nlifestyle products with Instagram as our major platform of choice.\nWe have several well-known reality television personalities on a roster of more than 200\nexclusive talent. From this base, we plan to expand to include several new verticals such as\nsports, culinary, teens and young adults, reaching broader audiences on both TikTok and\nYouTube to complement Instagram. Just the sports vertical alone could in success, we believe,\ngrow to be as big as our entire business today. Much more to come on this in the quarters ahead.\nNext, I'll turn to the midnight theater. As a reminder, Dolphin manages all aspects of publicity\nand marketing for Midnight Theatre and its restaurant hidden leaf while also facilitating talent\nand commercial relationships within the entertainment and culinary industries.\nDolphin also holds a meaningful ownership stake in Venture. The headline here is our new\nmultiyear partnership with Mastercard. Obviously, this is the bluest of blue-chip partners for any\nperformance venue. Guests will have the opportunity of taking new immersive experiences,\nexclusive events, special discounts, all tailored exclusively for Mastercard cardholders.\nMoreover, the venue will now be known as Mastercard Midnight Theatre with the financial\nindustry powerhouse's name prominently featured. We are confident that this long-term support\nfrom such a prominent player in the financial industry substantially elevates the intrinsic value of\nthis cutting-edge destination. For anyone new to Dolphin, Midnight Theatre is located in\nManhattan West in New York, between ninth and 10th Avenues. The same streets between 31st\nand 33rd like Penn Station or Madison Square Garden, just one avenue over and it's inside\nBrookfield's $4.5 billion complex, the largest in Brookfield's history. We are the only\nentertainment venue there. We have a theater and a restaurant on the same floor, all under one\nroof, if you will. We went to seven days a week, four days after we merged the influencer\nagencies, and 11 days before we acquired special projects with a full programming schedule and\nevents throughout the fall. And we've already started booking 2024, which includes\ninternationally renowned Magician, Joshua Jay, who is bringing, Look closer, a new Magic show\nto Midnight Theatre in February. He'll be performing 16 shows, including two shows on\nValentine's Day.\nI'm going to highlight this particular show because of the quality of the performer who is looking\nto call Midnight Theatre home. So Josh Jay return to New York City 4 years after its critically\nacclaimed show 6 impossible things, sold out its entire 18-month off Broadway run. As a\nmagician, Joshua Jay has performed its original work on the Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon,\nthe Late Late Show with James Corden, and even successfully fooled Penn & Teller on Fool Us.\nI can hear James Carbonara multitasking and pulling up midnightheater.com to buy Valentine's\nDay tickets right now. Let's just say I'm happy for Mirta, his lovely wife, who doesn't have to\nplan it this year. Okay. So now we're up to the acquisition of Special Projects.\nThis company is very special to all of us at Dolphin since it represents the culmination of that 7-\nyear journey to build our entertainment marketing Super Group. We'll begin with the speech at\nLD Micro in December of 2016 and was followed by the acquisition of 42 West on March 30,\n2017, and the uplisting to NASDAQ in December of 2017, 1 year after the speech at LD Micro\nTranscript Provided by\nhas now finished after buying one company a year since, with two in 2018, I should add. And it\nwould be hard-pressed to think of any company more strategic for our group than Special\nProjects. So first, some particulars.\nSpecial Projects was founded by Nicole Vecchiarelli and Andrea Oliveri, two former magazine\neditors, who met working at Condonast. They have built the entertainment industry's go-to talent\nbooking and celebrity curated live of that company, period. They have offices in both New York\nand Los Angeles and simply handle a wide variety of signature events, from the Wall Street\nJournal's Innovator Awards held with the Met every year, with this year's honorees two weeks\nago, including Martin Scorsese and Kylie Jenner among others, to the Motion Picture Academy\nMuseum Gala in Los Angeles coming up in a few weeks and said to honor Merrill Street, Oprah\nWinfrey, Sophia Copa, Michael B. Jordan along with a few surprises. Too bad they couldn't get\nany big names, right? Their client list is A++ from retainer clients like Apple and Chanel, the\nproject-based clients like A24, Amazon, the Apollo Theater, Bumble, GQ, Louis Vuitton, Max\nMara, Meta, Netflix, Stella McCartney, Versace, ES. Laurence and YouTube. Anyone who has\nheard our story before today knows that ideating and executing world-class events is a big part of\nDolphin's future. First, let's just take a look at our core business. Just with the business that our\nPR firms are already doing, we have so many opportunities for cross-selling. Every movie or\nstreaming series that brought to us is promoting is a potential candidate for a premier event\nhandled by Special Projects.\nEvery hotel or restaurant opening the door is promoting, is a potential candidate for a launch\nevent handled by Special Projects. Every single or album drop that shore Fire is promoting is an\nopportunity to create a release party handled by Special Projects. Any consumer product being\nhandled by any one of our PR firms is a potential beneficiary or sponsor of an event handled by\nSpecial Projects. So by the way, this is an immediately accretive acquisition for us. Special\nProjects is a very well-run profitable business with a great margin, and we think we can grow\nthem very well in the next 12, 24 months with all the synergies I just mentioned. And when we\nlook at Dolphin Ventures, we talk about receiving ownership stakes in exchange for our services\nand promoting three categories of assets; content, consumer products, and live events. Thus,\nideating and executing world-class events is a big part of Dolphin's future and adding special\nprojects immediately catapults us into the industry-leading position.\nAnd needless to say, after hearing that client roster, the reputations and relationships of Andrea\nand Nicole in our industry are simply unmatched. So, Andrea, Nicole, and Special Projects have\nfinished our super group. I've talked about how to some. This may seem like it's a finish line. For\nus at Dolphin, we see it as the starting line. We now have our full team assembled. And by the\nway, eight acquisitions from only eight offers. What's that tell you? We got our first choice of\ncompanies in every vertical of entertainment marketing we want to be in. We've assembled our\ndream team. Now we're excited to show what we can do together.\nWith these accomplishments, we believe Dolphin is in its strongest position in company history\nwith highly diversified revenue sources across seven operating subsidiaries and expectations of\ncash operating profits in 2024. As we look ahead to next year, a landscape of promising\nopportunities within Dolphin Entertainment and Dolphin Ventures awaits, beginning with the\nrelease of and the revenues from the Blue Angels, the first project in our multiyear agreement\nTranscript Provided by\nwith IMAX. Also, we believe the aforementioned multiyear partnership with Mastercard and\nMidnight Theatre validates our investment by indicating the value placed on our venue by the\nmarket. Both our IMAX partnership and our Midnight Theatre venue are just getting started. And\neach of them are ahead of other Dolphin ventures that we are equally excited about and are\nworking hard to realize in 2024. In short, we believe we've weathered the unique storm of this\npast summer and early fall. Looking ahead, after successfully navigating these temporary\nheadwinds, and after our successful at-the-market raise, no discount, no warrants of two weeks\nago, we find ourselves on stable footing and with the full amount of our targeted cash reserves.\nWe are very confident in our sustainable path forward. We believe that this sends a strong\nmessage to our current microcap market, which we expect will reward positive free cash flow,\nunderlining our strategy for creating significant near-term shareholder value. With that said, I'll\nturn it over to Mirta.\nMirta Negrini – CFO, Dolphin Entertainment, Inc.\nThank you, Bill, and good afternoon, everyone. I will now discuss results for the quarter ended\nSeptember 30, 2023. Total revenue for the third quarter ended September 30, 2023, increased by\n3% to $10.2 million compared to the third quarter ended September 30, 2022. The Overall,\noperating expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2023, were approximately $12.3\nmillion compared to approximately $11 million for the three months ended September 30, 2022.\nOperating expenses are composed of direct costs, payroll and benefits, selling general and\nadministrative expenses, acquisition costs, depreciation and amortization, impairment of\nintangible assets and legal and professional fees. Direct costs for the quarter ended September\n30, 2023, were $185,308 compared to $837,429 for the quarter ended September 30, 2022.\nPayroll costs were approximately $8.4 million in the third quarter of 2023 compared to $7\nmillion in the third quarter of 2022.\nFT&A expenses were $2.1 million in Q3 of 2023 compared to $1.7 million in Q3 of last year.\nLegal and professional fees were $695,188 in Q3 of 2023 compared to $774,613 in Q3 of 2022.\nOperating loss for Q3 of 2023 of $2.1 million includes noncash items of over $1.2 million. Net\nloss for Q3 of 2023 of $3.9 million includes noncash items of approximately $2.4 million. The\nnoncash items included in operating losses consist of nonrecurring $341,417 impairment of the\ntrade name of the social and social light upon combining to become the digital department.\n$535,740 of depreciation and amortization and $311,578 of bad debt expense related to the\nwrite-off of our investment in Crafthouse Cocktails.\nNet loss for Q3 of 2023 also includes the nonrecurring write-off of our investment in Crafthouse\nCocktails of approximately $1.2 million reported under the caption equity and losses of\nunconsolidated affiliates. This compares to an operating loss and net loss for the quarter ended\nSeptember 30, 2022, of $1.1 million and $1.3 million, respectively, which include noncash items\nfrom depreciation and amortization of $415,836.\nLoss per share was $0.27 per share based on 14,121,275 weighted average shares outstanding\nfrom both basic loss per share and fully diluted loss per share for the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023. Loss per share was $0.14 per share based on 9,664,681 weighted average\nshares outstanding for basic and 9,793,715 weighted average shares outstanding, and a fully\nTranscript Provided by\ndiluted loss per share basis for the three months ended September 30, 2022. Cash and cash\nequivalents of $6.4 million as of September 30, 2023, as compared to $6.1 million as of\nDecember 31, 2022, and does not include an October 31, 2023, underwritten public offering of\n1.4 million shares of our common stock at a price of $1.65 per share. That concludes my\nfinancial remarks. I will now ask the operator to open the phone line for Q&A. Operator, would\nyou please poll for questions?\nOperator\n[Operator Instructions]. And we'll take our first question from Allen Klee from Maxim Group.\nQ: Congratulations on all the positive events. I'd like to start with Blue Angels and the IMAX\npartnership. What's your best guess on when this goes into theaters? And how do you think about\nwhen you get paid for that and for Amazon? And then when you might consider the second\nmovie that you do in partnership with them.\nWilliam O’Dowd – CEO, Dolphin Entertainment, Inc.\nSure. Yes, this is obviously a hot topic with folks that have followed our story because it's a great\nsuccess story for us, the Blue Angels. We expect to have that in theaters probably Q2, Allen. We\nexpect to deliver the movie maybe even close to year-end here, but probably Q1, early Q1. We\nrecognized the revenue in Q1 then and would expect to receive the cash almost entirely by the\nend of Q1 or into Q2 if delivery occurs in January. As I mentioned, the revenue is recognized\nupon delivery of the film or 90% of it is. So I think then as people knew the story might find of\ninterest, we sold the film in what's called the second window, meaning after it's in theaters with\nIMAX, it will go on Amazon Prime. And we expect it to generate more than a 75% return on\ninvestment for us just from the sales we've already made. So that doesn't count any revenue share\nfrom the ticket sales in IMAX theaters or any theaters. So it was a home run first project in our\nslate with a multiyear slate with IMAX. In terms of the second project in that slate actively being\ndiscussed right now, I think I may have mentioned in our last earnings call, we hope to have an\nannouncement to make before the end of this year, but it may trickle into the first quarter just\nbecause it's hard to follow up a mega hit like that. We're actively looking for one that we can be\nin production on next year.\nQ: Okay. So here's a question that somebody asked me to ask you, so I'd ask it now before I\nforget. Do you make a bunch of announcements of your various firms of their clients winning\nawards? And the question is, do you get paid more when one of your clients wins an award?\nWilliam O’Dowd – CEO, Dolphin Entertainment, Inc.\nYes. And that's one of the reasons why we do it. We frame it as we are congratulating our\nsubsidiary or congratulating the clients as they deserve to be congratulated when you handle 25\nGrammy nominations or 99 nominations, whatever, or however many Oscar nominations won.\nBut the benefit of that also is that typically how awards campaigns work is that you get paid a\nretainer each month while you're running the campaign and oftentimes in certain industries, you\nTranscript Provided by\nget a bonus upon receiving a nomination at all. And by the way, then it extends your run, right?\nBecause if you're nominated, you keep the monthly retainer or the award ceremony.\nSo you might have gone from a three-month campaign to see if you get a nomination to another\nthree months after until the awards are money, for example, or whatever it might be. You also\nget a -- especially in the case of the Oscars, you typically get a nice reward bonus if your\nnominee wins in its category. And those bonuses are typically can range from mid to high five\nfigures each. And in rare cases, you may you get a 6-figure bonus for a win. So those are nice to\nhave in our industry for sure and can add up quite a bit.\nQ: That's very informative. So you said that you expect to get -- when the industry resumes\nnormal operations post-strike, you expect to be cash flow positive. Is a reasonable time to think\nabout that as being best guess today is second quarter '24?\nWilliam O’Dowd – CEO, Dolphin Entertainment, Inc.\nI think so. That seems conservative and nice for us. I mean, with the strike ending in -- the actor\nstrike, which is one that impacted us the most, right? And you say how well, of course, the two\nways that it impacts us the most would be certain talent don't -- they're not allowed to promote\nstrikes. If you don't have something other than filmed entertainment to promote, you would go\non what's called hiatus pause your publicity work. But then secondly, many movies just pushed\nout of the quarter. Now we've got arguably the biggest movie in theaters right, traditional movie\nin Killers Of The Flower Moon, shot maybe with DiCaprio and De Niro and that studio decided\nto push forward with the release despite not having DiCaprio and De Niro able to promote it. But\nthe majority of movies chose to push into next year. So after the marvels, and I think Disney\nmight have one more, yes, they wish coming out in a couple of weeks. And Disney, for example,\nis pausing or has a gap, I should say, in the release slate of seven months I think, until the next\nmovie will hit theaters next summer. So of course, we don't need the movie to be in theaters, we\nstart promoting beforehand.\nBut I would think that with strikes over now, that will impact us here, obviously, in the fourth\nquarter and into the first quarter, but we'll resume normal operations at some point before the end\nof the first quarter, we would hope and Q2 will be a normal quarter for us. I think the cash profit,\nthe cash operating profit, we were very proud of the fact that we built the team that would have\ndone it anyway. And with Special Projects, that certainly helps. I think the hesitation you're\nhearing in my voice is, what will Q1 look like? It's always our weakest quarter and Q4 is always\nour strongest quarter. So it's hard to gauge today because it's a riddle that would only best be\nanswered if we knew how the strikes will linger into Q1. Right now, before the strike settled,\nthere were only three theatrical releases on a wide basis the entire month of January. Everybody\nwas pushing out of it because they didn't know if they'd have actors to promote. Now some of\nthose movies are going to come back in, but it could be a ramp-up period in Q1 that I just don't\nknow the answer to, if we can be cash positive in Q1, but we would expect to be by Q2 and\ngoing forward.\nQ: That's great. So for your social influencing businesses that you combined, you've said in the\npast, that's around 1/4 of your revenue, but then there's opportunities to grow that very\nTranscript Provided by\nsignificantly you said as you add new verticals. How do you think about the timing of building\nout these new verticals?\nWilliam O’Dowd – CEO, Dolphin Entertainment, Inc.\nThat's very near term, Allen. Just like we acquired Socialite and we announced it on this call last\nyear, right, the Q3 earnings call date, November 14, I think it was also last year. And with the\neye towards the merger, right, that we were going to combine New York and L.A. to create -- we\ndidn't know the name of time, but the digital department. We handled that merger with the eye\ntowards having the scale and size of a company to build these other verticals. That was a big\nfactor in the merger. And so just like we've been working last few months towards the merger\nbefore, it came about. We feel very strongly about the work we've put in the last few weeks and\nmonths to have these other verticals and that we'd be announcing in the New Year for the digital\ndepartment. And we're particularly excited. We're excited about them all. But obviously, sports\nrepresent such a huge area for us and growth area for digital department for sure.\nQ: For Midnight Theater, how should we think about the impact of the Mastercard partnership?\nWilliam O’Dowd – CEO, Dolphin Entertainment, Inc.\nWell, it's certainly from a financial standpoint, it buffers the investment, right? I mean it's a\nmultiyear deal with increases every year. And we're very pleased with the outcome. And then on\nan operational level, you've got a partner that both brings events to the space, brings awareness\nof their own events. I mean, brings awareness to the space and has a marketing engine behind it.\nSo the theater is off to a strong start after the grand opening. Q4 is always good too because we'll\nhave the private events business with the holiday season. But it's nice as you go into the slow\nbusiness of Q1, so it kind of mirrors some of our companies in that way. When you have a\npartner like that, that can bring events during the data winter, it's just very strong for our\nbusiness.\nAnd as I mentioned on the earnings call, I mean, these types of things may somewhat get taken\nfor granted because of some of the blue-chip clients we have with our entertainment marketing\ncompanies. But in a venue like this and an investment like this, this is as far from normal. This is\na 150-seat granted state-of-the-art variety theater in a beautiful $4.5 billion complex. But at the\nend of the day, everyone who -- just think of your own hometown, if you're from New York,\nthink of all the entertainment venues of that size you've been to. Joe's pub to 54% below to\nwherever you may be thinking of, right? Now I ask you to take five seconds and just think of\nwhich of those venues have a sponsor? If you can name one of the same size with any sponsor\nand that could be like Joe's oil change, right? And then you think about Mastercard and the deal\ndone with the global CMO of Mastercard, I think it validates our venue. It validates its presence\nin New York City, and I think you can imagine that there's excitement about what we'll be doing\nin the future with that space and that brand.\nQ: Is there kind of a goal for how many private events you would like to do a month?\nWilliam O’Dowd – CEO, Dolphin Entertainment, Inc.\nTranscript Provided by\nYes, we have a goal. In terms of full venue buyouts in a perfect world, you could do one a week\nand not disrupt your programming enough, right? And when I say full venue, that means a client\nis taking over both the theater and the restaurant. Now in terms of just either the lounge, buyout\nor private dining room buyout or even a restaurant buyout, you could do those, maybe you don't\nwant to do it more frequently than a couple of times a week for a restaurant buyout, but I think\nthat 1 to 2x a week for the larger buyouts. In terms of the lounge or the happy hours of the\nprivate dining room, we can do that every day. And sometimes it feels like we do. And of course,\nyou only do buyouts if the money you're receiving is significantly above what you could just do\nif you operated it, right? So they're lucrative for us, and we like to do as many as we can\nresponsibly.\nQ: Okay. And then on Special Projects, it sounded like this could be -- you haven't provided the\nfinancial breakout of it. In terms of what its revenues is, I don't think -- I mean you did discuss\nhow much you paid for it. But it sounds like with the synergies, the revenues could be maybe\nsignificantly more than what it has been historically. Is that kind of a way to think about it?\nWilliam O’Dowd – CEO, Dolphin Entertainment, Inc.\nYes. And the profit. I mean, I don't want to give a wrong conversation here. This is a well-run,\nvery profitable, high-margin business as it is, period. And like I said, it's immediately accretive\nfor us. And we'll announce those financials about 74 days after the acquisition, we'll file the 8-K.\nSo it's not me dodging and I can't get ahead of our filing, right? But with that said, it's already\nwell run, like I mentioned. But what I was trying to make the point in my prepared remarks, you\ncan see how seamless this type of company and this particular company is within the group\nwe've already built. In a perfect world, we wanted to buy those PR firms first, which we largely\naccomplished. And then at influencer marketing, I think I called that the peanut butter and jelly\nof our media. On past calls, those are the twin pillars, if you will, PR and influencer marketing to\ncreate awareness and reach.\nAnd then the live event company, we always did want to bring in last because the PR firms and\nquite frankly, the influencer marketing can refer so much business to them. And so, it'll be a\nshame to have the live event company first and you're waiting to buy the PR firms, right? But\nthen in terms of Dolphin Ventures, the live events company, Special Projects is highly strategic.\nWe bought three PR firms. We bought two influencer marketing agencies, and we have one live\nevent company, and we don't need another because they're on both coasts, they're already the\nmarket leader. They're already the most established brand in talent booking and celebrity live\nevents, which is our wheelhouse, of course. And with them, we instantly can ideate anything\ninvolving celebrities or influencers and with a curated editorial sensibility. And we have\nimmediate credibility with any media partner. I mean, they're already ideating and executing for\nWall Street Journal, for CondÃ© Nast, for W Magazine, for Bustle Digital Group, right? They\ncome from that world.\nSo now all of a sudden, you've got PR firms, influencer marketing, publishing to promote an\nevent that we could either ideate or take an ownership stake in for all of that super power, and\nyou can bring the celebrities there. So it's all great to give award ceremonies, but if you can't get\nTranscript Provided by\nsomebody to show up to receive the wards not much of a very sponsorable event, right? So they\ndo it at the very highest level. And obviously, these are major brand-name type events with\nmajor celebrities attending, so. And they put all of that together. So last year's Academy Museum\nGala that had George Clooney and Julia Roberts up there, and that had Hailey Bieber and Selena\nGomez in the audience sharing a table, the photo that broke the Internet. That's all them. They\nbring the celebrities, they do the seating charts, they organize the panels, they put everybody up\nthere. So they're very well regarded in the industry, and we're blessed to have them and they\ncomplete the Super Group.\nQ: In your business where you take positions in content or consumer products, part of the\nlonger-term strategy is for some of them, you're basically getting the equity for free. And then\nover time, you can get payouts on that. Do you think it's reasonable to think that maybe some of\nthem might pay out in '24?\nWilliam O’Dowd – CEO, Dolphin Entertainment, Inc.\nWell, yes, you're referencing when we get. We take or receive ownership stakes in products or\ncompanies in partial exchange for our services. We love that model where we get cash, we get\nsome cash every month as a retainer, but we also get equity 5%, 7%, 10% of a product or service\nin exchange for the firepower of the Super Group. And it works especially well when the\nmarketing is as valuable as the quality of the product itself. So I think industries like liquor,\nbeauty, cosmetics, wellness products, getting people aware of the product and maybe even\nendorsed from an entertainment figure, either celebrity or influencers is gold in these days of\npromotion. So yes, we love that model and we put up no capital, as you said, Allen. Will we have\nsome exits in 2024? That may happen in the year, the second half of the year, depending on\nwhere a couple land. But I think what we see, not only have the group finished using a year so to\nbuild a slate of those, we've already got a couple, as you mentioned, and then start rolling exits\nout as we add new into the slate every year, we'll hopefully roll out a successful exit. And there\nare some very successful exits we can all think of using either celebrity front of product or\ninfluencer fronted product in the marketplace. And we expect to have one or two of those\nourselves in the next few years, we hope.\nOperator\n[Operator Instructions] And there appear to be no further questions at this time. I'll turn the floor\nback to Bill O'Dowd for closing remarks.\nWilliam O’Dowd – CEO, Dolphin Entertainment, Inc.\nOkay, great. Well, thank you very much, and I was getting -- slip to note see if was there one\nquestion from Tim Regan, or is that hold?\nOperator\nHe has been in the queue, but then he must have removed himself.\nTranscript Provided by\nWilliam O’Dowd – CEO, Dolphin Entertainment, Inc.\nOkay. Maybe I answered those other questions too long. Thank you very much.\nOperator\nYou are welcome.\nWilliam O’Dowd – CEO, Dolphin Entertainment, Inc.\nOf course, Karen. Well, thank you, everybody, for listening today. I know this is the entry into\nthe longest stretch of the earnings call seasons where we go from November 14th all the way to\nMarch 31st without having a scheduled earnings call or at the end of March, whatever our filing\ndate is. We'll try and continue with almost weekly press releases to let you know how each of the\nsubsidiaries are operating. We would hope to have some of the bigger announcements like a\nMastercard sponsorship or something equally exciting, the merger of our companies.\nBetween now and then, of course, we have a couple of those, and we'll try and call those out to\npay particular attention to, especially if it involves any of the ventures or receiving ownership\nstakes in some of those. We have a couple on the cusp. And I thank everyone who's been a part\nof the journey, especially for those fans that were in the room in December of 2016 at LD Micro\nwhen the idea of the group was presented before we bought the first one, 42West three months\nlater. So thank you for those who have been with us since the beginning, and thank you for those\nwho have just heard about us and joined in the last month or so. It's been a fun ride. And as I\nsaid, we think we're now firmly at the starting line with full group intact. So we're excited to see\nwhat's going to happen next. Thank you, guys, for the time today, and we look forward to\nspeaking again in March.\nOperator\nThank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's Dolphin Entertainment Earnings\nCall. We thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at this time, and have a great day.\nTranscript Provided by"

With me on the call are Bill O'Dowd, Chief Executive Officer; and Mirta Negrini,\nChief Financial Officer.\nI'd like to begin the call by reading the Safe Harbor statement.

We do not undertake any obligation to update or supplement any\nforward-looking statement to reflect subsequent knowledge, events or circumstances.\nNow I'd like to turn the call over to Bill O'Dowd, Chief Executive Officer of Dolphin\nEntertainment. Bill, please proceed.\nBill O'Dowd - Chairman & CEO, Dolphin Entertainment, Inc.\nThanks, James, and hi, everyone, and good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. As\nalways, we'll start with a review of some financial and operating highlights, followed by a full\nfinancial review and then open it up for Q&A.\nSo from a financial highlights perspective, revenue hit an all-time high for Q2 of $11 million.\nThis result marks our second highest quarterly revenue performance in the company's history in\nany quarter, coming incredibly close to our record best $11.1 million in Q4 of last year, without\nthe benefit of the holiday seasonality that strengthens our business every year. So we're very,\nvery proud of the revenue results this quarter.\nOn the operating line also, when you back out noncash charges, we improved our -- we\nimproved over Q1, excuse me, by $1.3 million to an operating loss less noncash charges of less\nthan $400,000. This momentum of greater than $1.3 million improvement in operating results\nquarter-over-quarter sets us up nicely as we enter into the historically stronger second half of the\nyear.\nFurthermore, we are very pleased with the strength of our balance sheet. We have over $7\nmillion of unrestricted cash on hand and we have paid out the last of our acquisition earn-outs,\nthereby removing the final contingent consideration liabilities that have been on our books since\nwe made our first acquisition in 2017. That's another significant milestone for us here six years\nlater. All earnouts have been paid and no more contingent consideration on our balance sheet.\nWith respect to the noncash charges, in addition to the normal depreciation and amortization we\ntake every quarter, primarily as we amortize over several years the intangible assets we receive\nvia our acquisitions, we also took a onetime $6.5 million noncash impairment against our\ngoodwill this quarter in recognition of our stock price dropping during the fourth quarter of last\nyear and the lack of market recovery in our stock price during the first half of this year.\nThis one-time noncash impairment allows us to reset and realign our market capitalization with\nour book value prior to moving into our strongest quarters of the year. And before we announced\nthe exciting catalysts we expect to share in the coming weeks. Again, it's worth repeating, this\nentire expense is both one-time and noncash and we're happy to have taken it now.\nLooking ahead, we expect a strong second half to the year, delivering strong double-digit annual\nrevenue growth. We also expect to report positive operating income in the back half of the year\nand going forward, once noncash items are excluded, as the strong improvement in operating\nTranscript Provided by\nresults of more than $1.3 million from Q1 to Q2 would indicate. Again, we expect to report\npositive operating income in the back half of the year and going forward once noncash items are\nexcluded.\nWe believe that our second half of the year will also benefit from the fact that none of Q2's\nDolphin Films’ sale of feature documentary the Blue Angels to Amazon Studios via our multi-\nyear co-production partnership with IMAX, none was actually recognized in Q2, but is expected\nto start being recognized in the second half of this year. Revenue from that transaction between\nthe second half of this year and the first half of next year is expected to bring Dolphin over $3.5\nmillion, which represents a better than 75% return on investment and this result does not include\nany of Dolphin's share of revenues from ticket sales in IMAX theaters.\nMoreover, virtually all of our subsidiaries and especially our influencer marketing agencies, Be\nSocial and Socialyte, traditionally thrive in the latter part of the year due to seasonality. Thus,\nwith the strong operating momentum created from Q1 to Q2, along with a strong cash position\nand the removal of all contingent considerations from our balance sheet and with the one-time\nnoncash goodwill impairment behind us, we feel we are best positioned for a very strong second\nhalf of the year which is a great segue into our operational updates.\nAt the prestigious 2023 Cannes Film Festival, the world premiere of Martin Scorsese's “Killers\nof the Flower Moon” was skillfully publicized by 42West, special shout out to Scott Feinstein.\nOur film and television PR powerhouse firm also showcased multiple clients at the Tribeca Film\nFestival and proudly represented an unprecedented 13 clients at the renowned San Diego Comic-\nCon and that does not include James Carbonara, who went incognito as Rocket Raccoon from\nGuardians of the Galaxy. Moreover, the exceptional talents represented by 42West received an\nimpressive total of four nominations at the 76th Tony Awards. We'll have more to announce\nabout 42West on the tremendous Emmy nominations they received once we all get through the\nnext couple of months.\nTurning to our award-winning consumer lifestyle and hospitality marketing communications\nagency, The Door warmly welcomed a host of new clients into their fold, including for those\nfrom New York, Carbone Fine Food, City Pickle, which I'm very excited about, and the\nesteemed Emeril Lagasse, along with his son, the skilled chef patron, EJ Lagasse. Demonstrating\ntheir prowess, The Door secured two exciting projects with world renowned culinary virtuoso,\nJean-Georges. These ventures encompass the Tin Building by Jean-Georges and a forthcoming\nrestaurant at the prestigious 425 Park Avenue in Manhattan, augmenting The Door's illustrious\nportfolio of culinary clients and destinations.\nShifting gears to Dolphin's industry-leading music PR firm, Shore Fire had its hands full\npromoting sold-out tours by Bruce Springsteen and Odessa, a #1 dance hit by Kylie Minogue and\ngroundbreaking initiatives by music business leaders such as ASCAP, Wasserman Music and\nRhino Records. And a crowning achievement for Shore Fire's clientele, Rhiannon Giddens who\nwon the well-deserved Pulitzer Prize in Music for her collaborative opera, Omar, co-authored\nwith the accomplished Michael Abels, known for his work on feature films Get Out and Nope.\nTranscript Provided by\nAnd then for Dolphin's respected creative agency and video production boutique, Viewpoint's\nwork in Q2 and year-to-date includes productions for Fenway Park, Big Red's hot sauce and\nPayPal.\nRounding out the super group, talent from our creator agencies, Be Social and Socialyte were\nrecently asked to join campaigns for leading brands, including Maybelline, Steve Madden,\nFabletics, Kay Jewelers, SKIMS among dozens of others in Q2. Also another special shout out\nsince both agencies were named top talent managers for creators by Business Insider.\nAnd I'd say that's just the tip of the iceberg for two reasons: one, because the second half of the\nyear is seasonally stronger for influencer marketing ; and second, because we've only had these\ntwo companies under the Dolphin umbrella for a short period of time, and we have big plans.\nAnd whereas we usually touch on brief highlights of what our up -- what our operating\ncompanies, excuse me, did in the quarter, I'd really like to spend a little bit more time on Be\nSocial and Socialyte. My goal is to try and paint a fuller picture of where we are and the massive\nopportunity ahead of us in the influencer marketing space both immediately in the second half of\nthis year and beyond.\nAs mentioned on previous earnings calls, we will be merging Be Social and Socialyte in the near\nfuture, and this will be a big deal in the influencer marketing industry. We believe the combined\nentity will be the entertainment industry's leading influencer marketing firm, along with our best-\nin-class PR firms, 42West, Shore Fire and The Door. Together, the two agencies now have 50\nemployees and represent over 200 leading creator talent with millions and millions of collective\nfollowers on social media.\nPart of the reason that is so important is because the influencer marketing industry has\nexperienced strong double-digit CAGR over the past five years, increasing from global brand\nspend of less than $2 billion in 2016 to estimates of more than $14 billion in 2022 according to\nGrand View Research. That's more than 7x in six years and it's not slowing down.\nWith the combination of Socialyte and Be Social, we now expect that influencer marketing will\nrepresent 25% or more of our revenues in 2023 and because influencer marketing is absolutely\none of the fastest-growing segments in all of marketing, if not the fastest-growing segment in all\nof marketing, we expect that percentage of our overall revenue to grow in the coming years.\nThus, we believe that influencer marketing is our biggest core business growth engine, not\nfactoring in what Dolphin Ventures can bring us.\nOur influencer marketing agencies receive a commission, typically 20% on whatever our talent\nmakes. And then if we run a campaign for a brand, we get 20% of whatever the budget is. So\nboth our talent management and our brand services divisions have pretty healthy margins. And\nwe will expand our roster and our services to match the market.\nWe are already at the vanguard of the biggest section of influencer marketing, female-led,\nInstagram-focused beauty, fashion and wellness categories. It feels to us that there is a very large\nopportunity to build the dominant bicoastal influencer marketing agency across all entertainment\nTranscript Provided by\nverticals. We already have that in public relations with our best-in-class PR firms. We want to be\nthe first to have that in influencer marketing too. We want to include athletes, NIL marketing for\ncollege athletes, for example, is only two years old and it will continue to grow.\nWe also believe in the strong potential of culinary influencers and teen influencers to name two\nmore categories, both of which are entire segments unto themselves. Into this growing market,\nwe are very excited that for the very first time, we'll be selling the services of these two\ncompanies in combination going into the heavy selling season of September and the fourth\nquarter, which obviously includes holidays.\nNow in this third quarter, we are ready to more formally combine our two great agencies, both\ntheir rosters and their services. Be on the lookout for big announcements in this area in the next\nfew weeks and well before we speak again in November.\nAll right. That was mouthful. But I wanted to share all of that so that you could understand the\nlong-term opportunity as well as why we are so excited about the second half of this year\nbecause we get to hit the ground running with these two companies in the September market.\nNow I'll turn to providing updates on some of our projects that we have at Dolphin Ventures\nwhere Dolphin and its shareholders have equity and participate in the upside that our best-in-\nclass marketing companies regularly enable for our clients. And maybe I'll be a little bit briefer\ngiven the long-form comments on influencer marketing a second ago.\nStarting with Midnight Theatre. As a reminder, Dolphin manages all aspects of publicity and\nmarketing for Midnight Theatre and its restaurant Hidden Leaf while also facilitating talent and\ncommercial relationships within the entertainment and culinary industries. Dolphin also holds a\nmeaningful ownership stake in the venture. We continue to ramp-up the programming at\nMidnight Theatre throughout the summer, aiming to have a full seven-day a week schedule by\nthe end of September. To that end, we expect to have exciting programming partnerships to\nannounce shortly in this quarter as well.\nTurning to our partnership with IMAX. We had the announcement that Amazon Studios obtained\nthe worldwide rights to the Blue Angels. It's a noteworthy highlight of Q2 that we discussed\nduring our previous earnings call, and I'll briefly touch on here. This accomplishment stems from\nDolphin Ventures' multiyear collaboration with IMAX jointly funding and producing a series of\nfeature length documentaries for the worldwide audience.\nThe inaugural project, the Blue Angels is the creation of J.J. Abrams' Bad Robot Productions\nalong with partners, obviously, Dolphin Entertainment and IMAX, commenced filming last\nsummer and has now wrapped production. We are in the final stages of editing, and we anticipate\nto release in IMAX theaters during the first quarter of next year.\nAs far as Dolphin's return, we project revenue generation of approximately $3.5 million through\nthe acquisition agreement, yielding an approximate 75% ROI. As mentioned earlier, this\nprojection does not include any revenue from ticket sales at IMAX institutional theaters, further\nenhancing the potential returns, nor was any of the revenue recognized in our record Q2. We are\nTranscript Provided by\nexcited to start realizing revenue in the coming quarters. We expect to have a lot more to talk\nabout on Dolphin Ventures as a whole on our Q3 earnings call.\nAnd so in summary, we feel we are well positioned to have a strong second half of the year\nwhich has historically been the case due to the seasonality of our businesses. To have our second\nhighest revenue quarter ever in Q2 when Q3 and Q4 are typically our biggest quarters, underpins\nour enthusiasm for what's to come.\nThank you for joining us on this journey. And to that end, I'll now turn it over to Mirta.\nMirta Negrini - CFO & COO, Dolphin Entertainment, Inc.\nThank you, Bill, and good afternoon, everyone. I will now discuss results for the quarter ended\nJune 30, 2023. Total revenue for the second quarter ended June 30, 2023, increased 11% to $11\nmillion compared to the first quarter ended March 31, 2023. Overall, operating expenses for the\nthree months ended June 30, 2023 were approximately $18.5 million compared to approximately\n$12.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023.\nAs Bill mentioned, included in that $18.5 million is a $6.5 million noncash nonrecurring\nimpairment of goodwill. During the second quarter, we performed a quantitative assessment\ndriven by triggering events related to declines in our market capitalization, combined with the\nlack of positive response from the market to positive information related to future projects that\nresulted in the impairment of goodwill.\nOperating expenses are composed of direct costs, payroll and benefits, selling, general and\nadministrative expenses, changes in the fair value of contingent consideration, depreciation and\namortization, impairment of goodwill and legal and professional fees. Direct costs for the quarter\nended June 30, 2023, were $217,000 compared to $219,000 for the quarter ended March 31,\n2023. Payroll costs were approximately $8.7 million in Q2 compared to $9.1 million in Q1 2023.\nSG&A expenses were $2 million in Q2 compared to $1.9 million in Q1. Legal and professional\nfees were $496,000 compared to $763,000 in Q1 2023.\nOperating loss for the quarter ended June 30, 2023, of $7.4 million and net loss for the quarter of\n$8 million include noncash items of over $7.1 million related to the nonrecurring $6.5 million\nimpairment of goodwill and $543,939 of depreciation and amortization. This compares to an\noperating loss for the quarter ended March 31, 2023 of $2.6 million and a net loss of $3 million\nwhich include noncash items for depreciation and amortization of $533,096 and a loss from the\nchange in the fair value of contingent consideration of $15,485, along with onetime and\nnonrecurring audit fees of $300,000.\nLoss per share was $0.60 per share based on 13,212,311 weighted average shares outstanding for\nboth basic loss per share and fully diluted loss per share for the three months ended June 30,\n2023. Loss per share of $0.23 per share based on 12,640,285 weighted average shares\noutstanding for both basic and fully diluted loss per share for the three months ended March 31,\n2023. Cash and cash equivalents were $7 million as of June 30, 2023 as compared to $7.9\nmillion as of March 31, 2023.\nTranscript Provided by\nThat concludes my financial remarks. I will now ask the operator to open the phone lines for\nQ&A. Operator, can you please poll for questions?\nOperator\nCertainly. The floor is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions]. Your first question is\ncoming from Allen Klee with Maxim Group. Please pose your question. Your line is live.\nQ: Hello, congratulations on strong revenue growth. My first question is, can you give us a sense\nbased on how long the writer and actor strike goes on, what the relative impact that might have\non your business in the future?\nBill O'Dowd - Chairman & CEO, Dolphin Entertainment, Inc.\nSure. Thank you, Allen. We're very proud of our revenue as well, especially for Q2. The writer\nstrike, it doesn't have too big an impact on us. I remember a brief conversation on this with Q1\nearnings call because, obviously, writers write projects that will be made in the future. And the\nprojects that we're promoting now and for the next year have already been produced. So that will\nhave minimal impact on Dolphin. It would take a writer strike into -- well into next year to have\nan impact.\nThe actor strike does have an impact. We're blessed to be in a position that our talent division is\na small piece of our overall revenue. 42West has four divisions. And then we've got six operating\nsubsidiaries. So there will be some dip in talent revenue at 42West, but as a whole, that\nrepresents a very small single-digit fraction of Dolphin's overall revenue. And then, of course,\nwe're all hopeful that actor strike and the writer strike will settle by the end of the quarter, let's\nhope or early in the fourth quarter.\nQ: Thank you. And thank you for the more detailed information about your social influencing\nbusinesses. So you talked about expanding to other verticals. How do you see the -- how are you\nthinking about the kind of which you have -- how much you have to do, to do that and maybe the\ntiming of being able to pull that off?\nBill O'Dowd - Chairman & CEO, Dolphin Entertainment, Inc.\nYes. And that was why we chose to really focus a good section of our prepared remarks on our\ninfluencer marketing agencies because we would like, and you can probably guess that we would\nlike, to sell their services in combination with each other once we come back from Labor Day\nweekend.\nAs we roll from September into the heavy, heavy selling season of late September through early\nDecember, we have these two companies that we'd like to be in the market as one. So I imagine\neveryone is looking forward to what that announcement could be in September, right? And then\nas we -- to go forward from there, to build what we think will be that dominant bicoastal\ninfluencer marketing agency, I think we would like to add divisions to it, and become almost a\nTranscript Provided by\nrapid fire leader in each of those divisions on a regular cadence afterwards. And that's a cadence\nmeasured in weeks between. So I think you'll see at least a couple of those divisions announced\nbefore the end of the year and most likely before we talk again November 15.\nQ: That's great.\nBill O'Dowd - Chairman & CEO, Dolphin Entertainment, Inc.\nIn partnership -- and I might add with leading partners in that pipeline in those areas. So it's\nreally going to be something we're focused on. And, quite frankly, why we wanted to raise it on\nthis call because people hopefully will be looking for those announcements, and we'll be\ndelivering on our expectations rather than say it all after the fact on November 15, right?\nQ: Got it. Your investment in Nina Compton and the restaurant that people sign up for the\nmemberships in New Orleans. You had news that you're selling -- you sold memberships. Can\nyou give us some update on how that went and how that works in terms of -- just if you can say\nanything about the monthly fee or the economics that we could think about? Thank you.\nBill O'Dowd - Chairman & CEO, Dolphin Entertainment, Inc.\nSure. Yes. ShaSha Lounge, we're very proud of that for a couple of different reasons. First, I\nshould say, this is a form of Dolphin Ventures that I know many listeners out there strongly feel\ngood about because this is a partnership wherein we get a monthly fee to promote the ShaSha\nLounge in New Orleans, and we also get an ownership stake in the venture itself. So we get paid\ncash every month, and we get an ownership stake in the success of the venture. That's very\nexciting for us, and it's a perfect representation of the types of things that we're looking to do.\nAnd quite frankly, we feel we're uniquely qualified to do.\nSecond reason why it's -- we're very proud of it, I should say, is because this was a concept\nideated with our team at The Door. Obviously, our culinary celebrity chef and hospitality PR\nfirm The Door is the very best at what they do. And the concept of putting this membership\nlounge, public and private in New Orleans came out of conversations they had with Nina and her\nhusband. And so how it works is for ShaSha, it's open -- it will be open to the public. We plan to\nopen it in early 2024, and you can go in and have a drink. But there will be sections of the lounge\nthat are open only to members and members will have certain rights and privileges as well as\naccess to forms of \"programming\" that are not available to the general public.\nSo celebrity chefs may be coming in through New Orleans. We'll be programming that, let's say,\non a regular cadence, maybe once a month, and members can have a special dinner prepared by\nMarc Forgione from New York or Rodney Scott from Charleston or Stephanie Izard from\nChicago or Michelle Bernstein from Miami, all of whom are minority partners in ShaSha New\nOrleans, and all of whom would have the right to open a ShaSha in their home city where they\nwould take the larger percentage.\nSo a really unique and creative business model as well as just a great idea to have this as a social\nclub in New Orleans. So we did -- we put memberships on sale just a couple of weeks ago. We're\nTranscript Provided by\nrapidly getting to the dollar amount that will allow for deposits to be put down on leases and\nconstruction to begin. So more to come on ShaSha, but I know the team who was down in New\nOrleans for the announcementat Tales of the Cocktail have done a great job and kudos to the\nteam at The Door, and we're all very excited for ShaSha.\nQ: That's great. Thank you. In terms of Blue Angels, I'm not sure if I heard you right, did you\nsay that you expected to get released in the first quarter of '24 or the first half? And then the $3.5\nmillion payment, that's related to Amazon streaming. Is there a way you could help us\nunderstand how that gets spread out of when you get the payments for that?\nBill O'Dowd - Chairman & CEO, Dolphin Entertainment, Inc.\nSure. Yes, absolutely. It's quick. So yes, we anticipate being in theaters in Q1 of 2024. It's in\ntheory, still possible in Q4, the original plan. But as we and J.J. take the time in post to do this as\nbest as possible, we're very excited with the cuts we're seeing, and it looks to be a special film.\nThen we're trying to juggle as well the best release date for it with the least amount of\ncompetition. So we're looking at different dates in both quarters. So I'm going to be conservative\nand say that we're aiming more towards Q1.\nBut we get paid by Amazon typically, well, the revenue, they have the right to put it on their\nservice within 30 days after we release in theaters. So -- and then they pay us effectively in full at\nthat time. So it's revenue that we should recognize in the first half of next year, if not realistically\nin the first quarter of next year. So -- and there are -- there's even an installment we'll receive in\nthis calendar year as well. So it's -- all of that revenue will be coming in, in fairly short order.\nQ: And any -- I know that the thoughts are with IMAX that this partnership can kind of result in\nadditional documentaries. So any comments on -- are there any issues with the strikes that are\nslowing down the potential next one? Or do you still feel good about being able to get them out?\nBill O'Dowd - Chairman & CEO, Dolphin Entertainment, Inc.\nWe feel good about them. That's a very savvy question, Allen, as you often ask. Yes, this is -- it's\nmore than even just a hope or a dream. It's a -- we've entered into a multi-year, multi-project 50-\n50 deal with IMAX, which is back when Dolphin was a private company is how I built Dolphin,\nco-financing and co-producing with Nickelodeon and with Warner Bros. and many others, right,\nin 50-50 deals. So the -- we're very proud of our partnership with IMAX. They've been\ntremendous partners and we have a hit right out of the gate, right? So that's also great to be able\nto report. We will do more documentaries with them. And we're -- as I mentioned on the Q1\nearnings call, too, we're looking at other forms of entertainment, some of which would come out\nof Midnight Theatre that we could go 50-50 on as well. And I don't want to jinx it, and I don't\nwant to promise something with a hard deadline, but I do believe we'll have a pretty big\nannouncement on that front before we speak again in November.\nSo yes, we'll be doing more. We just have to find that right follow-up. It's tough when you've got\na hit, right? I can understand how certain creative minds get a little frozen at times once you have\na big hit on your first outing, what are you following up with, right? But we just have to get over\nTranscript Provided by\nthat and feel good about whatever we pick second and make sure it's worthy of IMAX screens\nlike the Blue Angels will be, and we'll make another great film. So yes, we're excited for that\npartnership.\nQ: Okay. On previous calls, you've expressed some interest in live events. Is that -- and is that an\narea you feel the same about?\nBill O'Dowd - Chairman & CEO, Dolphin Entertainment, Inc.\n100%. One of the reasons we are excited to -- for the second half of this year, twofold. To\nanswer your question within context too, we always -- our -- many of our businesses are\nseasonal. So the second half of the year is always stronger for us than the first half. That's been\ntrue since 2017, right? And it's only going to be more pronounced this year because we have two\ninfluencer marketing agencies instead of one, and they're highly seasonal for the second half of\nthe year.\nBut the other reason we're so excited for the second half of the year, and this is coming on the\nheels of a record second quarter, right? So I'm not trying to minimize what we just accomplished.\nI'm just saying, we very much are excited for the second half of the year because we have\nmultiple catalysts coming, we believe. And a couple of those relate to Midnight Theatre. A\ncouple of those relate to the influencer marketing agencies, which is why I spent so much time\non this call. And we still believe we will complete the Super Group this year. As I mentioned on\nthe K call -- on the first quarter call -- the missing piece is that celebrity live event production\ncompany.\nThat will allow us to go into the third leg of the three legged stools of Dolphin Ventures, we\ncould get into the right types of live events that we already promote and I'm very excited for that\nas well. And we'll see what the timing is around our Q3 call, but expect -- yes, I expect you'll\nhear more about that from us as well. And so you can see we have maybe up to half a dozen\ndifferent catalysts coming in the next few months, which is another reason why it was good to\nput the non-cash one-time impairment behind us, because we feel we have such a bright future in\nthe next quarter.\nQ: Thank you. I had three just housekeeping questions. But one, since you just mentioned the\nnon-cash impairment, I was a little confused, because I usually think of an impairment when\npeople think that the outlook of a business has changed. And what I heard you guys say was you\ndid an impairment because your stock price was lower, which I'm not familiar with why that\nwould cause an impairment versus is there a particular business that you have that the outlook\nchanged? Or maybe you could just educate me on how this works? Thanks.\nMirta Negrini - CFO & COO, Dolphin Entertainment, Inc.\nSure. I'll take that one. The stock price doesn't necessarily cause the impairment, but it is a cause\nfor taking a closer look at your assets, especially when the book value of the company is higher\nthan the market cap. So that was the case in Q -- in the last quarter of '22, and it has been through\nTranscript Provided by\n2023. So we consider that to be a triggering event to test our goodwill which we did based on\nthis kind of cash flows and we determined that that impairment was necessary.\nBill O'Dowd - Chairman & CEO, Dolphin Entertainment, Inc.\nYes. The market capitalization is one of the four triggering categories, Allen, if that's helpful.\nThat required the review.\nQ: Thank you. Two other housekeeping. One, we use EBITDA in our valuation and in our\nmodel, but we don't get depreciation expense until your Q comes out. So could you give us an\nestimate of what depreciation expense was for the quarter?\nAnd then the second question is often when the Q comes out on the front page, you have the\nshares outstanding as of today. And I was wondering if that number is going to be meaningfully\ndifferent from the average diluted share count that you had in your press release? Thank you.\nMirta Negrini - CFO & COO, Dolphin Entertainment, Inc.\nSo the depreciation and amortization is one number. Depreciation is a very small part of that.\nAnd as of right now, if there are no other changes in our company structure, it's going to be about\n$550,000 a quarter.\nBill O'Dowd - Chairman & CEO, Dolphin Entertainment, Inc.\nAnd the bulk of that is the amortization of the intangible assets from the companies we've\nacquired over the years.\nQ: Thank you. I meant depreciation and amortization, I didn't say it. Thank you. Okay.\nBill O'Dowd - Chairman & CEO, Dolphin Entertainment, Inc.\nYes.\nMirta Negrini - CFO & COO, Dolphin Entertainment, Inc.\nAnd then on the stock count, we had used $13.2 million for the earnings per share or loss per\nshare.\nBill O'Dowd - Chairman & CEO, Dolphin Entertainment, Inc.\n13.2 million shares.\nMirta Negrini - CFO & COO, Dolphin Entertainment, Inc.\nShares, sorry.\nTranscript Provided by\nBill O'Dowd - Chairman & CEO, Dolphin Entertainment, Inc.\nYes. And it will be up about 1 million from that, Allen.\nQ: Bill, do you mean the number today is around 1 million higher than 13.2 million?\nBill O'Dowd - Chairman & CEO, Dolphin Entertainment, Inc.\nThat's right. We had a convertible note convert. That was a good chunk of that.\nQ: Got it. Okay. Great. I think those are my main questions. I was going over the history and\nlooking at your company from going back to like in 2018, and it's pretty impressive at where it is\ntoday. So congratulations.\nBill O'Dowd - Chairman & CEO, Dolphin Entertainment, Inc.\nThank you, Allen. I appreciate it. We're very proud of what we've built and are still building.\nOperator\nYour next question is coming from Chris Lahiji with LD Micro. Please pose your question, your\nline is live.\nQ: Bill, I just want to start out by saying that these are two very good-looking questions. Just\nwant to preface that. Are we going to make any money from Barbie and Oppenheimer either\ndirectly or indirectly, because it seems like both of them have turned out to be, I guess, a lot\nbigger than anticipated?\nBill O'Dowd - Chairman & CEO, Dolphin Entertainment, Inc.\nWell, sadly, and for many reasons, Chris, for you I know, we do not represent Margot Robbie.\nBut we -- so we do not have a direct stake in Barbie through our partners at IMAX, of course. I\nmean, look how well they're doing with Oppenheimer in theaters globally. Just to give them a\nshout out. I know that through the first four weeks of release, one in $4 earned by Oppenheimer\nin the U.S. have been at IMAX theaters and that may even be globally, too. So congrats to them.\nBut yes, those are two great films, no doubt about it.\nQ: The second good-looking question. It has been nearly three years since you guys have\nacquired Be Social. I know it probably went by a lot faster than anticipated. What was the\nbiggest surprise for you guys in terms of what you learned about the influencer market? And\nthank you again for taking my questions.\nBill O'Dowd - Chairman & CEO, Dolphin Entertainment, Inc.\nNo, of course, Chris. Well, I guess we bought Be Social three years ago this month on this call,\nwe announced it. So yes, it's a nice anniversary and we’ve been very, very happy with Be Social.\nTranscript Provided by\nAli Grant, Kirsten Weinberg, Belinda Sztrom, they're extremely strong young executives, and we\nfeel very fortunate that we have Be Social in the Dolphin family.\nA couple or three years later on look back, influencer marketing has only grown, as I said in the\nprepared remarks. The opportunity to pair them with a New York-based agency was because of\nthe strength of Be Social. We knew if we could -- as they were growing significantly year-over-\nyear, and if we could pair them with an equal agency in New York, we can immediately have the\nentertainment industry’s largest influencer marketing agency. So it’s a testament to the growth of\nBe Social that validated the thought process and validated the investment thesis.\nI think what we did not know three years ago was that one year later, the Supreme Court was\ngoing to allow for college athletes to be paid through brand campaigns. And I don’t know that\nthis would have helped me in my college basketball playing days, it might have helped some of\nmy teammates who are probably better basketball players. But the – but that opens up an entire\nnew world. When you think of NIL; Name, Image and Likeness, right, that the Supreme Court\nupheld, those college kids are influencers. That’s how they’re getting paid. That’s what they’re\ngetting paid for is to post on social media.\nSo the diversification of influencer marketing away from the traditional stronghold of female\nfashion, beauty, wellness, gives us even an expanded opportunity to build a truly unique and\nimpressive influencer marketing agency. And I’m proud that we’ll have some athletes in there\ntoo, Chris. So I think those are probably a couple of the things that have come to us in the last\nthree years.\nAnd I guess if I could say one more thing, if I were to guess, in the next three years, we’re seeing\nit. We bought Be Social five months after COVID started. So the first year or two with Be\nSocial, events were not as much of a thing. They're back now. And I think that in the next three\nyears, influencer events which I always -- we always put out press releases once a year or twice a\nyear about our showrooms that Be Social does, and that's Belinda, and her hard work. We will be\nexpanding those. And the opportunity to do events with influencers, specifically for influencers,\nis a huge white space opportunity for us.\nInfluencers already go to our other events. You can't work a movie red carpet without influencers\ntoday. You can't do a hotel or restaurant opening without influencers today. You can't release a\nmusic album without influencers today. But I'm talking about events specifically for, and\nincluding, and where the speakers are, influencers. And we think we're uniquely positioned to\ncapitalize on that opportunity. So that's -- hopefully, that was a thorough answer to your\nquestion, Chris.\nQ: It was. But technically, when you're usually designating athletes, a lot of people don't\nconsider tennis players as part of that equation. Sadly, sadly...\nBill O'Dowd - Chairman & CEO, Dolphin Entertainment, Inc.\nLooks like pickleball, Chris. Something I...\nTranscript Provided by\nQ: Listen, in many circles, in many social circles, pickleball has more cachet than tennis. It's\nalways a pleasure when you guys update your calls. Thank you again, Bill, and looking forward\nto being on the next one.\nBill O'Dowd - Chairman & CEO, Dolphin Entertainment, Inc.\nThanks, Chris. I appreciate it.\nOperator\nThere are no additional questions in queue at this time. I would now like to turn the floor back\nover to Bill O'Dowd for any closing remarks.\nBill O'Dowd - Chairman & CEO, Dolphin Entertainment, Inc.\nWell, thank you, everyone, for listening, as always. We're very, very proud of our Q2 and our\nbalance sheet. As you heard, it's nice to finish with all the contingent consideration and paying\nout all the earnouts, very proud that our subsidiaries earned the earnouts. Speaking of Be Social,\nthe very last one, timing-wise for us and we're very happy to pay out that full earnout this spring.\nSo with that off the balance sheet, we just feel like we have rocket fuel behind us as we go into\nthe typically much stronger second half of the year. And with some of the catalysts we've been\ndiscussing on this call in the near future.\nSo thank you, everybody. And please, if you're not on our mailing list for our press releases,\nplease reach out to James Carbonara. I think when you come back from Labor Day, if not even\nbefore, you'll hopefully -- we'll have some nice press releases to be able to share with everyone.\nSo thanks, everybody, for the time today, and I'll look forward to the next call.\nOperator\nThank you. This does conclude today's conference, and you may disconnect your phone lines at\nthis time. Thank you again for your participation.\nTranscript Provided by"

Bill, please proceed.\nBill O'Dowd - Chairman & CEO, Dolphin Entertainment, Inc.\nThanks, James, and hi, everyone, and good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. As\nalways, we'll start with a review of some financial and operating highlights, followed by a full\nfinancial review and then open it up for Q&A.\nSo from a financial highlights perspective, we're happy to report that our first quarter revenue\ngrew by 8% year-over-year to $9.9 million. Since Q1 is always our lowest revenue quarter\nbecause of the seasonality in our business and especially with our influencer marketing\ncompanies, we expect Q2 revenue to be meaningfully higher and believe that we will hit our\nexpected year-over-year revenue growth target of 20% to 25% for full-year 2023, basically\nsaying we're on track.\nWe are also pleased that our operating loss per share for Q1 stayed the same as last year despite\nadding a second influencer firm into our Q1 results. And as noted just a second ago, we expect\nour influencer marketing firms to be down in Q1 due to seasonality, but also expect them to more\nthan make up the ground in the rest of the year to deliver annual profits to Dolphin.\nMoving to operational updates. A clear highlight occurred after the quarter ended with the\nannouncement that Amazon Studios acquired the worldwide rights to The Blue Angels. I know\nwe spoke just six weeks ago, and this has occurred since. If you recall, this time last year, we\nannounced a multi-year agreement with IMAX to jointly finance the development and\nproduction of a slate of feature length documentaries for the global market.\nThe first project greenlit was The Blue Angels, developed and coproduced by J.J. Abrams, Bad\nRobot Productions and Zipper Bros Films. The Blue Angels started filming last summer and has\nfinished production. We expect the film to hit IMAX theaters in the second half of this year. In\nterms of financial implications, we expect to generate approximately $3.5 million of revenue to\nDolphin from the acquisition agreement, which would result in a 75% ROI before the inclusion\nof any revenues to Dolphin from the ticket sales from IMAX institutional theaters.\nThis fantastic return on The Blue Angels provides a formidable proof-of-concept for our Dolphin\nVentures model, formerly known as Dolphin 2.0, of taking equity in projects that we market.\nDolphin Ventures also saw a boost in Q1 with the announcement that veteran Fortune 500\nExecutive Ellie Doty has joined as Chief Marketing Officer. The rationale is that we expect to\nsource, evaluate, and engage in multiple ventures opportunities over the next 12 to 24 months,\nopportunities wherein we get paid a cash fee to secure the services of the various Dolphin\nagencies working on the account, but also where we receive equity in the product or services we\nare marketing.\nTranscript Provided by\nAdditionally, as Chief Marketing Officer, part of Ellie's role will be to communicate what we\nhave built and giving an additional platform to both the work we are doing and to the incredible\nleaders within our Dolphin family. Ellie is one of those leaders herself.\nLeaders like Shore Fire Media, Dolphin's industry-leading music PR firm, whose client\nRhiannon Giddens, was just awarded the Pulitzer Prize in Music, which followed Shore Fire\nclients receiving a collective 14 Grammy Awards in Q1, including Song of the Year and Best\nNew Artist. That many Grammys is a reflection of the breadth and depth of Shore Fire's roster,\nwhich is what allowed it to place clients across a wide variety of major promotional vehicles in\nQ1, including Good Morning America, the TODAY Show, the Kelly Clarkson Show and Rolling\nStone, just to name a few.\nWe have leaders like 42West, our film and television PR powerhouse, who has helped clients\nand worked on projects resulting in four nominations for the 76th Tony Awards, four awards at\nthe Sundance Film Festival and five awards at the South by Southwest Film Festival this year\nalready.\nAdditionally, 42West worked on the Top Gun: Maverick campaign, which resulted in an\nAcademy Award for Best Sound and six Oscar nominations, which follows a worldwide box\noffice total of $1.49 billion in 2022, the biggest of client Tom Cruise's career to date. I realized I\nshould have just rounded up to $1.5 billion instead of $1.49 billion. But hey, all right.\nUnsurprisingly, 42West and Shore Fire Media were once again honored by the Observer's PR\nPower List.\nWe have leaders like The Door, our leading culinary hospitality and lifestyle PR firm, who just\nwelcomed Carbone Fine Food to their ever growing roster of clients in the consumer packaged\ngoods space, while client Gigi Hadid paid tribute to Karl Lagerfeld in a stunning custom made\nGivenchy dress on the steps of the 2023 Met Gala, and client Viceroy Hotels made Travel and\nLeisure's 2023 top 500 Best Hotels list.\nLeaders like Be Social and Socialyte, our top influencer marketing agencies that represent over\n200 leading creator talent with hundreds of millions of followers on social media. Our creators\nwere recently asked to join campaigns for Saks, TianDe, Jose Cuervo tequila, Revlon and\nPinterest, among dozens of others in Q1. Be Social and Socialyte were named Top Talent\nManagers for Creators by Business Insider.\nAnd lastly, leaders like Viewpoint Creative, Dolphin's respected creative relations agency and\nvideo production boutique -- creative agency -- excuse me. Viewpoint's work in Q1 and year-to-\ndate included a brand image campaign for CBS News New York, Big Red's Hot Sauce and\nPayPal, of course.\nNow I'll turn to providing updates on some of our projects, where Dolphin and its shareholders\nhave equity and participate in the upside that our best-in-class marketing companies regularly\nenable for our clients. Starting with Midnight Theatre. As a reminder, Dolphin manages all\naspects of publicity and marketing for Midnight Theatre and its restaurant, Hidden Leaf, while\nTranscript Provided by\nalso facilitating talent and commercial relationships within the entertainment and culinary\nindustries. Dolphin also holds a meaningful ownership stake in the venture.\nAs we ramp up the programming at the theater throughout the summer, aiming to have a full\nseven day a week schedule shortly after Labor Day, we have played host to an array of talent,\nincluding Gloria Steinem; Nu York Cabaret; The Moth; The Daily Show's Roy Wood Jr., who\nincidentally just hosted the White House Correspondents' dinner; the Amy Schumer shows;\nRachel Feinstein; Broadway's Andrew Barth Feldman, who co-stars with Jennifer Lawrence in\nan upcoming comedy film from Sony, that by all accounts looks like it could be a summer hit; as\nwell as screenings of Academy Award winning Everything Everywhere All at Once; and NCAA\nMarch Madness in 4K high definition, just to name a few. Go, Bluejays.\nWe also anticipate putting out our first original production called A Brief History of Magic in\nMidnight Theatre in July. We're very excited for that as it should allow us to double the number\nof shows per month this summer versus what we did this winter and spring, and so the theater is\nkicking into gear.\nTurning back to our multi-year agreement with IMAX to jointly finance the development and\nproduction of a slate of feature length documentaries. You heard at the top of the call that with\nthe sale to Amazon Studios of our first project together, The Blue Angels, that this partnership\ncould not have gotten off to a better start. We're now looking for and evaluating opportunities for\nour second documentary together. We also anticipate doing more work with IMAX. We're\nactively sourcing and developing live shows with them that we can broadcast from Midnight\nTheatre into IMAX theaters nationwide. We expect to have a lot more to talk about on this topic\nbetween now and our Q2 earnings call.\nIn summary, it's been a great start to the year with record Q1 revenues. And as in previous years,\nwe are confident that Q2 will be even significantly higher in revenues than Q1 and Dolphin\nVentures, previously known as Dolphin 2.0, will enjoy a fantastic return on its investment in The\nBlue Angels with revenues from IMAX institutional theaters still to come.\nThank you for joining us. And to that end, I'll now turn it over to Mirta.\nMirta Negrini - CFO & COO, Dolphin Entertainment, Inc.\nThank you, Bill, and good afternoon, everyone. I will now discuss results for the quarter ended\nMarch 31, 2023. Revenue for the quarter ended March 31, 2023, was approximately $9.9\nmillion, 8% above the revenue for the quarter ended March 31, 2022. Overall operating expenses\nfor the three months ended March 31, 2023 were approximately $12.5 million compared to\napproximately $11.1 million in the same period in the prior year.\nOperating expenses are composed of direct costs; payroll and benefits; selling, general, and\nadministrative expenses, SG&A; changes in the fair value of contingent consideration;\ndepreciation and amortization; and legal and professional fees. Direct costs for the quarter ended\nMarch 31, 2023 were $219,000 compared to $1.1 million in the same period in prior year.\nPayroll costs were approximately $9.1 million compared to $7 million in the same period in the\nTranscript Provided by\nprior year.

Legal and professional fees were $763,000 compared to $938,000 in the same period\nof the prior year.\nOperating loss for the quarter ended March 31, 2023 of $2.566 million, includes non-cash items\nfrom depreciation and amortization of $533,096 and a loss from the change in the fair value of\ncontingent consideration of $15,485, along with one-time and non-recurring audit fees of\n$300,000. This compares to an operating loss for the quarter ended March 31, 2022 of\n$1,889,060, which includes non-cash items from depreciation and amortization of $407,238 and\na loss from the change in the fair value of contingent consideration of $161,451, along with one-\ntime and non-recurring professional fee expenses of approximately $300,000, primarily related\nto the 2021 audit.\nNet loss for the quarter ended March 31, 2023, of $2,969,320, included non-cash items from\ndepreciation and amortization of $533,096 and a loss from the change in the fair value of\ncontingent consideration of $15,485, along with one-time and non-recurring audit fees of\n$300,000.

This compares to $0.20 of basic loss per share and 8,713,700 weighted\naverage shares and $0.23 fully diluted loss per share based on 8,846,567 weighted average shares\noutstanding in the same period in the prior year. Unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of $7.9\nmillion as of March 31, 2023 as compared to $6.1 million as of March 31, 2022.\nThat concludes my financial remarks. I will now ask the operator to open the phone lines for\nQ&A. Operator, can you please poll for questions?\nOperator\nThank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question will come from Allen Klee with Maxim\nGroup.\nQ: Good afternoon. Congratulations on the quarter. Questions on Blue Angels. So I think I heard\nyou say that you're done with the production. Remind us when the goal is for this to hit the\ntheaters. How many theaters it goes and for how long? And then when it becomes available?\nAnd when do you recognize the revenue from Amazon? Thank you.\nBill O'Dowd - Chairman & CEO, Dolphin Entertainment, Inc.\nSure. Yes, this is a big deal, so we should unpack it a little bit. And certainly didn't expect to\nhave such an amazing result on the first one out of the gate. So thank you for highlighting it,\nAllen. The -- we did -- we just announced the deal a year ago this week in Cannes, where I'm\nTranscript Provided by\ngoing tomorrow, and we started filming last summer. We finished filming in March. We're\nediting it now. We expect to -- as of now, the plan is to be in theaters this fall late September,\nOctober. Of course, those things can move up or back, depending on a wide variety of factors,\nbut that's the current plan. It would hit Amazon 30 days or so after it goes into theaters. With a\ndocumentary like this, we'd love to capture a little bit of the tailwinds to try and do a flying\nanalogy maybe of Top Gun: Maverick, certainly helped us with the hype and excitement around\nthis film, which by all accounts is turning out beautiful.\nWe would recognize this $3.5 million in stages. But by the time it goes on the Amazon service, it\nwould be -- recognize at least 90% of the revenue, if not the full 100%. And if we're missing that\nlast 10%, it would come very shortly thereafter. So if the film's released this year, we should\nrecognize it all during the year, and that's exciting for us.\nQ: That's great. So as we look into 2023, and we're thinking about Dolphin Ventures, you have --\ncould you kind of go through what you've publicly said already of projects that are out there that\ncould hit in revenue for yourselves this year?\nBill O'Dowd - Chairman & CEO, Dolphin Entertainment, Inc.\nSure. Yes, it really is this -- Blue Angels really is kind of kicking off, being able to recognize\nrevenue from Dolphin Ventures. So it's an exciting time. Well, obviously, Blue Angels will\nhappen, which is fantastic. And I should point out, before I forget to, I'm sure somebody would\nkill me, that the deal with Amazon is fabulous for us. We also will have additional revenue on\nthe project from IMAX institutional theaters forever.\nSo that's exciting as well that we share with IMAX, of course, and the creatives on the film. But\nthis will have a nice annuity, we believe for us. And so that 75% ROI, not bad less than 12\nmonths later. So that's annualized. So less than 12 months will be higher, we will continue to\nincrease over the years. So we're excited about what the next documentary might be with IMAX.\nAnd then that leads to directly answer your question, Allen. We'll have more to talk about on our\nQ2 earnings call. But the ability to do more projects with IMAX will include some live\nstreaming out of our theater. That could result in some revenue generally, during 2023. Midnight\nTheatre as a whole will be up running and fully operational very shortly. We've got the restaurant\nopen. We're -- we've got shows in there now, about three many weeks, three weeks -- three\nnights a week, excuse me.\nWhen we have our magic show up in July, that will give us comfort that we could be more in the\nfour, five night-a-week range and then shortly after Labor Day. With that -- when that happens --\nand shortly after Labor Day, excuse me, we expect to be seven days a week. So when that does\nhappen, Midnight Theatre will be generating meaningful revenue, we believe here in 2023 and\nwill be a nice catalyst for us. Be on the lookout for that press release about our magic show.\nAnd then we have other Dolphin Ventures in the works. We do own a stake in Crafthouse\nCocktails. Those types of deals, I know many people on the call are fans of, wherein we put up\nno money, we don't make an investment of cash, but a company gets access to our Super Group.\nTranscript Provided by\nSo we get paid a cash fee every month in the structure, and we get equity in the company that\nwe're promoting or the venture that we're promoting.\nThose, we -- without giving a specific number and not stealing thunder from future\nannouncements, I do believe we've identified the next couple of those and are working towards\nclosing and anticipate being able to announce the next one shortly or in the coming weeks, let's\njust leave it at that, ahead of our Q2 earnings call.\nSo our goal there is maybe a year from the holidays, have six to eight of those types of ventures\nin our portfolio. Each will have an exit strategy. Maybe it's selling the company that we're\nworking with, maybe it's doing a fund raiser, et cetera, but it would give us an exit within two to\nthree years of it entering our portfolio.\nAnd having a slate like that, we obviously expect some of them to have Blue Angels type results.\nIt wouldn't qualify to be a venture for us if it wouldn't result in seven figures, certainly, to\nDolphin and a few of them where we have high hopes that it could be exits of eight figures or\nmore. So obviously, for a company of our size, a $10 million exit is extremely meaningful.\nSo we're excited for that, and we're able to ramp that up because of hiring Ellie, putting the\nmanagement team in place for Ventures. We'll have more to say on that over the summer and\nbeing able to handle six to eight of those at once and manage them to success. So that's -- from a\n2023 perspective, I'd say those are the big highlights. So more IMAX, Midnight Theatre and\nmore Ventures that we'll be able to share with everyone.\nQ: Thank you. That's great color. The writers' strike that's going on, do you -- does that have an\nimpact on your business? Or does it have to be going on for a long time for that to happen?\nBill O'Dowd - Chairman & CEO, Dolphin Entertainment, Inc.\nYes. No, we're blessed. We're similar to the movie theaters in that we're kind of insulated in\nterms of -- it would have to go on a long time because the projects we've already been hired to\npromote through the end of this year, we're identifying projects to promote early to middle of\nnext year. Those are already finished films, much like Blue Angels would be, right? So it will\naffect TV production if it goes on throughout the summer. And I wish I could be more optimistic\nabout how quickly this may be over, but I think most of the industry is not optimistic at the\nmoment. But it will not affect our business, no, happy to say.\nQ: Okay. That's great. In terms of Socialyte and Be Social, how do you feel about integrate the\ncombining of the two and the opportunity you have with these two powerful companies now\nworking together?\nBill O'Dowd - Chairman & CEO, Dolphin Entertainment, Inc.\nYes, I mean, in terms of Dolphin 1.0, our core businesses, this combination, quite frankly, is\nprobably the most exciting thing going because as listeners of these earnings calls know in the\nlast couple, we bought Socialyte the day of our earnings call back in November, and we've been\nTranscript Provided by\nworking to integrate -- get these two companies ready to merge and which we'll be announcing\nover the summer a new name and excitement around what will be, when they are together, we\nthink the largest and most formidable influencer marketing agency in all of entertainment.\nWith that said, it's only going to grow because we're going to invest in the growth of that\ncombined company, more divisions, more segments, more platforms we promote on because\ninfluencer marketing, I don't know if it's the fastest-growing area in all of marketing, but if it's\nnot, it's got to be very near the top. And anybody that's followed anything in marketing the last\nfive years knows that influencer marketing is going only in one direction.\nBecause when you think about it, 10 years ago, it started with mommy bloggers. And five years\nago, you might have Instagram campaigns. TikTok challenged the industry to come in with\nshort-form video. And now think of all the different segments that are promoted online, right? I\nmean, it's affected every industry, from books, remember, BookTok a thing.\nLet's talk college athletes, NIL, I played basketball at Creighton. Those who have met me in\nperson know I'm seven feet tall. It's a far different world today than when I played in terms of\nNIL. Those are influencers. And video gaming influencers. We really have synergies we can\ncreate with our large video gaming business within 42West and the influencer marketing firms,\nwhich we don't do today.\nWe are heavily, heavily female and beauty, lifestyle, wellness and are the market leader, which is\nthe core cornerstone of influencer marketing today. But in the next three to five years, I'd love to\nsee us be twice as big, 3x as big in influencer marketing. This year, influencer marketing will\nrepresent 25% of our revenues, up from 0 before we bought Be Social, right? And it would be a\ngreat success story if in three to five years influencer marketing is half of our revenues, which is\nsaying a lot considering how strong our PR firms are. So that combination on our core business,\nthat merger and doing it right this summer and into the Fall, will set us up for a lot of growth in\nthe future years.\nQ: Thank you. On the last call, you said that you had a desire to acquire a company in the live\nevents space. Subsequent to that, we picked up a company that's kind of does things like that,\nand I got educated on what a good business it is. But how do you think about how live events\ncould play into what you do?\nBill O'Dowd - Chairman & CEO, Dolphin Entertainment, Inc.\nWell, it's nothing new for us in that, that type of company was always something we said would\nbe part of our group since 2017, right? It was going to be the last piece we had because just we\nwanted to have the PR firms in place first and the influencer marketing agencies because they\nwill water -- there'll be firehoses of water to potential clients for the right live events company\nthat deals in our space.\nBecause the live events can mean a lot of things to a lot of people, it can be a very lucrative\nbusiness, especially, though, when you've got sister agencies like they will. Why? Every movie\npremiere is a live event. Every streaming service show premiere is a live event. Look -- think of\nTranscript Provided by\nall the different movies. I'm going to Cannes. We're blessed to represent Martin Scorsese. He's\ngot Killers of the Flower Moon premiering this Saturday, Di Caprio's in it. That's a live event.\nAnd how many of those we represent every year?\nBut how about every hotel opening that The Door does? How about every restaurant opening\nThe Door does? How about everything that can be done at Midnight Theatre? We've hosted, oh,\nmy goodness. I don't even know now, is it 10, 12 premieres in Midnight Theatre? We're not fully\nopen. So it's very hard. Call it live events, call it experiential marketing. I have a very good\nfriend that's listening in on this call now that's a big, big magazine publisher. I think he's\nprobably made more money from his live events than he has from his magazines.\nThat type of, like I say, experiential marketing is the other piece of earned media, which is what\nwe specialize in. PR, influencer marketing and experiential marketing, that is the cornerstone of\nour strategy. One last -- just while I'm riffing on this answer. 42West is the unquestioned leader,\nright, film and TV marketing. We are promoting -- proud to say you'll see a press release out on\nthis, this week or next week. We're promoting the Harry Potter Exhibition that's coming to New\nYork. We have a friends and family Thursday, and I think it's open to the public Friday, if I've\ngot that right. I'll be over in Cannes.\nWell, obviously, that's a big, big exhibition, right? I wonder if they're going to do well\nfinancially. I'll think about it. Now those types of opportunities, obviously. Warner Brothers\nowns the IP on that, but whether it's food festivals, music festivals, exhibitions, immersive\nexperiences, think of the Van Gogh exhibits and everything else I just said before. And if you're\ngoing to bring celebrities to those types of events which we would look for a company that does\nthat, I think the world is your oyster at that point. So yes, I do think that live events should be a\npart of our future, for sure.\nQ: That's great. My last question is not as exciting, but more financial.\nBill O'Dowd - Chairman & CEO, Dolphin Entertainment, Inc.\nNot as exciting as Harry Potter, Allen?\nQ: No, just how to think about the -- with your mix of business now, you mentioned 1Q is the\nseasonally slowest quarter. How to think about how, just in general, the other quarters are\nrelatively?\nBill O'Dowd - Chairman & CEO, Dolphin Entertainment, Inc.\nYes. As we wait more and more with influencer marketing, we're just going to have to get used\nto this because smoothing it out over the year just won't be possible. Q2, Q3 sequentially ramp\nup traditionally. With our PR business, too, by the way, but PR has, I'll call it a dip in Q1.\nInfluencer marketing is -- I don't -- there's no other word for it other than seasonality because Q4\nis through the roof for influencer marketing traditionally because the brands want to hire the\ninfluencers for holiday sales. And then the brands shut off their budgets until you get to Spring.\nTranscript Provided by\nCoachella and other events, back to live events, traditionally start a heavy brand marketing\nseason with influencers.\nSo Q1 is always going to be down for us and Q4 could -- well, every single year will be our\nhighest revenue quarter. It will be very interesting to see what happens this year since we've got\ntwo influencer marketing campaigns, which by then will be one merged entity. But still -- so yes,\nI think that's going to be true. This year's second half of the year is going to be overweight\nanyway because of the recognizing -- probably recognizing the revenue of Blue Angels.\nSo -- but I think as a rule going forward, we'll grow year-over-year every quarter as we've done\nfor the past three years. We're confident in that because each of our companies learns to cross-\nsell with the other, better, stronger, faster and easier. We've added one more component that\nallows them to cross-sell with now at Socialyte. So we'll -- our Q2 should be better than last\nyear's Q2. Our Q3 will be better than last year's Q3, et cetera, et cetera. But Q4 will always be\noverweight, and Q1 will always be underweight. Q2 and Q3 are often quite similar. Was that\nhelpful?\nQ: Yes. Thank you so much and congratulations.\nBill O'Dowd - Chairman & CEO, Dolphin Entertainment, Inc.\nThank you. It's an exciting time. Just don't expect 75% ROI on every venture. Ellie might have a\nheart attack, Allen.\nQ: Thank you.\nBill O'Dowd - Chairman & CEO, Dolphin Entertainment, Inc.\nThank you.\nOperator\nThank you. At this time, there are no additional questioners. I'd like to turn it back to Mr.\nO'Dowd for closing remarks.\nBill O'Dowd - Chairman & CEO, Dolphin Entertainment, Inc.\nOh, gosh. Okay. Well, first of all, I teach at the University of Miami. A shout-out out to all\nHurricanes who just graduated and those past graduates that are on this call, and there are a few\nof those as well. And I know the Q1 call, I always feel a little guilty because I get to talk to\neverybody twice in six weeks. And usually, not a lot has changed.\nObviously, The Blue Angels is -- has pride of place on this earnings call. I'm very happy that we\nwere able to, together, get off to such a great start with our Ventures. It's exciting times. And of\ncourse, having been in this business a long time, 27 years, and having formed multiyear\nTranscript Provided by\npartnerships with studios and networks in the past, I think having a success like that right out of\nthe gate just cements the relationship we believe we've built with IMAX.\nAnd I think there's -- when two good companies, with all of our reach together, whiteboard\nadditional ways to work together, good things come out of it. So I'm excited for that and sharing\nsome of those ideas that we'll be executing on over the summer and into the Q2 earnings call.\nObviously, I've been asked more than once, what's the next documentary? Well, we're going to\nbask in the glow of this one for a month or two and really make sure that we kick the right next\nproject together. We have some great exciting submissions.\nBut thank you all for listening. Thank you for giving us the opportunity to tell you our good\nnews, and I look forward to the next earnings call in about three months. So thank you,\neverybody.\nOperator\nThank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's presentation. You may now disconnect.\nTranscript Provided by"

Bill, please proceed.\nBill O’Dowd - Chief Executive Officer, Dolphin Entertainment, Inc.\nThanks, James, and hi, everyone. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today. As always,\nwe'll start with the review of some financial and operating highlights, followed by a full financial\nreview and then open it up for Q&A. So, from a financial highlights perspective, the fourth quarter\nset a new record for us with revenue of $11.1 million, the first time we passed $11 million in a\nquarter. Full year 2022 revenue exceeded our target increasing 13% year-over-year to a record\n$40.5 million. Also, in 2022, our balance sheet continued to improve.\nAs followers of our company know, our put obligations have all been finished and we now have\nonly one remaining earn-out from our previous acquisitions left to go, which will be paid this\nspring. Thus, our below the line items that need to be fairly valued will be cut in half, from four\nsuch line items to just two, which will dramatically simplify our financial reporting going forward.\nFurthermore, of the two remaining items, one of them are outstanding warrants of which there are\nonly 20,000 -- that's right, just 20,000 warrants, and the other is the last remaining convertible note\nwhich needs to be fair valued, which only has a principal amount of $500,000. Thus, as we near\nthe completion of the acquisition strategy that built our Super Group, the volatility in the earnings\nthat resulted from needing to fair value large amounts of puts and earn out consideration is nearing\nits completion, which will allow us to more closely align our net income results with the metric\nwe measure ourselves by, which is actual operating income less depreciation and amortization. To\nput it simply, what was a more complicated balance sheet over the past several years, has been\ntremendously streamlined and simplified, and I think we're a stronger company for it.\nNow let's move to some operational updates. I'm thrilled to begin with the news released this\nmorning. A veteran Fortune 500 executive, Ellie Doty, has joined Dolphin as Chief Marketing\nOfficer. I would like to take a few minutes to explain the strategic importance of this position.\nOkay, first off, Ellie has over 20 years of experience in high profile positions in major enterprises\nlike Burger King, including being CMO there, Taco Bell, being a CMO there; and Chili's including\nbeing CMO there, which have shaped her into a formidable brand strategist and creative leader.\nSince leaving Burger King a little over a year ago, Ellie caught our eye by flexing this brand\nbuilding expertise across several other sectors, including hospitality, tech, beauty and lifestyle,\nassisting startups with creating long-term brand building growth strategies. And Dolphin is at the\nnext stage of its growth. I mean, this is strategic for us not just because we brought in a CMO of\nEllie's caliber, but because specifically we expect to bring in multiple 2.0 opportunities over the\nnext 12 to 24 months. Opportunities like Crafthouse Cocktails, wherein we get paid a cash fee to\nsecure the services of the various Dolphin agencies working on the account, but also where we\nTranscript Provided by\nreceive equity in the product or services we are marketing. Some of these swings at the plate, since\nits opening day of baseball, right? Some of these will work, some will not. However, they all have\na much better chance of success with Dolphin’s agencies working for them. And they agree or they\nwill not be willing to offer revenue and equity in exchange for our Super Group supporting them.\nAnd furthermore, all of these opportunities need a point person within Dolphin to interact with the\npartner and guide the best plan for success. With Ellie's background that person is her. Ellie has\nbuilt marketing plans that range the gamut from startups with literally no money to an annual\nbudget of $400 million at Burger King. She came up in the business through brand strategy, which\nis the path we value the most, as opposed to media planning, let's say, which is all well and good\nbut isn't helpful to many startups or early stage brands that don't have any money to pay for media,\nright. So you can media plan all you want but if you don't have the money to pay for it what’s the\npoint, whereas brand building is essential.\nWe expect that the vast majority, if not all, of our 2.0 opportunities will be brands that need\nbuilding to hit their goals and dreams. Collectively, we have the ability to do that at scale. We need\nsomeone with the time and experience to guide our partners to the best results. And for the\ncompanies we are receiving an equity stake in, they are getting access to a seasoned Fortune 500\nCMO, which is a resource they would never be able to have on their own. So basically, that is the\nwhy about Ellie and now I'm going to talk about the why now. Because we're starting to prep for\nthe immediate future, one in which we expect to increase the pace of our 2.0 opportunity\nevaluations and negotiations. I know many listeners out there really, really like opportunities such\nas Crafthouse Cocktails for Dolphin. Quite frankly, these opportunities represent the value of\nbuilding a Super Group. It's what we knew from the very beginning. We have something unique,\nand companies are willing to pay us cash and equity to tap into our ability to reach consumers at\nscale. They believe that what we have, and what we can do, can be game changing for them. It's\nthat simple. And from our business perspective, we receive equity in companies we believe in\nwithout putting up cash ourselves. Actually, we receive cash along with the equity. It's a win-win\nand we get to fairly monetize what we have put together; the ability to access consumers at scale\nthrough every major vertical of pop culture -- movies, television, music, gaming, culinary,\nhospitality, and consumer products. Who else has that ability? We believe we have a strong\npipeline of those opportunities and we needed to organize ourselves to be able to execute on a slate\nof such opportunities and that's why we hired Ellie now.\nLastly, as CMO, part of Ellie's role on Dolphin’s growing executive leadership team will be\ntraditional -- to design and execute a communications plan that for the first time turns the spotlight\non ourselves, communicating what we have built, and giving an additional platform to both the\nwork we are doing and to the incredible leaders within our Dolphin family. Currently, Ellie is\ncollaborating with a team across Dolphin agencies to update the company's branding, messaging\nand materials. She too is a huge believer that the most powerful marketing is earned, which is to\nsay public relations and influencer marketing, and she is working hard to develop new messaging\nand methods to share our unique story.\nOkay, so, as we continue with Q4 2022 and recent highlights, Ellie’s addition then becomes even\nmore impactful due to the fact that in Q4 we expanded the number of companies in our Super\nGroup. To that end, in mid-November, we announced that Dolphin had brought leading influencer\nmarketing agency Socialyte into our family of best-in-class entertainment marketing agencies,\nTranscript Provided by\nalong with our West Coast influencer firm Be Social. Together, the two agencies represent over\n200 leading creative talent with hundreds of millions of followers on social media. Socialyte and\nBe Social operating under one roof immediately creates an unrivaled bicoastal combination within\nthe influencer marketing industry and we think gives us the entertainment industry's leading\ninfluencer marketing firm to go along with our best-in-class PR firms; 42West, Shore Fire, and\nThe Door. Part of the reason that is so important is because the influencer marketing industry has\nexperienced strong double-digit CAGR over the past five years, increasing from global brand\nspend of less than $2 billion in 2016 to an estimate of $14 billion in 2022. That's a 7x according\nto Grand View Research, and honestly, if we're being transparent, we think those numbers may be\nlow. Influencer Marketing is just exploding. Anecdotally, I don't think there's anybody on this call\nthat isn't aware of influencers on YouTube, on Instagram, on TikTok, that have enormous\nfollowings and enormous brand appeal.\nWith Socialyte and Be Social, we now expect that influencer marketing will represent 25% or\nmore of our revenues in 2023. And because influencer marketing is absolutely one of the fastest\ngrowing segments in all of marketing, we expect that percentage of our overall revenues to grow\nin the coming years.\nSpeaking of influence, Shore Fire Media, Dolphin's industry-leading music PR firm had its\ninfluence shine in Q4 2022 and year-to-date 2023. Shore Fire represented clients who collectively\nearned an incredible 45 nominations for the 2023 Grammy Awards and then in February, those\nclients received a collective 14 Grammy Awards, including Song of the Year for Bonnie Raitt and\nBest New Artist for Samara Joy. And for those who ever want to know the difference of elite PR\nversus very good PR, then I would say, Shore Fire just gave a masterclass in that for especially\nthose last two awards. Bonnie Raitt and Samara Joy are extremely talented artists that benefited\nfrom a beautifully run PR campaign to pull off upset wins in the biggest awards at the Grammys,\nright, Song of the Year and Best New Artist, incredible.\nAlso, let me just give a quick word on 42West, our film and television PR powerhouse. Their work\non Top Gun: Maverick, supported a worldwide box office total of almost $1.5 billion, the biggest\nof our client Tom Cruise's career to date. Additionally, Top Gun’s Oscar campaign resulted in six\nOscar nominations and an Academy Award for Best Sound and this all on top of running nearly\n100 Emmy nomination campaigns last September, holy sugar.\nAnd sticking with our PR firms for the moment, The Door, our leading culinary, hospitality, and\nlifestyle PR firm, had a busy fourth quarter that included placements for client Rachael Ray in\nVariety, work on campaigns for Honda's and Tao Hospitality Group.\nGiving a few words to Be Social, previously mentioned Dolphin’s West Coast influencer\nmarketing group, they had a busy quarter that included a holiday showroom, as well as influencer\npartnerships with Victoria's Secret, Wall Street Journal, Canada Goose, Resi, and American\nExpress to name a few.\nAnd lastly, to say a few words about Viewpoint Creative, Dolphin’s respected creative relations\nagency and video production boutique. Viewpoint’s work in Q4 and year-to-date included a brand\nTranscript Provided by\nimage campaign for CBS News, New York, NBC Peacock’s Sunday Night Football promos,\nwitnessed those live watching the games many times, and Pay Pal, of course.\nOkay, now let's shift gears to turn to providing updates on projects where Dolphin and its\nshareholders have equity and participate in the upside that our best-in-class marketing companies\nregularly enable for our clients. As many of you know, in 2022, Pan-Asian restaurant Hidden Leaf\nat The Midnight Theatre in Manhattan West opened. Midnight Theatre also held a soft opening\nand is partnered with MasterCard, as presenting sponsor for its programming. Dolphin manages\nall aspects of publicity and marketing for Midnight Theatre and Hidden Leaf and facilitates talent\nand commercial relationships within the entertainment and culinary industries. Dolphin also holds\na meaningful ownership stake in the venture. Throughout its soft launch, we have held several\nprivate events, some of which were full buyouts -- many of which were also movie or television\npremieres. We continue to ramp up the original programming in the theater, as we're nearing\ncompletion of the development of our own magic show, which we expect to begin previews here\ncoming up in Q2 with full opening of the theater. We're very excited for that.\nTurning to NFTs -- in Q4, we were pleased to report that our flagship NFT collection Creature\nChronicles minted on the Solana blockchain and featuring 7,777 custom-crafted avatars designed\nby Anthony Francisco, generated more than 13,000 in SOL in primary sales at mint time equaling\nabout $435,000. Many of you remember that occurred over 90 minutes on a Sunday afternoon. We\ncredit -- it was a complete sellout. We can credit the success of the project to the stunning visuals\nfrom Anthony, the commitment of our team, and the dedication of our community. We are very\nproud of the success. With all that said, though, despite the success of this initial collection, as\nnoted in our Q3 earnings call, we have paused the development of any new NFT collections, while\nwe wait to see if there's an improvement in overall market sentiment towards these products, as\nwell as the reinstatement of secondary royalties for new collections from the leading platforms.\nIt was also in 2022 that we announced a multi-year agreement with IMAX to jointly finance the\ndevelopment and production of a slate of feature-length documentaries for the global market. The\nfirst project greenlit is the Blue Angels, developed and co-produced with JJ Abrams, Bad Robot\nProductions and Zipper Bros Films. Blue Angels started filming last summer and is nearly finished\nproduction. We expect the film to hit IMAX theaters in the second half of this year. And on a side\nnote, this film looks really, really good. You can never predict hits in this business, but I've been\ndoing project financing for entertainment content since 1996, so I would say keep an eye out for\nthis one. We look forward to sharing more details in the coming weeks. Man, it looks good.\nAdditionally, during 2022, we drove value for Crafthouse Cocktails, a pioneering brand of ready-\nto-drink all natural classic cocktails created by world renowned mixologist Charles Joly and\nesteemed restaurant owner Matt Lindner. This is an arrangement that I mentioned at the top of the\ncall, wherein Dolphin received an ownership stake in the company and is compensated to manage\npublicity and marketing for the brand through our network of agencies.\nAll of these Dolphin ventures or Dolphin 2.0 projects are at various stages of development and\nwill begin to create meaningful revenues for us here we expect in 2023. And as I mentioned in the\nbeginning, with Ellie joining as CMO, we will be focused on building a slate of ventures where\nwe put up no cash, are paid cash, and receive ownership stakes generally between 5% and 10% of\nTranscript Provided by\nthe companies where our agencies can accelerate their growth. When we ramp up to -- excuse me,\nwhen we ramp up to full speed on the evaluation, negotiation and execution of these deals, we\nexpect to be able to add about three to four of those types of deals for us each year. And if so,\nwithin a very short period of time, those deals will create meaningful cash flow and will represent\nsignificant upside for Dolphin across the slate.\nSo, in summary, 2022 was a great year for us highlighted by the acquisition of Socialyte, the 50:50\ndeal with IMAX, and the soft opening of Midnight Theatre, and we expect 2023 to be even better.\nWe had double-digit growth crossing over $40 million in revenue. We certainly expect strong\ndouble-digit revenue growth again this year, with positive results from our 2.0 Ventures to share\nas well. Lastly, we expect 2023 will be the year we complete the original vision of our Super Group\nwith the acquisition of a live events production company that will give us the ability to take\nownership stakes in that vertical as well, which is highly strategic for us since our PR firms already\nmarket some of the country's most well-known food and music festivals, among many other live\nevents. I could not be prouder of what Dolphin has built, where we are today, and the path we are\non for this year and beyond to maximize shareholder value and to provide exciting opportunities\nacross a broad range of entertainment.\nThank you for joining us. And to that end, I'll now turn it over to Mirta.\nMirta Negrini - Chief Financial Officer, Dolphin Entertainment, Inc.\nThank you, Bill, and good afternoon everyone. I will now discuss results for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022. Revenue for the year ended December 31, 2022 was approximately $40.5\nmillion, 13% above the revenues for the year ended December 31, 2021 of approximately $35.7\nmillion. Overall operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2022 were approximately\n$45.1 million, compared to approximately $41.2 million in the prior year. Operating expenses are\ncomposed of direct costs, payroll and benefits, selling general and administrative costs, SG&A,\nacquisition costs, impairment of goodwill, change in fair value of contingent consideration,\ndepreciation and amortization, and legal and professional fees. Direct costs for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022 were $3.6 million, compared to $3.9 million in the prior year. Payroll costs\nwere approximately $29 million, compared to $24 million in the prior year. SG&A expenses for\nthe year ended December 31, 2022, were approximately $6.6 million, compared to $5.8 million in\nthe prior year. Legal and professional fees for the year ended December 31, 2022, were\napproximately $2.9 million, compared to $2 million in the prior year.\nOperating loss for the year ended December 31, 2022 of approximately $4.6 million include the\nnon-cash items from depreciation and amortization of $1.8 million, impairment of goodwill of\napproximately $900,000, a gain in the fair value of contingent consideration of approximately\n$47,000, and non-recurring costs consisting of acquisition costs in the amount of approximately\n$500,000, and legal and professional fees in the amount of approximately $600,000 related to the\nrestatement of our 2021 third quarter financial statements, the change in the audit firm, a financing\narrangement and the filing of our Form S-1. This compares to an operating loss for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2021 of $5.5 million, which includes non-cash items from depreciation and\namortization of $1.9 million and changes to the fair value of contingent consideration of $3.7\nmillion.\nTranscript Provided by\nNet loss for the year ended December 31, 2022 of $4.7 million includes non-cash items from\ndepreciation and amortization of $1.8 million, impairment of good will of approximately\n$900,000, gain on the change in fair value of contingent consideration of approximately $47,000,\nnon-recurring acquisition costs of approximately $500,000, legal and professional fees of\napproximately $600,000 related to the restatement of the 2021 Q3 financial statements, change of\naudit firm, financing arrangement and filing of our Form S-1 and gains from the changes in the\nfair value of certain liabilities of approximately $800,000. This compares to net loss for the year\nended December 31, 2021 of $6.5 million, which included non-cash items from depreciation and\namortization of $1.9 million, $3.7 million from changes in the fair value of contingent\nconsideration, and $3.1 million from changes in the fair value of certain liabilities offset by a gain\non the forgiveness of the Paycheck Protection Program loans of approximately $3 million.\nBasic loss per share for the year ended December 31, 2022 was $0.49 per share based on 9,799,021\nweighted average shares outstanding and fully diluted loss per share was $0.56 per share based on\n9,926,926 weighted average shares outstanding. This compares to $0.85 of basic and fully diluted\nloss per share based on 7,614,774 weighted average shares outstanding in the prior year.\nUnrestricted cash and cash equivalents of $6.1 million as compared to $7.7 million as of December\n31, 2021.\nThat concludes my financial remarks. I will now ask the operator to open the phone line for Q&A.\nOperator, can you please poll for questions?\nOperator\n[Operator Instructions] The first question is coming from Allen Klee from Maxim Group. Allen,\nyour line is live.\nInterviewer: Yes. Hi, good afternoon and congrats on so many things. Just so I’m trying to\nunderstand like the momentum and if I want to try to strip out like NFT's to think of it's reasonable\nto say the $433,000, that won't repeat, is there anything else like extra money you were making on\nDolphin 1.0 of marketing them that was material that we should think cuts back in 2023?\nBill O’Dowd - Chief Executive Officer, Dolphin Entertainment, Inc.\nNo, actually -- thank you for the kind words at the start Allen. If anything, 2022, removing NFT's\nis a net positive for us in 2023, not because we weren't successful in selling that collection, and\nCharles Dougiello and the whole team did a great job. But, we invested over the course of maybe\n15 months, over a million dollars into building out our NFT capabilities. Over $800,000 of that, I\nbelieve, hit in 2022 that were all expensed with the expectation that we would launch multiple\nNFT collections over the coming years and make a nice return on investment. Certainly $400,000\non the first collection is a good start, right, to recoup a million. But, as you can see, since we paused\nthe NFT business, just by not doing NFTs, 2023 should be a net of 600,000 or so -- $400,000 to\n$600,000 better, just because we don't have to re-expense the build of the platform. With that said,\nif we ever restart NFTs, then we don't expect nearly that type of expense to put up another\ncollection of them, because we don't have to do some of the actions more than once. So it's a shame\nTranscript Provided by\nwhere NFTs headed after we spent so much time and energy building an expertise in that, but we'll\nsee if they come back.\nInterviewer: Okay, great. And then if I have to guesstimate a little bit of 2.0 revenues in 2023, the\nbig picture way to think about it of stuff is that you might get something from Midnight Theatre\nand Hidden Leaf, maybe more in the second half, if you have the full launch of Midnight Theatre\nin the second quarter, and then IMAX movie could be more like a third quarter event. Is there\nanything else I should be thinking about, besides those two things?\nBill O’Dowd - Chief Executive Officer, Dolphin Entertainment, Inc.\nWell, those two are pretty big. Yeah and with Midnight Theatre getting to fully programmed and\nas you know, sometime this summer, late summer, early fall, being seven days a week of\nprogramming and theater and private events and in the restaurant, then that'll be meaningful. The\nIMAX movie can be very meaningful, based on what we've seen so far, and that will be -- our\nexpectation is that it'll be in theaters late Q3, so that's nice. So yeah, those are certainly two things\nwe wanted to highlight. We have some more 2.0 opportunities we expect to generate some revenue\nin the second half of this year that we'll be announcing in the coming weeks. Certainly that we're\nexcited by but nothing we want to announce right now.\nInterviewer: Okay, thank you. And then Socialyte, I think you would publish somewhere that --\nI think that they did like$ 4.5 million in the nine months of 2022, so that's going to be a big benefit\nfor your 2023 numbers. Is there a way to think about if it's going to have in those synergies between\nthem and Be Social that we could see in 2023?\nBill O’Dowd - Chief Executive Officer, Dolphin Entertainment, Inc.\nOh, yeah. Thank you for that question, Allen. I mean, we were blessed to bring Socialyte in to\ncomplement Be Social and then, obviously, we'll look at opportunities to have those companies\ncome even closer together, if you will, but they're a highly strategic benefit. They benefit and\ncomplement each other. The scale that on -- each company has two main divisions, they have a\ntalent management division and by combining the two we have scale to compete with and we think\nwe've established a leading, if not the leading, influencer management firm. On the brand side, the\nother division, it gives us highly complementary skills. Socialyte does paid campaigns, so when a\nbrand -- Airbnb comes and says we want to do a fall campaign we have $1 million budget, will\nyou help us identify that right influencers based on the demographics we want to hit, go contract\nwith them, organize the campaign, make sure that influencers do what they're supposed to do on\nthe time they're supposed to do it, report back to us the metrics etc. That's paid. And typically\nSocialyte takes a percentage of the overall campaign, so 20%, 30% of $1 million.\nBe Social does organic campaigns, where the brands may come to them and say, hey, we don't\nhave money to spend on the influencers, but we'll give out sample products, free products, if you\ncan get them to try it, and post about it and we'll pay you a fee of $20,000, $30,000, $40,000,\n$50,000 for each of those campaigns, and do more volume over them. The reason why it's highly\ncomplementary, besides now owning a leading agency, if not the leading agency, for each type of\ninfluencer campaign, is that not just can you offer both services now in house, but many brands\nTranscript Provided by\nrun both types of influencer campaigns. Within the same campaign, they could have both paid and\norganic to support their fall launch. Certainly almost every brand runs each type of campaign at\nsome point throughout the year. So you get longer client relationships, deeper client relationships,\nas they say, a bigger share of clients’ wallet and you just have a lot more ways to cross sell in the\ninfluencers as well.\nAnd we're now fully bicoastal, Be Social was only in the West Coast. Now we have New York as\nwell, we have Miami, we have Nashville. So everywhere where our PR firms have offices, we now\nactually have on the ground influencer marketing people as well and that shouldn't be understated.\nAnd in today's world where breaking marketing down into two buckets, paid media and earned\nmedia, earned media is the province of public relations and influencer marketing. They're the two\nlegs that you stand on in our media. And as longtime listeners have heard, for every company that\ncan afford a paid media campaign, there are nine companies I think that can't. And so these brands\nthat launch will need PR and influencer marketing to get their word out and get their products and\nservices noticed, and so you really want to have influencer marketing to complement PR. And if\nyou have both, you have a powerhouse, and that's what we think we've built. So hopefully that\ngave you a sense of the strategy of why Socialyte and -- what Socialyte and Be Social together\nhave is formidable.\nInterviewer: Thank you. When I look at the other PR and marketing firms that you have in your\nportfolio, what are the drivers for organic growth in 2023?\nBill O’Dowd - Chief Executive Officer, Dolphin Entertainment, Inc.\nWell, a couple of things. And we're starting to see one the cross selling just keeps going, right. So\nthat's what was driving organic growth. When we -- even before Socialyte, in 2021, many of you\nremember how fast we were growing just organically from like it was $7.2 million in Q1, $8.6\nmillion in Q2, $9.4 million in Q3, and $10.5 million in Q4, and that was all organic, there's no\nacquisition in there. What the -- that happens because we're getting better at creating synergies\nbetween our companies. But then secondly, you can go after different types of clients. So, Pay Pal\nhas been one for a while, but we've signed other clients now that are, let's call it traditional Fortune\n500s or large companies that don't have a direct tie to entertainment, but they want to use pop\nculture to get the word out about their product. And quite frankly, if you have any consumer facing\nproduct, you could probably use pop culture to create consumer awareness, right, because we're\nall human beings and we have multiple interests and so I might want to buy this makeup line today\nbut I'm a huge fan of White Lotus, right, which is a TV show that 42West represents. So are there\norganic ways to have conversations or reach out about different things to the consumer and let\nthem know about different opportunities that way. So, where a lot of our organic growth among\nthe PR firms can come from, and there are many different sources, but one such source is just\ngoing from 0 to 50 in terms of the number of classic non-entertainment companies that use our\nservices to reach the general consumer.\nI'm thinking of -- we mentioned Häagen-Dazs on this call, there's a great example out of the\nConsumer Products Division of The Door again, and Charlie and the team, they're handling that\naccount where Häagen-Dazs, by the way, does a very large influencer marketing business with us\nas well that would not have been a client of traditional entertainment PR firms perhaps even three\nTranscript Provided by\nyears ago. And they've had celebrity campaigns now through The Door and others that have done\nvery well. So if you can have a company with a Pay Pal, with a Häagen-Dazs, with blank, blank,\nblank, blank, blank of some of our other clients, you can just grow organically, ad infinitum.\nAnd we hired Ellie Doty, and for the first time, as I said on the call, now, we've hit scale in a\ndifferent way. We've had scale in the types of companies we have under the umbrella, and we've\ngot reach. So now if we market ourselves -- that can be to Wall Street, that could be to our own\nstakeholders, but that could be to the broader business community, corporate community -- and all\nof a sudden, we've got something different. And there are a lot of Chief Marketing Officers, Digital\nMarketing Officers, Social Marketing Officers out there, and these companies are trying to figure\nout how they get their word out. And here's a Dolphin over here that has all these different services\nand all this different type of reach using pop culture, and you can't fake it, you can't just say, oh,\nwe're a traditional PR firm, we'll get you into entertainment. How are we going to do that? Versus\nDolphin where we can say, well, we promote James Bond, Top Gun, Mission Impossible, Bruce\nSpringsteen, Chance the Rapper, Dave Matthews Band, Rachael Ray, Robert Irvine, Emeril\nLagasse, South Beach Wine & Food, New York Food & Wine, Super Bowl Music Fest; case\nclosed, right. So that's what we want to do and I think that's how we're going to drive a lot of\norganic growth for our PR firms.\nInterviewer: That's great. Last quarter, you mentioned a business you were going to be starting\nup, a celebrity chef business in New Orleans with Nina Compton. Any update on where that\nstands?\nBill O’Dowd - Chief Executive Officer, Dolphin Entertainment, Inc.\nSure, yeah, ShaSha Lounge. We're very excited for that one, too and, quite frankly, that should be\none of those things I was mentioning that should happen in the second half of this year.\nMemberships will go on sale in the next few weeks. And thank you again, Charlie. The Door,\nagain, has done a great job bringing that, ideating that with Nina and her husband and then bringing\nthat to life and so it's about to about to kick off. And we couldn't be more excited for that because\nwith success in New Orleans, many people that listened on previous earnings calls know that we\nhave a very scalable model there since Nina and Charlie in the team that brought in other celebrity\nchefs to do guest appearances, for lack of a better word, at the lounge and restaurant in New\nOrleans that can become the home for the same concept in other cities. So whether it's Michelle\nBernstein in Miami or Rodney Scott in Charleston or Stephanie Izard in Chicago, we're hopeful\nfor that. And I don't know if many of you listening saw the profil last week in The New York\nTimes about just the proliferation of membership only restaurants in Palm Beach in Florida, where\nI'm from, interesting profile in the Times. We see that just burgeoning.\nAnd by the way, if you're not familiar with this concept, I mean, the initiation fees to join a\nrestaurant only club in Palm Beach start at $10,000 in many places, routinely $20,000, and there\nare some that go as high as $250,000. That's quite an initiation fee for a restaurant that you then\ngo pay to have a meal at, so this type of idea of private membership clubs and the hybrid that's\nwhat Nina will do, you know open to the public but also a private membership club is something\nwe're very interested in, and that we feel we're uniquely positioned to promote and that could be a\nmassive growth driver. I'm not just talking about ShaSha, but just the general category of those\nTranscript Provided by\ntype establishments over the next three to five years and -- because the economics are extremely\nappealing if you can market them and get the membership. So seems like we're well positioned to\nhelp people that want to do that.\nInterviewer: My last two questions are financial related. First, how do you think about operating\nexpense growth in 2023, relative to revenue?\nBill O’Dowd - Chief Executive Officer, Dolphin Entertainment, Inc.\nWell, you'll see the jump in SG&A in 2021 -- or 2022 to 2023. It'll also be a little bit of a jump in\n2023 -- sorry, 2021 to 2022. It'll be a little bit of a jump in 2023 as we have Socialyte for a full\nyear. But we don't expect operating expense increases beyond typical payroll increases. We like\nwhere we are, in terms of operating expenses, some of it will go down because, again, we're not\nexpensing the building of an NFT business. But I don't expect any surprises. Obviously, we\nhighlighted two that the change in audit firms was an expense that we didn't anticipate, prior to the\nyear. It's a one-time expense of $600,000. We don't anticipate having that again this year and other\nrelated expenses to the change in audit firms. So, yeah, we feel pretty good about not having some\nof the recurring -- some of those one-time costs just won't recur. So we don't anticipate anything\non the horizon that would cause our operating expenses to jump up.\nInterviewer: Okay, great. I don't know if you can answer this. Maybe I could ask this offline, but\nI just was trying to get a sense of your operating income for the quarter was around a minus 3\nmillion. But then if I add back the various one-time items, you mentioned, impairment of goodwill\nchanges, fair value contingent, non recurring, I think I get to around $880,000 of kind of a -- this\nis back of the envelope, adjusted EBITDA, I don't know if you can tell me a sanity check on that\nmakes sense or we could take it offline.\nBill O’Dowd - Chief Executive Officer, Dolphin Entertainment, Inc.\nWell, we can go through each of those numbers offline, happy to do it. Yeah. I mean, we have\nrelatively significant non-cash expenses, and then there's one-time charges, so it's kind of why we\nhighlight it so people can see that we had$ 40 million in revenue but we expect to do double-digit\ngrowth on that this year, wouldn't surprise us if we're 50 plus and we expect to be EBITDA\npositive. We measure ourselves by operating income and taking away the non-cash charges, like\ndepreciation and amortization. That's how we know if we feel like we're doing well. So we're\ntransitioning Dolphin into that stage where we want to be and expect to be cash positive on an\nannual basis and then we have these 2.0 opportunities such as provide that really great upside. If\nyou have something that can pay off seven figure profits to you from a successful 2.0 venture,\nwhen you've got a $40 million, $50 million revenue company and single digit millions of profit\nand cash, that could double your profit, triple your profit. It's meaningful to a company our size.\nSo that's the mousetrap we've built. And I know, Allen, you've been with us from the beginning.\nYou've seen it from when we acquired 42West and wanted to up-list in NASDAQ and hopefully\nbuild a group. For those on the call that have known us for a while to see where we are now; seven\nacquisitions later, one more to go, to complete the original vision of building a Super Group that\nwould be unique in the market, that would be cash positive, and then have the upside of these 2.0\nopportunities, we're pretty far along in that story now. So, very lucky, feel very blessed about that.\nTranscript Provided by\nInterviewer: Okay, fantastic. Thank you for answering all my questions.\nBill O’Dowd - Chief Executive Officer, Dolphin Entertainment, Inc.\nSure.\nOperator\nThank you. There were no other questions from the lines.

Now, I'd like to turn the\ncall over to Bill O'Dowd, Chief Executive Officer of Dolphin Entertainment. Bill, please\nproceed.\nBill O'Dowd - Chairman & CEO, Dolphin Entertainment, Inc.\nThanks, James, and hi everyone. Good afternoon. And thank you for joining us today. As you\nmight expect, I'll start off the call by spending some time with breaking news of today --\nbringing Socialyte into the Dolphin family, followed by an update on various Dolphin initiatives\nand a full financial review, and then we'll open it up for Q&A.\nSo, here we go. I'll begin by giving a brief description of Socialyte. The company was founded in\n2011, the early days of social media marketing. Socialyte is an influencer marketing powerhouse,\nwith teams in New York, Los Angeles, Miami and Nashville representing some of the most\nsought-after creators, from digital-only to celebrity-level talent.\nSocialyte has a client roster of more than 125 market-leading influencers, including Jana Kramer,\nLauren Bushnell Lane, Catt Sadler, and Mary Fitzgerald. For this high-end roster of talent,\nSocialyte secures thousands of campaigns each year with such leading brands as Amazon,\nAmerican Express, Bose, Cartier, Target and more.\nSo, Socialyte has the talent roster and manages the talent's careers and secures campaigns for the\ntalent. Socialyte has a sister agency Lytehouse, which also came into the Dolphin family, which\nrepresents some of the world's most iconic brands, providing the full suite of services for\ninfluencer campaigns, from strategy and casting, through execution and delivery, with in-depth\nanalytics and reporting. So Lytehouse comes at it from the brand side, and the company delivers\nhundreds of campaigns annually with current and recent clients including Airbnb, Amazon,\nAmerican Express, Ann Taylor, Armani Beauty, Audi, Conde Nast, Etsy, Keurig Dr. Pepper,\nMichael Kors, Perrier, Prada, Ralph Lauren and W Hotels.\nOkay, so, now that you know a little bit about Socialyte, let me describe why this is a highly\nstrategic acquisition for us. I'll give you three reasons. First, this gives us scale in influencer\nmarketing. With Be Social and Socialyte under one roof, we now have what we consider to be\nthe leading influencer marketing agency in the entertainment industry to go along with our three\nmarket-leading PR firms in each of their verticals.\n200 influencers on roster with hundreds of millions of collective social media followers. And\nnow, we have an unmatched presence in the two U.S. capitals for influencer marketing with New\nYork based Socialyte and Los Angeles based Be Social.\nSecondly, that scale allows us to take full advantage of the very strong brand spend growth\nacross influencer marketing. It's not just that in today's Earned Media influencer marketing\nTranscript Provided by\nrepresents the “other half” along with PR, it's which verticals we are uniquely positioned across\nto offer the benefit of the scale we just achieved.\nLet me share some relevant stats. The influencer marketing industry has experienced strong\ndouble-digit CAGR over the past five years increasing from global brand spend of less than $2\nbillion in 2016 to over $10 billion in 2021 with estimates of more than $14 billion in 2022\naccording to Grand View Research. Less than $2 billion in 2016 and expected to be over $14\nbillion this year.\nSo the industry is one of the fastest growing as any brand marketer can tell you. But which\ncategories use influencer marketing the most? Now you will see why this is so strategic for\nDolphin. Again, citing Grand View Research here, in 2021, fashion and lifestyle was the largest\nsegment with 29% of total spend, which is the exact specialty of Socialyte, Lytehouse and Be\nSocial.\nGreat. We've now built scale, and leadership in the largest segment of the extremely fast-growing\ninfluencer marketing industry. But what about additional growth? Well, the second largest\nsegment in 2021 with 23% of total spend was food and entertainment. The exact specialty of\nDolphin's three market-leading PR firms.\nSo over 50% of total brand spend in influencer marketing last year went into fashion, beauty,\nlifestyle, food and entertainment. The exact verticals represented by our super group. That would\nbe over $7 billion this year with the industry at 14. Collectively, the Dolphin Companies\nrepresent approximately 1,000 clients including global celebrities, feature films, television series,\nstreaming services, musicians, venues, festivals, video game publishers, e-sports teams and\nleagues, culinary celebrities, hotels, toy companies, consumer product brands and Web 3 and\nNFT projects, as well as awards campaigns for nominees in over 100 Oscar, Emmy and Grammy\ncategories in 2022 alone.\nSpeaking plainly, when an influencer is considering where to call home or a brand is considering\nhow an influencer campaign can get them noticed by the general consumer through the broad\nlens of pop culture and entertainment, we believe we have a unique proposition in the\nmarketplace.\nAnd for our PR firms, the Door cannot open a restaurant or a hotel in today's environment\nwithout an influencer marketing campaign. Our PR firm Short Fire would find a strong\ninfluencer marketing campaign extremely beneficial in launching a single or album or a concert\ntour and if you don't think social media is important to launching music these days, you are\nrespectfully living under a rock. You get the idea.\nNow the third reason, why this acquisition was so strategic for Dolphin after giving us scale and\naccess to take advantage of the fast-growing influencer marketing industry generally and in our\nverticals specifically, the third reason why this acquisition was so strategic for Dolphin is\nbecause at the elite levels of Socialyte and Be Social, the influencers on rosters themselves have\nlarge enough followings to where they are celebrities in their own rights and many have\nambitions to be positioned to “crossover” into traditional media and many more have launched a\nTranscript Provided by\nwide array of consumer products and business centers. Our group is uniquely positioned to take\nadvantage of this market opportunity.\nAs influencers and celebrities seek to further spread their interest and monetize their platforms\nand followings, the rate at which they have been launching brands and products continues to rise.\nThe categories of beauty, lifestyle and fashion are particularly well suited to influencer product\nlaunches as demonstrated by the countless examples in recent years, perhaps the highest upside\ngrowth opportunity for Dolphin's scale is Socialyte and Be Social and it's the focus on pitching,\nfacilitating and sharing and the revenues created by influencer brands and content to generate\nfurther recurring revenue and value for Dolphin and its shareholders.\nOkay. So, now that you know about Socialyte and our strategic rationale for bringing them into\nthe Dolphin family, let me state that they are growing, and like Be Social, we believe we can\ngrow them even faster by cross-selling their services to clients across our PR firms.\nWith Socialyte and Be Social, we now expect that influencer marketing will represent 25% or\nmore of our revenues in 2023 and for more than that I don't want to get ahead of our 10-Q and 8-\nK filings. To share more on those topics we'll wait until after we have released that information.\nFor final details, Socialyte and its 40 employee team will continue to operate under its own name\nout of Dolphin's New York and LA offices, with if I say so, the very impressive CEO, Sarah\nBoyd and its entire staff welcomed into the Dolphin family of agencies. Furthermore, Socialyte\nChairman, Evan Luzzatto will continue as an advisor to Dolphin.\nAll right, cool. Let's shift gears to turn to providing updates on projects where Dolphin and its\nshareholders have equity in participating in the upside that our best-in-class marketing\ncompanies regularly enable for our clients and, by the way, for which going forward, Socialyte\nwill provide another asset to use for the benefit of these ownership stakes.\nSince we last spoke in August, we held a soft opening on September 21 from Midnight Theatre,\na new restaurant and variety theatre in New York's Manhattan West, Brookfield Properties' latest\nneighborhood development between 9th and 10th Avenues and West 31st and 33rd streets. The\nnight before our soft opening we prepped the theater with Peacock's premier of new romantic\ncomedy Meet Cute. Midnight Theatre's red carpet was stacked with national media covering the\narrival of the film's stars Pete Davidson and Kaley Cuoco. We had a sold out show last Monday\nwith the British singer Raye and while we seek to continue to ramp up the original programming\nin the theatre through the holiday season and into the winter, by which time we expect to be open\nevery day of the week.\nThe private events business in the theatre is already off to a terrific start. In the short time since\nthe soft opening, we have held well over a dozen private events, some of which were full buy\nouts, meaning both the theater and the restaurant, and the clients are top-tier including our\nprogramming sponsor Mastercard, as well as Accenture, Ernst & Young, both of them happen to\nbe neighbors inside Manhattan West One Tower and L'Oréal, Paramount, Riot Games for our\nreal cool League of Llegends event with Mastercard and SHOWTIME.\nTranscript Provided by\nNow turning to NFTs, on October 3rd, just after the quarter ended, we were pleased to report that\nour flagship NFT collection Creature Chronicles, a galactic immersive story telling experience\nfrom former Marvel Studios artist Anthony Francisco, sold out in about 90 minutes on the\nafternoon of Sunday October 2. The first Creature Chronicles collection developed and marketed\nby Dolphin's Web3 division We Come In Peace was minted on the Solana blockchain and\nfeatured 7,777 custom-crafted avatars generating more than 13,175 SOL in primary sales at mint\ntime equaling about $435,000. We credit the success of the project to the stunning visuals from\nAnthony, the commitment of our team and the dedication of our community. We are very proud\nof this success.\nWith that said though, we are very aware of the recent developments in the crypto space and\nwe'll continue to monitor the space as we decide on prudent paths forward with our NFT\nbusiness. I would like to point out that Dolphin has no exposure in the pending FTX bankruptcy\nproceedings and we have no assets inside FTX wallets.\nOur most recent announcement in late October was about a partnership with Nina Compton, the\nJames Beard Award Winning chef and owner of Compère Lapin and Bywater American Bistro\nin New Orleans, to open together ShaSha Lounge, a membership cocktail club and lounge in the\nCrescent City. Dolphin will be providing marketing services for fees and receiving a meaningful\nownership stake in the venture, as well. The announcement was made as part of the first annual\nFresh Mint Festival, New Orleans' Web3 conference and festival, where Dolphin executives\nmoderated a panel on how Web3 and NFTs are impacting the face of the food and beverage and\nhospitality industries.\nWhat I really like about this initiative is its inclusion of a variety of other celebrity chefs and its\nclear line of sight for national expansion and success. From the get go, five major celebrity chefs\nhave joined the ownership group -- Marc Forgione from New York, Stephanie Izard from\nChicago, Michelle Bernstein from Miami, Rodney Scott from Charleston, and Tiffani Faison\nfrom Boston. Right about now James Carbonara is salivating.\nEach of these chefs will visit New Orleans every year and offer custom menu items and cocktails\nfor the general public and also provide unique experiences for those who become members. That\nalone immediately distinguishes this concept and if you are a foodie, you know all five of those\nnames to go along with Nina Compton, six of the 12 chefs. But it also allows for the national\nexpansion I mentioned. Upon success in New Orleans, ShaSha can be brought to each of the\nother celebrity chefs hometowns where they would have control to concept the menu and also\ntake the largest share of profits supported by all of the other chefs in the network for a visit each\nyear.\nAnd in all there will be a total of 12 celebrity chefs in the initial rollout of ShaSha so you can see\nthe scalability of the project. ShaSha Lounge is a truly brilliant concept developed by The Door\nin partnership with Nina Compton and her management team and it is in alignment with The\nDoors professional expertise in marketing culinary destinations and the Dolphin's family's\npassion for charitable giving.\nTranscript Provided by\nNina's pledge that a portion of membership sales will go to support future disaster relief in New\nOrleans is a gracious and forward thinking win-win. And honestly to give Nina her due with the\nstarting point for the creative development of what became ShaSha. And being a native Miamian\nI know what it's like to get hit hard by hurricanes. So special shout out to Nina Compton on this\nearnings call.\nThank you for joining us on this ride and to walk through the financials, I'll now turn it over to\nMirta Negrini, our CFO.\nMirta Negrini - CFO & COO, Dolphin Entertainment, Inc.\nThank you, Bill, and good afternoon, everyone. I will now discuss results for the quarter ended\nSeptember 30, 2022. Revenues for the quarter were approximately $9.9 million as compared to\napproximately $9.4 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2021. Overall, operating\nexpenses for the quarter ended September 30, 2022 were approximately $11 million, compared\nto approximately $10.5 million in the same period of the prior year.\nOperating expenses are composed of direct costs, payroll and benefits, selling, general and\nadministrative costs, SG&A, acquisition costs, depreciation and amortization, legal and\nprofessional fees and changes in the fair value of contingent consideration.\nDirect costs decreased by approximately $200,000 to approximately $837,000. The decrease was\nprimarily attributable to the decrease in Viewpoint's revenue in comparison with the same period\nin the prior year as Viewpoint incurred third-party cost related to the productions of marketing\nmaterials which are included in direct costs.\nPayroll and benefit expenses increased by approximately $1.2 million to approximately $7\nmillion, primarily due to additional headcount in 2022 to support the growth of our business and\nstock compensation issued to our employees under the 2017 plan. SG&A costs were\napproximately the same during the three months ended September 30, 2022 as compared to the\nsame period in the prior year.\nAcquisition costs of approximately $300,000 were primarily legal and professional fees related\nto the Socialyte deal. There were no acquisition costs during the same period in the prior year.\nLegal and professional fees increased by approximately $300,000 to approximately $800,000.\nThe increase is primarily due to legal and auditor fees associated with the Lincoln Park\nagreement and the filing of the S-1 and consulting fees for the implementation of a new\nenterprise resource planning system. These are all one-time costs.\nOperating loss for the quarter ended September 30, 2022 of $1.1 million includes non-cash items\nfrom depreciation and amortization of $415,836, a gain in the change of fair value of contingent\nconsideration of $5,000, as compared to an operating loss of $1.1 million for the quarter ended\nSeptember 30, 2021, which included non-cash items from depreciation and amortization of\n$475,207, and a loss in the change of fair value of contingent consideration of $1.1 million.\nTranscript Provided by\nNet loss of approximately $1.3 million or $0.14 per share based on 9,664,681 weighted average\nshares outstanding for basic loss per share and $0.14 per share based on 9,793,715 weighted\naverage shares on a fully diluted loss per share basis for the three months ended September 30,\n2022.\nThe net loss of $1.3 million includes non-cash items from depreciation and amortization of\n$415,836, a gain in the change of fair value contingent consideration of $5,000, a gain in the\nchange of fair value of warrants and convertible notes of $55,642 and loss on the equity\ninvestments of unconsolidated affiliates of approximately $100,000.\nNet income was $141,651 or $0.02 per share based on 7,740,085 weighted average shares\noutstanding for both basic and diluted earnings per share for the three months ended September\n30, 2021. Net income for the quarter ended September 30, 2021 of $141,651 includes non-cash\nitems from depreciation and amortization of $475,207, a loss in the change of fair value of\ncontingent consideration of $1.1 million, a loss in the change of fair value of warrants and\nconvertible notes of $278,923 and a net gain of $1.7 million for the extinguishment of debt.\nThat concludes my financial remarks. I will now ask the operator to open the phone lines for\nQ&A. Operator, would you please poll for questions?\nOperator\nThank you. [Operator Instructions] First we'll go to James Carbonara with our Investor\nRelations.\nJames Carbonara - Investor Relations, Dolphin Entertainment, Inc.\nThank you, operator and hi, Bill. Allen Klee of Maxim Group emailed in four questions. The\nfirst one is, what is your plan on NFTs, given all that's happening with FTX current prices and\nvolumes?\nBill O'Dowd - Chairman & CEO, Dolphin Entertainment, Inc.\nSure. This is unusual. We need to evaluate it, to be quite honest, I mean, the crypto space is\nobviously in quite a bit of turmoil right now. We've weathered and pushed the launch of Creature\nChronicles to out past what was socially the crypto winner of the spring and summer. We had a\nvery successful launch. I don't know where crypto is going to from here and we need to just take\nit day-by-day without making any hard promises one way or the other.\nAs I mentioned, Allen, you may not have heard because he is emailing these questions, but as I\nmentioned in my prepared remarks, we don't have any exposure on the FTX side. And we'll see\nwhat it all means as we go forward and live it day by day. We do believe we have an expertise\nand being able to market in that space and it's proven by Creature Chronicles, proven by the hard\nwork the team does for a variety of clients every day, but I don't know that we can commit today\nto knowing what the future is going to hold.\nTranscript Provided by\nJames Carbonara - Investor Relations, Dolphin Entertainment, Inc.\nGreat. And then, his next one, which I think you may have already addressed was, please provide\nan update on the Midnight Theatre and Hidden Leaf.\nBill O'Dowd - Chairman & CEO, Dolphin Entertainment, Inc.\nYes, the space is gorgeous, the theater is gorgeous, the restaurant is gorgeous.\nTheater is unique. Those walls that are interactive and high fidelity projection will allow for\nsome really cool experiences and we knew -- I was educated on the process -- during the process\nabout how popular space would be for private events and the team believed in that they knew it\nfrom beginning. Brookfield was very complimentary of its potential for private events during the\nconstruction phase and I think to a sponsor of those private events they all want to come back for\nmore.\nSo, it's a really nice environment and brand new space. It gives us the private events that are\nnecessary for any venue. The next step is to get our programming right and getting it up seven\ndays a week.\nJames Carbonara - Investor Relations, Dolphin Entertainment, Inc.\nGreat. And then, the third of his four questions is, any other changes in 2.0 initiatives?\nBill O'Dowd - Chairman & CEO, Dolphin Entertainment, Inc.\nWell, he probably would have liked the comments about ShaSha. I mean, I know there are some\nof our folks probably listening to this call that really like the ShaSha model and so do we. It's not\njust ShaSha -- we do feel like having access to the Super Group only bolstered by Socialyte right\nnow gives us an opportunity to participate in the revenues or profits of the clients or in equity of\nthe clients.\nWe've done a couple of those deals in the past, ShaSha is one that combines that concept being a\nclient and we can market ShaSha and get paid to market ShaSha, but also have a meaningful\nownership percentage in it to help make ShaSha in New Orleans more of a success and hope\nexpand it nationally. So, that's a very good deal for both sides and we feel very good about that.\nSo, those types of deals where we get a little bit of both worlds – cash and equity -- are very\nappealing and congrats to Charlie Dougeillo and The Door for being there from the beginning\nand for ideating what that could be. So there is an example.\nNina Compton is pretty darn big and a group of 12 chefs is a pretty big deal. And so, I think this\njust opens up a lounge that's open to the public, but also has a membership program component.\nSo, there is a good example of I think something that we are excited about in 2.0 since we last\nspoke.\nTranscript Provided by\nJames Carbonara - Investor Relations, Dolphin Entertainment, Inc.\nGreat. And then, Allen's last question any commentary related to outlook?\nBill O'Dowd - Chairman & CEO, Dolphin Entertainment, Inc.\nYes, sure. Let's see, well, I mean, obviously, whatever I would have said, before Socialyte,\nwould change with Socialyte, right, and by the way, it's a bit fun in commentary, we don't -- I\nwas thinking about just how to convey it in brief comments, the growth of the influencer\nmarketing industry to those who may not be as familiar with it. I went back and I remember\nwhen Dolphin was producing shows at Nickelodeon we were starting to dabble with online\ncontent.\nThis is before Netflix streaming its first original series Lilyhammer back about 2008 we had\n“Zoey 101” on the air. And I remember having the first conversations with digital groups at\nCAA and others. And I think Facebook somebody correct me if I'm wrong went public in '06, I\nthink it's about right and I looked up from '08 when we were playing the beginning slates, the\noriginal series for AOL and Facebook called Aim High. This is a great journey question. What\nwas the average time an American spent on social media in 2008, two years after Facebook went\npublic, it was eight minutes -- eight minutes a day and last year, it was 2 hours and 24 minutes a\nday, average. So, it's not a surprise that brands followed eyeballs and the eyeballs of the average\nAmerican.\nSo, Socialyte will change things, obviously on both revenue and profit but, as I look back at Q3,\nam I happy with our revenue growth? I think that had Creature Chronicles gone in Q3 instead of\nQ4, we would have had a double-digit revenue growth story again year-over-year, we are still on\npace for $40 million of revenue this year without Socialyte.\nAnd I do think that Q3 would look actually different if we didn’t have the non-cash charges and\nthe non-recurring expenses and the acquisition costs and the professional and legal fees,\nSo, if you took away those one-time expenses of the professional and legal fees that are both\nnormal in the transaction costs, and the non-cash depreciation and we would have made probably\na small profit and would have been a bigger profit $0.5 million or so which would have been\nhappier with Creature Chronicles launch two days earlier. But it's -- I think our outlook stays the\nsame, we are happy with the way Q4 is shaping up, what our revenue is going to be and then\nobviously next year our profits will increase, revenues will significantly increase, both will\nactually and we are excited about that. So I think that's a fair summary and as I mentioned in the\nprepared remarks we now have an influencer marketing combination that is equivalent to anyone\nof our PR firms verticals.\nThe combination of Socialyte and Be Social will represent about 25% of our company's revenue.\nAnd that's very meaningful and that's on par with each of our three PR verticals, right obviously.\nSo, I think that PR and influencer marketing are going to complement each other. Be Social has\ngrown very well within our family and I expect the same with Socialyte.\nTranscript Provided by\nJames Carbonara - Investor Relations, Dolphin Entertainment, Inc.\nThank you, Bill. That concludes the questions received from Allen Klee of Maxim Group. I'll\nhand it back to the operator. Operator?\nOperator\nThank you. And at this time, this will conclude our Q&A session. I'll turn it back to management\nif there are any additional or closing remarks.\nBill O'Dowd - Chairman & CEO, Dolphin Entertainment, Inc.\nMan, I missed both Allen's voice and another question. Well, thank you. Thank you for listening\nand obviously a very exciting day. I don't want to bury the lead and we could not being more\nthrilled to add Socialyte to the Dolphin family, the management team as I quickly alluded to in\nthe prepared remarks are outstanding, CEO, Sarah Boyd, is very, very impressive and a great\nleader, same with Amanda Sorenson in New York and Roy Peters in Los Angeles, I really enjoy\ngetting to know them.\nI had a lot of respect for the Luzzatto family, Mark and Evan, very kind people and I know that\nthey are going to be allied with Dolphin for years to come and significant shareholders in\nDolphin. So, it's an exciting time for Dolphin and I'm very, very happy with this transaction\nheading into holiday season which as anyone knows is the prime season for influencer\nmarketing, it's not out of the ordinary that half of the year’s profits or more can come in the\nfourth quarter. So, I hope we all have a happy holiday season and if I don't talk to everyone on\nthe call before then, our best to you and yours and I look forward to the next time we get an\nopportunity to speak. Thank you everybody.\nOperator\nThank you. This concludes today's call. We thank you for your participation. You may\ndisconnect at any time.\nTranscript Provided by"

As always,\nwe’ll start with a review of some financial and operating highlights followed by a full financial\nreview and then we’ll open it up for Q&A.\nSo, starting with the financials, Q2 revenue of $10.3 million represented a 19% increase year-over-\nyear.\nSix-month 2022 revenue was $19.5 million, up 23% year over year.\nThat’s all organic revenue growth, coming from our Dolphin 1.0 business of entertainment\nmarketing.\nWe continue to believe Dolphin is positioned to exceed $40 million in annual revenue for 2022\nand to generate a larger EBITDA profit in 2022 versus last year.\nTurning to key profit metrics, operating income was $587,000. This includes non-cash items from\ndepreciation and amortization of $415,000 as well as an impairment of the right-of-use asset in the\namount of $98,857 related to the sublease of one of Dolphin’s offices, offset by a gain from the\nchange in the fair value of contingent consideration of approximately $670,000. That nets out to\nan operating profit of approximately $441,000 – all while we continue to invest in Dolphin 2.0\nwhich offers upside optionality.\nAnd, as great as positive operating income is, our balance sheet is also worthy of extra focus. At\nthe apex of our acquisition strategy to build the Super Group, our debt reached a high of over $16\nmillion. It has now reached a record low of below $5.3 million. That is a dramatic reduction.\nFurthermore, the vast majority of our debt is long-term. And even so, the total remaining debt is\nless than our cash on hand.\nBut that only tells part of the story. It’s also extremely important to point out that all puts, all puts\nand all but one Earn-Out contingent consideration has been paid from all 6 of our acquisitions.\nThis complete transformation of our balance sheet has allowed us to remove our financial\nstatement disclosure ongoing concern and we believe serves as a differentiating factor for us in the\nmarketplace.\nSimply put, financially speaking, we have moved to the next milestone for Dolphin, no going\nconcern, more cash on the books than all remaining debt, which is at the lowest amount it’s been\nsince we listed on NASDAQ in 2017 and almost all of the debt remaining is long-term anyway.\nAll puts have been paid, all but one Earn-Out paid. Basically, we finished paying for the Super\nGroup, and we can now look to building profits and diversifying our investments.\nAt this point in our company’s history and continuing with our financial update, in June, we\nannounced a change of auditor to Grant Thornton LLP. Grant Thornton is a firm with more\nentertainment industry experience, providing professional services to 65% of Fortune 1000\ncompanies in the media and entertainment space, 65%, and half of the major studios. Dolphin is\ngrowing, and we believe Grant Thornton best understands where we are heading and has the\nsystems and procedures in place to ensure timely filing of Qs and Ks.\nWe are now current in our financial reporting, and look forward to staying that way.\nI’m excited to share some of those 2.0 updates, but first let’s move to operational highlights on\nDolphin 1.0, our Super Group of companies helping us to grow revenue on a double-digit basis,\nprofitably, and which both enables and turbo-charges our 2.0 investments, that in success could\nresult in exponential upside.\nWe’ll start with our Entertainment PR Powerhouse, 42West. During the second quarter,\n42West helped longtime client, Tom Cruise, launch the sequel to his 1986 film Top Gun. With\nmore than $1.3 billion in global box-office revenue so far, “Top Gun: Maverick,” has already\nsurpassed “Titanic” to become Paramount’s biggest domestic movie of all time. Also, we have\nannounced that 42West is hard at work on 97 Emmy nomination campaigns, a truly staggering\nnumber.\nIf 42West keeps your eyes popping, The Door, our leading culinary hospitality and lifestyle\nPR firm, will have your mouth watering. During Q2, the Door worked on campaigns ranging from\nPat LaFrieda’s TOMAHAWK GIFT BOX, which includes a colossal 40oz Prime Tomahawk Rib\nSteak alongside tender filet mignons and other grilling staples. As temperatures soared this\nsummer, the Door also rolled out a promotion for HäagenDazs' new City Sweets ice cream\ncollection. Preparing for Fall, The Door also began promoting New York City’s biggest wine and\nfood festival – which will return October13–16 and is celebrating its 15th anniversary with over 80\nevents – including a musical performance from Joseph “Rev Run” Simmons from Run DMC.\nSpeaking of music, Shore Fire Media, Dolphin’s industry-leading music PR firm, itself had an\neventful quarter, as it was awards season (and what a season Shore Fire had). Shore Fire musicians\nwon seven Grammys plus a Lifetime Achievement Award for client Bonnie Raitt, whose brand\nnew album also topped 6 Billboard charts. Chance The Rapper showcased new music at the BET\nAwards and hot gospel act Maverick City were among the top nominees at the Billboard Music\nAwards. Shore Fire also added Canada’s top music awards show, The JUNOs, to its roster. Shore\nFire client Steve Aoki was named Ad Week’s Creative Visionary of the Year. Not to be outdone,\nShore Fire corporate clients, streaming platform Mandolin and debate series Intelligence\nSquared, were also award winners, named the #1 most innovative music company by Fast\ncompany and top podcast event by Adweek, respectively. Shore Fire placements also included\nclient Chance the Rapper on the Late Show with Steven Colbert, Mandy Moore performing on the\nToday Show and the Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon, Jewel appearing as musical guest on Late\nNight with Seth Myers, as well as Kesha appearing on Seth Myers to promote her new show on\nDiscovery Plus - and so much more.\nMoving along to Dolphin’s influencer marketing group, Be Social kicked off the quarter with their\nSpring Showroom, working with brands from Lulus to POM Wonderful – capped off with a spring\ntrend report, before heading off to Coachella to elevate clients. Also, during the quarter BeSocial\nworked on projects that included CoCo Chanel, a partnership with Barbie and Forever 21, and\npaired the hottest spring and summer styles with a timeless classic, Michael Jordan’s Air Jordan\nbrand, produced by Nike.\nTurning now to Viewpoint, Dolphin’s respected creative agency and video production boutique.\nViewpoint completed marketing videos and brand work for a wide range of clients in Q2 including\nA&E networks, CBS, AAA and PayPal.\nThat concludes my update on Dolphin 1.0,\nTurning to Dolphin 2.0. where Dolphin and its shareholders have equity in projects and participate\nin the upside that our best-in-class marketing companies regularly enable for our clients.\nAs a reminder, for anyone new on the call or to the Dolphin story, we define the work of our Super\nGroup under Dolphin 1.0 as the very best at marketing pop culture. And we define what we call\nDolphin 2.0 as using pop culture to market assets that we own. In terms of a business model, I’ll\nremind you that broadly speaking, there are 2 types of Dolphin 2.0 initiatives, ones where we\ndevelop assets in the categories of content, consumer products or live events, and ones where we\nreceive ownership stakes in other people’s companies that have assets in those categories. That’s\nthe core thesis behind Dolphin 2.0 -- taking ownership stakes in assets that we know how to market.\nPut more simply, we want to own some of the types of things that we know we can market better\nthan anybody else.\nAs a reminder, we have a couple of models for 2.0 which include Ownership Stakes only, but also\nEquity Plus Asset Development.\nFor Ownership stake only, we typically look to receive somewhere between 5% and 10% of the\nequity in the respective company in addition to the monthly cash fee.\nExamples include Crafthouse Cocktails, a pioneering brand of ready-to-drink all-natural classic\ncocktails that is promoted by the Super Group and led by The Door to help market their award-\nwinning product. During the quarter, promotional activity included brand activations with Wiz\nKhalifa. Crafthouse also went global in Q2, and is now available in London, England.\nWith respect to the other types of Dolphin 2.0 initiatives wherein we develop and own assets that\nwe are excited to market, we do not receive a monthly cash fee since we would often only be\npaying it to ourselves, but as a result, we take a larger ownership position in the product or venture.\nExamples of these types of Dolphin 2.0 investments would be Midnight Theatre and the NFT\nmarketplace we have built.\nLet’s start with Midnight Theatre, it was actually the first week in July, so just after Q2 ended,\nthat Midnight Theatre’s restaurant, Hidden Leaf opened. Hidden Leaf is the newest restaurant\nconcept from Brooklyn restaurateur Josh Cohen of Chez Ma Tante, Lilia and Saint Vitus fame,\nopened its doors at 75 Manhattan West Plaza.\nThe beautiful standalone restaurant tucked inside our exciting, new performance venue Midnight\nTheatre, features a pan-Asian menu created by Executive Chef Chai Trivedi of Pranna, Tamarind,\nBuddakan and Eventi Hotel fame. Internationally renowned bartender Iain Griffiths, co-founder\nof the wildly acclaimed and influential Dandelyan and White Lyan bars in London, is making their\nfirst permanent foray into the NYC drinks scene with the opening of Hidden Leaf's bar and its\nstreet level companion, a high-energy aperitivo bar Midnight Cafe.\nA few weeks later Midnight Theatre also held the first of many anticipated private events prior to\nits official opening this fall, with the premier of Kevin Durant’s basketball documentary, ‘NYC\nPoint Gods. NYC Point Gods profiles the highly influential 80s and 90s NYC hoops legends that\nemerged out of New York City, highlighting some of the most famous point guards in New York\nCity history, including Rafer Alston, Kenny Anderson, Mark Jackson, Stephon Marbury, God\nShammgod, Kenny Smith, Rod Strickland and Dwayne \"Pearl\" Washington.\nWe’re highly encouraged at the potential for private events at Midnight Theatre and we’re excited\nto share more in coming quarters, especially as the Theatre opens publicly this fall.\nAs a reminder, for modeling purposes, there are 100 seats in the restaurant, and there will be 160\nseats in the theater. So, anyone can model out an average ticket price and the number of turns in\nthe restaurant and do the same in the theater with an assumption of a number of shows per week.\nThis will quickly get you to a revenue model. And, you can apply a reasonable profit margin\nstandard in the industry\nDolphin is the largest single owner within Midnight Theatre, and we manage all aspects of\npublicity and marketing for the venue, both the restaurant and the theater, as well as facilitate talent\nand commercial relationships within the entertainment and culinary industries. We invested $1\nmillion into the venture for a stake of approximately 12.5%. We also invested in options for up to\nanother approximately 25%. And then, in success, of course, we will look to add locations around\nthe country and around the world.\nNow, I’ll turn to NFTs.\nIn terms of the launch of two high-profile NFT collections that we have previously discussed,\nFlower Girls and Creature Chronicles, we have decided to push those launches from this summer\nto this Fall. Our decision was based on the calculation that the native crypto community will be\nstronger in the coming months than it has been in the previous 2-3 months. We have high hopes\nfor both of these collections, and want to give them each the best possible chance of success.\nBut the postponement of the release of those two collections does not mean that our NFT teams\nhave been idle. Far from it. As many of you know, during the second quarter We Come In Peace,\nour Web 3 agency, developed a full slate of metaverse-related clients and NFT projects to market\nfor others.\nWCIP worked on promoting a new NFT-gated community called the Venice Music\nCollective built for independent music artists, in partnership with music and tech industry\nentrepreneurs Troy Carter and Suzy Ryoo, WCIP has also helped to bring to market a generative\nNFT project that reimagines a new visual language for Web3 that is made up of variations of the\n26 letters in the English alphabet called The Symbols. Finally, WCIP was tapped by reBASE, the\nfirst ever geo-minting NFT platform, to help market and promote a new metaverse and NFT\ninitiative co-founded by Bella Hadid. The marketing campaign for Bella’s collection has already\nstarted and has gained a large number of followers.\nNow turning to our most recent Dolphin 2.0 initiative, our multiyear coproduction and distribution\nagreement with IMAX for a slate of documentary features. The first project we have greenlit is\nBlue Angels, developed and co-produced with the renowned producer J.J. Abrams and his Bad\nRobot Productions, along with Zipper Bros Films.\nBlue Angels is currently in production and is expected to hit IMAX theaters in the second half of\n2023. We are tremendously excited by this partnership with the IMAX team as we work together\nto build a slate of unforgettable documentaries that need to be seen on the big screen.\nAnd I can say, I’ve seen the first footage from this film, and it is nothing short of spectacular. We\nwill be very excited to bring this picture to market, and we believe it will be a tremendous\nambassador for Dolphin’s aspirations to invest in content a one of the four legs of our Dolphin 2.0\nstool.\nTo remind those on the call, we\nIn summary, we’re very excited about these five Dolphin 2.0 investments, on top of a growing,\nsustainable 1.0 business that generated an operating profit here in Q2. Purely on Dolphin 1.0 alone\nwe are on a path to exceed $40 million in revenue this year, and generate a larger EBITDA profit\nthan last year. As I mentioned, 1.0 enables and turbo-charges our opportunities with 2.0, and we’re\nexcited to keep building on that portfolio of investments for Dolphin and our fellow shareholders.\nThank you for joining us on this ride and to walk through the financials, and I’ll now turn it over\nto Mirta Negrini, our Chief Financial Officer.\nMirta Negrini - Chief Financial Officer, Dolphin Entertainment, Inc.\nThank you, Bill, and good afternoon, everyone. I will now discuss results for the quarter ended\nJune 30, 2022. Revenues for the quarter were approximately $10.3 million as compared to $8.6\nmillion for the quarter ended June 30, 2021.\nOverall operating expenses for the quarter ended June 30, 2022, were approximately $9.7 million\ncompared to approximately $8.4 million in the same period of prior year.\nOperating expenses are composed of direct costs, payroll and benefits, selling, general and\nadministrative costs, changes in the fair value of contingent consideration, depreciation and\namortization, and legal and professional fees.\nDirect costs for the quarter ended June 30, 2022, were approximately $939,000 compared to\n$833,000 in the same period in the prior year. The increase is primarily a result of expenses\nincurred in our NFT business.\nPayroll and benefit costs for the quarter ended June 30, 2022, were approximately $7.0 million\ncompared to $5.7 million in the same period in the prior year. The increase was primarily due to\nadditional headcount in 2022 to support the growth of our business.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses for the quarter ended June 30, 2022, were\napproximately $1.4 million, compared to $1.2 million in the period in the prior year – the increase\nwas primary due to __.\nLegal and professional fees were approximately $613,000 for the quarter ended June 30, 2022,\ncompared to $457,000 for the quarter ended June 30, 2021. The increase was primarily due to __.\nOperating income for the quarter ended June 30, 2022 of $587,815, includes non-cash items from\ndepreciation and amortization of $415,547 and a change in the fair value of contingent\nconsideration of $(670,878), compared to operating income of 221,293 for the quarter ended June\n30, 2021, which included non-cash items from depreciation and amortization of $478,270 and a\nchange in the fair value of contingent consideration of $(165,000).\nNet Income for the quarter ended June 30, 2022 was $710,865, includes non-cash items from (i)\ndepreciation and amortization of $415,547, (ii) a change in the fair value of contingent\nconsideration of $(670,878), (iii) and a change in the fair value of warrants and convertible notes\nof $279,022, compared to net income for the quarter ended June 30, 2021 of $1,349,942 which\nincludes non-cash items from (i) depreciation and amortization of $478,270, (ii) a change in the\nfair value of contingent consideration of $(165,000), iii) a change in the fair value of warrants and\nconvertible notes of 333,974 (iv) and the benefit of a net $1.0 million in non-cash items stemming\nfrom a $1.0 million gain on extinguishment of debt\nFor the quarter ended June 30, 2022, $0.07 basic earnings per share is based on 9,498,266 weighted\naverage shares and $0.05 fully diluted earnings per share is based on 9,626,143 weighted average\nshares compared to a basic earnings per share of $0.17 based on 7,664,000 weighted average shares\nand $0.13 fully diluted earnings per share based on 7,913,396 weighted average shares for the\nquarter ended June 30, 2021.\nCash and cash equivalents of $7.2 million as of June 30, 2022 as compared to $7.7 million as of\nJune 30, 2021.\nThat concludes my financial remarks. I will now ask the operator to open the phone line for Q&A.\nOperator, would you please poll for questions?"

Bill, please proceed.\nBill O’Dowd\nThanks, James, and hi, everyone. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today.\nAs always, we’ll start with a review of some financial and operating highlights, followed\nby a full financial review, and then we’ll open it up for Q&A.\nSo, starting with the financials:\nQ1 revenue of $9.2 million represented a 28% increase year over year. This increase\nrepresents pure organic growth derived from the cross-selling of services within our\nSuper Group of entertainment marketing companies. We feel this strong start to the\nyear positions Dolphin to exceed $40 million in annual revenue for 2022.\nCommensurately, we continue to expect to generate a larger EBITDA profit in 2022\nversus last year.\nTurning back to Q1, on the operating line – though our operating loss for the quarter\nended March 31, 2022 was $(963,709), that includes non-cash items from depreciation\nand amortization of $407,238. It also includes nearly ~$440,000 in 1x investments\nrelated to our NFT business, and our marketplace is now completely finished. More on\nour upcoming NFT collections in a little bit. Finally, that Q1 operating number also\nincludes approximately $400,000 of one-time, non-recurring professional fee expenses\nrelated primarily to our annual audit which was ultimately filed in May and Dolphin 2.0\ninitiatives.\nEven with those non-cash and one-time charges, Q1 was an improvement of over\n$600,000 from the $1.6 million operating loss in Q1 2021, which also included non-cash\nitems from depreciation and amortization of $482,712 and changes to fair value of\ncontingent consideration of $365,000.\nNow I would like to move to the balance sheet. Let’s stop and pause on this for a few\nminutes because this is possibly the most important point to make on today’s call. Our\nbalance sheet improvement is worth extra focus.\nAt the apex of our acquisition strategy to build the Super Group, our debt reached a high\nof over $16 million. It has now reached a record low of below $6 million. $5.7 million to\nbe exact. That is a dramatic reduction. Furthermore, the vast majority of our debt is\nlong-term and, even so, the $5.7 million of remaining debt is far less than our cash on\nhand of $9.6 million.\nBut that only tells part of the story. It’s also extremely important to point out that all\nputs … all puts … and all but one Earn-Out contingent consideration has been paid from\nall six of our acquisitions, and we now have shareholder’s equity of just under $25\nmillion. This complete transformation of our balance sheet has allowed us to remove\nour financial statement disclosure on going concern, and we believe serves as a\ndifferentiating factor for us in the marketplace.\nSimply put, financially speaking, we have moved to the next milestone for Dolphin. No\ngoing concern. More cash on the books than all remaining debt, which is at the lowest\namount its been since we listed on NASDAQ in 2017, and almost all of the debt\nremaining is long-term anyway. All puts have been paid. All but one Earn-Out paid.\nBasically, we’ve finished paying for the Super Group and we can now look to building\nprofits and diversifying our investments.\nAt this point in our company’s history, and continuing with our financial update, in June\nwe announced a change of Auditor to Grant Thornton LLP. Grant Thornton is a firm with\nmore entertainment industry experience, providing professional services to 65% of\nFortune 1000 companies in the Media & Entertainment space, and half of the major\nstudios. Dolphin is growing, and we believe Grant Thornton best understands where we\nare heading and has the systems and procedures in place to ensure timely filing of Qs\nand Ks.\nNow, let’s move to some operational updates on our Super Group, the companies that\nare making those great numbers happen.\nWe’ll start with Shore Fire Media. Dolphin’s industry-leading music PR firm, which has\nhad a great 2022, kicking off Q1 by once again helming the red carpet at the Bud Light\nSuper Bowl Music Fest, with three nights of All-Star Talent, including Green Day and\nMiley Cyrus, Blake Shelton and Gwen Stefani with Mickey Guyton; and Halsey & Machine\nGun Kelly; as well as other special guests. Also, Shore Fire just announced the first\ndates and locations for Bruce Springsteen’s 2023 World Tour. Hopefully, we’ll see some\nof those listening to this call out there with the Boss next year.\nMoving along to Be Social, Dolphin’s influencer marketing group. It has been a busy\nstart to the year that has included brand campaigns for red-hot Australian company\nCanva, EyeBuyDirect and LightStim with Kylie Jenner, while the talent management\nteam has negotiated campaigns with blue-chip brands such as Prada, Revlon, L’Oreal\nParis, and Pinterest.\nTurning now to Viewpoint, Dolphin’s respected creative agency and video production\nboutique. Viewpoint completed marketing videos and brand work for a wide range of\nclients in Q1, including NBC Sports/Peacock, AAA, PayPal, and Harvard Business\nSchool.\nFinally, it’s not a surprise that once again 42West and The Door were named to the\nObserver's annual list of 50 Most Powerful Firms. 42West was ranked #2 in the nation,\nthe highest-ranking of any entertainment firm and The Door was ranked #22.\nBoth have had a very successful start to 2022, with 42West most recently helping long-\ntime client Tom Cruise launch \"Top Gun: Maverick\" to the largest domestic Memorial\nDay opening in history, grossing $160.5 million. The film has performed remarkably well\nthis summer, and has now passed $1.2 billion at the worldwide box office.\nFor its part, The Door has also had a strong start to the year. Already having landed the\nfast growing plant-based quick service restaurant PLNT Burger in late 2021, a venture\nbetween longtime Door clients Spike Mendelsohn and enterpreneur Seth Goldman\n(Honest Tea), The Door was brought on to launch Chef Spike and Goldman’s newest\nventure Eat the Change®, a plant-based snack company. You might have seen the\nrecent announcement by Goldman that he will bring Honest Tea back into the fold to\nEat the Change after its discontinuation with Coca Cola. With both of these brands -\nPLNT Burger and Eat the Change - under The Door’s watch, The Door is a major\nplayer in the movement of planet-friendly eating.\nKudos to the Door and to 42West, proving yet again why they are perennially on the\nObserver’s most powerful PR companies list.\nThat concludes my update on Dolphin 1.0 and is the perfect segue into Dolphin 2.0.\nBecause, with Dolphin 2.0 we want Dolphin and its shareholders to have some equity in\nprojects and participate in the upside optionality that our best-in-class marketing\ncompanies routinely facilitate for our clients.\nThat’s why in December 2021 we took an equity ownership stake in a ready to drink\nbeverage company called Crafthouse Cocktails. And why this past May we announced,\na multi-year agreement with IMAX. That’s the thesis behind Dolphin 2.0, taking\nownership stakes in assets that we know how to market.\nWe just gave concrete examples that we know how to market ready-to-drink beverages\nand feature films. Now, we have ownership stakes in both areas.\nAs a reminder, for anyone new on the call or to the Dolphin story, we define the work of\nour Super Group under Dolphin 1.0 as the very best at marketing pop culture. And we\ndefine what we call Dolphin 2.0 as using pop culture to market assets that we own.\nIn terms of a business model, I’ll remind you that broadly speaking, there are two types\nof Dolphin 2.0 initiatives. Ones where we develop assets in the categories of content,\nconsumer products or live events, and ones where we receive ownership stakes in other\npeople’s companies that have assets in those three categories.\nLet’s talk about the second type of Dolphin 2.0 investment first – when we take\nownership stakes in other people’s companies. I’ll start with Crafthouse Cocktails, a\npioneering brand of ready-to-drink all-natural classic cocktails. They have an award-\nwinning product line. And they wanted the Super Group, led by The Door, to help market\ntheir product. They pay us a cash fee every month to do just that, and we have also\nreceived an ownership stake in the company in return for the added value of the\nservices and relationships extended by the entire Super Group.\nWith respect to these types of Dolphin 2.0 initiatives, we typically look to receive\nsomewhere between 5% and 10% of the equity in the respective company in addition to\nthe monthly cash fee.\nWith respect to the other types of Dolphin 2.0 initiatives, wherein we develop assets that\nwe are excited to market, we do not receive a monthly cash fee since we would often be\nsimply paying it to ourselves. But correspondingly, we take a larger ownership position\nin the product or venture. Examples of these types of Dolphin 2.0 investments would be\nMidnight Theatre and the NFT marketplace we have been building.\nLet’s start with Midnight Theatre, a contemporary variety theater and restaurant that will\nbe a true anchor for Manhattan West, the $4.5 billion development from Brookfield\nthat’s between 31st and 33rd and between 9th and 10th Avenues, in Manhattan. Inside\nMidnight Theatre, there is Hidden Leaf, which we opened just a couple of weeks ago, the\nnewest restaurant concept from our partner, Brooklyn restaurateur Josh Cohen. Many\nof you know Josh’s other restaurants, including Lilia’s, one of the hardest to get into\nrestaurants in America (and favorite date night spot of multiple celebrities), as well as\nChez Ma Tante, So, Hidden Leaf is a drop-dead gorgeous standalone restaurant within\nMidnight Theatre, and you would think it was straight out of the Great Gatsby –it is\nstunning -- with beautiful and timeless art deco design. The restaurant features a pan-\nAsian menu created by Executive Chef Chai Trivedi, previously from Tamarind and\nBuddakan for those foodies out there. I have too many favorites to name off the menu,\nbut the dim sum and the small plates are out of this world. Also, Josh has recruited\ninternationally renowned bartender Iain Griffiths, co-founder of the wildly acclaimed and\ninfluential London bars, Dandelyan and White Lyan, who is making his first permanent\nforay into the NYC drinks scene with the opening of Hidden Leaf’s bar and its street\nlevel companion, a high-energy aperitivo bar Midnight Café. As you can see, these are\nworld class talent in the food and beverage space to pair with what we believe wlll be a\nworld-class venue in Midnight Theatre, which we expect to be open for preview shows in\nAugust and with a Grand Opening in September.\nDolphin is the largest single owner within Midnight Theatre, and we manage all aspects\nof publicity and marketing for the venue, both the restaurant and the theater, as well as\nfacilitate talent and commercial relationships within the entertainment and culinary\nindustries. As we’ve mentioned before, we’re hopeful that Midnight Theater creates a\nrelatively straightforward or predictable range of modeling because even though it has\ntwo components, a restaurant and a theater, it has many of the variables already\ndefined for the model.\nThere are 100 seats in the restaurant, and there will be 160 seats in the theater, so you\ncan model out an average ticket price and the number of turns in the restaurant, and do\nthe same in the theater with an assumption of a number of shows per week. This will\nquickly get you to a revenue model. And of course, we will look to operate the venue at a\nreasonable profit margin standard in the industry. You can quickly see how this\nopportunity can become very exciting for a company at this stage of Dolphin in 2022.\nWe invested $1 million into the venture for a stake of approximately 12.5%. We also\ninvested in the options for up to another approximately 25%. As you can tell, we’re very\nexcited for Midnight Theatre. In success, of course, we will look to add locations\naround the country and around the world.\nNow, I’ll turn to NFTs. In the first quarter of 2022, Dolphin Entertainment launched our\nWeb3 marketing, consulting and communications agency, We Come In Peace (WCIP),\nafter attracting over two dozen NFT and Metaverse clients within the past year. We\ndidn’t need to acquire an agency in this space. We already had the clients to launch the\nleading agency!\nIn the first quarter, WCIP partnered with celebrity chefs and restaurateurs Tom Colicchio\nand Spike Mendelsohn to develop Chfty, a collection of NFTs that provide owners with\naccess to a culinary community led by the founders with virtual and in-person cooking\nevents. The collection went on sale in March and quickly sold out. WCIP's partnership\nwith Chfty will continue with the creation of a larger Web3 culinary ecosystem aimed at\nhelping chefs, foodies, and brands integrate into Web3.\nWCIP has quickly developed a full slate of metaverse related clients and NFT projects,\nincluding ones with supermodel Bella Hadid and music industry mogul Troy Carter. Our\nsummer slate includes drops of more than half a dozen NFT collections, and we look\nforward to updating you on our progress when we speak again in a few weeks for our\nQ2 Earnings Call.\nLastly, our most recent Dolphin 2.0 initiative is the announcement I referenced earlier --\nDolphin Entertainment has struck a Multi-Year Co-Production and Distribution\nAgreement with IMAX for a slate of Documentary Features.\nThe first project we have greenlit is Blue Angels, developed and co-produced with\nrenowned producer, JJ Abrams, and his Bad Robot Productions, along with Zipper Bros\nFilms. Blue Angels follows the newest class of the storied Navy and Marine Corps flight\nsquadron through intense training and into their first season of heart-stopping aerial\nartistry, while also sharing the emotional stories of the veterans on the team who, this\nyear, will take their final flights. It will mark the first time the iconic blue and yellow F/A-\n18 Super Hornets will be featured in IMAX. The film is being shot with state-of-the-art\nIMAX cameras, and will provide a truly unique view of these incredible pilots as, for the\nfirst time ever, audiences will be able to go inside the formation, inside the cockpit, and\ninside the helmet for a visceral, adrenaline rush, ride of a lifetime.\nBlue Angels is currently in production and is expected to hit IMAX theaters in the second\nhalf of 2023.\nIMAX is simply best-in-class when it comes to the movie-going experience. And certain\nstories, like The Blue Angels, can only be enjoyed to their fullest potential if seen in the\nIMAX Experience. We are tremendously excited by this partnership with the IMAX team,\nas we work together to build a slate of unforgettable documentaries that need to be\nseen on the big screen.\nSo, there we are – for now – in the summer of 2022. In summary, we’re extremely\npleased with these first five Dolphin 2.0 initiatives, and hopefully, today’s conversation\nprovided some additional detail. I would like to also reiterate that these 2.0 investments\nare on top of a growing 1.0 business. And, most importantly for today, we are very\nproud of our balance sheet, and expect it to be a differentiating factor for us in the\nquarters and years to come. All of this was our thesis when we uplisted to NASDAQ in\nDecember of 2017 and began assembling the Super Group. It’s fun to be where we are\nnow, but we’re only getting started. The best is still ahead of us.\nThank you for joining us on this ride. And to walk through the financials, I’ll now turn it\nover to Mirta Negrini, our Chief Financial Officer.\nMirta Negrini\nThank you, Bill, and good afternoon, everyone.\nI will now discuss results for the quarter ended March 31, 2022. Revenues for the\nquarter were approximately $9.2 million as compared to $7.2 million for the quarter\nended March 31, 2021. Overall operating expenses for the quarter ended March 31,\n2022 were approximately $10.1 million compared to approximately $8.7 million in the\nsame period of prior year.\nOperating expenses are composed of direct costs, payroll and benefits, selling, general\nand administrative costs, changes in the fair value of contingent consideration,\ndepreciation and amortization and legal and professional fees. Direct costs for the\nquarter ended March 31, 2022, were approximately $1.1 million compared to $829,000\nin the same period in the prior year. The increase is primarily a result of expenses\nincurred in our investment of NFT’s.\nPayroll and benefit costs for the quarter ended March 31, 2022, were approximately\n$7.0 million compared to $5.2 million in the same period in the prior year. The increase\nwas primarily due to additional headcount in 2022 to support the growth of our\nbusiness.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses for the quarter ended March 31, 2022, were\napproximately $1.5 million unchanged from the same period in the prior year.\nLegal and professional fees were approximately $938,000 for the quarter ended March\n31, 2022 compared to $344,000 for the quarter ended March 31, 2021. The increase\nwas primarily due to approximately $400,000 of one-time, non-recurring legal and\nprofessional fees related to the Q3 2021 restatement, fee overrun of 2021 audit fees\nand certain Dolphin 2.0 initiatives.\nOperating loss for the quarter ended March 31, 2022 of $(963,709), includes non-\ncash items from depreciation and amortization of $407,238 and a gain in the change of\nthe fair value of contingent consideration of $(763,900), compared to an operating loss\nof $(1.6) million for the quarter ended March 31, 2021, which included non-cash items\nfrom depreciation and amortization of $482,712 and a loss in the change of the fair\nvalue of contingent consideration of $365,000.\nNet loss for the quarter ended March 31, 2022 was $(792,481) which included non-cash\nitems from (i) depreciation and amortization of $407,238, (ii) $(763,900) gain in the\nchange of the fair value of contingent consideration and (iii) $347,858 from changes in\nthe fair value of a convertible promissory note and warrants as compared to a net loss\nof $(5.3) million for the quarter ended March 31, 2021, which included $4.4 million in\nnon-cash items stemming from depreciation and amortization of $482,712 and negative\nchanges in fair value of derivative liabilities, convertible notes payable, warrants, put\nrights and contingent consideration of $3.9 million in the aggregate.\nFor the quarter ended March 31, 2022, $0.09 basic loss per share is based on 8,713,700\nweighted average shares, and $0.13 fully diluted loss per share is based on 8,846,567\nweighted average shares, compared to basic and diluted loss per share of $0.73, both\nbased on 7,267,297 weighted average shares for the quarter ended March 31, 2021.\nCash and cash equivalents as of March 31, 2022, were $9.6 million compared to $7.7\nmillion as of March 31, 2021.\nThat concludes my financial remarks. I will now ask the operator to open the phone\nlines for Q&A. Operator, would you please poll for questions?"

We do not undertake any obligation to update or supplement any forward-looking\nstatements to reflect subsequent knowledge, events or circumstances.\nNow, I would like to turn the call over to Bill O’Dowd, Chief Executive Officer of Dolphin\nEntertainment. Bill, please proceed.\nBill O’Dowd - Chief Executive Officer, Dolphin Entertainment, Inc.\nThanks, James and hi, everyone. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today. As always,\nwe’ll start with a review of some financial and operating highlights, followed by a full financial\nreview, and then open it up for Q&A.\nSo from a financial highlights perspective, the momentum from the first half of the year carried\nthrough to the third quarter. Looking at the P&L, we have set another new record with 9.4\nmillion in revenue, up 70% year-over-year, with an absolutely fantastic 41% year-over-year\norganic growth from existing subsidiaries. Please note that this follows Q2, which set a record of\n8.6 million in revenues, which followed Q1, which itself had a set a record of 7.2 million in\nrevenues.\nNext, looking at our operating income, which is the metric by which we gauge ourselves, it’s\npositive for the second consecutive quarter, even when including the non-cash expenses of\ndepreciation and amortization. To reiterate positive operating income from a MicroCap\nEntertainment Company, even including the D&A expense from our acquisitions. What’s also\nnice is that we are EBITDA positive through the first nine months of the year, even while\ninvesting in our 2.0 initiatives.\nOkay, let’s turn to the balance sheet. We have a record cash position of $12.7 million, which is\nan increase of 60% compared to December 31, 2020. Also, we now have significantly more cash\nthen all debt combined, including long-term debt. Furthermore, let’s look at our working capital.\nAfter reaching a peak working capital deficit at the end of 2019 of just under 16 million, as we\nborrowed to pursue our acquisition strategy to build our Super Group, we’re now reporting a\nworking capital surplus standing at 4.5 million, which is more than triple the working capital\nsurplus as of June 30. And of course, since we’re a cash positive company, we expect the surplus\nwill only continue to grow. Thus, our balance sheet today, less than two years removed from our\npeak working capital deficit can only be fairly described as possibly our biggest strength when\ncompared to our micro cap peers.\nI’d like to reiterate the reason this is so important to us is because that working capital surplus\ngives us the muscle on our balance sheet for the next set of acquisitions and 2.0 investments.\nWhere acquisitions on the same terms of any of the six we’ve already done, for example, we\nwould be able to pay the cash component for any of them from cash currently on our balance\nTranscript Provided by\nsheet. Furthermore, we have not needed to borrow money or do a drawdown on our S3 to fund\nthe development of our NFT business. In short, this perfectly illustrates the better mousetrap we\nfeel we built with Dolphin, a growing cash positive core business and Dolphin 1.0 that is capable\nof self funding the majority of investments and development costs of the big potential upside\nopportunities of Dolphin 2.0.\nNow let’s move to some operational updates on our Super Group, the companies that are making\nthose great numbers happen. Let’s start with Shore Fire Media, Dolphin’s industry-leading music\nPR firm, which is having an absolutely terrific year. Shore Fire helped the concert and event\nbusiness re-launch by publicizing 40 tours year-to-date from artists in all genres, the nation’s\nlargest festival in Milwaukee Summerfest and the reopening of nationally recognized venues\nincluding New York’s legendary Blue Note and the award winning Brooklyn Bowl Nashville.\nShore Fire’s client Angelique Kidjo was named one of Times 100 most influential people, Carole\nKing and Todd Rundgren were inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame and athlete Chris\nBosh was inducted into the NBA Naismith Hall of Fame. Shore Fire’s corporate clients including\nNorth America’s leading live stream shopping platform Network, tech focus digital fan\nengagement company Mandolin and reservations technology platform Light have won Best in\nClass awards recently in Fast Company, Forbes, Ad Age, Adweek and Rolling Stone, thanks to\nShore Fire’s efforts.\nOkay, how about 42West, Dolphin’s entertainment PR powerhouse? Well, speaking of\nSeptember that’s Emmys month and 42West’s extraordinary range of work for programs and\nindividuals put their clients in position to receive a total of 19 Emmy nominations. Just to\nhighlight a couple, the company’s work on the Amazon series The Boys led to multiple\nnominations, including for Outstanding Drama Series. Also as a result of 42West’s campaign\nefforts, the acclaimed music documentary Billie Eilish, The World’s a Little Blurry, earned a\ntotal of four nominations.\nTurning to B/HI, a division of 42West with a particular focus on entertainment consumer\nproducts and gaming. B/HI was engaged by Fandom, the world’s largest fan platform and\nnumber one source for in depth information on pop culture, entertainment and gaming to execute\ncomprehensive publicity efforts for increased brand awareness and overall business growth. For\ncontext, Fandom is an entertainment and gaming juggernaut reaching more than 315 million\nunique visitors each month, across 250,000 fan powered communities with 30 million pages of\ncontent to get 30 billion page views per year.\nMoving along to Be Social, Dolphin’s influencer marketing group. Be Social launched its\nShowroom concept, hosting a two-day summer showroom in West Hollywood. Participating\nbrands included Bondi Sands, EyeBuyDirect, MATE The Label, and Peach and Lily, among\nmany others, with key creators in the beauty, fashion, and lifestyle spaces in attendance. Those\nwho follow our company closely know that I’m a big fan of this initiative and I’ve been asked\nhow influencer showrooms work. Well, the model of the showroom concept is pretty simple.\nBrands pay a fee to be included in the showroom and work with Be Social on selecting products\nthat are carefully tailored towards the influencers attending. From there, Be Social handles all\nevent production in addition to spearheading influencer outreach. Be Social uses their own in-\nhouse roster of talent, along with their team’s long standing influencer relationships, to drive\nTranscript Provided by\ntraffic to the event. Influencers are gifted the products from each participating brand during the\nevent and then Be Social monitors all social coverage secured from the event for a full month,\nsending each brand a tailored report outlining all social placements secured for their products, as\na result of the event. Hopefully that helps provide context for the showroom concept. We intend\nto scale in 2022.\nNext up Viewpoint Creative, Dolphin’s respected creative relations agency and video production\nboutique. Viewpoint joined forces with the Larry Firefighters Foundation to create and distribute\ncontent commemorating 911 and the 20 years since the attacks. More than attributed heroes who\nfell that day, the content recognized legacy firefighters who continue to struggle with the fallout\nand how the FDNY has improved systems and processes based on the events of 911. We’re\nalways very proud and willing to highlight this type of work that Viewpoint does.\nAnd last but not least, let’s talk about The Door, our leading culinary, hospitality and lifestyle PR\nfirm. The integrated marketing division at The Door is doing great work for their consumer\nproducts clients and the culinary and hospitality teams are fresh off promoting the New York\nCity Wine and Food Festival last month. But truth be told, I save The Door for last in order to\nallow them to serve as a bridge into Dolphin 2.0, since Charlie, Lois and the entire door team are\nplaying an essential part in both of the 2.0 initiatives we’re going to talk about today.\nSo let’s go let’s talk about Dolphin 2.0. As a reminder for anyone new on the call or to the\nDolphin story, we define the work of our Super Group under Dolphin 1.0 as the very best at\nmarketing pop culture. And we define what we call Dolphin 2.0 as using pop culture to market\nassets that we own. What type of assets do we want to own? Easy, ones where our expertise in\nmarketing gives us the greatest likelihood of success, we want to own what we know we can\nmarket better than anybody else. That’s why last month we announced a major Dolphin 2.0\ninitiative, the acquisition of an ownership stake in Midnight Theatre, a contemporary variety\ntheater and restaurant that will anchor the $4.5 billion development from Brookfield known as\nManhattan West. Across Ninth Avenue from Moynihan Station to the east and across 10th\nAvenue from Hudson Yards to the west and only a short walk from the Javits Center, New\nYork’s preeminent dimension facility, we feel the Midnight Theatre is being built in the very\nbest location in Manhattan.\nOkay, so let’s talk about the venue. The Midnight Theatre features three distinct experiences for\nthe guests, the theater itself, a separate pan-Asian restaurant called Hidden Leaf, and a ground\nlevel cafe. Let’s take the variety theatre first. It’s an intimate luxury state-of-the-art 160 seat\ntheater, which as the name implies, will have a rotating schedule of a wide variety of\nperformances across music, comedy, Broadway and magic shows. The Midnight Theater also\nhas built in live stream capabilities, allowing for events inside the theater to expand beyond into\npeople’s homes and corporate offices. The theater will be available to host live stream podcasts,\ncomedy specials, music events, corporate keynote events and more.\nHidden Leaf is the modern pan-Asian restaurant concept on the second floor of the Midnight\nTheatre space led by renowned restaurants Josh Cohen. Many of you know several of Josh’s\nBrooklyn hotspots, including the Italian mainstay Lilia, one of the most in-demand restaurants in\nall of New York City. For the midnight theater, Hidden Leaf will feature a 75-seat dining room,\nTranscript Provided by\n20-seat private dining room, and a 40-seat lounge bar area. Hidden Leaf will be opened for lunch\nand dinner and will incorporate world-class food with interactive elements such as table side\nprep, wine consignments and memberships. And the bar is where you’ll be able to find James\nCarbonara every Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday nights.\nFor Dolphin, the Midnight Theatre is the most exciting live venue concept we have seen in a\nvery long time. It will be a truly modern variety theater paired with fantastic restaurant, which is\na combination that is missing in the cultural landscape today. It is in the final stages of\nconstruction and we expect to open by the end of the first quarter of next year. Dolphin will\nmanage all aspects of publicity and marketing for the venue, both restaurant and theatre, as well\nas facilitate talent and commercial relationships within both the entertainment and culinary\nindustries. As we look to own assets, wherein our specific marketing expertise will give us a\ngreater likelihood of success, it is hard to imagine anything more in our wheelhouse than a\nworld-class restaurant for The Door to publicize paired with a state-of-the-art variety theater that\nwill program musical performances, Broadway cabaret, comedy acts, and magic shows, all of\nwhich Shore Fire and 42West currently promote. And of course, we’ll be sure to have Be Social\nbring a steady stream of influencers as our guests and post about the great time they had\nafterwards.\nPlaying Dolphin’s marketing strengths is what Dolphin 2.0 is all about which is also why we\nlaunched our NFTs business in 2021. I know many of you saw our big announcement this\nmorning. Before we talk about that specifically, I’d like to take us back through the two key\nmilestones in the past three months that positioned us to make today possible. First, our\npartnership with FTX US, which we announced in August. For any that need reminding, FTX is\na leading cryptocurrency exchange and wallet provider with over 1 million active users and over\n$10 billion of average trading volume per day. With access to FTX’s platform and wallet\nservices, we can now aggressively pursue our ambition to develop and program global NFT\ncollections targeting all of Dolphin’s verticals, including the sports, film, television, music,\ngaming, eSports, culinary, lifestyle and charity industries.\nWith the technical development well underway, we then turned our attention to the creative side\nof the coin and brought in award-winning visual designer Anthony Francisco a few weeks ago in\nthe newly created post of Creative Director to develop and execute numerous NFC series\ninvolving original and existing IP. Anthony came to us from Marvel Studios, where he was the\nsenior visual development artist responsible for designing iconic characters across the Marvel\nCinematic Universe, such as Baby Groot, personal favorite of many of the Dolphin’s, Loki and\nDora Milaje, the female warriors in Black Panther. In short, we feel we won the lottery for NFT\nbusiness of securing FTX as our technical partner and by bringing in Anthony Francisco as our\ncreatively lead.\nAnd together, that is what enabled us this morning to announce the launch of Creature\nChronicles: Exiled Aliens, Dolphin’s first generative NFT collection, which will feature 10,000\nunique custom crafted avatars of an ancient race of aliens designed by Anthony Francisco. Each\nExiled Alien avatar will fall into a specific alien hierarchy, assigned traits, and randomly\ngenerated. The collection is available for viewing today, right now, at creaturechronicles.io and\nis slated for minting in December.\nTranscript Provided by\nNow we intend Creature Chronicles to be a multi-season NFT event. After the release of Exiled\nAliens, the community and fan experiences will continue to evolve and grow while the storyline\ndevelops and new NFT drops are released during upcoming seasons. Dolphin will ensure that\nExiled Aliens community members will enjoy a host of benefits, including limited edition NFTs,\nmaster classes with Anthony Francisco and friends, creative competitions with incredible prizes,\nprivate events, and future surprises, all leveraging Dolphin’s world-class relationships across the\ncreative community. Furthermore, holders of Exiled Aliens avatars will receive priority status for\nthe purchase of future seasons of Creature Chronicles.\nWe are pricing each Exiled Alien at $200, which includes both the NFT avatar and inclusion into\nthe ongoing Creature Chronicles community with all the benefits I just mentioned. Users can\npurchase Exiled Aliens directly on site, through a simple registration process which establishes a\nproprietary FTX.US wallet for each user. The user’s FTX.US wallet allows for payments to be\nmade via credit and debit cards, as well as a wide variety of cryptocurrencies, including Sol,\nEther and Bitcoin. The NFTs will be minted and stored on the Solana blockchain, a leading Proof\nof Stake blockchain that is recognized as faster, more efficient, lower cost and more\nenvironmentally friendly than its Proof of Work competitors, notably Ethereum.\nSo there it is, all of us at Dolphin are really excited to this day has come when we can share our\nvery first NFT collection designed to launch our first community. We are obviously playing to\nthe strengths of Anthony and he has delivered the graphic art within the Exiled Aliens collections\nabsolutely breathtaking and no offense to the aliens but we don’t believe there’s a better visual\nartists in our shared universe than Anthony. We think this collection will appeal to the existing\nNFT enthusiast, while also serving as an entry point to those who are curious about NFTs and\nwant to dip their toe in was something really cool from a world class designer. And quite frankly,\nwe’re excited to program for the community, which will allow us to play to our strengths, and\noffer benefits and access to the worlds of entertainment and pop culture that are simply unique in\nthe marketplace today.\nIt is fun [ph] day, Midnight Theatre and Exiled Aliens in one conversation. We’re extremely\npleased with these first two Dolphin 2.0 initiatives. And hopefully today’s conversation shared\nsome context as to why they were chosen to lead Dolphin to this new era of ownership of assets\nthat we are marketing. Any Dolphin 2.0 opportunity is judged by its ability in success to serve as\na major catalyst for our company. We feel these first two certainly have tremendous growth\npotential with Midnight Theatre’s possibility to expand into other cities and with our plan to\nlaunch NFT collections across all the industries that Dolphin companies currently market. By the\ntime we jump on the earnings call for 10-K, we would hope to have Midnight Theatre open and\neveryone on this call scheduling their first visit and one or two more NFT collections launched\nand community activities for all of them well underway.\nAnd we’re not stopping. We have more 2.0 initiatives in the final stages of closing that we\nanticipate announcing before the end of the year. Our Dolphin flywheel is turning and\nmomentum is helping us to gain speed. We feel that our marketing companies are the very best\nin their respective industries. By frankly, I think that’s almost impossible to argue and there’s no\nshortage of attractive partners and opportunities for us. The 2.0 pipeline is strong for NFT and\nTranscript Provided by\nnon-NFT opportunities alike and we will pursue those firsts that we believe will create the most\nshareholder value.\nIn closing, I would like to remind everyone that these 2.0 investments are on top of a growing\n1.0 business that has led to record revenues for three quarters in a row, including 70% year-over-\nyear revenue growth here in the third quarter, two consecutive quarters of positive operating\nincome, even after the non-cash expenses of depreciation and amortization from our acquisitions,\nand a record level of cash on hand, over $12 million, in fact, which is approximately 3 million\nmore than all remaining debt combined, including the long-term debt. We are profitable and\ngrowing with a beautiful balance sheet and now we are launching Dolphin 2.0 in earnest. These\nare the days that we’ve been dreaming of since we uploaded it to NASDAQ almost four years\nago and began assembling the Super Group.\nThank you for joining us. To that end, I’ll now turn it over to Mirta.\nMirta Negrini - Chief Financial Officer, Dolphin Entertainment, Inc.\nThank you, Bill and good afternoon, everyone. I will now discuss results for the quarter ended\nSeptember 30, 2021. Revenue for the quarter ended September 30, 2021 was approximately $9.4\nmillion, compared to approximately $5.5 million in the quarter ended September 30, 2020.\nOverall operating expenses for the third quarter of 2021 were approximately $9.4 million,\ncompared to approximately $6 million in the quarter -- in the third quarter of 2020. Operating\nexpenses are composed of direct costs; payroll and benefits; selling, general and administrative\ncosts; depreciation and amortization; and legal and professional fees. Direct costs for the third\nquarter of 2021 were approximately $992,000 compared to approximately $575,000 in the same\nperiod of the prior year. Payroll costs were approximately $5.9 million in the third quarter of\n2021, compared to approximately $3.6 million in the third quarter of 2020. Selling, general and\nadministrative expenses for the third quarter of 2021 were approximately $1.5 million, compared\nto approximately $950,000 in the third quarter of 2020. Legal and professional fees were\napproximately $499,000 in the third quarter of 2021 compared to approximately $373,000 in the\nthird quarter of 2020.\nOperating income for the quarter ended September 30, 2021 of approximately $38,000 included\nnon-cash items from depreciation and amortization of approximately $475,000 as compared to\nan operating loss of approximately $493,000, which included non-cash items from depreciation\nand amortization of approximately $514,000 for the same period in the prior year. Net income\nfor the quarter ended September 30, 2021 was approximately $142,000 compared to a net loss of\napproximately $138,000 for the quarter ended September 30, 2020.\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2021, we had basic and fully diluted earnings per\nshare of $0.02 per share based on 7,740,085 weighted average shares outstanding. For the three\nmonths ended September 30, 2020, we had basic loss per share of $0.02 per share, based on\n6,676,405 weighted average shares and fully diluted loss per share of $0.04 per share based on\n6,912,011 weighted average shares outstanding. Cash and cash equivalents were $12.7 million,\nTranscript Provided by\nas of September 30, 2021, compared to $7.9 million, as of December 31, 2020, not including\nrestricted cash of approximately $542,000 and $714,000 in each period, respectively.\nThat concludes my financial remarks. I will now ask the operator to open the phone lines for\nQ&A. Operator, can you please poll for questions?\nOperator\n[Operator Instructions] Your first question is coming from Allen Klee from Maxim Group. Your\nline is live.\nQ: Good afternoon. Congratulations on a strong quarter. I wanted to start off with the NFTs. It\nreally seems like you’ve put a business together now that this could have an impact next year.\nHow do you think about kind of -- is there a way to think about like how the opportunity is here?\nThank you,\nBill O’Dowd - Chief Executive Officer, Dolphin Entertainment, Inc.\nSure. Well, thank you, Allen. Thanks for the kind words. Yes, we’re thrilled with the progress,\neven since Q2 on the numbers just getting stronger. NFTs, yeah, it’s an exciting business. I think\nwe really wanted this announcement before we did our earnings call to be able to talk about and\nlet people go check out. I mean, it’s up in there today to see what we’ve been building on the\ntechnological side with FTX to allow us to sell directly on our own sites, each branded site if you\nwill, and be able to take credit cards, as well as every form of crypto, not just the single form on\nthe blockchain that we’re using. We’re thrilled that it’s Solana. We think Solana has so many\nadvantages and its speed and environmentally friendly are two big ones for us but we’re excited\nfor today.\nIn terms of scaling, you can see that this type of product is very exciting for us, the idea of a\ncommunity-based NFC system, sell 10,000 memberships, if you will, and get a whole bunch of\ncool stuff. We think that plays to our strengths. We can program the cool stuff part. If you’re\ninterested in animation, graphic design, who better than somebody like an Anthony Francisco to\ndo master-classes with to program around? Imagine if we did special screenings of any of the\nmovies that Anthony has worked on and he talked to you behind the scenes, what he did for them\nand some of the story decisions. Imagine sweepstakes and prizes that result in all expense paid\ntrips to Comic Con, where we have teams of people that every summer. You can imagine we go\nto other verticals, whether it’s music, movies, television, sports, what we can do, we’re already at\nthe Grammys, the Emmys, the Oscars, the Super Bowl.\nI think we think of the NFT business as community based. And I think if you talk to people on\nthe inside, I’m talking to blockchains, the competitive marketplaces, etc, how long, pure art for\nart’s sake will last is an open question. But the few -- everyone agrees that the future of NFTs is\nin utility, that the NFT allows you to do something or receive something. And I think that’s\nexactly why we built what we’ve built and where we just quite frankly, feel we have tremendous\nadvantages. An entertainment-related NFT community, we have access to and can program\nbetter than anybody and so that’s what we’re excited to roll out to the market.\nTranscript Provided by\nAnd along the way, by the way, our art is going to look really, really cool, because we have\nAnthony. And so that’s what we’re launching today. And then the question after this initial\nlaunch will be the frequency and the speed that we can get the other verticals up and running.\nBut as we get into the first half of next year, all the major verticals, we would have wanted -- we\nwill have wanted to have launched. So we’re in it for the long haul but we’re excited to start in\neach of the verticals that we already have expertise in.\nQ: Is it reasonable to think that the NFT products should be a high margin product? To me, it\nseems that way to me but could you explain it?\nBill O’Dowd - Chief Executive Officer, Dolphin Entertainment, Inc.\nSure. And if I could, as I was trying to say in our numbers, this really is illustrative of what we\nhope is considered a better mousetrap by the market. I mean, we have the optionality and a huge\ncatalyst in NFT’s, right. I would argue that NFTs to Dolphin represent the potential upside or\nmore of many of the highest return investments out there from biotech or wherever else, if they\nwork. Well, we feel our catalyst is as good as anybody else’s but we’re profitable along the way.\nWe’ve been building this technology and our ability to offer this product to market and have\nbeen EBITDA positive in both the second and third quarters. So therefore, I should pretty much\ntell you what the margin can be.\nYou know, obviously, people have already received numerous calls today people see the quick\nmath 10,000 avatars at $200 each, it’s a $2 million product. And you’re starting a community\nand so that means you can engage with our community every week, daily, hourly on social\nmedia. But -- and then as we -- this product was designed to be an event, multi-season event. So\nyou’re going to have more drops, more contests and sweepstakes and that’s what allows you to,\nto build and sustain this community that will have future drops in the future. So you might have\nanother $2 million product four, six months from now and etc, etc. So it scales very quickly. And\nthen of course, once we have multiple verticals going, imagine a product in music, one in film,\none in sports, one in charity, one in culinary, one in gaming; right now that’s up to six and you\nstart cross selling with each other. So you cross pollinate your communities and of course, you\ncan have more than one community inside each vertical.\nI mean, music itself, you’re not going to have one music community, you’ll have multiple for\ndifferent types of music, right. So it’s an exciting world for us and we needed the robustness, if I\njust coined the term, I’m not sure, of FTX in their wallet, to allow for both the acceptance of\ncredit cards, the speed, the strength of being able to build on the blockchain for that volume of an\noffering, globally. So, some of our programs, including Anthony’s are going to appeal to an\ninternational audience very much. Aliens, no national boundaries, right, so it’s an exciting day\nand I think it opens a glimpse to those who are interested in Dolphin for our NFT capabilities to\nreally get a sense of what we can accomplish.\nQ: And just to confirm that I understand that NFT market, right. You have the potential -- is it\ntrue that you have the potential to get recurring revenue, if you’re the creator of an NFT because\nevery time there’s a secondary sale, can you get a piece of that?\nTranscript Provided by\nBill O’Dowd - Chief Executive Officer, Dolphin Entertainment, Inc.\nYeah and thank you. I’m sorry. Go back to your previous question, I’ll answer in three parts with\nthe new question with that.\nQ: Sorry.\nBill O’Dowd - Chief Executive Officer, Dolphin Entertainment, Inc.\nMy fault. It’s a very high margin business because especially Exiled Aliens because this is an\ninternal Dolphin developed property. We own 100% of it and it’s exciting for us to launch with\nthat, and to show our creative chops. And why we took the time to build an entire storyline\naround it, there’s a saga here that that fans are going to want to be a part of, and imagine\nreceiving issue number one of one of the classic DC or Marvel Comics, right. If you’re a\ncollector, you’re going to want to collect all ten episodes and that’s exciting for us. That’s what I\nmean by future NFT drops.\nBut secondly yes, we have potential for recurring revenue in a couple of ways; one, are those\nfuture drops to the same community. We haven’t decided on the number of episodes of Exiled\nAliens but whatever number it might be, as we’re refining that now, those are -- that’s revenue,\nyou can go to the same community and give them added value along the way. And secondly,\neach NFT that we sell, if it resells in the open market, because new people want to be part of the\ncommunity, or certainly these NFTs are going to be very rare and valuable from moment number\none, then yes, as they resell Dolphin keep 7.5% of the revenue in perpetuity across all sales.\nQ: Thank you. If I look at some of your Dolphin 1.0 businesses, they should all be benefiting\nfrom post-pandemic recovery. And I was wondering if you could kind of give us a sense of kind\nof what inning we are in the recovery for some of these. I know for example like Live Nation, on\ntheir third quarter call, I think they said that there’s some their tickets for major festivals were\nselling out and overall sales were up 10% versus 2019, which is pretty amazing. So, I’m just\nhearing for yourself, how you’re thinking about where you are in the recovery and the potential\njust in some of the areas just to getting back to kind of where you were.\nBill O’Dowd - Chief Executive Officer, Dolphin Entertainment, Inc.\nSure. Yeah, this growth has been accomplished without a full recovery. We’ve had some\nrecovery which is great and it’s only going to -- it’s continuing to build momentum but the two\nbig areas, motion pictures have started to come back in theaters, which is great. Obviously we\nhad James Bond earlier this month, [indiscernible] before it, we have some others coming up.\nBut it’s still not where it was. We expect the motion picture business will be and hope that it will\nbe where it was by second quarter of next year and it’s growing up until that point. The one\nthat’s still out there that hasn’t recovered yet is the restaurant business. There’s their sign of\nshoots coming up from out of the ground, trickling in, but that’s going to be a nice recovery play\nfor us in 2022. I don’t know if its first quarter, if it’s going to take till the spring, but that’ll\nTranscript Provided by\nmeaningfully impact our numbers. This revenue growth has been accomplished without that\nbusiness being back.\nAnd by the way, that’s really a tribute to our subs. I really included that line. Yes, we’re up 70%\nyear-over-year, that’s 41% organic growth from the existing subs, that’s tremendous growth.\nAnd we have more to go as we get both the recovery play, but then also, as longtime fans of the\nstock, the companies are just getting stronger and stronger at cross selling with each other. We\nhave more and more joint projects. You’ll joke I made when we had 42West alone in the group\nthree years ago, well as you can’t cross sell with yourself. But now you’re up to six companies\nand you know this Dolphin 1.0 is only going to continue to grow because we can cross and\nrecover. So it’s exciting times. I mean, we’ve gone from seven point something to eight point\nsomething to nine point something in successive quarters of record revenue, so that’s got to say\nsomething to somebody.\nQ: And Be Social, it’s kind of fascinating how that can kind of touch everything. How do you\nthink about kind of how that expands next year?\nBill O’Dowd - Chief Executive Officer, Dolphin Entertainment, Inc.\nWell, it’s funny you say that, Allen, because, yeah, and those who remember from the Q2 of\n2020 remember, the joke we made then was the holidays came early, when Be Social joined the\ngroup because every one of our market leading PR firms wanted a sister company that was great\nat influencer marketing. For Dolphin 1.0 that’s -- I’m not going to under-emphasize adding Be\nSocial to the group and what it’s meant. But for Dolphin 2.0, as we talk about touching\neverything, as I highlighted, I mean, Midnight Theatre, yep, they can use Be Social, both for the\nrestaurant and theater. Influencer marketing campaigns are marketing 101 today for any\nrestaurant opening as The Door or hotel opening but then also with NFT’s.\nI mean, how do you get the word out and online about a new offering and I think the fact that a\nstrong influencer marketing campaign, as we go forward and go into 2022, we’re certainly\nlooking for engaging Be Social on a consistent basis to help with these launches because they\nbring a lot of the word of mouth and a lot of the cool factor to it. So Be Social is a very important\nand strategic part of our company, and it couldn’t be nicer people and a nice cocktail event with\nthem last Thursday in Los Angeles, and yeah, we feel very lucky that Be Social is inside the\nDolphin family.\nQ: That’s great. In terms of Midnight Theatre, will there be a point next year where we can get a\nsense of what the contribution could be? I know, it’s too early now but –\nBill O’Dowd - Chief Executive Officer, Dolphin Entertainment, Inc.\nYeah, I think so. As we get to opening, we’re going to have a lot of metrics for that. We’re very\nconfident in that investment. We think it’s going to do very well and it has a lot of room for\ngrowth I can get to in a second, but we’ll have some metrics, probably by the time we speak on\nthe K call, because we’ll have -- with a theater, you have advanced ticket sales. We’ll know pre-\nopening numbers, we will probably know our post-opening numbers, we’ll have a sense of how\nTranscript Provided by\nit does. And if I could -- or how it’s doing, I think the aspect of the variety theater is really cool\nand I think it may -- the advantages of that may be missed by the casual investor. A true -- a\nclassic, let’s call, Broadway Theater rides entirely on whichever shows in the theater. So if\nyou’re the Richard Rogers and you got Hamilton, you’re feeling great, but if you don’t that’s\nriskier, it’s an all or nothing proposition.\nFor a variety theater, you have a variety of acts and you have a variety of different audiences that\nyou can bring in because of those acts and something like an intimate 160 seat theater, that’s not\na lot of seats. To fill that theater and you don’t need to fill it to be profitable. But to sell tickets\nthere, you’re not -- it’s not a heavy lift. A variety theater gives you a broad, broad audience to go\nafter, there’s something literally for everyone over a short period of time. The challenge of\nvariety theaters, you say, well, why doesn’t everybody do a variety theater, there’s a shortage of\nthat. Because there’s two challenges, you have to be able to program it, you got to be able to\nmarket all those different acts. Well, that’s where one plus one hopefully equals 11.\nWhat do we have the ability to do? We have the ability to market all those different acts. We\nalready do from a wide variety of musical, look at Shore Fire, it’s the biggest and most expensive\nmusic PR firm in the world. The types of acts that Shore Fire has in the roster, they have every\ngenre of music. It’s not just pop, it’s rock, it’s jazz, it’s R&B, it’s classic, it’s everything and\nmany of those acts are played in Midnight Theatre. So you get a double win of both marketing\nand helping the program. And so as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, whether it’s comedy,\nwhether it’s Broadway cabarets, whether it’s magic, we already promote. One of our PR\nagencies already promotes those individual types of acts. So we have that expertise and if you\ncan market it, then you’ve eliminated what’s usually the challenge, and you’re left with what’s\nusually the positive.\nAnd then of course, every one of those acts are new audiences to the restaurant, and new\naudiences you can market to in the future. And you get all that data of what programs, well jazz,\ndoes it work and does it work on Tuesdays, Thursdays, Saturdays, etc and you and you get\nsmarter and smarter with each passing month. So yeah, it’s exciting and then, of course, for the\nupside, you have this great venue, in this gorgeous location. I mean, for those who aren’t familiar\nwith Manhattan West that live in New York, you should really check it out. I mean, it’s brand\nnew in $4.5 billion city block, right. But there’s no reason why in success, you can’t take that\nconcept to other cities and then the scaling of those economics is just gorgeous, whether it’s Los\nAngeles, whether it’s London, whether it’s Nashville, whether it’s Miami. I mean, when we\ntalked about catalyst, New York alone would be a catalyst to a company our size, you start\nscaling, it’s a whole different ballgame. So, that’s why Midnight Theatre was extremely\nattractive to us.\nQ: Okay. My last question, it is somewhat financial. How do you feel about your expense\nstructure now, staffing and whatever tech spending, relative to your revenue growth? Do you\nthink that there’s operating leverage at this point in the business model?\nBill O’Dowd - Chief Executive Officer, Dolphin Entertainment, Inc.\nTranscript Provided by\nI think so. We are staffed preparing for this day, right. So we were close to full staffing needed to\nreally would be able to expand the NFT business, I assume that’s all but most people want to talk\nabout. Past this one collection into a series of collections, we’ll want to add one or two more\npeople in that division, but bulk of what we needed we have in-house now, so that’s exciting for\nus. And to your original question on the NFT business, it’s not only a high margin business in\nsuccess, it’s the highest margin business we have. So, it’s a -- I would hope it will be a\nmeaningful contributor in 2022. Excuse me.\nQ: That’s great. Thank you so much. Sure.\nOperator\nI’d now like to turn the floor back to Bill O’Dowd, CEO of Dolphin Entertainment, for closing\nremarks.\nBill O’Dowd - Chief Executive Officer, Dolphin Entertainment, Inc.\nOh, man, I was so sure I was going to get more questions this time. Well, thank you, everybody\nand to that last point on Allen’s question, I should also say, that’s also why you saw we managed\nourselves to the to the EBITDA positive, operating income positive, even while we’re staffing up\nand investing, which is really fantastic.\nSo thank you, everybody, for the time today. Hope everybody has a great holiday season. I know\nwe’ll speak again in 2022, hopefully, sooner than even the 10-K call, we’ll look for an\nopportunity to do so. But in the meantime, I think you could be looking for a couple of more\nannouncements from us before the end of the year, and we’re excited for what this call represents\nwith our first two 2.0 initiatives in market. And if you’re looking for something to do when\nspringtime rolls around in New York, come to the Hidden Leaf and have a drink with James\nCarbonara. Thanks, everybody. Talk to you later.\nOperator\nThank you, ladies and gentlemen. This does conclude today’s conference call. You may\ndisconnect your phone lines at this time and have a wonderful day. Thank you for your\nparticipation.\nTranscript Provided by"

Bill, please proceed.\nBill O’Dowd - Chairman & CEO, Dolphin Entertainment, Inc.\nThanks, James and hi, everyone. Good afternoon. And thank you for joining us today. Now\nJames has asked me to follow our traditional format where I start by discussing our financials at\na high level and then speak about Dolphin 1.0 in the second quarter, and then move to our recent\nlaunch of Dolphin 2.0 and announcements regarding NFTs.\nBut James, hold on to your seat, brother, because I'm going to break from format. This, I realize,\nmay be unconventional. But, I would like to first pay tribute to those who have been following\nDolphin since before March 23rd of this year. I think everyone knows that date. The one when\nwe made our first Dolphin 2.0 announcement in NFTs and the trading in our stock went nuclear.\nNo, I want to speak to those who have been with us even before January of this year when we\nmade our last acquisition. Yes, I want to speak to the OG stakeholders and investors, some of\nwhom have followed us since we first spoke of our dream of building an entertainment\nmarketing Super Group at LD Micro in December 2016, when we were an OTC stock and had\nnot even brought 42West into the family.\nAnd I want to speak to those who I met the following year during our Roadshow prior to our\nuplisting on the NASDAQ in December 2017. Yes, those are the people I want to speak to right\nnow -- to James Carbonara of Hayden IR, who was the first addition to the team after deciding to\ntake Dolphin public in the summer of 2016, and who arranged for that first speaking engagement\nat LD Micro, I should add.\nTo John Shaw, Jason Sardo and Keith Goodman of Maxim, who helped us achieve the uplisting\nto NASDAQ, and have been with us every step of the way since, to Josh Scheinfeld and all of\nmy friends at Lincoln Park, to Tim Johnson at Bard, to Marvin Shanken (Go Canes), to our\ndirectors, especially the original independent directors Mike Espensen, Nick Stanham, and\nNelson Famadas, who have seen the entire journey, to Mirta Negrini, our CFO who has also been\nwith us since before we were public.\nAnd to all of our CEOs and former private company owners, Amanda, Lois, Charlie, Dave,\nMarilyn, Ali and Dean, who each share the belief that we are stronger together than any of us\nTranscript Provided by\nwould be alone, and to their senior management teams who care so much about the work they do\non behalf of our clients.\nAnd to all of the over 160 Dolphins working with us today. I want to talk to them and all the\nothers like them, those who believed and continue to believe in what we’re building here at\nDolphin. And so in speaking to all of you, I'm going to be inspired by many of our musician\nclients and dedicate this song, this earnings call, you know who you are and this earnings call is\nfor you.\nSo here we go. From a financial perspective, we have reached several significant milestones this\nquarter. Looking at the P&L, we have set a new record with $8.6 million in revenues. Please note\nthat this follows Q1, which set a then record of $7.2 million in revenues. That is 20% sequential\ngrowth from the previous record holding quarter. And as you might expect, it is significant\ngrowth from last year's Q2 revenues of $5.2 million, 66% growth to be exact.\nNext, looking at our operating income, this is another huge milestone. Since we uplisted to\nNASDAQ in December of 2017, it's positive for the first time even when including the non-cash\nexpenses, depreciation and amortization. Yes, positive operating income from a microcap\nentertainment company, even including the D&A expenses from our acquisitions.\nFrom a P&L perspective, that is how we measure ourselves. And so this is a big moment for our\ncompany. Now sure, it's fun to report those numbers in the P&L. But for my money, the real\nstory is the balance sheet. As we took on debt to assemble the Super Group, many saw this is our\nbiggest weakness, as our Achilles heel. At first they doubted we could add other private\ncompanies into our group. When that started happening with the Door only six months after we\njoined NASDAQ, they then switch the story and said we wouldn't make it to the point where we\ncould pay off those debts. Actually, they didn't just say it, they proclaimed it. Everyone's entitled\nto their opinion, of course. And we respect that. But many of those opinions were stated as\nconclusions, as facts. They were absolutely certain this day would never come.\nWell …\nLet's recap where we are then, shall we? In little more than three years since our uplisting, to pull\nour version of LeBron James maybe, we have acquired not one, not two, not three, not four, but\nfive additional companies to join 42West.\nI guess other market leading companies did want to join and create a Super Group after all, who\nknew? And even doing all of that, from a peak working capital deficit of just under $16 million,\none and a half short years ago and even after bringing in six companies, we’re now reporting the\nfirst working capital surplus in Dolphin history at $1.25 million. And since we're a cash positive\nmicro-cap company, we expect this surplus will only continue to grow.\nWhy is that so important to us? Because that working capital surplus will give us strength on our\nbalance sheet for the next set of acquisitions in 2.0 Investments? For acquisitions on the same\nterms of any of the six we've already done, for example, we would be able to pay the cash\ncomponent for any of them from cash currently on our balance sheet.\nTranscript Provided by\nObviously, we had not been in this position previously. So this is another huge milestone for us.\nAnd speaking of cash, we now have $9.3 million of unrestricted cash, which is more than all\nremaining debt.\nYes, all debt, including long-term debt, and including the remaining $2 million in PPP loans,\nwhich we expect to be fully forgiven and which of course will only improve our working capital\nsurplus.\nAnd last but not least, remember all those puts from any of the acquisitions dating back to 2017\ntotaling $11 million. Yes, those have been paid in full. Thank you very much, completely off\nour balance sheet. None left. Not $1, nada, Zippo. So our balance sheet, what was stated to be a\nweakness by those who couldn't see beyond it to what we were building. Yes, our balance sheet\ntoday, one and a half years later, can only be fairly described as possibly our biggest strength\nwhen compared to our micro-cap peers. And let me tell you, that feels so good, so, so, so very\ngood.\nAll right. Now we can stop giving James a heart attack and I'll go back to his script instead of\nmine. Let me give you some updates on our Super Group, the companies that are making those\ngreat numbers happen.\nDuring the second quarter, 42West was involved in various capacities with 13 films that earned a\ntotal of 32 Academy Award nominations and won six Oscars. This past Friday, as movies are\nslowly coming back to theaters, 42West handled Respect, MGM's biographical drama film based\non the life of Aretha Franklin. And, looking ahead, upcoming promotional campaigns include\nsome doozies, including Universal Pictures film adaptation of six times Tony Award winning\nmusical Dear Evan Hansen, coming in September, MGM's highly anticipated latest installment\nin the James Bond franchise, coming in October, as well as Paramount's Top Gun 2 starring our\nvery own client, Tom Cruise, coming in November. So we've got major releases coming out one\nafter the other through the fall.\nTurning to music. Shore Fire Media had a terrific second quarter, really, really great. Let's spend\na little extra time on Shore Fire because Marilyn and the team are truly firing on all cylinders. I'll\nstart with a special shout out to Shore Fire Media clients, Carole King and Todd Rundgren, who\nare being inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame. Awesome. And although the return of a\nfull touring calendar is very much a moving target these days, Shore Fire worked with Day One\nclient Bruce Springsteen for his return to Broadway with the summer run at the St. James\nTheatre, as well as long time clients, Hall & Oates and the Dave Matthews Band, to promote live\nperformances.\nBut it's not just the artists. Shore Fire represents many businesses from all facets of the music\nindustry, including OneOf, the digital company from Quincy Jones, and Lyte, the ticket reselling\nplatform, among many others. Finally, it should be pointed out that Shore Fire's work with\nmusicians and authors and influencers has attracted a lot of attention and allowed for the growth\nof a very nice roster of non-musician clients, including former athletes, Shawn Johnson East,\nexcuse me, and Chris Bosh, Go Heat!!!\nTranscript Provided by\nShifting to consumer and hospitality, The Door welcomed iconic ice cream brand, Häagen-Dazs\nand beloved European baby food brand, Holle, and led campaigns for the Dominic Hotel,\nJefferson's Ocean Bourbon and Virgin Hotels in New Orleans. Also, Charlie and Lois of The\nDoor have taken a leadership position for us in these early months of the NFT business, guiding\nour launches and developing processes to onboard more large scale campaigns, which we'll\nhighlight soon. But I wanted to take a moment to thank them for all of their hard work in this\nspace.\nAs for video production, Viewpoint, again also had an exceptional quarter producing a wide\nrange of videos, everything from traditional network and entertainment clients, CNN, National\nGeographic, Viacom and HBO Max, to the rapidly growing consumer product and brand video\nwork done for clients, including PayPal, Biogen and AAA.\nAnd on a personal level, this is a company that cares deeply about charitable opportunities and\nmaking a positive impact in the world. So I'd like to highlight Viewpoint's work with The Door\nto develop strategy and digital content for Leary Firefighters Foundation's International\nFirefighters' Day broadcast event, which recognizes firefighters and launched the Foundation's\nvirtual training video series with the largest fire training exercise in New York City.\nAnd finally moving to influencer marketing, Be Social was another company that had a fantastic\nquarter, really executing across both the brand campaign side and the influencer talent\nmanagement sides of the business. This is what can happen when you've got a young, exciting\nmarket leader in such a growing market.\nAnd I honestly think some may be sleeping on this aspect of our company. It was on this\nearnings call last year that I tried my best to express our great enthusiasm for adding Be Social to\nour Super Group, explaining that influencer marketing and PR are the twin pillars of earned\nmedia, with influencer campaigns representing tremendous growth in our industry. Well,\neMarketer and Business Insider recently inaugurated their forecast for this industry with an\nexpectation of 33.6% year-over-year growth to $3.69 billion in influencer marketing spend in the\nU.S. in 2021, which is $1 billion more than 2020.\nFurthermore, their forecast for both 2022 and 2023 also showed double-digit growth with total\ninfluencer marketing spend nearing $5 billion in the U.S. in 2023. We very much wanted to be in\nthis space, and we have a gem of a company with Be Social. Their skill set is an advantage for\nour Super Group, and we'll be sure to leverage it to the fullest extent possible with our 2.0\ninitiatives.\nSpeaking of which, let's talk about Dolphin 2.0. As a recap for anyone new on the call or to the\nDolphin story, we define the work of our Super Group under Dolphin 1.0 as the very best at\nmarketing pop culture, and we define what we call Dolphin 2.0 as using pop culture to market,\nspecifically marketing assets that we own. Simply put, we are looking to own assets for which\nour marketing companies have a particular expertise and therefore, which will give us the best\nchances for success. We want to own what we know we can market better than anybody else.\nTranscript Provided by\nSo, what would those categories be? There are three, entertainment content, live events and\nconsumer products. And we also talked about a fourth category wherein we take equity stakes in\nother people's companies that have entertainment content, live events or consumer products.\nThose then are the buckets or categories we talked about when we talked about Dolphin 2.0.\nWe used the first three years of our public company's existence to build scale and reach across all\nof pop culture by assembling our Super Group of marketing companies that we think are the very\nbest at what they do in marketing film, television, music, culinary, hospitality, video games,\neSports, consumer products, et cetera.\nI think after the 1.0 summary I just gave, it would be very difficult for anyone to say that we\ndon't have the best-in-class subsidiaries across all of these verticals. The rest of our lifetimes will\nnow also include developing, producing and purchasing assets that we will own, giving us\ngreater upside and success with these projects.\nWe previously announced our expectation that we will seek to have two initiatives from each of\nthe four categories per year to guide to a cadence we feel we can achieve. The only exception to\nthis pace will be that we will not start our live events investments until 2022 for obvious reasons.\nAs pretty much everyone on this call knows, we have previously announced our entrance into the\nNFT business, which was the first of our two consumer products announcements expected for\nthis year. I can now also say that we've identified our first 2.0 content initiative and our first 2.0\nequity stake initiative.\nAnd while we had hoped to be able to speak about both of those initiatives on this earnings call,\nthe timing of our partners dictates that we will probably need to wait until later in this quarter to\nbe able to do so. Those initiatives will give us the first one in each of the three buckets for this\nyear: content, consumer products and equity. And we are hard at work in selecting the second\none in each of those three buckets for 2021.\nAnd speaking of the NFT business. Many of you saw the partnership with FTX we announced.\nFTX's platform and technical skills with the blockchain were the final pieces in the puzzle we\nfelt we needed to have to launch large scale collectible businesses with major partners. I don't\nthink there's anyone on this call that hasn't heard of FTX, but just in case, they are a leading\ncryptocurrency exchange with over 1 million users and over $10 billion of average trading\nvolume per day.\nLast month, they announced the largest raise in crypto exchange history, a $900 million Series B\nround, valuing their company at $18 billion. And to expand their visibility in the U.S., FTX saw\nsponsorship opportunities in the sports and eSports industries, which dovetail nicely with our\nNFT ambitions also in those industries.\nSome of FTX's sponsorship highlights include their 19-year naming rights deal for FTX Arena,\nhome of my beloved Miami Heat; their $210 million 10-year sponsorship of TSM, labeled the\nmost valuable team in eSports by Forbes, the largest sponsorship deal in eSports history; and\ntheir groundbreaking deal to become the official cryptocurrency exchange brand of Major\nTranscript Provided by\nLeague Baseball, the first such agreement with one of the major sports leagues in the United\nStates.\nSo, in summary, we feel our goals and interests in the NFT space are aligned. Now Dolphin will\ndevelop and execute the creative branding, production and marketing of these programs,\nalongside FTX, who will use their crypto exchange services and technical development as the\nbackbone of the marketplaces. Together, we will develop and program global NFT marketplaces\ntargeting all of Dolphin's verticals, including the sports, film, television, music, gaming, eSports,\nculinary, lifestyle and charity industries.\nWe see the trading of NFTs as much more than just a list of digital products. We view our\nmarketplace experiences as the future of fandom for internationally recognized brands and\nfranchises in sports and entertainment. To achieve this vision, we need a seamless user\nexperience, because buying NFTs today is the opposite of that. To put it nicely, to buy NFTs\ntoday on the Ethereum blockchain, it's clunky. We wanted to be able to have the wallet and the\nproduct all in one place.\nWe wanted to be able to allow the consumer to pay with crypto, credit card or traditional\ncurrency. We wanted to have the product available on wholly owned and programmed online\ndestinations. We want to have the same product available for purchase directly in-app. And we\nalso wanted to have actual customer support when necessary, all of which are enormous\ndifferentiating factors that FTX either provides now or can provide as we build larger and larger\nmarketplaces, which we intend to do.\nTo put it simply, Dolphin and many, many others were waiting for the ability to sell NFTs using\ncredit cards and for the elimination of gas fees that prohibit competitively pricing collectibles.\nThere's simply no business rationale for selling products at $10 or $20 when it costs you $100 in\ngas fees to upload those products for sale.\nAnd by the way, when it would cost the consumer another $100 to download the product after\nbuying it. Those gas fees are why the NFT markets, primarily up until now, have been dominated\nby speculative assets like art because they can be priced at $1,000 or more, where even $100 in\ngas fees becomes just a fraction of the cost.\nNow with FTX and the ability to take credit cards and the elimination of gas fees, we think for\nourselves and honestly, for the major studios and record labels that have predominantly sat on\nthe sidelines as well, waiting like we have been, when you can sell digital products for any price\npoint, like $25 or less if you want to, then you can create a true market, a true cross industry\necosystem and e-collectibles.\nWe like the state of the industry and we like our position and experience within it, given that our\nPR firms have marketed collectibles for virtually every major studio’s consumer products\ndivision, as well as industry leaders like Funko and Mattel.\nTranscript Provided by\nWe know how to market collectibles. And now, we can make our own and price them\ncompetitively. Let's see what happens over the next few months. We're certainly very excited for\nthe possibilities.\nAnd to remind everyone, NFTs only represent one of the Dolphin 2.0 initiatives we expect to\nannounce this year. We believe each of these 2.0 initiatives, including NFTs, have the potential\nto be a major catalyst for our company. Dolphin 2.0, after having identified the first initiative in\ncontent and after identifying the first initiative in equity stakes, is gathering momentum and we\ncan't wait to share more.\nAnd did I mention that we have reported positive operating income on record revenues? Yes, I\ndid, okay. That's good. And how about the fact that we have a working capital surplus with more\ncash on the books than all remaining debt, including both long-term and the PPP loans, which we\nexpect to be forgiven? I already said that, too, okay, great.\nI just want to make sure I didn't forget to mention that we are a profitable entertainment\nmicrocap company with a working capital surplus and more cash on our books than total debt\nbefore we even start Dolphin 2.0. Okay. I'm just glad I didn't forget to say that.\nI'd like to finish my prepared remarks at the same point I started them by saying the most sincere\nthank you to everyone who had faith in us along our journey. We are far from reaching our\nfullest potential, and we know that.\nBut it's also important to celebrate successfully reaching milestones along the way. And I would\nsay that record revenues, positive operating income and a working capital surplus are each\nabsolutely a reason to celebrate.\nSo with that said, I'll now turn it over to Mirta.\nMirta Negrini - CFO & COO, Dolphin Entertainment, Inc.\nThank you, Bill. And good afternoon, everyone. I will now discuss results for the quarter ended\nJune 30, 2021. Revenue for the quarter ended June 30, 2021, was approximately $8.6 million\ncompared to approximately $5.2 million in the quarter ended June 30, 2020.\nOverall operating expenses for the second quarter of 2021 were approximately $8.6 million\ncompared to approximately $5.4 million in the second quarter of 2020. Operating expenses are\ncomposed of direct costs, selling, general and administrative costs, depreciation and\namortization, legal and professional fees, and payroll costs.\nDirect costs for the second quarter of 2021 were $833,511 compared to $656,849 in the same\nperiod of the prior year. Selling, general and administrative expenses for the second quarter of\n2021 were approximately $1.2 million compared to $978,527 in the second quarter of 2020.\nTranscript Provided by\nLegal and professional fees were $457,998 in the second quarter of 2021 compared to $362,853\nin the second quarter of 2020. Payroll costs were approximately $5.6 million in the second\nquarter of 2021 as compared to approximately $2.9 million in the second quarter of 2020.\nOperating income for the quarter ended June 30, 2021, of $56,293, included non-cash items from\ndepreciation and amortization of $478,270, as compared to an operating loss of $179,038, which\nincluded non-cash items from depreciation and amortization of $496,461 for the same period in\nthe prior year.\nNet income for the quarter ended June 30, 2021 of approximately $1.3 million, included the\nbenefit of approximately net $1.0 million in non-cash items, primarily from a $1.0 million gain\non extinguishment of debt and positive changes in the fair value of derivative liabilities, warrants\nand contingent consideration of $498,974, partially offset by depreciation and amortization of\n$478,270.\nThis compares to a net loss of approximately $2.9 million, which included non-cash items from\ndepreciation and amortization of $496,461, a negative change in fair value of derivative\nliabilities, warrants, put rights, and contingent consideration items in the amount of $1.7 million\nand approximately $0.9 million from the beneficial conversion feature of a certain convertible\ninstruments for the three months ended June 30, 2020.\nFor the three months ended June 30, 2021, we have basic earnings per share of $0.17 per share\nbased on 7,664,000 weighted average shares outstanding and diluted earnings per share of $0.13\nper share based on 7,913,396 weighted average shares outstanding.\nFor the three months ended June 30, 2020, we had basic and diluted loss per share of $0.62 per\nshare based on 4,719,241 weighted average shares outstanding. Cash and cash equivalents were\n$9.9 million as of June 30, 2021, compared to $8.6 million as of December 31, 2020, including\nrestricted cash of approximately $0.7 million in each period.\nThat concludes my financial remarks. I will now ask the operator to open the phone line for\nQ&A. Operator, can you please poll for questions?\nOperator\nCertainly, thank you. [Operator Instructions] We will go first to Allen Klee at Maxim Group.\nYour line is open, sir. Please go ahead.\nQ: Thank you. And congratulations, this was really an impressive quarter. A couple of things on\nthe financials to start. The sequential increase in revenue from the first quarter, where did that\ncome from? And any thoughts on the sustainability of it? Thank you.\nBill O’Dowd - Chairman & CEO, Dolphin Entertainment, Inc.\nSure. Allen, thank you. Yes, this is a nice call to be on. Well, I mean, we -- first, on the\nsustainability, we're excited about the fact that our revenues grew as they did without movies in\nTranscript Provided by\ntheaters and without the restaurant business and without the live touring to a large degree, as we\ntalked about on our last quarter.\nSo really, I want to give the credit, obviously, to each of the subs because this is where having\nmarket leaders in their respective fields makes a difference, they're growing even without certain\nrecovery catalysts. And I think it was a little surprising to many -- the growth we did experience\nfrom the first quarter.\nI think with Q3 and through the end of this year, I am feeling that we certainly don't see anything\nthat -- there is no one time revenue or event that occurred or something that would -- it was just\norganic growth. And we anticipate -- we don't see any reason why it can't continue.\nAnd I am not saying though that I think certain of those recovery categories will come back this\nyear. As of right now, at least, as I stated in the prepared remarks, I don't think we are confident.\nI do not think we are confident in the music business right now, but we're hopeful.\nAnd the restaurants, we're also waiting and seeing. So obviously, that only bodes well for 2022\nbecause I don't think any of us think it will go beyond that. So that's just organic growth across\neach of the subs.\nQ: All right. Thank you. I just have a few more financial related questions. If I were to calculate\nthe gross margin, if I took your direct costs and payroll and imagine that as cost of goods sold\nand came up with a gross margin, that number also improved sequentially.\nSo the profitability of the gross profits, and I was wondering if you could maybe point to what\nwas behind that and thoughts on the potential for that to improve?\nBill O’Dowd - Chairman & CEO, Dolphin Entertainment, Inc.\nWell, to a large degree, it's that we've invested to keep our very best people during a pandemic,\nright. And in doing so, I'm trying to look beyond the pandemic and when you've got superstars\nand we think we've got a whole host of them, we wanted to keep them even if they were working\nat 70%, 80%, 90% capacity and you're starting to see that. I mean look at the margin growth, to\nyour point, Allen. Quite simply the same amount of people were able to handle a little bit more\nwork, and there it is.\nAnd we'd rather invest in the people we have and have them all at full salary and et cetera, than\nsome of our competitors who have been laying off people or what not. So it worked out very\nwell for us this quarter and, we think, going forward.\nQ: Right. I also -- in the last three quarters, your SG&A has declined sequentially. Could you\nexplain what's going on there?\nBill O’Dowd - Chairman & CEO, Dolphin Entertainment, Inc.\nTranscript Provided by\nWe're pulling it up, Allen, to make sure we -- sure. And that one, I don't know off the top of my\nhead, brother.\nQ: That's all right. I can move on. So for Dolphin 2.0, where you're owning an asset. In -- big\npicture, not specific numbers, do you think that the margins of the businesses, in general, when\nyou own it compared to where you're doing the PR marketing that -- how do you think the\nmargins would be for the 2.0 businesses relative to your legacy other businesses?\nBill O’Dowd - Chairman & CEO, Dolphin Entertainment, Inc.\nYes. I mean in one sentence, the thought process is, of course, that when you can own the asset,\nyou make a better margin and gross dollars, too, I might add, than servicing the asset. So I'm\nexcited for the margins we're showing now. And thank you for pointing that out, Allen, that was\na sophisticated question you asked previously.\nBut when we go into 2.0 with successful assets, there's just -- you could service all day long,\nyou'll never get to the margin, ever, that you could do by servicing assets you own, obviously. So\nspeaking as someone who's produced successful television series in the past and digital series\nand it just doesn't compare on a dollar-for-dollar investment basis.\nSo as we get -- as our company evolves and includes more and more and more 2.0 initiatives and\nwhere we'll be in a quarter, where we'll be three years from now, like we -- I took us on a trip\ndown memory lane in my prepared remarks to thank those who were with us since three years\nago, when we laid out the strategy of three years for the Super Group that we could get to this\nday. I think three years after starting 2.0, the margin profile will be vastly, hopefully, even\nstronger than it is today because we'll have a much bigger mix of 2.0 to go with our 1.0 revenue.\nQ: That's great. And on...\nBill O’Dowd - Chairman & CEO, Dolphin Entertainment, Inc.\nAnd by the way, our -- if I could add, our CEOs not only know that. That's why they joined\nDolphin, right. The whole point of doing Dolphin, the whole point from -- and it seems timely to\nreminisce back to the roadshow that, as I mentioned, at LD Micro as Josh Scheinfeld and Tim\nBard were listen -- Tim Johnson, sorry, were listening into, then the whole vision was to get to\nthis point so that we could own some of the assets we were marketing.\nAnd that's why each of those private company owners joined the group because they know the\nmargin is better. They know what can happen if you have a successful piece of content or live\nevent or consumer product.\nSo I think I mentioned it on the 10-K call this year, what 2021 represented for all of us was and\nis the starting line, and that's why we're so excited. And it's great to be at the starting line with\nwhere we are financially, obviously. Sorry, Allen, I know you had another question.\nTranscript Provided by\nQ: No, no, that's fine. Thank you. For NFTs, it seems like the FTX partnership is pretty\nmeaningful and potentially game changing. Could you comment on where you think that can\nbring this business? And kind of what we can look forward to seeing in '21?\nBill O’Dowd - Chairman & CEO, Dolphin Entertainment, Inc.\nYes, sure. Our friends at FTX probably don't need us to share their selling points, if you will, for\nthem. But obviously, they're a great, well recognized company and doing it very quickly with\njust a couple of years of existence.\nBut what they represent for us as we were out there looking at serving the landscape of NFTs,\nright, and where the business was going to go, right. I think, we, by that, I mean, people that have\nsold or marketed a collectibles business, not an art business, the collectibles business.\nPreviously, in the physical world, we needed to create price points that were under $50 a\nproduct, and we needed to create price points in the $10 to $25 range, and it just wasn't possible\nuntil you could eliminate the gas fees. You needed a different blockchain then -- or a\nworkaround to the current Ethereum blockchain, where NFTs are primarily sold. So that's point\nnumber one.\nAnd secondly, to reach all consumers and not just 1% of consumers, you needed to -- you'd be\nable to have the consumer pay with something other than crypto. So when we were looking for\nthose two things, FTX not only fit those two bills and allowed us to do both of those, but they're\nan exchange, and they’re global -- both the U.S. component to FTX and the international one,\ntoo.\nSo as we have aspirations to do global NFT marketplaces, right, in those industries and music, I\nmean, there's nothing more global than music, right, film, television, other industries and\nverticals that are global by nature, right.\nThen to be able to accept payment in not just credit card, obviously, it eliminates much of it, but\n-- and in crypto but in fiat currency too, and with an exchange that's licensed and available\nglobally. And that is the technical partner and the blockchain partner we wanted for what our\naspirations are in the collectibles business.\nWhen you think about the promise of digital delivery, right? What's the biggest disruptor in that\nin our industry in our lifetime, Netflix, right? Well, what did Netflix have that traditional linear\ncable channels didn't? They weren't bound by national boundaries. They -- they're a global\nservice. It's digital delivery on a global scale. Collectibles can be transformed that same way with\ndigital delivery if you have a partner that can be global.\nAnd a reason to highlight those two or three sponsorship deals FTX did -- and I'll state the\nobvious here, but I think it's implied. You can't just drop a check and name a major sports arena\nin this country, right. If you -- they named an NBA franchise's arena and they're the official\npartner of Major League Baseball.\nTranscript Provided by\nAltogether, either one of those deals, you're vetted six ways to Sunday, right. This is an exchange\nthat in the U.S. follows the KYC compliance, know your customer. They follow AML, anti-\nmoney laundering laws. They have to be, to be endorsed and accepted by two of the four major\nsports leagues and the only cryptocurrency exchange by any.\nSo we can't feel more comfortable with our choice of partner and their technological expertise is\nexactly what we want in the market to seek as we got closer to this fall as we have aspirations,\nagain, for global collectibles marketplaces. And so we're excited about the partnership. We've\nenjoyed our time with them so far, and there's a lot more to come.\nQ: It seems like what FTX -- and one of the other opportunities, and I think you might have --\nyou did touch on this is -- but the NFT market could potentially be transforming from more of a\nhigh end art market to more collectibles lower end. And so we may not even know if we're\nlooking at what's happened this year with high end, what the real opportunity is as this market is\nbeing created for a different type of product. What do you think about that?\nBill O’Dowd - Chairman & CEO, Dolphin Entertainment, Inc.\nYes. I think -- I don't think we'll even need a three year horizon. I'd be surprised at 12 months\nfrom now. Whatever we're calling NFTs today, and maybe a branding or marketing campaign\nwill change that, right. Whatever that is 12 months from now, will be a market that's bifurcated.\nThere still will probably be an art or a speculative market aspect to trading on the blockchain. I\ndon't think it will go away. It's not something we have any particular interest in or our expertise\nin.\nBut I imagine a world in which the major studios are launching their own collectibles, from\nDisney to Paramount to Universal to Warner Bros. to Sony, to the major record labels, Sony\nMusic, Warner Music, Universal Music. That's a lot of marketing, that's a lot of firepower. That's\na lot of pop culture recognition across the general consumer population. I mean, they'll be almost\nunavoidable that products are being offered.\nAnd I think -- and if you have custom interfaces, which we're getting to, and if you have the\nability to pay with a credit card, then purchasing and an NFT is going to be indistinguishable\nfrom purchasing a mug on eBay or a product from Amazon, right. You're going to go to a\ncustom interface website and you're going to purchase something.\nSo I think if that is all grouped under the umbrella of what an NFT business is, great. If it's\nsomething -- if it's just seen as just more -- if it's just seen as what it will be, selling consumer\nproducts and tickets to experiences and unlocking value for collectors or value for people buying\nthese digital products in real world benefits, too, then it's going to look vastly different. And it\nwill be -- it will -- it has the potential to boom is why we're excited to be in it.\nI mean, the dollar amounts in the NFT space have been reported widely up until now. But if\nsomeone really wants to think about it, how many people, gross number of people in the U.S.\nhave bought an NFT today. I do not believe it would have been -- I don't think that number\nwould reach 1 million people.\nTranscript Provided by\n12 months from now, we might have 10 million, 25 million, 50 million people who have bought\nwhat we call an NFT, which is a collectible that just happened to be delivered on the blockchain.\nSo it's an exponential growth of the consumer base, and that's what we see coming and why we\nwant to play in that space.\nQ: Last question. How do you feel about the environment for producing an independent film?\nBill O’Dowd - Chairman & CEO, Dolphin Entertainment, Inc.\nBetter. I do. I don't want to get ahead of my skis on what any of our content initiatives that we\nmay know are coming, but I would say that I do feel better, Allen. The industry is coming back.\nProduction insurance, while not solved completely, is getting into a place where I feel that there\nwill be more independent production starting even as early as Q4 this year, certainly Q1 of next\nyear.\nAnd without having to take the very expensive burden of risking a COVID outbreak on set. So I\ndo feel good about production, and I'd be surprised if we aren't able to take advantage of\nopportunities in the filmed entertainment space in the coming months.\nQ: That's great. Congratulations. Thank you.\nBill O’Dowd - Chairman & CEO, Dolphin Entertainment, Inc.\nThank you, Allen.\nOperator\nAnd with no other questions holding, I'll turn the conference back to Mr. O'Dowd for any\nadditional or closing comments.\nBill O’Dowd - Chairman & CEO, Dolphin Entertainment, Inc.\nWell, thank you. I was looking forward to a second questioner. But, Allen, as usual, he's very\nthorough. So he probably took a lot of people's questions. And thank you for those.\nAnd I'm excited for what's to come. I think by the time we speak again in this format in 13 weeks\nin the middle of November, I imagine we'll have quite a few hopeful additional topics to talk\nabout than what we are free to talk about today. And maybe that's just all part of the plan. It\nallows today to be a celebration of those three milestones we hit. It certainly feels great as I think\nyou probably sensed from my prepared remarks.\nRecord revenue.\nCongratulations to each of the companies within Dolphin, to report positive operating income\neven after the depreciation and amortization, which is higher for our company than others\nTranscript Provided by\nbecause we've been an acquisition story up until now. It is really a fabulous milestone since\nlisting on NASDAQ.\nAnd of course, our working capital surplus. We've got a great balance sheet that's only going to\nimprove. And I'm very, very thankful for those who believed in us from day one, and we picked\nup along the way. And this type of validation, I'm sure, is very comforting for them.\nSo thank you, everybody, that's been listening, and I appreciate the time. And we look forward to\nspeaking again in the next quarter and see what we can talk about. Have a great day.\nOperator\nLadies and gentlemen, that will conclude today's conference. We thank you for your\nparticipation. You may disconnect at this time. And have a great day.\nTranscript Provided by"

And welcome to Dolphin Entertainment First Quarter 2021\nEarnings Call. All lines have been placed in a listen-only mode and the floor will be opened for\nyour questions and comments following presentation. [Operator Instructions]\nAt this time, it is my pleasure to turn floor over to your host, James Carbonara. Sir, the floor is\nyours.\nJames Carbonara - Investor Relations, Dolphin Entertainment, Inc.\nThank you, and once again, welcome to Dolphin Entertainment’s first quarter 2021 earnings call.\nWith me on the call are Bill O’Dowd, Chief Executive Officer and Mirta Negrini, Chief\nFinancial Officer.\nI would like to begin the call by reading the Safe Harbor statement. This statement is made\npursuant to the Safe Harbor statement for forward-looking statements described in the Private\nSecurities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.\nAll statements made on this call with the exception of historical facts may be considered\nforward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and\nSection 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.\nAlthough the company believes that expectations and assumptions reflected in these forward-\nlooking statements are reasonable, it makes no assurances that such expectations will prove to\nhave been correct.

We do not undertake any obligation to update or supplement any forward-looking\nstatements to reflect subsequent knowledge, events or circumstances.\nNow, I would like to turn the call over to Bill O’Dowd, Chief Executive Officer of Dolphin\nEntertainment. Bill, please proceed.\nBill O’Dowd - Chief Executive Officer, Dolphin Entertainment, Inc.\nThanks, James and hi, everyone. Good afternoon. Thank you for joining us today. It does feel\nlike only yesterday when we heard James reading Safe Harbor statement for the 10-K. It’s hard\nto believe it was only four weeks ago.\nFollowing in our traditional format, I will start by discussing our financials at a high level and\nthen speak about Dolphin 1.0 and the B/HI acquisition in the first quarter and then move to our\nlaunch of Dolphin 2.0 in the first quarter and our subsequent announcements regarding NFTs.\nSo, beginning with financials. First quarter revenue grew to approximately 7.2 million from 6.6\nmillion last year. We continue to believe that full year 2021 revenues will pass 30 million\nwithout taking into account any Dolphin 2.0 initiatives. And as we noted in today’s press release,\nour Q1 top line financials reflect the strength of our Super Group. However, we had a bottom\nline net loss of 5.3 million, which was largely the result of non-cash charges in the aggregate\namount of 4.4 million, stemming primarily from changes in fair value accounting that has\naffected Dolphin for the past four years from March 2017 through March of 2021. We are\npleased to report that all puts from the purchase of 42West in 2017 have now been exercised and\nfurthermore, all the 20,000 warrants have either expired or been exercised as well. We expect\nthis elimination of derivative exposure will greatly simplify our balance sheet. And combined\nwith our expectation to reach positive working capital within this year, we’ll unlock significant\nshareholder value.\nMoving to Dolphin 1.0 first quarter and year to date highlights, we’ll begin with 42West. As\nmany of you know, the most recent Power 50 List of PR firms in this country from the New\nYork Observer, 42West was ranked the most powerful PR firm in entertainment. Unsurprisingly,\n42West brought that power to another successful academy award season, culminating in a 2021\nceremony that sought 42West involved in various capacities with 13 films that earned a total of\n32 Academy Award nominations, and won six Oscars. 42West to worked on elements of the\nawards campaigns for Nomaldand, which led all films with three wins including Best Picture,\nSound of Metal which tied for second and overall wins with two for Best Film Editing and best\nsound and Promising Young Woman, which was given the first award of the night, Best Original\nScreenplay.\nTranscript Provided by\nEarlier this year, we acquired B/HI, a leading entertainment consumer products video gaming\nand esports PR firm that has become a division of 42West. The acquisition of B/HI provides an\nentry point into the final outstanding sizable vertical of entertaining for our Super Group, the\n$160 billion video gaming and esports market. This transaction has been instantly rewarding as\nwe announced soon after the purchase of B/HI, we signed Funko to promote their Snapsies\nconsumer product line, marketing Funko launch into the toy vertical. And 42West and B/HI have\nalso signed Tyler Blevins, otherwise known to his fans as Ninja, the most popular video gamer in\nthe world. It’s been a great start with B/HI.\nAlso in the Dolphin family is Shore Fire Media, the very best in the music PR business. This\nmonth, it was announced that Shore Fire clients Carole King and Todd Rundgren were inducted\ninto the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame. In addition Shore Fire regularly has fantastic nights at the\nGrammy Awards, including this year, when Shore Fire’s client base earned 15 Grammy\nnominations, including one for Album of the Year in multiple genres of film and comedy\ncategories.\nThe third cornerstone of our PR firms is The Door, we unequivocally adore this company. They\nare the foremost culinary and hospitality PR firm in the world. And they’ve launched a\nConsumer Products Division that has grown immensely, and which is a considerable opportunity\nfor us. The Door played leading roles in some of our first NFTs announcements since launching\nour NFT division in the first quarter, and we’ll highlight that shortly.\nIn addition to these three PR firms is Viewpoint Creative, our creative agency that we believe\ncreates the finest marketing videos in the field, among many other inspired resources. Their\nheritage is in TV and we’ve now leveraged their skills to create publicity videos for clients\nspanning our PR firms, including the Consumer Products Division at The Door. This month\nViewpoint partnered with The Door to develop strategy and digital content for Leary Firefighters\nFoundation’s international firefighters’ day broadcast event, which recognizes firefighters and\nlaunches the foundation’s virtual training video series with the largest fire training exercise in\nNew York City.\nAnd our recent acquisition of Be Social, a leading influencer marketing firm out of Los Angeles,\nhas been highly strategic for us. As many listeners know, Be Social represents both popular\nindividual influencers under its talent management division and also services individual brands\nthrough both organic and paid influencer marketing campaigns, media relations, digital strategy\nand events. Be Social’s own labeled product BrandEdit, an organic sampling turnkey solution for\nbrand discovery and amplification has been extremely well received and we expect to grow from\ntwo such launches in 2020, to eight of them in 2021. So, all of our members of the Super Group\nare off to a great start for the year.\nMoving to Dolphin 2.0. As a reminder, for anyone new on the call or to the Dolphin story, we\ndefine the work of our Super Group under Dolphin 1.0 as the marketing of pop culture and we\ndefine what we call Dolphin 2.0 as using pop culture to market, specifically marketing assets that\nwe own. And in 2021, we expect to launch six dolphin 2.0 products or initiatives with two each\nacross ownership categories of first, consumer products; second, entertainment content; and\nTranscript Provided by\nthird, equity in other companies. The first of these six has already launched, it falls under the\nconsumer products category and is our NFTs division.\nIn Q1 we announced the formation of our new division dedicated to designing, producing,\nreleasing and promoting NFTs for ourselves and our partners within the film, television, music,\ngaming, culinary, sports and technology industries. As we mentioned at the time, NFTs, whether\nit’s digital art in their own right, or as collectibles, or simply as promotional items, have entered\nthe realm of pop culture and entertainment, which is where Dolphin lives. We believe Dolphin’s\nbest-in-class entertainment marketing companies are uniquely positioned to capitalize on the\nexpanded promotional capabilities that NFTs represent, as well as to maximize their potential\nrevenue streams.\nWe also announced our first NFTs vertical, sports through a partnership with Hall of Fame\nResort and Entertainment Company. HOFV is a leader, at the crossroads of professional football\nand entertainment, which makes them a perfect first partner for Dolphin’s new NFT division.\nEarlier today, we dropped our first collection of NFTs together, very exciting, around the iconic\nwide receiver Tim Brown, one of only 10 men to both won the Heisman Trophy and to have\nbeen inducted into the Professional Football Hall of Fame. The items are currently available on\nOpenSea and can also be viewed at TimBrownNFTs.com. We are very proud of these pieces, as\nwe know are Tim and our partners at HOFV, they are the perfect launch into this exciting new\nworld of opportunities for Dolphin.\nSpeaking of which, today we announced the culinary world will be our second vertical for NFTs.\nThrough the leadership of The Door, our NFT division has begun developing a first of its kind,\nNFT collectible recipe card system, which will debut with some of the most important culinary\nfigures in the country, including world renowned chefs Nina Compton, Hugh Acheson, Marc\nForgione, Dale Talde and Ludo Lefebvre, to name just a few. Each partner chef in this and future\nRecipe Card NFT programs will create exclusive seasonally inspired recipes that will come to\nlife with visually stunning digital 3D art that will be exclusive to the consumers who buy the\nNFTs. We are thinking about collectibles in every space we work in within the entertainment\nindustry. And when it comes to the culinary world, collectibles begin and end with recipes. We\nbelieve our upcoming Recipe Card collection will be the first major entry in the culinary NFT\nspace.\nAdditionally, in the culinary space, just less than two hours ago, we launched a really unique\nNFT collection with Romero Britto in collaboration with longtime Door client, The South Beach\nWine & Food Festival. Many folks know Romero as a world famous, as the founder of The\nHappy Art Movement. Another fun fact about Romero though is that he designed the very first\nguest pass for The South Beach Wine & Food Festival 20 years ago. So as this year’s edition is\nthis week, it only seems fitting that he launches this collection to support the festival. His\noriginal art piece entitled It’s So Miami just went on auction on OpenSea, as I mentioned a\ncouple of hours ago and check it out also at Britto -- excuse me BrittoNFTs.com. I can say it’s\nreally cool. And as a native Miami and I can definitely say that Romero captures the vibrancy of\nour city like no other artist I’ve ever seen.\nTranscript Provided by\nSo we are often running in the NFT space and it is hard as it is to believe NFTs only represent\none of the six Dolphin 2.0 initiatives we expect to announce this year. We believe we will be\nannouncing one more consumer products initiative this year, along with two in entertainment\ncontent, and another two as equity and other companies that are launching entertainment content\nor consumer products. We believe each of these six initiatives, including NFTs have the potential\nto be a major catalyst for our company. Dolphin 2.0 was here and we could not be more excited.\nWith that said, I’ll now turn it over to Mirta.\nMirta Negrini - Chief Financial Officer, Dolphin Entertainment, Inc.\nThank you, Bill and good afternoon, everyone. I will now discuss results for the quarter ended\nMarch 31, 2021. Revenue for the quarter ended March 31, 2021 was 7.2 million compared to 6.6\nmillion in the quarter ended March 31, 2020. Overall operating expenses for Q1 2021 were\napproximately 8.4 million compared to 7.5 million in Q1 of 2020. Operating expenses are\ncomposed of direct costs, selling general and administrative costs, depreciation and amortization,\nlegal and professional fees and payroll costs.\nDirect costs for Q1 of 2021 were approximately 829,000 compared to 689,000 in the same\nperiod of prior year. Selling, general and administrative expenses for Q1 2021 were 1.5 million\ncompared to 1.1 million in Q1 of 2020. Legal and professional fees were 345,000 in Q1 of 2021\ncompared to 284,000 in Q1 of 2020. Payroll costs were approximately 5.2 million in Q1 of 2021\nas compared to 4.9 million in Q1 of 2020.\nOperating loss for the quarter ended March 31, 2021 of 1.2 million, included non-cash items\nfrom depreciation and amortization of $482,712 as compared to an operating loss of $870,859,\nwhich included non-cash items from depreciation and amortization of $521,003 for the same\nperiod in the prior year. Net loss for the quarter ended March 31, 2021 was approximately 5.3\nmillion, which included $4.4 million in non-cash items stemming from depreciation and\namortization of $482,712 and a negative change in fair value of derivative liabilities, warrants,\nput rights and contingent consideration of 3.9 million, compared to net income of $2.1 million,\nwhich included non-cash items from depreciation and amortization of $521,003, offset by a non-\ncash positive change in fair value of derivative liabilities, warrants, put rights and contingent\nconsideration items in the amount of $1.8 million, for the same period in the prior year.\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2021, we had basic and diluted loss per share of $0.73,\nbased on 7,267,297 shares outstanding. For the three months ended March 31, 2020, we had\nbasic earnings per share of $0.40 based on 4,099,713 shares outstanding and diluted earnings per\nshare of $0.05 per share, based on 5,676,996 shares outstanding. Cash and cash equivalents were\n7.1 million as of March 31, 2021 compared to 7.9 million as of December 31, 2020.\nThat concludes my financial remarks. I will now ask the operator to open the phone line for\nQ&A. Operator, can you please call for questions?\nOperator\nTranscript Provided by\nThank you. [Operator Instructions] And we take our first question from Allen Klee with the\nMaxim Group. Please go ahead.\nQ: Hi, good afternoon. You had a lot of stuff going on in a positive way. Could you start off\ntalking about, just in general, for your entertainment segments, how you’re thinking about the\nrecovery, in terms of movies and music and the other way areas, live events to kind of where you\nthink, like, we’re going to see things to start to pick up. Thank you.\nBill O’Dowd - Chief Executive Officer, Dolphin Entertainment, Inc.\nSure. Thank you, Allen. And yeah, we’re very excited too and see a lot of positive things\nhappening as well. Well, and that’s reflected a little bit in the in the revenue growth, right. I\nmean, we went sequentially up from fourth quarter pretty significantly, broke 7 million for the\nfirst time. Expect will do better here in the second quarter. Of course, as the country is starting to\nopen up, in terms of movies, which is where we started, the movie release calendar is firming up;\nmovies are being slotted and held in those dates by the studios and independents alike. 42West is\nsigning an awful lot of business for the second half of this year. And we feel really bullish about\n42West having the return of the movie business to complement all the great work they’re doing\nwith the streaming services. Hard to believe that’s growing, too. But it’s been a good year of\nstreaming services work and adding the movies to it will only help. And yeah, we feel very good\nabout that.\nAnd in terms of other aspects, Shore Fire is doing very, very well for us. I think they’re having\nrecord revenue on a monthly basis, coming into the summer. That will only increase with the\nreturn of live music. Some of the smaller venues are talking about coming back in Q3, Q4, we\nexpect that will happen. We have such a large roster of musicians that many of them play those\ntypes of venues. Obviously, your major acts whether it’s Dave Matthews Band, Bruce\nSpringsteen or whatnot, those acts play arenas and I’m not as confident that we’ll be back by Q4\nbut certainly next year. But just with the return of the bulk of the live music in the second half of\nthis year, I think we’re going to continue to see Shore Fire growing and establishing new records\nfor themselves, as they’ve already been doing.\nThe last of the recovery for us The Door, hotels, we’re seeing come back, which is exciting. I\nimagine it will be more -- it’ll ramp in more Q3 which is the second half of the year should be\ngood for us in that regard. What I don’t have visibility on, on this call, would be the restaurant\nbusiness. We know that the world is opening up, we know that restaurants are looking at opening\nbut sitting here today, I don’t have visibility on that. Obviously, that would be monumental\nbecause of the leadership position they have in the restaurant business. All of this revenue\ngrowth is being done without $1 of restaurant businesses that comes in, it will make an\nimmediate impact. So I imagine by the time we speak again in August, we’ll have visibility if it\nhasn’t already started, if that’s helpful.\nQ: That’s great. And then in your longer term plans to be able to also produce content such as\nmovies, I know there has been a challenge of waiting for insurance to be available. Any thoughts\non where that stands? And when that might get resolved or whatever else that needs to get\nresolved? Thank you.\nTranscript Provided by\nBill O’Dowd - Chief Executive Officer, Dolphin Entertainment, Inc.\nYeah, I feel bullish about that, too. I just came back from Los Angeles, where I was last week,\nthe combination of either production insurance or the simple fact that vaccinations are taking up,\npeople are starting to plan and production could occur this year. And independent production,\nI’m talking about, not studios or streamers that are self-funding. And so I feel very good about\nthat. It’s certainly playing into our belief that we’ll have two entertainment content\nannouncements this year. I feel very good about that.\nAnd part of that is because we know that we expect we can go into production, obviously\ncomplementing a second consumer products initiative and then of course the two taking equity in\nother people’s companies. It -- content, we want those two from content and make sure we hit all\nsix this year, and I’m confident that we’ll have that. And I think that’s great for the sector. And\nit’s been so -- it’s been a hard year for a lot of independent producers and artisans that work on\nindependent film. So it’s nice to see that second half of this year, we should see a return to\nproduction for them that’d be great.\nQ: Yeah, I don’t think the markets figured out like, at least the way you explain the business\nmodels that if they get sold -- if you do a smaller film, and you sell it to a streaming site where\nthey cover your costs, and you get a guaranteed profit. If -- I mean, if you’ve made a million\ndollars on like -- if you did a $5 million budget and got a 20% like profit on top of that, on your\nshare count that works out to like $0.14 a share and if you were able to do four of them a year,\nlike this is pretty meaningful to the bottom line at a much lower risk than what people used to\nthink of making movies. I mean, am I understanding that right or?\nBill O’Dowd - Chief Executive Officer, Dolphin Entertainment, Inc.\nYeah, you are. And you may want to become a producer yourself, Allen, I don’t know. But the --\nit’s why, in nutshell, what you just described is why the whole point of Dolphin 2.0, you can do\nso much better when you own what you’re marketing to, right. So build, scale, get the best-in-\nclass marketing companies across every vertical to give you as many cross-selling opportunities\nas possible, as many entry points into owning some of what you’re marketing as possible, and\nthen go back into production, which is something that we know very well.\nAnd production can mean movies, it can mean TV, it can mean podcasts, it can mean all types of\ndifferent forms of content, and do them all. And when you can access the very best creators,\nwhat often gets overlooked too, is the fact that 42West, as what we think is by far the very best\nwriter, director roster in Hollywood too. And when you can work with some really great\ncreatives, then you can make some really great content. And it’s at the cornerstone of the three\ninitiatives we really want to do; content, consumer products, and equity, and of course in 2022\nlive events. But for this year those three and we’re excited to go back into content. And then of\ncourse, that’s my background for 20 plus years, so it’s in the lifeblood of Dolphin.\nQ: When do you think we might have more clarity on some of the content, things like NFTs of\nhow to think about the economic business model of what it can mean to Dolphin Entertainment?\nTranscript Provided by\nBill O’Dowd - Chief Executive Officer, Dolphin Entertainment, Inc.\nI’ll stick by my thoughts on like 10-K call. I think, on our Q2 call, August 15, we should have\nlaid out a good number of the initiatives for the market, be able to start modeling, what people\nmay assume could be expected for either Q4 or 2022. By then we’ll have the visibility that I’m\nencouraged by after LA last week about production but also the announcements in those other\ninitiatives, whether it be equity or the other -- potentially the other consumer products initiative,\nthat might actually be the latest one, but the latest one in the year, I mean, but I would expect\nwe’d have many of the other initiatives already announced. So I think on a call, we could point to\nwhen we would expect to be able to start production as well as when we would expect to launch\nor receive revenue from the other initiatives as well.\nAnd then on the NFTs, what a day to day, I mean it kind of worked out fortuitously for us with\nan earnings call in the afternoon and we were launching the first of the Hall of Fame, partnership\nNFTs. We’re very proud of those. Those really represent, I think, the very best of what Dolphin\nhas to offer, which are these really cool NFTs. I encourage everyone to check them out and see\nwhat the artistry of those and big kudos to Charlie Dougiello, Lois O’Neill and others in the NFT\ndivision, Julia Levy for assembling and working through the creative process on those. But then\nalso, we announced our major -- second major category.\nAnd as I said, on the 10-K call, we expect to have an NFT strategy and partnerships in every\nvertical that we work in across all of pop culture. So, now we’re into sports and culinary. That’s\na big announcement for the foodies out there, I know. Gotten a few congratulations on those\nchefs that we announced but if you’re not as familiar in the food space, those are major, major\nchefs. And we’re excited for the culinary world. We have a lot we can do in there. The Recipe\nCard program will be a cornerstone for us, but there’s more coming. And then we’ll have more\nverticals to announce before August 15 too. So that’s where I think by that date, we’ll have a\nsense of the scope of the NFTs we’ll be creating by the end of the year and then into 2022.\nQ: Is there a way to attain -- for example, with the culinary, like, do you have an idea in the -- at\nleast in the first year of how many NFTs this would represent?\nBill O’Dowd - Chief Executive Officer, Dolphin Entertainment, Inc.\nWell, I think you can definitively state that we wouldn’t even call it a vertical if it wasn’t in the\nthousands. So and it’ll rapidly move into the tens of thousands, we would hope. So, that’s where\nI think in terms of modeling a scale, by time we get to August 15, that we’ve announced a third\nvertical and fourth vertical or so then you can start thinking about what that can mean on an\nannual basis. And I think the market will then see that there are some pretty high flying\nvaluations for NFT companies out there and I think we’re going to feel very good about our\nposition because we’re in so many different verticals. And each vertical can have multiple\nproducts, right. I mean, culinary is a massive field by itself, but so would be movies and TV. So\nwould be music, right.\nTranscript Provided by\nSo, I don’t think that’s been appreciated yet just how large our opportunity is within because any\none of these verticals is an entire business in and of itself. So, we’re excited for that to get\nrecognized and as we just launched the person and the products in market. A lot of people talk a\ngood game, but we’ve got product in market and more coming, so patience wins the day and 90\ndays from now, we’re excited to share what we have announced by then.\nQ: Okay, great. That’s it for me. Congratulations.\nBill O’Dowd - Chief Executive Officer, Dolphin Entertainment, Inc.\nThank you.\nOperator\nThere are no further questions. We return to Bill O’Dowd for closing remarks.\nBill O’Dowd - Chief Executive Officer, Dolphin Entertainment, Inc.\nSure. Well, thank you. Thank you, everyone. I know we – this is probably an easier and quicker\ncall since we just spoke a few weeks ago. But for those who’ve been following the Dolphin\nstory, pre-uplift onto NASDAQ, I know this day was coming to for the, as I said at the top of the\ncall, the removal of a lot of those derivative liabilities finished, the fact that we’ve exercised or\nhad all the puts exercised from the purchase of 42West four years -- that was a four year\nschedule and having that removed is just, again, a further element of this year having such a\nstronger balance sheet and we’re very excited for that, and the fact that all the 20,000 warrants\nhave been exercised or expired as well. So, we still feel we’ll have a positive working capital this\nyear and with all of the different exciting aspects of Dolphin 2.0, yes, including NFTs I know,\nthat’s what a lot of people want to talk about, but in addition to the NFTs, all the different\ninitiatives we have, as we’ve outlined the categories of them, we’re excited for what’s coming.\nSo now we’ll have a normal 90 days between calls. And I think you can expect a few different\nannouncements between now and then and hopefully get your hands around what we’re building\nhere and we’re all excited. In the meantime, please check out the NFTs, I think you’re going to\nlove them and we’ll hope for the best, especially across all of them but for the charitable aspect\nof the burrito [ph] pieces, we’d like to raise some money for charity as well. So, thank you\neveryone for your time and hope everybody has a great rest of their day. Thank you.\nOperator\nThank you. This does conclude today’s teleconference. We thank you for your participation. You\nmay disconnect your lines at this time. Have a great day.\nTranscript Provided by"
