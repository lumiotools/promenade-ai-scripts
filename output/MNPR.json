Monopar will be assembling a regulatory package and initiating discussions with the FDA, with an initial focus on Wilson disease patients with more severe symptoms. More details on this transaction can be found here ([link](https://ir.monopartx.com/press-releases/detail/105/monopar-announces-agreement-with-alexion-astrazeneca-rare)). \n\n\n\n**_MNPR_** -**_101 for Radiopharmaceutical Use – Phase 1_**\n\n  * In August 2024, the Company received regulatory clearance in Australia to commence a first-in-human Phase 1a therapeutic clinical trial of its novel urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR)-targeted radiopharmaceutical therapy MNPR-101-Lu (MNPR-101 conjugated to lutetium-177) in patients with advanced solid cancers. The Company activated its first clinical trial site and launched the study in October 2024; the trial is currently active and recruiting patients. \n  * In September 2024, the Company announced positive early clinical data from its ongoing open-label Phase 1 imaging and dosimetry clinical trial of MNPR-101-Zr that validate the tumor-targeting ability of MNPR-101-Zr. In October, the Company presented additional clinical data at the European Association of Nuclear Medicine Annual Congress 2024. The data demonstrate clear and durable tumor uptake of MNPR-101-Zr in a patient with advanced ovarian cancer and show favorable biodistribution with low off-target binding. \n  * The Company is also actively exploring opportunities to expand its radiopharmaceutical pipeline primarily through internal development efforts. In October 2024, the Company announced the filing of a provisional patent application for new radiopharmaceutical compounds and a family of linkers used to connect radioisotopes with targeting agents, including its uPAR-targeting antibody MNPR-101. This provisional patent could enable the Company to use these linkers to create new proprietary radiopharmaceuticals to pursue well-established, high-value cancer targets of interest. \n\n\n\n**_Capital Raise_**\n\n  * On October 30, 2024, the Company completed a registered public offering of 1,181,540 shares of the Company’s common stock at $16.25 per share, generating net proceeds of approximately $17.7 million, after deducting placement agent fees and other estimated offering expenses. \n\n\n\n**Results for the Third Quarter Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to the Third Quarter Ended September 30, 2023**\n\n**_Cash and Net Loss_**\n\nCash and cash equivalents as of September 30, 2024, were $6.0 million. As noted above, the Company completed a registered public offering on October 30, 2024 that yielded net proceeds to the Company of approximately $17.7 million, after deducting placement agent fees and other estimated offering expenses.\n\nMonopar projects that its current funds will be sufficient to continue operations at least into the first half of 2026, including to: (1) assemble a regulatory package and initiate discussions with the FDA on ALXN-1840 for Wilson disease; (2) continue to conduct and conclude its first-in-human imaging and dosimetry Phase 1 clinical trial with MNPR-101-Zr; (3) continue to conduct its first-in-human therapeutic radiopharma clinical trial with MNPR-101-Lu; (4) advance its preclinical MNPR-101-Ac program into the clinic, and (5) invest in internal R&D projects to expand its radiopharma pipeline.\n\nNet loss for the third quarter of 2024 was $1.3 million, or $0.37 per share, compared to net loss of $2.0 million, or $0.69 per share, for the third quarter of 2023.\n\n**_Research and Development (R &D) Expenses_**\n\nR&D expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were $984,000, compared to $1,317,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. This represents a decrease of $333,000 attributed to (1) a decrease in camsirubicin manufacturing costs of $301,000 due to the Company’s decision to wind down that program, and (2) a decrease of $218,000 in Validive clinical trial related expenses due to the closure of the trial in March 2023. These decreases were partially offset by a net increase of $186,000 due to other R&D expenses attributable to MNPR-101 for radiopharmaceutical use.\n\n**_General and Administrative (G &A) Expenses_**\n\nG&A expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were $591,000, compared to $749,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. This represents a decrease of $158,000 primarily attributed to (1) a reduction of stock based compensation expenses of $146,000 due to the full vesting of the 2020 grants in the fourth quarter of 2023, and (2) a decrease in stock-based compensation to the CEO and the board of directors of $64,000 as no equity awards have been issued to the CEO and the board of directors to date in 2024, partially offset by a net increase in consulting and other G&A expenses of $52,000.\n\n**About Monopar Therapeutics**\n\nMonopar Therapeutics Inc. is a clinical-stage biotechnology company with late-stage ALXN-1840 for Wilson disease, and radiopharma programs including Phase 1-stage MNPR-101-Zr for imaging advanced cancers, and Phase 1a-stage MNPR-101-Lu and late preclinical-stage MNPR-101-Ac225 for the treatment of advanced cancers.

As noted above, the Company completed a registered public offering on October 30, 2024 that yielded net proceeds to the Company of approximately $17.7 million, after deducting placement agent fees and other estimated offering expenses.\n\nMonopar projects that its current funds will be sufficient to continue operations at least into the first half of 2026, including to: (1) assemble a regulatory package and initiate discussions with the FDA on ALXN-1840 for Wilson disease; (2) continue to conduct and conclude its first-in-human imaging and dosimetry Phase 1 clinical trial with MNPR-101-Zr; (3) continue to conduct its first-in-human therapeutic radiopharma clinical trial with MNPR-101-Lu; (4) advance its preclinical MNPR-101-Ac program into the clinic, and (5) invest in internal R&D projects to expand its radiopharma pipeline.\n\nNet loss for the third quarter of 2024 was $1.3 million, or $0.37 per share, compared to net loss of $2.0 million, or $0.69 per share, for the third quarter of 2023.\n\n**_Research and Development (R &D) Expenses_**\n\nR&D expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were $984,000, compared to $1,317,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. This represents a decrease of $333,000 attributed to (1) a decrease in camsirubicin manufacturing costs of $301,000 due to the Company’s decision to wind down that program, and (2) a decrease of $218,000 in Validive clinical trial related expenses due to the closure of the trial in March 2023. These decreases were partially offset by a net increase of $186,000 due to other R&D expenses attributable to MNPR-101 for radiopharmaceutical use.\n\n**_General and Administrative (G &A) Expenses_**\n\nG&A expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were $591,000, compared to $749,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. This represents a decrease of $158,000 primarily attributed to (1) a reduction of stock based compensation expenses of $146,000 due to the full vesting of the 2020 grants in the fourth quarter of 2023, and (2) a decrease in stock-based compensation to the CEO and the board of directors of $64,000 as no equity awards have been issued to the CEO and the board of directors to date in 2024, partially offset by a net increase in consulting and other G&A expenses of $52,000.\n\n**About Monopar Therapeutics**\n\nMonopar Therapeutics Inc. is a clinical-stage biotechnology company with late-stage ALXN-1840 for Wilson disease, and radiopharma programs including Phase 1-stage MNPR-101-Zr for imaging advanced cancers, and Phase 1a-stage MNPR-101-Lu and late preclinical-stage MNPR-101-Ac225 for the treatment of advanced cancers.

All statements other than statements of historical facts included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are\nforward-looking statements. The words “hopes,” “believes,” “anticipates,” “plans,” “seeks,” “estimates,” “projects,” “expects,” “intends,” “may,” “could,” “should,”\n“would,” “will,” “continue,” and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. The following uncertainties and factors, among others, could affect\nfuture performance and cause actual results to differ materially from those matters expressed in or implied by forward-looking statements:\n● our ability to raise sufficient funds in order for us to support continued clinical, regulatory and commercial development of our programs and to make\ncontractual upfront and future milestone payments, as well as our ability to further raise additional funds in the future to support any existing or future\nproduct candidate programs through completion of clinical trials, the approval processes and, if applicable, commercialization;\n● our ability to raise funds on acceptable terms;\n● our ability to find a suitable pharmaceutical partner or partners to further our development efforts, under acceptable financial terms;\n● risks and uncertainties associated with our or any development partners' research and development activities, including preclinical studies, clinical trials,\nregulatory submissions, and manufacturing and quality expenses;\n● known and unknown risks associated with developing radiopharmaceutical therapeutics and imaging agents and copper-chelating therapies;\n● the uncertainty of timeframes for our clinical trials and regulatory reviews for approval to market products;\n● our ability to address the fulfillment and logistical challenges posed by the potential time-limited shelf-life of our current radiopharmaceutical programs\nor future drug candidates;\n● our ability to obtain an adequate supply at reasonable costs of radioisotopes that we are currently using or that we may incorporate into our drug\ncandidates;\n● uncertainties related to the regulatory discussions we intend to initiate related to ALXN-1840 and the outcome thereof;\n● the rate of market acceptance and competitiveness in terms of pricing, efficacy and safety, of any products for which we receive marketing approval, and\nour ability to competitively market any such products as compared to larger pharmaceutical firms;\n● the difficulties of commercialization, marketing and product manufacturing and overall strategy;\n● uncertainties of intellectual property position and strategy including new discoveries and patent filings;\n● our ability to attract and retain experienced and qualified key personnel and/or to find and utilize external sources of experience, expertise and scientific,\nmedical and commercialization knowledge to complete product development and commercialization of new products;\n● the risks inherent in our estimates regarding the level of needed expenses, capital requirements and the availability of required additional financing at\nacceptable terms;\n● the impact of the U.S. Presidential and Congressional election results affecting the economy and future government laws and regulations including\nincreased governmental control of healthcare and pharmaceuticals, resulting in direct price controls driving lower prices, other governmental regulations\naffecting cost requirements and structures for selling therapeutic or imaging products, and recent governmental legislation affecting other industries\nwhich may indirectly increase our costs of obtaining goods and services and our cost of capital;\n● the uncertain impact any resurgence of COVID-19 or another pandemic could have on our ability to advance our clinical programs and raise additional\nfinancing;\n● the cumulative impact of domestic and global inflation, volatility in financial markets and/or the potential for an economic recession increasing our costs\nof obtaining goods and services or making financing more difficult to obtain on acceptable terms or at all;\n● the uncertain impact of the Russia-Ukraine war, the Israel-Hamas war, or any potential future conflicts on our clinical material manufacturing expenses\nand timelines, as well as on general political, economic, trade and financial market conditions; and\n● uncertainty of our financial projections and operational timelines and the development of new competitive products and technologies.\n3\nTable of Contents\nAlthough we believe that the risk assessments identified in such forward-looking statements are appropriate, we can give no assurance that such risks will materialize.\nCautionary statements are disclosed in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including without limitation statements in the section entitled “Item 1A - Risk Factors,”\naddressing forward-looking statements. All subsequent written and oral forward-looking statements attributable to us or persons acting on our behalf are expressly qualified\nin their entirety by the cautionary statements. We undertake no obligation to update any statements made in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q or elsewhere, including\nwithout limitation any forward-looking statements, except as required by law.\nAny forward-looking statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q reflect our current views with respect to future events or to our future financial performance and\ninvolve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future\nresults, performance or achievements expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. Information that is based on estimates, forecasts, projections, market\nresearch or similar methodologies is inherently subject to uncertainties and actual events or circumstances may differ materially from events and circumstances projected in\nthis information.\n4\nTable of Contents\nSummary Risk Factors\nOur business is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including those highlighted in “Item 1A - Risk Factors” of our December 31, 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-\nK filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 28, 2024 and “Item 1A - Risk Factors” of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. These risks include, among\nothers, the following:\n● We are a clinical stage biotechnology company with a history of financial losses. We expect to continue to incur significant losses for the foreseeable future and\nmay never achieve or maintain cash self-sufficiency or profitability, which could result in a decline in the market value of our common stock.\n● Our ability to raise sufficient funds in order for us to support continued clinical, regulatory and commercial development of our programs and to make contractual\nupfront and future milestone payments, as well as our ability to further raise additional funds in the future to support any existing or future product candidate\nprograms through completion of clinical trials, the approval processes and, if applicable, commercialization;\n● Although a pivotal Phase 3 trial with ALXN-1840 has been completed, which met its primary endpoint as described elsewhere in this report, Alexion ended up\nterminating the ALXN-1840 program in Wilson disease based on review of results from Phase 2 mechanistic trials and discussions with regulatory authorities. In\nthe near term, we will be focusing on assembling a regulatory package and initiating discussions with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). There are\nuncertainties with respect to the outcome of these discussions and the additional capital needed for the program.\n● The regulatory approval process can be lengthy, expensive and uncertain. The FDA and other regulatory agencies around the world could require us to perform\nadditional nonclinical and/or clinical studies to obtain ALXN-1840 approval, which we may not be able to raise the capital to complete or the results of which\nmay not meet the level of clinical or statistical significance required by the FDA and other regulatory agencies.\n● We do not have and may never have any approved products on the market. Our business is highly dependent upon receiving marketing approvals from various\nU.S. and international governmental agencies and would be severely harmed if we are not granted approvals to manufacture and sell our product candidates.\n● Our clinical trials may not yield sufficiently conclusive results for regulatory agencies to approve the marketing and sale of our products, which would adversely\naffect our financial condition.\n● If we experience delays or difficulties in the enrollment of patients in clinical trials, our receipt of necessary regulatory approvals will be delayed or prevented,\nwhich could materially delay our program schedules and adversely affect our financial condition.\n● If we or our licensees, development collaborators, or suppliers are unable to manufacture our products in sufficient quantities or at defined quality specifications,\nor are unable to obtain regulatory approvals for the manufacturing facility, we may be unable to develop and/or meet demand for our products as well as lose time\nto market and potential revenues.\n● We rely on qualified third parties to conduct our active pharmaceutical ingredient manufacturing, our drug product manufacturing, non-clinical studies, and our\nclinical trials. If these third parties do not or cannot successfully carry out their contractual duties and meet expected deadlines or performance goals, the initiation\nor conduct of our clinical trials would be delayed and we may be unable to obtain regulatory approval for, or commercialize, our current product candidates or\nany future products, and our financial condition would be adversely affected.\n● Radiopharmaceutical technology is a relatively novel approach to cancer imaging and treatment, which may create significant and potentially unpredictable\nchallenges for it, including the availability of radioisotopes, potential misconception about the safety of radiopharmaceuticals, and low market uptake due to its\nnovelty. Perceptions of these challenges may make it more difficult to raise funding as we focus efforts on our radiopharmaceutical programs.\n5\nTable of Contents\n● The Russia-Ukraine war, and resulting sanctions against Russia and Russian entities, and Russian reduction in gas shipments to the EU and other allies, have\nincreased fuel costs, reduced access to critical supplies and may cause shipping delays. Separately, the Israel-Hamas war has created additional uncertainties. The\nbroader political, economic, trade and financial market consequences are uncertain at this time, which may increase the cost of supplies for our clinical\nmaterials, delay the manufacture of our clinical materials, restrict the availability of radioisotopes, increase costs of other goods and services or make it more\ndifficult or costly to raise additional financing, any of which could cause an adverse effect on our clinical and preclinical programs and on our financial condition.\n● Market variables, such as inflation of product costs, labor rates and fuel, freight and energy costs, as well as geopolitical events could likely cause us to suffer\nsignificant increases in our operating and administrative expenses.\n● Unstable market and economic conditions, such as volatility in the markets due to concerns about bank stability and economic challenges due to inflation, may\nhave serious adverse consequences on our ability to raise funds, which may cause us to delay, restructure or cease our operations.\n● The impact of the U.S. Presidential and Congressional election results affecting the economy and future government laws and regulations including potential\nincreased governmental control of healthcare and pharmaceuticals, resulting in direct price controls driving lower prices, other governmental regulations affecting\ncost requirements and structures for selling therapeutic or imaging products, and recent governmental legislation affecting other industries which may indirectly\nincrease our costs of obtaining goods and services and our cost of capital;\n● We face significant competition from other radiopharmaceutical, biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, and from research-based academic medical\ninstitutions, in our targeted medical indications, and our operating results would be adversely affected if we fail to compete effectively. Many competitors in our\nindustry have greater organizational capabilities, much higher available capital resources, and established marketing and sales resources and experience in the\ntargeted markets. Competition and technological change may make our product candidates obsolete or non-competitive.\n● The termination of third-party licenses would adversely affect our rights to important compounds or technologies which are essential to develop and market our\nproducts.\n● If we and our third-party licensors do not obtain and preserve protection for our respective intellectual property rights, our competitors may be able to develop\nand market competing drugs, which would adversely affect our financial condition.\n● If we lose key management leadership, and/or the expertise and experience of our scientific personnel, and if we cannot recruit qualified employees or other\nhighly qualified and experienced personnel for future requirements, we would be at risk to experience significant program delays and increased operational and\ncompensation costs, and our business would be materially disrupted.\n● Any future or long-term impacts of COVID-19 or any other pandemic remain uncertain, and their scope and impact could have a substantial negative bearing on\nour business, financial condition, operating results, stock price and ability to raise additional funds.\n6\nTable of Contents\nPART I\nFINANCIAL INFORMATION\nItem 1.

Contents\nMONOPAR THERAPEUTICS INC.\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nSeptember 30, 2024\nNote 1 – Nature of Business and Liquidity\nNature of Business\nMonopar Therapeutics Inc. (\"Monopar\" or the \"Company\") is a clinical-stage biotechnology company with late-stage ALXN-1840 for Wilson disease, and radiopharma\nprograms including Phase 1-stage MNPR-101-Zr for imaging advanced cancers, and Phase 1a-stage MNPR-101-Lu and late preclinical-stage MNPR-101-Ac225 for the\ntreatment of advanced cancers.\nLiquidity\nThe Company has incurred an accumulated deficit of approximately $64.9 million as of September 30, 2024. To date, the Company has primarily funded its operations with\nthe net proceeds from the Company’s initial public offering of its common stock on Nasdaq, sales of its common stock in the public market through at-the-market sales\nagreements, private placements of convertible preferred stock and of common stock and cash provided in the camsirubicin asset purchase transaction. In October 2024, the\nCompany raised approximately $18.7 million in total net proceeds from two financing events as disclosed under subsequent event section of this Form 10-Q. Management\nestimates that currently available cash will provide sufficient funds to enable the Company to meet its obligations at least into the first half of 2026. The Company’s ability\nto fund its future operations, including the development of ALXN-1840, an investigational drug candidate for Wilson disease, and the continued clinical development\nof its radiopharmaceutical programs, is dependent upon its ability to execute its business strategy, to obtain additional funding and/or to execute collaborative research\nagreements. There can be no certainty that future financing or collaborative research agreements will occur in the amounts required or at a time needed to maintain\noperations, if at all.\nGoing Concern Assessment\nThe Company applies Accounting Standards Codification 205-40 (“ASC 205-40”), Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity’s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern,\nwhich the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued to provide guidance on determining when and how reporting companies must disclose going concern\nuncertainties in their financial statements. ASC 205-40 requires management to perform interim and annual assessments of an entity’s ability to continue as a going concern\nwithin one year of the date of issuance of the entity’s financial statements (or within one year after the date on which the financial statements are available to be issued,\nwhen applicable). Further, a company must provide certain disclosures if there is “substantial doubt about the entity’s ability to continue as a going concern.” In October\n2024, the Company analyzed its cash requirements at least through December 31, 2025 and has determined that, based upon the Company’s current available cash, the\nCompany has no substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern.\nRisks and Uncertainties\nRisks Related to the Company's Financial Condition and Capital Requirements\nMany, if not most, biotechnology companies never become profitable and are acquired, merge, sell major product assets or go out of business before successfully\ndeveloping any product that generates revenue from commercial sales that enables profitability. The Company has incurred losses since inception, and expects to continue to\nincur substantial operating losses over the next several years. These losses stem from the clinical development of the Company's current and future licensed and/or\npurchased product candidates and will continue for the foreseeable future. As a result, the Company anticipates that it will seek to raise additional capital within the next 12\nmonths to fund our future operations. The Company's ability to raise sufficient funds in order to support continued clinical, regulatory and commercial development and to\nmake contractual future milestone payments, as well as to further raise additional funds in the future to support any existing or future product candidate programs through\ncompletion of clinical trials, the approval processes and, if applicable, commercialization are uncertain.\nThe amount of future losses and when, if ever, the Company would become profitable is uncertain. The Company's ability to generate revenue and achieve profitability will\ndepend on, among other things, successful completion of the development of its product candidates; obtaining necessary regulatory approvals from the FDA and\ninternational regulatory agencies; establishing manufacturing/quality, sales, and marketing and distribution arrangements with third parties; obtaining adequate\nreimbursement by third-party payers; and raising sufficient funds to finance its activities. If the Company is unsuccessful at some or all of these undertakings, its business,\nfinancial condition, and results of operations are expected to be materially and adversely affected.\n12\nTable of Contents\nMONOPAR THERAPEUTICS INC.\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nSeptember 30, 2024\nNote 2 – Significant Accounting Policies\nBasis of Presentation\nThese condensed consolidated financial statements include the financial results of Monopar Therapeutics Inc., its wholly-owned French subsidiary, Monopar Therapeutics,\nSARL, and its wholly-owned Australian subsidiary, Monopar Therapeutics Australia Pty Ltd, and have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally\naccepted in the U.S. (“GAAP”) and include all disclosures required by GAAP for financial reporting. All intercompany accounts have been eliminated. The principal\naccounting policies applied in the preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements are set out below and have been consistently applied in all periods\npresented. The Company has been primarily involved in performing research activities, developing product candidates, and raising capital to support and expand these\nactivities.\nThe accompanying interim unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements contain all normal, recurring adjustments necessary to present fairly the Company’s\ncondensed consolidated financial position as of September 30, 2024, and the Company’s condensed consolidated results of operations and comprehensive loss for the three\nand nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, and the Company’s condensed consolidated cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.\nThe interim condensed consolidated results of operations and comprehensive loss and condensed consolidated cash flows for the periods presented are not necessarily\nindicative of the condensed consolidated results of operations or cash flows which may be reported for the remainder of 2024 or for any future period. Certain information\nand footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP have been condensed or omitted. The accompanying unaudited\ninterim condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and notes thereto for the year ended December 31,\n2023, included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on March 28, 2024.\nFunctional Currency\nThe Company’s consolidated functional currency is the U.S. Dollar. The Company’s Australian subsidiary and French subsidiary use the Australian Dollar and European\nEuro, respectively, as their functional currency. At each quarter-end, each foreign subsidiary’s balance sheets are translated into U.S. Dollars based upon the quarter-end\nexchange rate, while their statements of operations and comprehensive loss and statements of cash flows are translated into U.S. Dollars based upon an average exchange\nrate during the period.\nComprehensive Loss\nComprehensive loss represents net loss plus any income or losses not reported in the condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss, such as\nforeign currency translations gains and losses and unrealized gains and losses on debt security investments that are reflected on the Company’s condensed consolidated\nstatements of stockholders’ equity.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and\nliabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and reported amounts of expenses in the condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.\nActual results could differ from those estimates.\nCash Equivalents\nThe Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with a maturity of three months or less on the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. Cash equivalents as\nof September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, consisted of two money market accounts and U.S. Treasury Bills.\nInvestments\nThe Company considers all of its investments in debt securities (U.S. Government or Agencies), with maturities at the date of purchase from over three months to one year\nto be available-for-sale securities. These investments are recorded at fair value with the unrealized gains and losses reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income\n(loss) on the Company’s condensed consolidated balance sheets. Realized gains and losses from the sale of investments, if any are determined, are recorded net in the\ncondensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. The investments selected by the Company have a low level of inherent credit risk given they are\nissued by the U.S. government and any changes in their fair value are primarily attributable to changes in interest rates and market liquidity. Investments as of\nSeptember 30, 2024 consisted of U.S. Treasury Bills with maturities of less than three months.\n13\nTable of Contents\nMONOPAR THERAPEUTICS INC.\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nSeptember 30, 2024\nPrepaid Expenses\nPrepayments are expenditures for goods or services before the goods are used or the services are received and are charged to operations as the benefits are realized. Prepaid\nexpenses may include payments to development collaborators in excess of actual expenses incurred by the collaborator measured at the end of each reporting period.\nPrepayments also include insurance premiums, dues and subscriptions and software costs of $10,000 or more per year that are expensed monthly over the life of the\ncontract, which is typically one year. Prepaid expenses are reflected on the Company’s condensed consolidated balance sheets as other current assets.\nLeases\nLease agreements are evaluated to determine whether an arrangement is or contains a lease in accordance with ASC 842, Leases. Right-of-use lease assets and lease\nliabilities are recognized based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term at the commencement date. The right-of-use lease asset on\nthe Company’s condensed consolidated balance sheets includes any lease payments made and excludes lease incentives. The incremental borrowing taking into\nconsideration the Company’s credit quality and borrowing rate for similar assets is used in determining the present value of future payments. Lease expense is recorded as\ngeneral and administrative expenses on the Company’s condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.\nConcentration of Credit Risk\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentration of credit risk consist of cash and cash equivalents. The Company maintains cash and cash\nequivalents at two reputable financial institutions. As of September 30, 2024, the balance at one financial institution was in excess of the $250,000 Federal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation (“FDIC”) insurable limit. The Company has not experienced any losses on its deposits since inception and management believes the Company is not\nexposed to significant risks with respect to these financial institutions.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nFor financial instruments consisting of cash and cash equivalents, investments, accounts payable, accrued expenses, and other current liabilities, the carrying amounts are\nreasonable estimates of fair value due to their relatively short maturities.\nThe Company adopted ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, as amended, which addresses the measurement of the fair value of financial assets and\nfinancial liabilities. Under this standard, fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (i.e., the “exit price”) in an\norderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.\nThe standard establishes a hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by\nrequiring that the most observable inputs be used when available. Observable inputs reflect assumptions market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability based\non market data obtained from independent sources. Unobservable inputs reflect a reporting entity’s pricing an asset or liability developed based on the best information\navailable under the circumstances. The fair value hierarchy consists of the following three levels:\nLevel 1 - instrument valuations are obtained from real-time quotes for transactions in active exchange markets involving identical assets.\nLevel 2 - instrument valuations are obtained from readily available pricing sources for comparable instruments.\nLevel 3 - instrument valuations are obtained without observable market values and require a high-level of judgment to determine the fair value.\n14\nTable of Contents\nMONOPAR THERAPEUTICS INC.\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nSeptember 30, 2024\nDetermining which category an asset or liability falls within the hierarchy requires significant judgment. The Company evaluates its hierarchy disclosures each reporting\nperiod. There were no transfers between Level 1, 2 or 3 of the fair value hierarchy during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. The following\ntable presents the assets that are reported at fair value on the Company's condensed consolidated balance sheets on a recurring basis. No values were recorded in Level 2 or\nLevel 3 as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The Company has no liabilities reported at fair value on a recurring basis\nAssets Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis\nSeptember 30, 2024 Level 1 Total\nAssets:\nCash equivalents(1) $ 5,795,869 $ 5,795,869\nTotal $ 5,795,869 $ 5,795,869\nDecember 31 2023 Level 1 Total\nAssets:\nCash equivalents(1) $ 6,544,910 $ 6,544,910\nTotal $ 6,544,910 $ 6,544,910\n(1) Cash equivalents as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, represent the fair value of the Company’s investment in two money market accounts and U.S.\nTreasury Bills with maturities at the date of purchase of three months or less.\n15\nTable of Contents\nMONOPAR THERAPEUTICS INC.\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nSeptember 30, 2024\nNet Loss per Share\nNet loss per share for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, is calculated by dividing net loss by the weighted-average shares of common stock\noutstanding during the periods. Diluted net loss per share for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, is calculated by dividing net loss by the\nweighted-average shares of the sum of a) weighted average common stock outstanding (3,520,398 and 2,823,680 shares for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and\n2023 respectively, 3,419,321 and 2,710,356 shares for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 respectively) and b) potentially dilutive shares of\ncommon stock (such as stock options and restricted stock units) outstanding during the period determined using the treasury stock method. As of September 30, 2024 and\n2023, potentially dilutive securities included stock-based awards to purchase up to 476,758 and 516,166 shares of the Company’s common stock, respectively. For the three\nand nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, potentially dilutive securities are excluded from the computation of fully diluted net loss per share as their effect is\nanti-dilutive.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nResearch and development (“R&D”) costs are expensed as incurred. Major components of R&D expenses include salaries and benefits paid to the Company’s R&D staff,\ncompensation expenses of G&A personnel performing R&D, fees paid to consultants and to the entities that conduct certain R&D activities on the Company’s behalf and\ncosts of materials and supplies which were used in R&D activities during the reporting period.\nClinical Trials Accruals\nThe Company accrues and expenses the costs for clinical trial activities performed by third parties based upon estimates of the percentage of work completed over the life of\nthe individual study in accordance with agreements established with contract research organizations, service providers, and clinical trial sites. The Company estimates the\namounts to accrue based upon discussions with internal clinical personnel and external service providers as to progress or stage of completion of trials or services and the\nagreed upon fees to be paid for such services. Costs of setting up clinical trial sites for participation in the trials are expensed immediately as R&D expenses. Clinical trial\nsite costs related to patient screening and enrollment are accrued as patients are screened/entered into the trial.\nCollaborative Agreements\nThe Company and its collaborative partners are active participants in collaborative agreements and all parties would be exposed to significant risks and rewards depending\non the technical and commercial success of the activities. Contractual payments to the other parties in collaboration agreements and costs incurred by the Company when\nthe Company is deemed to be the principal participant for a given transaction are recognized on a gross basis in R&D expenses. Royalties and license payments are recorded\nas earned.\nDuring the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, no milestones were met, and no royalties were earned; therefore, the Company did not pay or\naccrue/expense any license or royalty payments.\nLicensing Agreements\nThe Company has various agreements licensing technology utilized in the development of its product or technology programs. The licenses contain success milestone\nobligations and royalties on future sales. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, no milestones were met, and no royalties were\nearned; therefore, the Company did not pay or accrue/expense any license or royalty payments under any of its license agreements.\nSee Note 8 for additional discussion regarding the Company’s Licensing Agreements.\nPatent Costs\nThe Company expenses costs relating to issued patents and patent applications, including costs relating to legal, renewal and application fees, as a component of general and\nadministrative expenses in its condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.\n16\nTable of Contents\nMONOPAR THERAPEUTICS INC.\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nSeptember 30, 2024\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company uses an asset and liability approach for accounting for deferred income taxes, which requires recognition of deferred income tax assets and liabilities for the\nexpected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in its financial statements but have not been reflected in its taxable income. Estimates and judgments\nare required in the calculation of certain tax liabilities and in the determination of the recoverability of certain deferred income tax assets, which arise from temporary\ndifferences and carryforwards. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the\nyears in which those tax assets and liabilities are expected to be realized or settled.\nThe Company regularly assesses the likelihood that its deferred income tax assets will be realized from recoverable income taxes or recovered from future taxable income.\nTo the extent that the Company believes any amounts are not “more likely than not” to be realized, the Company records a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred\nincome tax assets. In the event the Company determines that all or part of the net deferred tax assets are not realizable in the future, an adjustment to the valuation allowance\nwould be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made. Similarly, if the Company subsequently determines deferred income tax assets that were previously\ndetermined to be unrealizable are now realizable, the respective valuation allowance would be reversed, resulting in an adjustment to earnings in the period such\ndetermination is made.\nInternal Revenue Code Sections 382 and 383 (“Sections 382 and 383”) limit the use of net operating loss (“NOL”) carryforwards and R&D credits, after an ownership\nchange. To date, the Company has not conducted a Section 382 or 383 study, however, because the Company will continue to raise significant amounts of equity in the\ncoming years, the Company expects that Sections 382 and 383 will limit the Company’s usage of NOLs and R&D credits in the future.\nASC 740, Income Taxes, requires that the tax benefit of net operating losses, temporary differences, and credit carryforwards be recorded as an asset to the extent that\nmanagement assesses that realization is “more likely than not.” Realization of the future tax benefits is dependent on the Company’s ability to generate sufficient taxable\nincome within the carryforward period. The Company has reviewed the positive and negative evidence relating to the realizability of the deferred tax assets and has\nconcluded that the deferred tax assets are not “more likely than not” to be realized. As a result, the Company recorded a full valuation allowance as of September 30, 2024\nand December 31, 2023. U.S. Federal R&D tax credits from 2016 to 2019 were utilized to reduce payroll taxes in future periods and were recorded as other current assets\n(anticipated to be received within 12 months), on the Company’s condensed consolidated balance sheets. The Company intends to maintain the valuation allowance until\nsufficient evidence exists to support its reversal. The Company regularly reviews its tax positions. For a tax benefit to be recognized, the related tax position must be “more\nlikely than not” to be sustained upon examination. Any amount recognized is generally the largest benefit that is “more likely than not” to be realized upon settlement. The\nCompany’s policy is to recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters as an income tax expense. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024\nand 2023, the Company did not have any interest or penalties associated with unrecognized tax benefits.\nThe Company is subject to U.S. Federal, Illinois and California state income taxes. In addition, the Company is subject to local tax laws of France and Australia. Tax\nregulations within each jurisdiction are subject to the interpretation of the related tax laws and regulations and require significant judgment to apply. Monopar was originally\nformed as an LLC in December 2014, then incorporated on December 16, 2015. The Company is subject to U.S. Federal, state and local tax examinations by tax authorities\nfor the tax years 2015 through 2023. The Company does not anticipate significant changes to its current uncertain tax positions through September 30, 2024.\nStock-Based Compensation\nThe Company accounts for stock-based compensation arrangements with employees, non-employee directors and consultants using a fair value method, which requires the\nrecognition of compensation expense for costs related to all stock-based awards, including stock option and restricted stock unit (“RSU”) grants. The fair value method\nrequires the Company to estimate the fair value of stock-based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model or the closing stock price on the date of\ngrant in the case of RSUs.\n17\nTable of Contents\nMONOPAR THERAPEUTICS INC.\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nSeptember 30, 2024\nStock-based compensation expense for awards granted to employees, non-employee directors and consultants are based on the fair value of the underlying instrument\ncalculated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model on the date of grant for stock options and using the closing stock price on the date of grant for RSUs and\nrecognized as expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is the vesting period. Determining the appropriate fair value model and related\nassumptions requires judgment, including estimating the future stock price volatility and expected terms. For stock options granted in 2023, the expected volatility rates are\nestimated based on the Company’s historical actual volatility over the three-year period from its initial public offering on December 18, 2019 through December 31,\n2022. For awards granted during the three months ended September 30, 2024, the expected volatility rates were estimated based on the Company’s historical actual\nvolatility over the four-year period from its initial public offering on December 18, 2019, through December 31, 2023. The expected term for options granted to date is\nestimated using the simplified method. Forfeitures only include known forfeitures to-date as the Company accounts for forfeitures as they occur due to a limited history of\nforfeitures. The Company has not paid dividends and does not anticipate paying a cash dividend in the future vesting period and, accordingly, uses an expected dividend\nyield of zero. The risk-free interest rate is based on the rate of U.S. Treasury securities with maturities consistent with the estimated expected term of the awards.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn October 2023, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (\"ASU\") 2023-06, Disclosure Improvements, Codification Amendments in Response to the SEC’s\nDisclosure Update and Simplification Initiative. The ASU incorporates certain U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) disclosure requirements and are expected\nto clarify or improve disclosure and presentation requirements of a variety of Codification Topics, allow users to more easily compare entities subject to the SEC's existing\ndisclosures with those entities that were not previously subject to the requirements, and align the requirements in the Codification with the SEC's regulations.

For all other entities, the amendments will be effective two years later. In accordance with ASU 2023-06, the Company has added Note 7 – Net Loss\nper Share.\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures. The ASU is intended to\nimprove reportable segment disclosure requirements, primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. The purpose of the amendment is to\nenable investors to better understand an entity’s overall performance and assess potential future cash flows. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after\nDecember 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the\neffect the amendments in ASU 2023-07 will have on its segment disclosures.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures. The ASU improves income tax disclosure\nrequirements and will require more detailed information on several income tax disclosures, such as income taxes paid and the income tax rate reconciliation table. The\nstandard is effective for public business entities with annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024, and early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently\nevaluating the impact of this new standard on its condensed consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. The Company does not expect a material impact to its\ncondensed consolidated financial statements based on adoption of this ASU.\nNote 3 - Investments\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company had two money market accounts and available-for-sale investments with contractual maturities of three months or less categorized\nas cash and cash equivalents as follows:\nAggregate Fair\nAs of September 30, 2024 Cost Basis Unrealized Gains Value\nU.S. Treasury Bills $ 1,891,680 $ 6,454 $ 1,898,134\nMoney Market Accounts 3,897,735 — 3,897,735\nTotal $ 5,789,415 $ 6,454 $ 5,795,869\nAs of September 30, 2024, there were no available-for-sale securities in an unrealized-loss position.

To date no\ndividends have been declared. Upon dissolution and liquidation of the Company, holders of the common stock are entitled to a ratable share of the net assets of the\nCompany remaining after payments to creditors of the Company. The holders of shares of common stock are entitled to one vote per share for the election of each director\nnominated to the Board and one vote per share on all other matters submitted to a vote of stockholders.\nThe Company’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes the Company to issue 40,000,000 shares of common stock with a par value of $0.001 per share.\nReverse Stock Split\nOn August 5, 2024, the Company conducted its Annual Meeting of Stockholders in which the stockholders approved among other items, a proposal to amend the\nCompany's Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation to effect a reverse stock split of the outstanding shares, which provided the Board of Directors with\nauthority to effect a reverse split within a specified range of ratios. Subsequently, the Board of Directors approved a reverse stock split of 1 for 5 shares of the Company's\ncommon stock in an attempt to regain compliance with the Nasdaq's continued listing requirements, which the reverse stock split did end up successfully\naccomplishing. The reverse stock split became effective at 5:00 pm on Monday August 12, 2024, and the Company's common stock commenced trading on a split-adjusted\nbasis at the open of trading on Tuesday, August 13, 2024.\nFurthermore, at the Annual Meeting of Stockholders, a proposal to amend the 2016 Stock Incentive Plan was approved. As a result, the total number of shares reserved for\nissuance under the Amended 2016 Plan would increase from 5,100,000 to 7,100,000 (pre-split). As a result of the above mentioned stock split, the total number of shares\nreserved for issuance was adjusted to 1,420,000.\nThe reverse stock split reduced the number of shares of the Company's common stock outstanding on August 12, 2024 from 17,601,827 to 3,520,427. Proportional\nadjustments were made to the Company's outstanding stock options, and restricted stock units. No fractional shares were issued in connection with the reverse stock split.\nStockholders who would otherwise have held a fractional share of common stock were rounded up and issued one whole share.\nThe par value of the Company's common stock was unchanged at $0.001 per share. The number of authorized shares of common stock was also unchanged at 40,000,000\nshares.\nThe reverse stock split did not modify the rights or preferences of the underlying common stock. The Company's stockholders' equity reflects the par value for all shares of\ncommon stock at $0.001 per share, with a corresponding increase in additional paid-in capital. All per-share amounts and numbers of shares in the accompanying financial\nstatements and related notes have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the reverse stock split.\n19\nTable of Contents\nMONOPAR THERAPEUTICS INC.\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nSeptember 30, 2024\nSales of Common Stock\nOn April 20, 2022, the Company entered into a Capital on Demand™ Sales Agreement with JonesTrading Institutional Services LLC (“JonesTrading”), pursuant to which\nMonopar may offer and sell, from time to time, through or to JonesTrading, as sales agent or principal, shares of Monopar’s common stock.

(“Alexion, AstraZeneca Rare Disease” or\n“Alexion”), pursuant to which Alexion, AstraZeneca Rare Disease granted the Company an exclusive worldwide license for the development and commercialization of\nALXN-1840, a drug candidate for Wilson disease that has progressed through a Phase 3 clinical trial that met its primary endpoint.\nAs initial upfront consideration for the License Agreement, the Company issued Alexion 387,329 shares of common stock (representing a 9.9% beneficial ownership\ninterest in the Company upon issuance) and the Company has agreed to make an upfront cash payment of $4.0 million, which shall be payable in two installments, including\na $1.0 million cash payment at the time of signing and a $3.0 million cash payment within ninety (90) days. The Company made the initial $1 million payment on October\n24, 2024.\nAdditionally, pursuant to the license agreement, Alexion is eligible to receive milestones and royalties, as further described below.\nThe shares issued to Alexion were issued pursuant to a separate Common Stock Investment Agreement, also dated October 23, 2024, between the Company and Alexion\n(the “Equity Agreement”). Pursuant to the Equity Agreement, the Company agreed to anti-dilution provisions that entitle Alexion to additional shares of common stock so\nthat the total number of shares issued thereunder continue to represent 9.9% of outstanding shares after any subsequent issuances of common stock through the next $25.0\nmillion of common equity capital raised by the Company, subject to a maximum of 705,015 Shares (inclusive of the shares initially issued) unless the Company obtains\nstockholder approval. As of October 31, 2024, the Company has issued Alexion an additional 135,172 shares under these anti-dilution provisions (bringing the total number\nof shares issued to Alexion to 522,501) as a result of the financing transactions discussed below. The Equity Agreement also entitles Alexion to customary registration rights\nand the Company agreed to file a resale registration statement within forty-five (45) days of October 23, 2024.\nAs additional consideration, the Company will be obligated to pay Alexion aggregate milestone payments of up to $94.0 million, including regulatory approval and sales\nrelated milestone payments. Alexion is also entitled to receive tiered royalties based on net sales in the low to mid-double digit range. Alexion has a right of first negotiation\nregarding any rights that the Company intends to sublicense, and will receive a percentage in the mid-double digits of sublicensing income received by Company until the\nLicensed Product achieves sales. The Company also assumed a third party agreement from Alexion under which the Company will owe a third-party a single digit millions\ncash milestone payment upon regulatory approval in Europe and a single digit percentage royalty on net sales in Europe.\nSubsequent to September 30, 2024, the Company sold 48,700 shares of its common stock at an average gross price per share of $21.22 for net proceeds of $1,007,934, after\nfees, commissions and expenses of $25,874 through an-at-the market offering,\nOn October 28, 2024, the Company entered into and executed a placement agent agreement with Rodman & Renshaw LLC in connection with registered public offering\nof 1,181,540 shares of the Company’s common stock, par value $0.001 per share, at an offering price of $16.25 per Share. In connection with this offering, the Company\nentered into a securities purchase agreement with certain of the purchasers in the offering. The offering closed on October 30, 2024 and yielded net proceeds to the\nCompany of approximately $17.7 million, after deducting placement agent fees and other estimated offering expenses.\n23\nTable of Contents\nItem 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our condensed consolidated financial\nstatements and related notes contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis are set forth elsewhere in\nthis Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business and related financing activities, includes forward-looking\nstatements that involve risks and uncertainties.\nOverview\nWe are a clinical-stage biotechnology company with late-stage ALXN-1840 for Wilson disease, and radiopharma programs including Phase 1-stage MNPR-101-Zr\nfor imaging advanced cancers, and Phase 1a-stage MNPR-101-Lu and late preclinical-stage MNPR-101-Ac225 for the treatment of advanced cancers.\nFinancial Status\nOur cash, cash equivalents and investments as of September 30, 2024, were $6 million. Our primary funding source over the past three years was sales of shares of\nour common stock under at-the-market sales programs through Capital on Demand™ Sales Agreements with JonesTrading Institutional Services LLC (“Jones Trading”). As\nof October 31, 2024 we sold 557,761 shares of our common stock this year at an average gross price per share of $7.73 for net proceeds of $4,202,244 after fees and\ncommissions of $107,806. On October 28, 2024, we entered into and executed a placement agent agreement with Rodman & Renshaw LLC in connection with a registered\npublic offering of 1,181,540 shares of our common stock, par value $0.001 per share, at an offering price of $16.25 per Share. The offering closed on October 30, 2024 and\nyielded net proceeds from the offering of approximately $17.7 million, after deducting placement agent fees and other estimated offering expenses.\nAs discussed further below and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report, we expect that our current funds will be sufficient at least into the first half of 2026 for us to:\n(1) assemble a regulatory package and initiate discussions with the FDA for the in-licensed ALXN-1840 investigational drug candidate for Wilson disease; (2) continue to\nconduct and conclude our first-in-human imaging and dosimetry clinical trial with MNPR-101-Zr; (3) continue to conduct our first-in-human therapeutic clinical trial\nof MNPR-101-Lu; (4) advance our preclinical MNPR-101-Ac program into the clinic; and (5) invest in internal R&D projects to expand our radiopharma pipeline. We will\nrequire additional funding to further advance our clinical and preclinical programs and we anticipate that we will seek to raise additional capital within the next 12 months\nto fund our future operations.\nOur Product Pipeline\nALXN-1840 for Wilson disease\nWilson disease is a rare and progressive genetic condition in which the body’s pathway for removing excess copper is compromised. It affects one in 30,000 live\nbirths in the US. Over time this results in the build-up of toxic copper levels in the liver, brain, and other organs, leading to damage that greatly impacts a patient’s life.\nPatients can develop a wide range of symptoms, including liver disease and/or psychiatric or neurological symptoms, such as personality changes, tremors and difficulty\nwalking, swallowing or talking. In some cases, the damage and loss of function may be irreversible.\nALXN-1840 (bis-choline tetrathiomolybdate) is an investigational once-daily, oral medicine in development for the treatment of Wilson disease. This novel\nmolecule is designed to selectively and tightly bind and remove copper from the body’s tissues and blood. ALXN-1840 has been granted Orphan Drug Designation in the\nUnited States and orphan designation in the European Union for Wilson disease.\nA pivotal Phase 3 trial with ALXN-1840 has been completed, which met its primary endpoint. The primary endpoint assessed copper mobilization over 48 weeks,\ndefined as daily mean AUEC (Area Under the Effect Curve) for dNCC (directly measured non-ceruloplasmin-bound copper). In the trial, 214 patients were enrolled, and the\ntrial was randomized, rater-blinded, and multi-centered, designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ALXN-1840 versus standard-of-care (SoC) in patients with Wilson\ndisease aged 12 years and older. In the trial, people taking ALXN-1840 experienced rapid copper mobilization, with a response at four weeks and sustained through the 48\nweeks. The primary endpoint demonstrated three-times greater copper mobilization from tissues compared to the SoC arm (Least Square Mean Difference [LSM Diff] 2.18\nµmol/L; p< 0.0001), including in patients who had been treated previously for an average of 10 years.\n24\nTable of Contents\nAlexion ended up terminating the ALXN-1840 program in Wilson disease based on review of results from Phase 2 mechanistic trials and discussions with\nregulatory authorities. The Phase 2 mechanism of action studies failed to meet their primary objectives of demonstrating net-negative copper balance in Wilson disease\npatients during short-term treatment with ALXN-1840 and reducing hepatic copper concentration after treatment with ALXN-1840. The decision not to progress the ALXN-\n1840 program in Wilson disease was not related to any safety signals.\nIn the near term, we will be focusing on assembling a regulatory package and initiating discussions with the FDA. These activities will provide clarity on the\nadditional capital needed for the program. As a result, the costs beyond the $4.0 million due at signing and within ninety (90) days pursuant to the license agreement, will\nlargely be consultant time along with patent maintenance. These near-term expenses are estimated to be less than $1.0 million to assemble the detailed regulatory package\nand maintain the patent portfolio.\nThe regulatory approval process can be lengthy, expensive and uncertain. The FDA and other regulatory agencies around the world could require us to perform\nadditional nonclinical and/or clinical studies to obtain ALXN-1840 approval, which we may not be able to raise the capital to complete or the results of which may not meet\nthe level of clinical or statistical significance required by the FDA and other regulatory agencies. What the FDA and other regulatory agencies require for approval could\nhave a material impact on the timelines and/or capital required to get ALXN-1840 approved. Even if approved, market adoption could be slower or lower than expected,\nespecially given competition from existing therapies or new ones that get approved. We are planning to initially focus on Wilson disease patients with more severe\nsymptoms, and this population could end up being smaller than we are anticipating. This population could be further reduced in size if the FDA or other regulatory agencies\ngive us a more narrow label than anticipated. Being an orphan indication, this could result in a very small eligible patient population. Additionally, if the currently filed\npatents do not end up providing sufficient protection, we will be heavily reliant on the orphan drug designation protections in the US and EU.\nMNPR-101 for Radiopharmaceutical Use, Development Update\nThe radiopharma space has had numerous positive recent developments and announcements, from acquisitions to clinical data to reimbursement rates to\ncommercial demand. Since this past December alone, four significant acquisitions have been publicly announced or completed which have had upfront payments ranging\nfrom approximately $1 billion to over $4 billion (BMS/RayzeBio, AstraZeneca/Fusion Pharma, Eli Lilly/POINT BioPharma, and Novartis/Mariana Oncology).\nMonopar has a proprietary first-in-class humanized monoclonal antibody, MNPR-101, that targets the urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (\"uPAR\"). uPAR is\nexpressed on several of the more aggressive, deadly cancers including pancreatic, breast, ovarian, colorectal, and bladder cancers. Monopar has conjugated MNPR-101 to\nimaging and therapeutic radioisotopes for the purpose of creating highly precise radiopharmaceutical agents that have the potential to image and treat tumors expressing\nuPAR while reducing exposure to healthy tissues. In February 2024, we received regulatory clearance in Australia to commence a first-in-human Phase 1 imaging and\ndosimetry clinical trial with our novel radiopharmaceutical imaging agent MNPR-101-Zr (MNPR-101 conjugated to zirconium-89) in patients with advanced cancers, and\nin April, we launched the Phase 1 trial. In July 2024, we announced the enrollment of our first patient and in September 2024, we announced positive early clinical data\nvalidating the tumor-targeting ability of MNPR-101-Zr. In August 2024, we received regulatory clearance in Australia to commence a first-in-human Phase 1a clinical trial\nof our novel uPAR-targeted radiopharmaceutical therapy MNPR-101-Lu (MNPR-101 conjugated to lutetium-177) in patients with advanced solid cancers. We launched the\ntrial in October 2024, and it is now active and open for patient enrollment.\nIn October, we presented clinical data at the European Association of Nuclear Medicine Annual Congress 2024 showing significant uptake of MNPR-101-Zr in a\npatient with advanced ovarian cancer together with preclinical and clinical data showing favorable biodistribution, tumor uptake, and low off-target binding of our uPAR-\ntargeted radiopharmaceuticals MNPR-101-Zr, MNPR-101-Lu, and MNPR-101-Ac (MNPR-101 conjugated to actinium-225).\nWe are also actively exploring opportunities to expand our radiopharmaceutical pipeline primarily through internal development efforts. In October 2024, we\nannounced the filing of a provisional patent application for new radiopharmaceutical compounds and a family of linkers used to connect radioisotopes with targeting agents,\nincluding our uPAR-targeting antibody MNPR-101.\nOur Strategy\nOur management team has extensive experience in developing therapeutics and medical technologies through global regulatory approval and commercialization. In\naggregate, companies they co-founded have achieved four drug approvals and three diagnostic medical imaging device approvals in the U.S. and the EU, successfully sold\nan asset developed by management which subsequently had a positive Phase 3 clinical trial, sold two oncology-focused diagnostic imaging businesses to Fortune Global\n1000 firms, and completed the clinical and commercial development and ultimately the sale of a commercial biopharmaceutical company for over $800 million in cash. In\naddition, the team has supported multiple regulatory submissions with the FDA and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and launched multiple drugs in the U.S and the\nEU. Understanding the preclinical, clinical, regulatory and commercial development processes and hurdles are key factors in successful drug development and the expertise\ndemonstrated by our management team across all of these areas increases the probability of success in advancing the product candidates in our product pipeline.\nOur strategic goal is to acquire, develop, and commercialize innovative treatments for patients with unmet medical needs. Key elements of our strategy to achieve\nthis goal are to:\n25\nTable of Contents\nAssemble a regulatory package for ALXN-1840 and initiate discussions with the FDA. We are planning to assemble a regulatory package to support a New\n●\nDrug Application (NDA) approval for ALXN-1840 in Wilson disease patients with more severe symptoms.\n● Expand the development of MNPR-101 for radiopharmaceutical use as a therapeutic as well as a diagnostic imaging agent. Based on promising preclinical\ndata from our imaging and efficacy animal model studies in multiple cancers including triple-negative breast and pancreatic cancers and human clinical data from\nour MNPR-101-Zr Phase 1 trial validating the tumor-targeting ability of MNPR-101, we have prioritized significant resources and funds toward the development\nof our radiopharmaceutical programs. We have two open and active human clinical trials for our MNPR-101 radiopharmaceutical program; a Phase 1 imaging and\ndosimetry clinical trial of MNPR-101-Zr in patients with advanced cancers and a Phase 1a therapeutic clinical trial of MNPR-101-Lu also in patients with\nadvanced cancers. In addition, we are continuing our preclinical development of MNPR-101-Ac, using the alpha-emitter actinium-225 conjugated to MNPR-101.\n● Expand our drug development pipeline through internal efforts, in-licensing and acquisition of product candidates. We plan to continue the expansion of\nour drug development pipeline through internal research and development, acquiring or in-licensing additional product candidates, particularly those that leverage\nexisting scientific and clinical data that helps reduce the risks of the next steps in clinical development. The focus on this front will include identifying both novel\nand established targets and candidates complementing our radiopharmaceutical and rare disease programs.\n● Utilize the expertise and prior experience of our team in the areas of asset acquisition, drug development and commercialization to establish ourselves as\na leading biotechnology company. Our senior executive team has relevant experience in biopharmaceutical in-licensing and acquisitions as well as developing\nproduct candidates through approval and commercialization. In aggregate, our team has co-founded BioMarin Pharmaceutical (Nasdaq: BMRN), Sensant Corp\n(acquired by Siemens), American BioOptics (assets acquired by Olympus), Raptor Pharmaceuticals ($800 million sale to Horizon Therapeutics), and Tactic\nPharma, LLC (“Tactic Pharma”) (sale of lead asset, bis-choline tetrathiomolybdate, was ultimately acquired by Alexion in June 2018 for $764 million; Alexion\nwas subsequently acquired by AstraZeneca). In October 2024, we in-licensed, ALXN-1840 from Alexion, AstraZeneca Rare Disease and plan to pursue\nregulatory approval and commercialization of this late-stage drug candidate for Wilson disease.\nRevenues\nWe are an emerging growth company. We have no approved drugs and have not generated any revenues. To date, we have engaged in acquiring or in-licensing\ndrug product candidates, and in entering into collaboration agreements for the preclinical testing and clinical development of our drug product candidates along with\nproviding the infrastructure to support the clinical development of our drug product candidates. We do not anticipate revenues from operations until we complete testing\nand development of one of our drug product candidates and obtain marketing approval, or until we sell, enter into a collaborative marketing arrangement, or out-license\none of our drug product candidates to another party. See “Liquidity and Capital Resources”.\nRecently Issued and Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2024, there were three recently issued accounting pronouncements that are described in more detail in Note 2 of our\ncondensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\n26\nTable of Contents\nCritical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates\nWhile our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in Note 2 of our condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this\nQuarterly Report on Form 10-Q, we believe the following accounting policies to be critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our condensed\nconsolidated financial statements.\nGoing Concern Assessment\nWe apply Accounting Standards Codification 205-40 (\"ASC 205-40\"), Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity's Ability to Continue as a Going Concern, which\nthe Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") issued to provide guidance on determining when and how reporting companies must disclose going concern\nuncertainties in their financial statements. ASC-205-40 requires management to perform interim and annual assessments of an entity's ability to continue as a going concern\nwithin one year of the date of issuance of the entity's financial statements (or within one year after the date on which the financial statements are available to be issued when\napplicable). Further, a company must provide certain disclosures if there is \"substantial doubt about the entity's ability to continue as a going concern.\" In October 2024, we\nanalyzed our cash requirements at least through December 31, 2025 and we have determined that, based upon our current available cash, we have no substantial doubt about\nour ability to continue as a going concern.\nClinical Trials Accruals\nWe accrue and expense the costs for clinical trial activities performed by third parties based upon estimates of the percentage of work completed over the life of the\nindividual study in accordance with agreements established with contract research organizations, service providers, and clinical trial sites. We estimate the amounts to\naccrue based upon discussions with internal clinical personnel and external service providers as to progress or stage of completion of trials or services and the agreed upon\nfees to be paid for such services. Costs of setting up clinical trial sites for participation in the trials are expensed immediately as research and development expenses.\nClinical trial site costs related to patient screening and enrollment are accrued as patients are screened/entered into the trial.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe account for stock-based compensation arrangements with employees, non-employee directors and consultants using a fair value method, which requires the\nrecognition of compensation expense for costs related to all stock-based compensation grants, including stock option and restricted stock unit (“RSU”) grants. The fair value\nmethod requires us to estimate the fair value of stock-based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model or the closing stock price on the date of\ngrant in the case of RSUs.\nStock-based compensation costs for stock awards granted to our employees, non-employee directors and consultants are based on the fair value of the underlying\ninstruments calculated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model on the date of grant for stock options and using the closing stock price on the date of grant for RSUs\nand recognized as expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is the vesting period. Determining the appropriate fair value model and related\nassumptions requires judgment, including selecting methods for estimating our future stock price volatility and expected holding term. During the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024, we granted 2,000 options to purchase shares of our common stock to a consultant, 30,001 options to purchase shares of our common stock to officers\nand 11,522 options to purchase shares of our common stock to non-officer employees. For awards granted during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the\nexpected volatility rates are estimated based on our actual historical volatility over the four-year period from our initial public offering on December 18, 2019, through\nDecember 31, 2023. For awards granted during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the expected volatility rates are estimated based on our actual\nhistorical volatility over the three-year period from our initial public offering on December 18, 2019, through December 31, 2022. The expected term for stock options\ngranted during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, was estimated using the simplified method. Forfeitures only include actual forfeitures to-\ndate as we account for forfeitures as they occur due to a limited history of forfeitures. We have not paid dividends and do not anticipate paying a cash dividend in future\nvesting periods and, accordingly, use an expected dividend yield of zero. The risk-free interest rate is based on the rate of U.S. Treasury securities with maturities consistent\nwith the estimated expected term of the awards.\n27\nTable of Contents\nResults of Operations\nComparison of the Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023\nThe following table summarizes the results of our operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n(Unaudited) (Unaudited)\n(in thousands) 2024 2023 Variance 2024 2023 Variance\nResearch and development expenses $ 984 $ 1,317 $ (333) $ 3,081 $ 4,564 $ (1,483)\nGeneral and administrative expenses 591 749 (158) 2,006 2,355 (349)\nTotal operating expenses 1,575 2,066 (491) 5,087 6,919 (1,832)\nOperating loss (1,575) (2,066) 491 (5,087) (6,919) 1,832\nOther income 171 — 171 171 — 171\nInterest income 99 112 (13) 255 331 (76)\nNet loss $ (1,305) $ (1,954) $ 649 $ (4,661) $ (6,588) $ 1,927\nResearch and Development (“R&D”) Expenses\nR&D expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were $984,000, compared to $1,317,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. This\nrepresents a decrease of $333,000 attributed to (1) a decrease in camsirubicin manufacturing costs of $301,000 due to our decision to wind down that program, and (2) a\ndecrease of $218,000 in Validive clinical trial-related expenses due to the closure of the trial in March 2023. These decreases were partially offset by a net increase of\n$186,000 due to other R&D expenses attributable to MNPR-101 for radiopharma use.\nR&D expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were $3,081,000 compared to $4,564,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This\nrepresents a decrease of $1,483,000 attributed to (1) a decrease of $1,572,000 in Validive clinical trial-related expenses due to the closure of the trial in March 2023, and\n(2) a net decrease of $366,000 due to other R&D expenses. These decreases were partially offset by an increase of $455,000 in expenses for MNPR-101 for radiopharma\nuse.\nGeneral and Administrative (“G&A”) Expenses\nG&A expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were $591,000, compared to $749,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. This\nrepresents a decrease of $158,000 primarily attributed to (1) a reduction of stock based compensation expenses of $146,000 due to the full vesting of the 2020 grants in the\nfourth quarter of 2023, and (2) a decrease in stock-based compensation to the CEO and the board of directors of $64,000 as no equity awards have been issued to the CEO\nand the board of directors to date in 2024 partially offset by a net increase in consulting and other G&A expenses of $52,000.\nG&A expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were $2,006,000, compared to $2,355,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This\nrepresents a decrease of $349,000 primarily attributed to (1) a reduction of stock based compensation expenses of $197,000 due to the full vesting of the 2020 grants in the\nfourth quarter of 2023, and (2) a decrease in stock-based compensation to the CEO and the board of directors of $197,000 as no equity awards were issued to the CEO and\nthe board of directors to date in 2024 partially offset by a net increase in consulting, tax services and other G&A expenses of $45,000.\nOther Income\nOther income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased by $171,000 versus the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 due to\nthe release of an accrued liability.\nInterest Income\nInterest income for the three months ended September 30, 2024, decreased by $13,000 versus the three months ended September 30, 2023. The reduction in the\namount of interest received is a reflection of the lower daily average cash balance in the third quarter of 2024 versus the third quarter of 2023.\nInterest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, decreased by $76,000 versus the nine months ended September 30, 2023, due to lower interest\nreceived due to a lower daily average cash balance in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 versus the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\n28\nTable of Contents\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nSources of Liquidity\nWe have incurred losses and cumulative negative cash flows from operations since we commenced operations resulting in an accumulated deficit of approximately\n$64.9 million as of September 30, 2024. We anticipate that we will continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future. We expect that our R&D and G&A expenses will\nincrease to enable the execution of our strategic plan. As a result, we anticipate that we will seek to raise additional capital within the next 12 months to fund our future\noperations. We will seek to obtain needed capital through a variety of methods including and not limited to marketed offerings, rights offerings, debt financing, strategic\npartnerships or other sources of capital that may be available.\nWe anticipate that the currently available funds as of October 31, 2024 will fund our planned operations at least into the first half of 2026.\nWe invest our cash equivalents in two money market accounts and U.S. Treasury Bills and may consider expanding the instruments to include U.S Treasury Notes\nand U.S. Treasury bonds.\nCash Flows\nThe following table provides information regarding our cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.\nNine Months Ended September 30,\n(Unaudited)\n(in thousands) 2024 2023 Variance\nNet cash used in operating activities $ (4,405) $ (6,312) $ 1,907\nNet cash provided by investing activities — 1,957 (1,957)\nNet cash provided by financing activities 3,155 1,692 1,463\nEffect of exchange rates 4 (8) 12\nNet decrease in cash and cash equivalents $ (1,246) $ (2,671) $ 1,425\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 we had a net cash outflow of $1,246,000 and $2,671,000, respectively. During the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024, versus the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the decrease in net cash outflow of $1,425,000 primarily consisted of a decrease in net cash\nprovided by investing activities of $1,957,000 due to the purchases of investments versus certain investments maturities in 2023, partially offset by (1) a decrease in net cash\nused in operating activities of $1,907,000, (2) an increase in net cash provided by financing activities of $1,463,000 due to the increased sales of shares of our common\nstock under at-the-market sales programs and (3) an increase due to effect of foreign exchange rates.\nCash Flow Used in Operating Activities\nThe decrease of $1,907,000 in cash flow used in operating activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023 was primarily a result of lower net loss due to a reduction in research and development expenses.\nCash Flow Provided by Investing Activities\nThe cash provided by investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and the cash provided by investing activities during the nine months\nended September 30, 2023 represent our net investment in U.S. Treasury Bills maturing or invested in during the periods reported.\nCash Flow Provided by Financing Activities\nThe increase in cash flow provided by financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30,\n2023 of $1,463,000 was primarily due to higher net proceeds from sales of our common stock under at-the-market sales programs during the nine months ended September\n30, 2024 when compared to the sales of our common stock during the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\n29\nTable of Contents\nFuture Funding Requirements\nTo date, we have not generated any revenue from product sales. We do not know when, or if, we will generate any revenue from product sales. We do not expect to\ngenerate any revenue from product sales or royalties unless and until we obtain regulatory approval of and commercialize any of our current or future drug product\ncandidates or we out-license or sell a drug product candidate to another party. At the same time, we expect our expenses to increase in connection with our ongoing\ndevelopment activities, particularly as we continue the research, development, future preclinical studies and clinical trials of, and seek regulatory approval for, our current\nand future drug product candidates. We will need substantial additional funding for clinical development prior to seeking regulatory approval. If we obtain regulatory\napproval of any of our current or future drug product candidates, we will need substantial additional funding for commercialization requirements and our continuing drug\nproduct development operations.\nAs a company, we have not completed development through marketing approvals of any therapeutic or imaging products. We expect to continue to incur significant\nincreases in expenses and increasing operating losses for the foreseeable future. We anticipate that our expenses will increase substantially as we:\n● develop our ALXN-1840 investigational drug candidate as a treatment for Wilson disease;\n● progress our MNPR-101-Zr imaging and dosimetry clinical trial in advanced cancer patients;\n● progress our MNPR-101-Lu therapeutic clinical trial in advanced cancer patients;\n● continue the preclinical activities and potentially advance MNPR-101-Ac into the clinic as a therapeutic in advanced cancer patients;\n● support intellectual property initiatives for our Wilson disease and radiopharmaceutical programs;\n● identify and potentially invent or license novel targets and drug candidates complementing our radiopharmaceutical programs, and pursue the future preclinical\nand clinical development and regulatory requirements of such drug product candidates;\n● seek regulatory approvals for any of our current and future drug product candidates that successfully complete registration clinical trials;\n● establish or purchase the services of a sales, marketing and distribution infrastructure to commercialize any products for which we obtain marketing approval;\n● develop, or contract for, manufacturing/quality capabilities in order to establish a reliable, high quality supply chain sufficient to support our clinical and\nspecialized radiopharmaceutical requirements and to provide sufficient capacity to launch and supply the market for any product for which we obtain marketing\napproval; and\n● add or contract for required operational, financial, human resources and management information systems and capabilities and other specialized expert personnel\nto support our drug product candidate development and planned commercialization efforts.\nWe anticipate that the funds available as of October 31, 2024 will fund our obligations at least into the first half of 2026. We have based this estimate on assumptions that\nmay prove to be wrong, and we could use our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect. Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with\nthe development and commercialization of our drug product candidates, and the extent to which we enter into collaborations with third parties to participate in the\ndevelopment and commercialization of our drug product candidates, we are unable to accurately estimate with high reliability the amounts and timing required for increased\ncapital outlays and operating expenditures associated with our current and anticipated drug product candidate development programs.\nOur future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including:\n● the development program for ALXN-1840 in Wilson disease;\n● the clinical development progress of MNPR-101-Zr in imaging advanced cancers;\n● the clinical development progress of MNPR-101-Lu as a therapeutic agent in advanced cancers;\n● the progress of preclinical and clinical development of MNPR-101-Ac (the radioisotope actinium-225 conjugated to MNPR-101);\n● the progress of preclinical activities towards identifying novel targets and candidates to complement our radiopharmaceutical programs;\n● the number and characteristics of other drug product candidates that we may invent, license, acquire, or otherwise pursue;\n30\nTable of Contents\n● the scope, progress, timing, cost and results of research, preclinical development and clinical trials and regulatory requirements for future drug product\ncandidates;\n● the costs, timing and outcomes of seeking, obtaining, and maintaining FDA and international regulatory approvals;\n● the costs associated with establishing or contracting for manufacturing/quality requirements and establishing or contracting for sales, marketing and distribution\ncapabilities;\n● our ability and related costs to maintain, expand and defend the scope of our intellectual property portfolio, including the amount and timing of any payments we\nmay be required to make in connection with the licensing, filing, defense and enforcement of any patents or other intellectual property rights;\n● our need and ability to hire or contract for additional management, administrative, scientific, medical, sales and marketing, and manufacturing/quality and other\nspecialized personnel or external expertise;\n● the effect and timing of entry of competing products or new therapies that may limit market penetration or prevent the introduction of our drug product candidates\nor reduce the commercial potential of our product portfolio;\n● our need to implement additional required internal management, operational, record keeping, and other systems and infrastructure; and\n● the economic and other terms, timing and success of our existing collaboration and licensing arrangements and any collaboration, licensing or other arrangements\ninto which we may enter into in the future, including the timing of receipt of or payment to or from others of any license, milestone or royalty payments under\nthese arrangements.\nWe intend to continue evaluating drug product candidates for the purpose of growing our pipeline. Identifying and securing high-quality compounds usually takes\ntime and related expenses. Our spending could be significantly accelerated in the future if additional drug product candidates are acquired and enter clinical development. In\nthis event, we may be required to expand our management team, and pay higher contract manufacturing costs, contract research organization fees, other clinical\ndevelopment costs and insurance costs that are not currently projected. Beyond our current funds, substantial additional long-term funding is needed to further develop our\nradiopharmaceutical and rare disease programs.\nUntil we can generate a sufficient amount of product revenue to finance our cash requirements, we expect to finance our future cash needs primarily through a\ncombination of equity offerings, debt financings, strategic collaborations and grant funding. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or\nconvertible debt securities, the ownership interest of our current stockholders will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences\nthat adversely affect our current stockholders’ rights. Debt financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take\nspecific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. If we raise additional funds through marketing and distribution\narrangements or other collaborations, strategic alliances or licensing arrangements with other parties, we likely will have to share or relinquish valuable rights to our\ntechnologies, future revenue streams, research programs or drug product candidates or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us, which will reduce our future\nreturns and affect our future operating flexibility. If we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings when needed, we may be required to delay,\nlimit, reduce or terminate our pipeline product development or commercialization efforts or grant rights to others to develop and market drug product candidates that we\nwould otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves.\n31\nTable of Contents\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nLicense, Development and Collaboration Agreements\nAlexion, AstraZeneca Rare Disease\nOn October 23, 2024, we executed a License Agreement with Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc., pursuant to which Alexion granted us an exclusive worldwide license\nfor the development and commercialization of ALXN-1840, a drug candidate for Wilson disease. As initial upfront consideration for the License Agreement, we issued\nAlexion 387,329 shares (representing 9.9% of our outstanding shares) of our common stock and agreed to make an upfront cash payment of $4.0 million. We agreed to an\nanti-dilution provision that entitles Alexion to receive additional shares at no cost to maintain their 9.9% ownership until we raise the next $25.0 million of common equity\ncapital, subject to a maximum of 705,015 Shares unless we obtain stockholder approval. We have given customary registration rights to Alexion and agreed to file a resale\nregistration statement within forty-five (45) days of October 23, 2024. To date, we have issued an aggregate of 522,501 shares of our common stock to Alexion.\nA cash payment of $1.0 million was paid at the time of signing and the remaining $3.0 million is due to be paid within ninety (90) days. Additionally, we are\nobligated to milestone payments of up to $94.0 million for achievement of regulatory approval and sales related milestones. In addition, we are obligated to pay tiered\nroyalties based on net sales in the low to mid-double digit range. We have also given Alexion the right of first negotiation regarding any rights should we intend to\nsublicense ALXN-1840. Furthermore, we will have to pay Alexion a percentage in the mid-double digits of any sublicensing income received by us. As part of this license\nagreement, we will also owe a third-party single digit millions cash milestone payment upon regulatory approval in Europe and a single digit percentage royalty on net sales\nin Europe.\nNorthStar Medical Radioisotopes, LLC (\"NorthStar\")\nIn June 2024, we entered into a long-term, non-exclusive master supply agreement with NorthStar underwhich Northstar will provide us with the therapeutic\nradioisotope actinium-225 (\"Ac-225\"). The original collaboration agreement was amended at that time to clarify certain economic terms and those related to jointly\ndeveloped intellectual property rights for our MNPR-101 for radiopharmaceutical use. We have acquired these rights from NorthStar, together with certain broad, jointly\ndeveloped intellectual property pertaining to MNPR-101, giving us full ownership and title to our lead MNPR-101 radiopharmaceutical platform. We will jointly share\nownership of the filed patent application on the use of PCTA as a linker with Ac-225, which has shown that MNPR-101 has superior binding and yield with Ac-225 over the\ncurrent industry-leading linker, DOTA.\nXOMA Ltd.\nPursuant to a non-exclusive license agreement with XOMA Ltd. for the humanization technology used in the development of MNPR-101, we are obligated to pay\nXOMA Ltd. clinical, regulatory and sales milestones which could reach up to $14.925 million if we achieve all milestones for MNPR-101. The agreement does not require\nthe payment of sales royalties. There can be no assurance that we will achieve any milestones. As of October 31, 2024, we had not reached any milestones and had not been\nrequired to pay XOMA Ltd. any funds under this license agreement. The first milestone payment is payable upon first dosing of a human patient in a Phase 2 clinical trial.\nWe are currently conducting a Phase 1 clinical trial and cannot reliably predict when we will be able to commence a Phase 2 clinical trial, if at all.\nService Providers\nIn the normal course of business, we contract with service providers to assist in the performance of R&D, including drug product manufacturing, process\ndevelopment, clinical and preclinical development, and G&A including financial strategy, audit, tax and legal support. We can elect to discontinue the work under these\nagreements at any time. We could also enter into collaborative research and development, contract research, manufacturing and supplier agreements in the future, which\nmay require upfront payments and/or long-term commitments of cash.\nOffice Lease\nWe are currently leasing on a month-to-month basis office space for our executive headquarters at 1000 Skokie Blvd., in the Village of Wilmette, Illinois for $4,238\nper month.\nLegal Contingencies\nWe are currently not, and to date have never been, a party to any adverse material legal proceedings.\n32\nTable of Contents\nIndemnification\nIn the normal course of business, we enter into contracts and agreements that contain a variety of representations and warranties and provide for general\nindemnification. Our exposure under these agreements is unknown because it involves claims that may be made against us in the future, but that have not yet been made. To\ndate, we have not paid any claims or been required to defend any action related to our indemnification obligations. However, we may record charges in the future as a result\nof these indemnification obligations.\nIn accordance with our Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, Amended and Restated Bylaws and the indemnification agreements entered into\nwith each officer and non-employee director, we have indemnification obligations to our officers and non-employee directors for certain events or occurrences, subject to\ncertain limits, while they are serving at our request in such capacity. There have been no claims to date.\nItem 4. Controls and Procedures\nOur Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have provided certifications filed as Exhibits 31.1 and 31.2, respectively, and Exhibit 32.1. Such\ncertifications should be read in conjunction with the information contained in this Item 4 for a more complete understanding of the matters covered by those certifications.\n(a) Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nWe carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial\nOfficer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024, pursuant to Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act. Based\non that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures, as of such date, were effective.\n(b) Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have concluded that the condensed consolidated financial statements and other financial information included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q fairly\npresent in all material respects our financial condition, results of operations and comprehensive loss and cash flows as of, and for, the periods presented.\nThere have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the three months ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are\nreasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nPART II. OTHER INFORMATION\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\nOther than the additional risk factors below, there have been no material changes in information regarding our risk factors as described in Item 1A of our Annual\nReport on Form 10-K as filed with the SEC on March 28, 2024.\nOur strategic focus on our radiopharmaceutical program could subject to us to concentrated risks.\nAs a result of our strategic decision to focus our efforts on our radiopharmaceutical program, a relatively novel approach to cancer imaging and treatment, and\nwind-down our camsirubicin and MNPR-202 programs, we face concentrated risks. Although the nature of the risks associated with our radiopharmaceutical program as\ndescribed in Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K have not materially changed, the impacts from those risks should they be realized, or from perceptions of those\nrisks in the market, could be more acute. In addition, our decision to wind-down our camsirubicin and MNPR-202 programs could adversely impact our stock price.\nFollowing our decision to wind-down our Validive program in 2023, our stock price suffered significant declines. We cannot predict what impact our decision to focus on\nour radiopharmaceutical program and wind-down our other programs will have on our stock price or financing prospects.\nThere are risks and uncertainties associated with our newly-acquired ALXN-1840 program.\nAlthough a pivotal Phase 3 trial with ALXN-1840 has been completed, which met its primary endpoint as described elsewhere in this report, Alexion ended up\nterminating the ALXN-1840 program in Wilson disease based on review of results from Phase 2 mechanistic trials and discussions with regulatory authorities. The Phase 2\nmechanism of action studies failed to meet their primary objectives of demonstrating net-negative copper balance in Wilson disease patients during short-term treatment\nwith ALXN-1840 and reducing hepatic copper concentration after treatment with ALXN-1840. The decision not to progress the ALXN-1840 program in Wilson disease was\nnot related to any safety signals.\nIn the near term, Monopar will be focusing on assembling a regulatory package and initiating discussions with the FDA. These activities will provide clarity on the\nadditional capital needed for the program.\nThe regulatory approval process can be lengthy, expensive and uncertain. The FDA and other regulatory agencies around the world could require us to perform\nadditional nonclinical and/or clinical studies to obtain ALXN-1840 approval, which we may not be able to raise the capital to complete or the results of which may not meet\nthe level of clinical or statistical significance required by the FDA and other regulatory agencies. What the FDA and other regulatory agencies require for approval could\nhave a material impact on the timelines and/or capital required to get ALXN-1840 approved. Even if approved, market adoption could be slower or lower than expected,\nespecially given competition from existing therapies or new ones that get approved. We are planning to initially focus on Wilson disease patients with more severe\nsymptoms, and this population could end up being smaller than we are anticipating. This population could be further be reduced in size if the FDA or other regulatory\nagencies give us a more narrow label than anticipated. Being an orphan indication, this could result in a very small eligible patient population. Additionally, if the currently\nfiled patents do not end up providing sufficient protection, we will be heavily reliant on the orphan drug designation protections in the US and EU.\nItem 5. Other Information\nDuring the quarter ended September 30, 2024, no director or officer of the Company adopted or terminated a “Rule 10b5- 1 trading arrangement” or “non-\nRule 10b5- 1 trading arrangement,” as each term is defined in Item 408(a) of Regulation S-K.\n33\nTable of Contents\nItem 6.

All statements other than statements of historical facts included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are forward-looking\nstatements. The words “hopes,” “believes,” “anticipates,” “plans,” “seeks,” “estimates,” “projects,” “expects,” “intends,” “may,” “could,” “should,” “would,” “will,” “continue,”\nand similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. The following uncertainties and factors, among others, could affect future performance and cause actual\nresults to differ materially from those matters expressed in or implied by forward-looking statements:\n● our ability to raise sufficient funds within the next 12 months in order for us to support continued clinical development of MNPR-101 for radiopharmaceutical use in\nadvanced cancers, and if supported by positive data from the ongoing Phase 1b dose escalation study, continue the clinical development of camsirubicin and\npreclinical development of MNPR-202 and related compounds; as well as our ability to further raise additional funds in the future to support any future product\ncandidate programs through completion of clinical trials, and our current and future product candidate programs through the approval processes and, if applicable,\ncommercialization;\nour ability to regain compliance with the Nasdaq listing standards requiring our stock closing bid price to be at least $1.00 for at least 10 consecutive trading days\n● (and potentially up to 20) by August 26, 2024, and, in the event it is necessary to effect a reverse stock split to attempt to cure the bid price deficiency, the uncertain\nimpact on our stock price, or if more time is needed, our ability to win an appeal to Nasdaq requesting additional time;\n● our ability to raise funds on acceptable terms;\n● our ability to find a suitable pharmaceutical partner or partners to further our development efforts, under acceptable financial terms;\n● risks and uncertainties associated with our or our development partners' research and development activities, including preclinical studies, clinical trials, regulatory\nsubmissions, and manufacturing and quality expenses;\n● known and unknown risks associated with developing new radiopharmaceutical therapeutics and imaging agents;\n● estimated timeframes for our clinical trials and regulatory reviews for approval to market products are uncertain;\n● our ability to address the fulfillment and logistical challenges posed by the potential time-limited shelf-life of our current radiopharma or future drug candidates;\n● our ability to obtain an adequate supply at reasonable costs of radioisotopes that we are currently using or that we may incorporate into our drug candidates, as such\nsupply may be impacted by the ongoing wars between Russia-Ukraine, Israel-Hamas and other uncertain economic and market effects;\n● the rate of market acceptance and competitiveness in terms of pricing, efficacy and safety, of any products for which we receive marketing approval, and our ability to\ncompetitively market any such products as compared to larger pharmaceutical firms;\n3\nTable of Contents\nForward-Looking Statements (continued)\n● the difficulties of commercialization, marketing and product manufacturing and overall strategy;\n● uncertainties of intellectual property position and strategy including new discoveries and patent filings;\n● our ability to attract and retain experienced and qualified key personnel and/or to find and utilize external sources of experience, expertise and scientific, medical and\ncommercialization knowledge to complete product development and commercialization of new products;\n● the risks inherent in our estimates regarding the level of needed expenses, capital requirements and the availability of required additional financing at acceptable\nterms;\n● the impact of government laws and regulations including increased governmental control of healthcare and pharmaceuticals, resulting in direct price controls driving\nlower prices, other governmental regulations affecting cost requirements and structures for selling therapeutic or imaging products, and recent governmental\nlegislation affecting other industries which may indirectly increase our costs of obtaining goods and services and our cost of capital;\n● the uncertain impact any resurgence of COVID-19 or another pandemic could have on our ability to advance our clinical programs and raise additional financing;\n● the cumulative impact of domestic and global inflation, volatility in financial markets and/or the potential for an economic recession increasing our costs of obtaining\ngoods and services or making financing more difficult to obtain on acceptable terms or at all;\n● the uncertain impact of the Russia-Ukraine war or the Israel-Hamas war on our clinical material manufacturing expenses and timelines, as well as on general\neconomic, trade and financial market conditions; and\n● uncertainty of our financial projections and operational timelines and the development of new competitive products and technologies.\nAlthough we believe that the risk assessments identified in such forward-looking statements are appropriate, we can give no assurance that such risks will materialize. Cautionary\nstatements are disclosed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including without limitation statements in the section entitled “Item 1A - Risk Factors,” addressing forward-looking\nstatements. All subsequent written and oral forward-looking statements attributable to us or persons acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary\nstatements. We undertake no obligation to update any statements made in this Annual Report on Form 10-K or elsewhere, including without limitation any forward-looking\nstatements, except as required by law.\nAny forward-looking statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K reflect our current views with respect to future events or to our future financial performance and involve\nknown and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results,\nperformance or achievements expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. Information that is based on estimates, forecasts, projections, market research or similar\nmethodologies is inherently subject to uncertainties and actual events or circumstances may differ materially from events and circumstances projected in this information.\n4\nTable of Contents\nSummary Risk Factors\nOur business is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including those highlighted in “Item 1A - Risk Factors” located elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. These\nrisks include, among others, the following:\n● We are a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company with a history of financial losses. We expect to continue to incur significant losses for the foreseeable future and\nmay never achieve or maintain cash self-sufficiency or profitability, which could result in a decline in the market value of our common stock.\n● Funds raised to date are not sufficient to support clinical development of MNPR-101 for radiopharmaceutical use in advanced cancers beyond the planned Phase 1\nclinical trial and, if supported by positive data from the ongoing Phase 1b dose escalation study, continue the clinical development of camsirubicin and preclinical\ndevelopment of MNPR-202 and related compounds. If we are unable to raise enough funds within the next 12 months from the sale of our common stock or other\nfinancing efforts, or conclude a strategic agreement or collaboration such as out-licensing our product candidates, or enter into a clinical or commercial partnership,\nwe will likely have to prioritize and/or terminate one or more programs. There can be no assurance that we will be able to secure such financing or find a suitable\ndevelopment partner on satisfactory terms.\n● The termination of our Validive clinical trial at the end of March 2023 resulted in a decrease in our stock price. The closing bid price of our stock fell below $1.00 for\nmore than 30 consecutive trading days and on August 28, 2023, we received a notice from Nasdaq stating that we were out of compliance with Nasdaq listing\nstandards giving us 180 days to regain compliance. On February 27, 2024, we received a notice from Nasdaq granting us an additional 180-day period to regain\ncompliance. If we do not regain compliance by August 26, 2024 or win an appeal to extend the deadline, we would face delisting or needing to do a reverse stock\nsplit and it may have serious adverse consequences on our stock price and our ability to raise funds, which may cause us to delay, restructure or otherwise reconsider\nour operations. If it is necessary to effect a reverse stock split to attempt to cure the bid price deficiency, the impacts on our stock price are uncertain and could be\nadverse.\n● We do not have and may never have any approved products on the market. Our business is highly dependent upon receiving marketing approvals from various U.S.\nand international governmental agencies and would be severely harmed if we are not granted approvals to manufacture and sell our product candidates.\n● Our clinical trials may not yield sufficiently conclusive results for regulatory agencies to approve the marketing and sale of our products, which would adversely\naffect our financial condition.\n● If we experience delays or difficulties in the enrollment of patients in clinical trials, our receipt of necessary regulatory approvals will be delayed or prevented, which\ncould materially delay our program schedules and adversely affect our financial condition.\n● If we or our licensees, development collaborators, or suppliers are unable to manufacture our products in sufficient quantities or at defined quality specifications, or\nare unable to obtain regulatory approvals for the manufacturing facility, we may be unable to develop and/or meet demand for our products as well as lose time to\nmarket and potential revenues.\n● We rely on qualified third parties to conduct our active pharmaceutical ingredient manufacturing, our drug product manufacturing, non-clinical studies, and our\nclinical trials. If these third parties do not or cannot successfully carry out their contractual duties and meet expected deadlines or performance goals, the initiation or\nconduct of our clinical trials would be delayed and we may be unable to obtain regulatory approval for, or commercialize, our current product candidates or any\nfuture products, and our financial condition would be adversely affected.\nRadiopharmaceutical technology is a relatively novel approach to cancer imaging and treatment, which may create significant and potentially unpredictable\n● challenges for it, including the availability of radioisotopes, potential misconception about the safety of radiopharmaceuticals, and low market uptake due to its\nnovelty. Perceptions of these challenges may make it more difficult to raise funding as we focus efforts on our radiopharmaceutical program.\n5\nTable of Contents\nSummary Risk Factors (continued)\n● The Russia-Ukraine war, and resulting sanctions against Russia and Russian entities, and Russian reduction in gas shipments to the EU and other allies, have\nincreased fuel costs, reduced access to critical supplies and may cause shipping delays. Separately, the Israel-Hamas war has created additional uncertainties. The\nbroader economic, trade and financial market consequences are uncertain at this time, which may increase the cost of supplies for our clinical materials, delay the\nmanufacture of our clinical materials, restrict the availability of radioisotopes, increase costs of other goods and services or make it more difficult or costly to raise\nadditional financing, any of which could cause an adverse effect on our clinical programs and on our financial condition.\n● Market variables, such as inflation of product costs, labor rates and fuel, freight and energy costs, as well as geopolitical events could likely cause us to suffer\nsignificant increases in our operating and administrative expenses.\n● Unstable market and economic conditions, such as volatility in the markets due to concerns about bank stability and economic challenges due to inflation, may have\nserious adverse consequences on our ability to raise funds, which may cause us to delay, restructure or cease our operations.\n● The effects of economic and political pressure to lower pharmaceutical prices are a major threat to the economic viability of new research-based pharmaceutical\nproducts, and any significant decrease in drug prices could materially and adversely affect the financial appeal of our products and prospects for us to raise additional\ncapital.\n● We face significant competition from other radiopharmaceutical, biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, and from research-based academic medical\ninstitutions, in our targeted medical indications, and our operating results would be adversely affected if we fail to compete effectively. Many competitors in our\nindustry have greater organizational capabilities, much higher available capital resources, and established marketing and sales resources and experience in the\ntargeted markets. Competition and technological change may make our product candidates obsolete or non-competitive.\n● The termination of third-party licenses would adversely affect our rights to important compounds or technologies which are essential to develop and market our\nproducts.\n● If we and our third-party licensors do not obtain and preserve protection for our respective intellectual property rights, our competitors may be able to develop and\nmarket competing drugs, which would adversely affect our financial condition.\n● If we lose key management leadership, and/or the expertise and experience of our scientific personnel, and if we cannot recruit qualified employees or other highly\nqualified and experienced personnel for future requirements, we would be at risk to experience significant program delays and increased operational and\ncompensation costs, and our business would be materially disrupted.\n● Any future or long-term impacts of COVID-19 or any other pandemic remain uncertain, and their scope and impact could have a substantial negative bearing on our\nbusiness, financial condition, operating results, stock price and ability to raise additional funds.\n6\nTable of Contents\nPART I\nItem 1. Business\nYou should read the following discussion in conjunction with our financial statements as of December 31, 2023, and the notes to such financial statements included\nelsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOverview\nWe are a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing innovative treatments for cancer patients. We are building a drug candidate pipeline through in-\nhouse development as well as the licensing and acquisition of therapeutics in late preclinical and in clinical development stages. We leverage our scientific and clinical experience\nto help reduce the risk and accelerate the clinical development of our drug product candidates.\nWe currently have several compounds in development: 1) MNPR-101-Zr, a clinical stage uPAR-targeted radiodiagnostic imaging agent; 2) MNPR-101-RIT, a late preclinical\nstage radiotherapeutic for advanced cancers; 3) camsirubicin (generic name for MNPR-201, GPX-150; 5-imino-13-deoxydoxorubicin), a Phase 1b clinical stage novel analog of\ndoxorubicin engineered specifically to retain anticancer activity while minimizing toxic effects on the heart; and 4) an early stage camsirubicin analog, MNPR-202, for various\ncancers.\nOur Product Pipeline\n7\nTable of Contents\nOur Product Candidates\nMNPR-101 for Radiopharmaceutical Use\nOur MNPR-101 radiopharmaceutical program was developed by us for advanced cancers expressing urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (\"uPAR\"). This proprietary,\nnovel first-in-class radiopharmaceutical program aims to identify and selectively kill the tumors expressing uPAR, which include a majority of triple-negative breast, colorectal, and\npancreatic cancers. The program uses MNPR-101, our proprietary humanized monoclonal antibody targeting uPAR, as a means to accurately deliver radioisotope payloads to the\ntumors. We have demonstrated promising preclinical data to-date for our MNPR-101 radiopharmaceutical program. Positron emission tomography (“PET”) imaging data of\npreclinical human tumor xenograft mouse models for triple-negative breast, colorectal, and pancreatic tumors expressing uPAR display high, selective and durable uptake of\nMNPR-101 conjugated to the imaging radioisotope zirconium-89 (\"MNPR-101-Zr\"). Additionally, preclinical triple-negative breast and pancreatic cancer mouse model studies with\nMNPR-101 conjugated to therapeutic radioisotopes (\"MNPR-101-RIT\") have shown promising anti-tumor activity. Overall, the preclinical imaging and therapeutic efficacy\nstudy results demonstrate the potential utility of MNPR-101 as a precision targeting radiopharmaceutical agent for both imaging and therapy in multiple cancer indications. We are\nactively working towards enrolling our Phase 1 dosimetry clinical trial in Australia for MNPR-101-Zr in patients with advanced cancer.\nMNPR-101 is designed to selectively bind to uPAR. uPAR is highly expressed in multiple types of tumors, including breast, pancreatic, and colorectal cancers but not on\nmost normal cells. It is estimated that the tumors and/or tumor associated cells in 97% of breast, 89% of bladder, 87% of pancreatic and 85% of colorectal cancer patients express\nuPAR. Moreover, several Phase 1 PET imaging studies in advanced cancer patients show that uPAR can only be detected in the tumor and not in normal tissues, making it a\npotentially attractive target for cancer therapies, including radiopharmaceuticals.\nIn February 2024, we received Human Research Ethics Committee (HREC) clearance in Australia to commence our Phase 1 dosimetry trial for MNPR-101-Zr in patients\nwith advanced cancers. The trial will utilize total body PET/CT (\"positron emission tomography–computed tomography\") imaging to assess tumor uptake, normal organ\nbiodistribution, and safety. The study will be conducted at Melbourne Theranostic Innovation Centre (\"MTIC\")headed by Professor Rodney Hicks, MBBS(Hons), MD, FRACP,\nFICIS, FAAHMS, and will use one of the world's most sensitive clinical total-body PET/CT scanners, the Siemens Biograph Vision Quadra, to image the targeting ability of\nMNPR-101-Zr in cancer patients. If the tumor uptake, biodistribution, and safety look encouraging in this Phase 1 clinical trial, which is anticipated to enroll approximately 12\npatients, we plan to evaluate the efficacy in humans of a therapeutic version of MNPR-101 radiolabeled with an isotope such as actinium-225 (\"Ac-225\" or \"Ac\").\n8\nTable of Contents\nOverview of Preclinical Development\nIn February 2024, we announced promising preclinical data for MNPR-101 radiopharmaceutical imaging and therapeutic agents demonstrating highly selective and durable uptake\nin uPAR expressing tumors and potent anti-tumor effects in human tumor xenograft mouse models. Maximizing the dose delivered to the tumor relative to normal tissue is of\nparamount importance in radiopharmaceutical therapy. Figure 1 below shows the before and after optimization of MNPR-101-Zr. MNPR-101-Zr is a zirconium-89 labeled version\nof MNPR-101 that is being developed as a radiopharmaceutical imaging agent for advanced solid tumors expressing uPAR. Monopar’s in-house radiopharmaceutical development\nteam was able to significantly increase tumor uptake of MNPR-101-Zr while minimizing uptake in healthy tissue, as shown in this preclinical PET sequential imaging time-series.\nThe high specificity and durable tumor uptake are evident in the After Optimization panel below.\n9\nTable of Contents\nPreclinical data to date demonstrate compelling and durable anti-tumor benefits with MNPR-101 conjugated to therapeutic radioisotopes. Figure 2 below shows preclinical efficacy\ndata in triple negative breast cancer (left) and pancreatic cancer (right) human tumor xenograft mouse models utilizing two different therapeutic radioisotopes conjugated to MNPR-\n101; one of these radioisotopes has already been disclosed as being Ac-225. The results in both show near complete elimination of the tumor after a single injection of the\nradiopharmaceutical agent. These studies demonstrate the potential of a MNPR-101 based radiopharmaceutical to provide a very meaningful clinical benefit to cancer patients.\nTo visualize the biodistribution of a therapeutic radioisotope conjugated to MNPR-101, lutetium-177 (\"Lu-177\") was used. The results of a sequential SPECT (\"single-photon\nemission computed tomography\") imaging time-series utilizing MNPR-101 conjugated to Lu-177 (\"MNPR-101-Lu\") can be seen in Figure 3. High specificity and durable uptake\nof MNPR-101-Lu in the tumor relative to normal tissue is readily apparent, and help explain the near complete elimination of tumors observed after a single injection of therapeutic\nradioisotopes bound to MNPR-101.\n10\nTable of Contents\nCamsirubicin (5-imino-13-deoxydoxorubicin; formerly MNPR-201, GPX-150)\nCamsirubicin is a novel analog of doxorubicin which has been designed to reduce the cardiotoxic side effects generated by doxorubicin while retaining effective anti-cancer\nactivity. A previous Phase 2 clinical trial for camsirubicin dosed up to 265 mg/m2 per cycle was completed in patients with advanced (e.g., unresectable or metastatic) soft tissue\nsarcoma (“ASTS”). Average life expectancy for these patients is 12-15 months. In this previous study, 52.6% of patients evaluable for tumor progression demonstrated clinical\nbenefit (partial response or stable disease), which was proportional to dose and consistently observed at higher cumulative doses of camsirubicin (>1000 mg/m2). Camsirubicin was\nvery well tolerated in this study and underscored the ability to potentially administer camsirubicin without restriction of cumulative dose in patients with ASTS. Although\ndoxorubicin has been the standard of care treatment for ASTS for over 40 years, doxorubicin is limited to a lifetime cumulative dose maximum of 450 mg/m2 due to the risk of\ncausing irreversible cardiotoxicity. Even if a patient is responding to doxorubicin, therefore, their treatment is discontinued once this lifetime cumulative dose has been reached.\nIn contrast to doxorubicin, camsirubicin is selective for topoisomerase II-alpha. Doxorubicin is used to treat adult and pediatric solid and blood (hematologic) cancers,\nincluding soft tissue sarcomas, breast, gastric, ovarian and bladder cancers, leukemias and lymphomas. Despite clinical studies demonstrating the anti-cancer benefit of higher\ncumulative doses of doxorubicin, the clinical efficacy of doxorubicin has historically been limited by the risk of patients developing irreversible, potentially life-threatening\ncardiotoxicity. For example, several clinical studies completed in the 1990s demonstrated that concurrent doxorubicin (60 mg/m2, 8 cycles) and paclitaxel gave a 94% overall\nresponse rate in patients with metastatic breast cancer but led to 18% of these patients developing congestive heart failure. Reduction of doxorubicin to 4-6 cycles of treatment\ndecreased the incidence of congestive heart failure, but also reduced response rates to 45-55%. In a clinical study looking at dose response, sarcoma patients on the high dose (75\nmg/m2) doxorubicin had a response rate of 37% compared to just 18% in the low dose (45 mg/m2) doxorubicin group. With the cumulative dose restriction on doxorubicin, the\nmedian progression free survival for ASTS patients is approximately 6 months, with median overall survival of 12-15 months. There is a significant unmet opportunity to develop a\nreplacement for doxorubicin that can be dosed higher and for longer to improve anti-tumor activity.\nCamsirubicin has been engineered specifically to retain the anticancer activity of doxorubicin while minimizing its toxic effects on the heart. Similar to doxorubicin, the\nantitumor effects of camsirubicin are mediated through the stabilization of the topoisomerase II complex after a DNA strand break and DNA intercalation leading to tumor cell\napoptosis (cell death). Inhibiting the topoisomerase II-alpha isoform is desired for the anti-cancer effect, while inhibiting the topoisomerase II-beta isoform has been demonstrated\nto mediate, at least in part, the cardiotoxicity associated with all anthracycline drugs currently used in the clinic. Camsirubicin is substantially more selective than doxorubicin for\ninhibiting topoisomerase II-alpha versus topoisomerase II-beta. This selectivity may partly explain the minimal cardiotoxicity that has been observed for camsirubicin in preclinical\nand clinical studies to date. We believe that these attributes provide a strong rationale for developing camsirubicin as a monotherapy as well as in combination with other anticancer\nagents, without potential restrictions on cumulative dose, and offer the opportunity to pursue a large market opportunity for camsirubicin in a broad spectrum of cancer types.\nCamsirubicin Clinical Data\nTwo clinical studies of camsirubicin have been completed and one is currently ongoing.\nIn October 2013, a Phase 1 dose escalation study conducted at the University of Iowa completed enrollment of 24 patients who received one of eight different dose levels\nof camsirubicin ranging from 14 to 265 mg/m2. No evidence of irreversible cardiotoxicity was observed in any of these patients, including 4 patients who received prior\nanthracycline (doxorubicin or related molecules) treatment. Stable disease was observed in 55.0% of patients in this Phase 1 study, including 3 out of 4 patients with\nleiomyosarcoma, which is a type of soft tissue sarcoma that originates in connective tissue and smooth muscle most commonly in the uterus, stomach and small intestine. No\ngrowth factor support (G-CSF) was given to patients, and the limiting toxicity was neutropenia.\n11\nTable of Contents\nIn January 2015, a multi-center open label single arm Phase 2 clinical trial was initiated in doxorubicin-naïve patients with ASTS. This Phase 2 clinical trial enrolled 22\npatients and was completed in August 2016. Camsirubicin was administered intravenously at 265 mg/m2 every 3 weeks for up to 16 doses, with all patients being given growth\nfactor support, and there was clear indication of anticancer activity at this well-tolerated dose and schedule. The majority of patients (52.6%) evaluable for tumor progression\ndemonstrated clinical benefit (stable disease or partial response), which was proportional to dose and consistently observed at higher cumulative doses of camsirubicin (>1000\nmg/m2). The progression-free survival at 6 months was 38%, higher than the 6-month PFS of doxorubicin in three of the more recent studies, which showed 23%, 25%, and 33% 6-\nmonth PFS for doxorubicin. Camsirubicin was very well tolerated in this study and underscored the potential ability to administer camsirubicin without restriction for cumulative\ndose in patients with ASTS. Under compassionate use access, one patient received 20 cycles of camsirubicin (cumulative dose 5,300 mg/m2). Apart from one patient who\ndeveloped febrile neutropenia and severe leukopenia, there were no grade 4 toxicities reported and no grade 3 side effects other than anemia. A transient decrease in left ventricular\nejection fraction (“LVEF”) was observed in four patients treated with camsirubicin. These decreases in LVEF in camsirubicin treated patients were not serious adverse events and\nwere transient, with LVEF subsequently returning to normal levels in all four subjects. Despite some subjects in this study receiving camsirubicin for up to 20 cycles, effects on\ncardiac function were of no clinical significance and there was no evidence of irreversible heart failure in any subject.\nBased on the previous clinical results, in September 2021, we commenced an open-label, Phase 1b dose escalation trial of camsirubicin plus growth factor support\n(pegfilgrastim/G-CSF) in the U.S. as first-line treatment for patients with ASTS. The aim is to administer camsirubicin without restricting cumulative dose, thereby potentially\nimproving efficacy by keeping patients who are responding on treatment. These are patients who are not candidates for surgery or radiation treatment, and are largely made up of\npatients with metastatic disease. Doxorubicin is the current standard of care in the first-line setting for these patients. Although this Phase 1b is designed to determine the maximum\ntolerated dose of camsirubicin, given the historical dose-dependent anti-tumor response repeatedly demonstrated with doxorubicin, efficacy measurements are being tracked in these\npatients as the dose is increased. We are presently enrolling patients at the fifth dose level. The fifth dose level is over twice the highest dose reached in any prior camsirubicin\nclinical trial (650 mg/m2 versus 265 mg/m2).\nMNPR-202 and Related Analogs\nIn June 2021, we entered into a collaboration agreement with the Cancer Science Institute of Singapore (“CSI Singapore”), one of Asia’s premier cancer research centers, at\nthe National University of Singapore (“NUS”) (consistently ranked as one of the world’s top universities) to evaluate the activity of MNPR-202 and related analogs in multiple\ntypes of cancer. MNPR-202 was designed to retain the same potentially non-cardiotoxic backbone as camsirubicin but is modified at other positions which may enable it to work in\ncertain cancers that are resistant to camsirubicin and doxorubicin. In December 2020, we announced the issuance of our composition of matter U.S. patent (US10,450,340) covering\nMNPR-202 and related analogs. CSI Singapore has tested MNPR-202 in preclinical cancer models with promising results.\nLicense, Development and Collaboration Agreements\nXOMA Ltd.\nTo humanize our MNPR-101 antibody, we have taken a non-exclusive license to XOMA (US) LLC’s humanization technology and know-how. Humanization involves\nreplacing most of the non-critical parts of the mouse sequence of an antibody with the human sequence to minimize the ability of the human immune system to recognize this\nantibody as foreign. As such, MNPR-101 has been engineered to be 95% human sequence using the XOMA technology. Under the terms of the non-exclusive license with XOMA\nLtd., we are to pay only upon clinical, regulatory and sales milestones which could reach up to $14.925 million if we achieve all milestones. The agreement does not require the\npayment of sales royalties. There can be no assurance that we will reach any milestones. As of March 8, 2024, we had not reached any milestones and had not been required to pay\nXOMA Ltd. any funds under this license agreement. The first milestone payment is payable upon first dosing of a human patient in a Phase 2 clinical trial.\nOnxeo S.A.\nIn June 2016, we executed an agreement with Onxeo S.A., a French public company, which gave us the exclusive option to license (on a world-wide exclusive basis)\nValidive (clonidine hydrocholoride mucobuccal tablet; clonidine HCI MBT) a mucoadhesive tablet of clonidine based on the Lauriad mucoadhesive technology. The agreement\nincluded clinical, regulatory, developmental and sales milestones and escalating royalties on net sales. In September 2017, we exercised the option to license Validive from Onxeo\nfor $1 million. On March 27, 2023, we discontinued our Validive Phase 2b/3 VOICE trial based upon our Data Safety Monitoring Board’s determination that the trial did not meet\nthe pre-defined threshold for efficacy of a 15% absolute difference in severe oral mucositis prevention between Validive and placebo. We have not incurred any license or royalty\nobligations and the license has been terminated effective January 2024.\n12\nTable of Contents\nIntellectual Property Portfolio and Exclusivity\nAn important part of our strategy is obtaining patent protection to help preserve the proprietary nature of our product candidates, and to prevent others from developing\ncompetitive agents that are similar. Our patent portfolio includes issued patents and pending patent applications in the U.S. and in foreign countries. Our general practice is to seek\npatent protection in major markets worldwide.\nMNPR-101\nOur patent portfolio for our MNPR-101 antibody (huATN-658), as well as its epitope, consists of two issued U.S. composition of matter and their methods of use patents\nand corresponding (granted and pending) patents and patent applications in multiple foreign jurisdictions, including the European Union, Japan, and other Asian countries. These\npatents are owned by us. The patents covering the composition of matter of MNPR-101 will expire in 2025 and the patents covering the MNPR-101 epitope will expire in 2027.\nBeing a novel biologic, it is eligible for 12 years of exclusivity in the U.S. under the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act (“BPCI Act”), and it will benefit from varying\ndurations of similar exclusivity in numerous other countries. The Radio-Immuno-Therapeutic derivative of MNPR-101 (\"uPRIT\") patent, if granted expires in 2041.\nPatent life determination depends on the date of filing of the application and other factors as promulgated under the patent laws. In most countries, including the U.S., the\npatent term is generally 20 years from the earliest claimed filing date (the priority date) of a non-provisional patent application in the applicable country, not taking into\nconsideration any potential patent term adjustment that may be filed in the future or any regulatory extensions that may be obtained. Some of our patents are currently near\nexpiration and we may pursue patent term extensions for these where appropriate or to let patents lapse. See “Risk Factors – Risks Related to our Intellectual Property”.\nMNPR-101 for Radiopharmaceutical Use\nIn collaboration with NorthStar, we filed a provisional patent application entitled “Precision Radioimmunotherapeutic Targeting of the Urokinase Plasminogen Activator\nReceptor (uPAR) for Treatment of Severe COVID-19 Disease” with the USPTO on June 15, 2020. A full international application (International Application Number\nPCT/US2021/037416) that claims priority to the provisional filing date was filed under the Patent Cooperation Treaty (“PCT”) on June 15, 2021. This application covers novel\ncompositions and uses of cytotoxic radioisotopes attached to antibodies that bind to uPAR, thereby creating precision targeted radiotherapeutics, also known as uPRITs, for the\ntreatment of severe COVID-19 and other respiratory diseases.\nIn May 2021, we and NorthStar filed a provisional patent application with the USPTO titled “Bio-Targeted Radiopharmaceutical Compositions Containing Ac-225 and\nMethods of Preparation.” Radiopharmaceutical therapy is a promising approach to treat cancer and other diseases using radioactive isotopes bound with proteins/antibodies to target\nand kill cells. If validated through further evaluation, it could potentially improve efficacy and safety and enhance manufacturing efficiency of actinium-based\nradiopharmaceuticals, the full potential of which are presently constrained by the price and scarcity of Ac-225.\nAlso in May 2021, we and NorthStar filed a provisional composition of matter patent application titled “Urokinase Plasminogen Activator Receptor-Targeted\nRadiopharmaceutical” covering a radiotherapeutic consisting of our proprietary antibody MNPR-101 bound to Ac-225 via the isotope binding agent PCTA. This RIT demonstrated\n98% radiochemical purity and high stability and has the potential to be a highly selective, potent treatment for a variety of cancers, severe COVID-19, and other diseases\ncharacterized by aberrant uPAR expression.\n13\nTable of Contents\nCamsirubicin\nCamsirubicin (GPX-150) is covered by manufacturing process patents. We have a patent for chemical synthesis technology that efficiently converts cardiotoxic “13-keto”\nanthracyclines such as doxorubicin, daunorubicin, epirubicin, and idarubicin into novel, patentable, and potentially less-cardiotoxic “5-imino-13-deoxy” analogs. A novel chemical\ncomposition of an intermediate for this synthesis is also patented. In addition, we have a patent covering the combination of camsirubicin with paclitaxel for the treatment of cancer,\nplus covering the method of use of these two drugs for this purpose. Our camsirubicin patent portfolio contains eight issued U.S. patents (two of which have expired) and one U.S.\npending patent application. We have certain corresponding patents and applications in twenty-nine foreign jurisdictions, including the U.S., EU, Japan, and other Asian countries.\nThe process patents for the synthesis of camsirubicin intermediates will expire in 2024 and the patents covering the combination use of camsirubicin and its analogs with taxanes\nwill expire in 2026. The patent covering novel, potentially more potent analogs of camsirubicin expires in 2038. We may pursue patent term extensions where appropriate or let\npatents lapse. We have obtained patent protection around the intermediates and process used to manufacture camsirubicin and we expect to obtain Hatch-Waxman exclusivity\n(applicable to new chemical entities) for 5 years that will prevent generic competition. We have also obtained U.S. and EU orphan drug status in soft tissue sarcoma.\nMNPR-202\nIn December 2020, we announced the issuance of a U.S. patent (US 10,450,340) covering compositions of matter (2-pyrrilino camsirubicin) for a novel family of\ncamsirubicin analogs. This patent, which expands the Company’s camsirubicin intellectual property portfolio, is expected to expire in 2038 not including any patent term\nextensions. The patent broadens our camsirubicin portfolio and creates a pipeline that has been designed to retain the potentially favorable non-cardiotoxic chemical backbone of\ncamsirubicin and the potent broad-spectrum antitumor activity of doxorubicin. Further, preclinical evidence suggests that this new family of 2-pyrrilino camsirubicin analogs could\nbe active in doxorubicin-resistant tumor cells which may enable use in cancer types beyond those possible with camsirubicin.\nManufacturing\nWe do not currently own or operate manufacturing facilities for the production or testing of MNPR-101 radiopharmaceutical program, camsirubicin, or MNPR-202, nor do\nwe have plans to develop our own manufacturing operations in the foreseeable future. We presently depend on third-party contract manufacturers for all our required raw materials,\nActive Pharmaceutical Ingredients (“API”), and finished drug products for our preclinical and clinical studies. We are having clinical batches of MNPR-101-Zr manufactured in\npreparation for treating patients in our Phase 1 radiopharma program in advanced cancers. Also, we have completed manufacturing of the clinical batches of drug product for\ncamsirubicin which are being used in our ongoing Phase 1b dose-escalation camsirubicin clinical trial.\nOncology Market Competition\nThe pharmaceutical industry in general, and the oncology therapeutics sector in particular, are characterized by intense competition. We face competition from\npharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, many of which are larger and better financed than us. We also face competition in our efforts to develop and commercialize new\noncology therapeutics from academic and government laboratories. The therapeutics that we are developing, if successfully commercialized, will have to compete with existing\ntherapeutics already on the market and novel therapeutics currently in development, as well as new therapeutics that may be discovered and developed in the future. Our product\ncandidates will also have to compete with alternate treatment modalities, such as improvements in radiation treatments, which are also subject to continual innovation and\nimprovement. Additional information can be found in the section entitled “Risk Factors – Risks Related to Our Business Operations and Industry.”\n14\nTable of Contents\nMNPR-101 Radiopharmaceutical Program Competition\nOur MNPR-101 radiopharmaceutical program, including MNPR-101-Zr and MNPR-101 conjugated to therapeutic radioisotopes, is susceptible to all of the competitive\nfactors listed in the first paragraph of this section on Oncology Market Competition. In addition to the current standard of care for patients with advanced cancers, we consider our\nmost direct competitors to be companies that are developing targeted radiopharmaceuticals for the treatment of cancer. There are several companies that are developing\nradiopharmaceuticals for cancers including, but not limited to: Bayer AG, Bristol Myers Squibb, Eli Lilly and Company, Novartis AG, Actinium Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Johnson &\nJohnson, Telix Pharmaceuticals Limited, Lantheus Holdings, Inc. and Genentech, as well as several early-stage companies that are developing a wide range of targeted\nradiopharmaceuticals for advanced cancers. For the uPAR-targeted radiopharmaceuticals, CuraSight, a Danish biotech company, is currently developing a non-antibody-based\nuPAR radiodiagnostic and radiotherapeutic pair which binds to a different epitope on uPAR as compared to MNPR-101.\nCamsirubicin Competition\nWe believe our camsirubicin program, if approved, could replace doxorubicin as the first-line treatment for ASTS. In addition, we believe that camsirubicin would compete\nwith a number of currently available anthracycline-based drugs on the market for other cancer indications. These are largely derivatives of doxorubicin, or reformulations of\ndoxorubicin such as liposomal doxorubicin (e.g., Doxil, sold by Johnson & Johnson). All of these have the issue of cardiotoxicity. In addition to approved products, there are a\nnumber of product candidates in development, largely as new formulations or derivatives of doxorubicin.\nMNPR-202 Competition\nOur MNPR-202 program is in the early stages of development and as such is the most susceptible to all of the competitive factors listed in the first paragraph of this section\non Oncology Market Competition.\nGovernment Regulation and Product Approval\nGovernment authorities in the U.S., at the federal, state and local level, and in other countries such as Australia, extensively regulate, among other things, the research,\ndevelopment, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, post-approval monitoring and\nreporting, marketing and export and import of products such as those we are developing. The pharmaceutical product candidates that we develop must be approved by the U.S.\nFood and Drug Administration (\"FDA\") and the Therapeutics Goods Administration (\"TGA\") before they may be legally marketed in the U.S. and Australia, respectively. See “Risk\nFactors – Risks Related to Clinical Development and Regulatory Approval”.\nRegulatory Framework in Australia\nThe Therapeutic Goods Administration, through the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989 and the Therapeutic Goods Regulations, is responsible for the efficacy, quality, safety and\ntimely availability of drugs and medical devices in Australia. The mission statement of the TGA is “To ensure the safety, quality and efficacy of therapeutic goods available in\nAustralia at a standard equal to that of comparable countries, and that premarket assessment of therapeutic goods is conducted within a reasonable time.\" The TGA administers two\npathways for clinical trials, the Clinical Trials Notification (\"CTN\") and Clinical Trials Approval (\"CTA\") schemes. These provide an avenue through which 'unapproved'\ntherapeutic goods may be lawfully supplied for use solely for experimental purposes in humans. The choice of which route to use (CTN or CTA) lies firstly with the Australian\nclinical trial sponsor and then with the Human Research Ethics Committee (\"HREC\") that approves the protocol.\n15\nTable of Contents\nClinical trials of medicines and biologicals typically proceed through 'phases' of development, which generally follow: Phase 1 (human pharmacology), Phase 2\n(therapeutic exploratory), and Phase 3 (therapeutic confirmatory). Phase 4 may be conducted for post-marketing surveillance or resolution of treatment uncertainties. Clinical\ndevelopment pathways are becoming less rigid with respect to phase and seamless adaptive trial designs and other cross-phase studies exist. Under the CTN and CTA schemes the\nuse of therapeutic goods in the trial must be in accordance with the Guideline for Good Clinical Practice, the National Statement and the protocol approved by the HREC\nresponsible for monitoring the conduct of the trial. The trial sponsor must also comply with the requirements of any other Commonwealth and/or state and territory legislation in\nrelation to clinical trials and the supply of therapeutic goods.\nA company or organization wishing to supply a therapeutic good in Australia must apply for market authorization from the TGA. The TGA assesses the application, and if\nmarket authorization is granted, the therapeutic good is entered on the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods (\"ARTG\"). The TGA uses three pathways to evaluate a prescription\nmedicine: the standard pathway, the priority review pathway and the provisional approval pathway. The TGA is required by statute to complete its evaluation for approval of a\nmedicine in the standard pathway within 255 working days. The priority review pathway has a target timeframe of 150 working days and allows for faster assessment of vital and\nlife-saving prescription medicines. Sponsors of promising new prescription medicines (with only preliminary clinical data available) can seek fast-tracked registration through the\nprovisional approval pathway. All pathways require evidence that medicines are made according to Good Manufacturing Practice (\"GMP\"). GMP describes principles and\nprocedures to ensure therapeutic goods are of high quality. The TGA inspects Australian (and some overseas) manufacturers to ensure compliance with GMP standards.\nThe evaluation and approval process of a new medicine in Australia generally follows:\n● Pre-submission: before submitting an application, potential sponsors should ensure that the proposed product meets the eligibility requirements for the assessed listed\nmedicines pathway. Applicants can arrange a free optional pre-submission meeting with the TGA prior to submitting the application for a new assessed listed\nmedicine;\n● Application submission: applications are created and lodged through TGA Business services;\n● Preliminary assessment: The TGA will conduct a preliminary assessment of the application to determine whether it meets the administrative requirements and basic\ntechnical eligibility requirements to proceed to evaluation;\n● Evaluation and requests for information: Once an application has passed preliminary assessment and the evaluation fee has been paid, the application enters the\nevaluation phase. During this phase, the TGA assesses the application, reviews any responses to requests for information, and documents the findings. The TGA may\ndecide to seek advice from an expert advisory committee, such as the Advisory Committee for Complementary Medicines (ACCM);\n● The decision: When making the decision under section 26AE of the Therapeutics Goods Act (1989) on whether to list the medicine in the ARTG, the decision maker\n(the delegate of the Secretary of the Department of Health) will review all documentation associated with the application, including the dossier, evaluation reports,\nresponses to requests for information, and advice from expert advisory committees;\n● Finalization: Sponsors need to provide a patent certificate under subsection 26B(1) of the act, or notification that this is not required before the medicine can be listed\nin the ARTG;\n● Conduct post-marketing requirements, if any: a drug may be selected for a post-market compliance review at any time. The TGA will check the assessed listed\nmedicine's compliance against the regulatory requirements that are self-certified by the sponsor.\n16\nTable of Contents\nTherapeutic goods generally need to be entered on the ARTG before they can be sold in Australia. However, there are a number of ways that patients can gain access to\nproducts that have not been approved for use in Australia:\n● The Special Access Scheme (\"SAS\") allows a health practitioner to access an unapproved therapeutic good for an individual patient on a case-by-case basis;\n● Medical professionals can apply to the TGA to become an ‘Authorised Prescriber’ of a specific unapproved good to specific patients with a particular medical\ncondition. In some instances, doctors also need to have their application approved by a human research ethics committee or endorsed by a specialist college;\n● Depending on the level of risk involved, a sponsor of a clinical trial can make either a notification or application to the TGA to use an unapproved good in the trial;\n● Under the Personal Importation Scheme, individuals can legally import a three-month supply of some unapproved therapeutic goods for personal use, without TGA\napproval. A prescription from an Australian-registered medical practitioner is required for S4 and S8 medicines;\n● If a medicine included in the ARTG is in short supply, the Secretary (or delegate) can approve the import and supply of a substitute medicine that is not on the ARTG.\nIn some instances, pharmacists are allowed to substitute medicines, including different strengths or forms of a product, without a prescribing doctor’s approval where\na medicine is unavailable.\nU.S. Pharmaceutical Product Development Process\nIn the U.S., the FDA regulates pharmaceutical products under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”) and implementing regulations. Pharmaceutical products\nare also subject to other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal,\nstate, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any\ntime during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial enforcement. FDA enforcement could result\nin refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, a clinical hold, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or\ndistribution injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement or civil or criminal penalties. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on us. The process required by the FDA before a non-biological pharmaceutical product may be marketed in the U.S. generally involves the following:\n● Completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies according to Good Laboratory Practices (“GLP”), and other applicable regulations;\n● Submission to the FDA of an Investigational New Drug application (“IND”), which must become effective before human clinical studies may begin;\n● Performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical studies according to the FDA’s current Good Clinical Practices (“GCP”), to establish the safety, efficacy\nand optimum dose of the proposed pharmaceutical product for its intended use;\n● Submission to the FDA of a New Drug Application (“NDA”) or Biologics License Application (“BLA”), for a new pharmaceutical product;\n● Satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the pharmaceutical product is produced to assess compliance with the\nFDA’s current Good Manufacturing Practice standards (“cGMP”), to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the pharmaceutical\nproduct’s identity, strength, quality and purity;\n● FDA audits of the preclinical and clinical study sites that generated the data in support of the NDA or BLA;\n● FDA review and approval of the NDA; and\n● Fulfillment of FDA post-marketing requirements, if any.\n17\nTable of Contents\nThe lengthy process of seeking required approvals and the continuing need for compliance with applicable statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial\nresources, and approvals are inherently uncertain.\nBefore testing any compounds with potential therapeutic value in humans, the pharmaceutical product candidate enters the preclinical testing stage. Preclinical tests include\nlaboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as in-vitro and animal studies to assess the potential safety and activity of the pharmaceutical product\ncandidate. These early proof-of-principle studies are done using sound scientific procedures and thorough documentation. The conduct of single and repeat dose toxicology and\ntoxicokinetic studies in animals must comply with federal regulations and requirements including GLP. The sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with\nmanufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and a proposed clinical protocol, to the FDA as part of the IND. The IND automatically becomes\neffective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA has concerns and notifies the sponsor. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding\nconcerns before the clinical study can begin. If resolution cannot be reached within the 30-day review period, either the FDA places the IND on clinical hold, or the sponsor\nwithdraws the application. The FDA may also impose clinical holds on a pharmaceutical product candidate at any time before or during clinical studies due to safety concerns or\nnon-compliance. Accordingly, it is not certain that submission of an IND will result in the FDA allowing clinical studies to begin, or that, once begun, issues will not arise that\nsuspend or terminate such clinical studies.\nDuring the development of a new drug, sponsors are given opportunities to meet with the FDA at certain points. These points may be prior to submission of an IND, at the\nend of Phase 2, and before an NDA or BLA is submitted. Meetings at other times may be requested. These meetings can provide an opportunity for the sponsor to share information\nabout the data gathered to date, for the sponsor to ask specific questions to the FDA, for the FDA to provide advice, and for the sponsor and FDA to reach agreement on the next\nphase of development. Sponsors typically use the end of Phase 2 meeting to discuss their Phase 2 clinical results and present their plans for the pivotal Phase 3 clinical (registration)\ntrial(s) that they believe will support approval of the new drug. A sponsor may be able to request a Special Protocol Assessment (“SPA”), the purpose of which is to reach agreement\nwith the FDA on the Phase 3 clinical trial protocol design and analyses that will form the primary basis of an efficacy claim.\nAccording to FDA guidance for industry on the SPA process, a sponsor which meets the prerequisites may make a specific request for a SPA and provide information\nregarding the design and size of the proposed clinical trial. The FDA’s goal is to evaluate the protocol within 45 days of the request to assess whether the proposed trial is adequate,\nand that evaluation may result in discussions and a request for additional information. A SPA request must be made before the proposed trial begins, and all open issues must be\nresolved before the trial begins. If a written agreement is reached, it will be documented and made part of the IND record. The agreement will be binding on the FDA and may not\nbe changed by the sponsor or the FDA after the trial begins except with the written agreement of the sponsor and the FDA or if the FDA determines that a substantial scientific issue\nessential to determining the safety or efficacy of the drug was identified after the testing began.\nClinical studies involve the administration of the pharmaceutical product candidate to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of qualified investigators,\ngenerally physicians not employed by or under the clinical study sponsor’s control. Clinical studies are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of\nthe clinical study, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria, how the results will be analyzed and presented and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety.\nEach protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Clinical studies must be conducted in accordance with Good Clinical Practice (“GCP”) guidelines. Further, each\nclinical study must be reviewed and approved by an independent institutional review board (“IRB”), at, or servicing, each institution at which the clinical study will be conducted.\nAn IRB is charged with protecting the welfare and rights of study participants and is tasked with considering such items as whether the risks to individuals participating in the\nclinical studies are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the informed consent form that must be provided to each clinical study\nsubject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical study until completed.\n18\nTable of Contents\nHuman clinical studies are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined:\n● Phase 1. The pharmaceutical product is initially introduced into healthy human subjects and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution\nand excretion.\n● Phase 2. The pharmaceutical product is evaluated in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the\nefficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases, to determine dosage tolerance, optimal dosage and dosing schedule and to identify patient populations with\nspecific characteristics where the pharmaceutical product may be more effective.\n● Phase 3. Clinical studies are undertaken to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy and safety in an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical\nstudy sites. These clinical studies are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the product and provide an adequate basis for product labeling. The studies\nmust be well-controlled and usually include a control arm for comparison. One or two Phase 3 studies are required by the FDA for an NDA or BLA approval,\ndepending on the disease severity and other available treatment options.\n● Post-approval studies, or Phase 4 clinical studies, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These studies are used to gain additional experience from the\ntreatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication.\n● Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical studies must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and written IND safety reports must be submitted to the\nFDA and the investigators for serious and unexpected adverse events or any finding from tests in laboratory animals that suggests a significant risk for human\nsubjects. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical studies may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. The FDA or the sponsor or its data\nsafety monitoring board may suspend a clinical study at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an\nunacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical study at its institution if the clinical study is not being conducted in\naccordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the pharmaceutical product has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.\nConcurrent with clinical studies, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical\ncharacteristics of the pharmaceutical product as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The\nmanufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the pharmaceutical product candidate and, among other things, must develop methods for\ntesting the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final pharmaceutical product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be\nconducted to demonstrate that the pharmaceutical product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.\nU.S. Review and Approval Processes\nThe results of product development, preclinical studies and clinical studies, along with descriptions of the manufacturing process, analytical tests conducted on the\nchemistry of the pharmaceutical product, proposed labeling and other relevant information are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA or BLA requesting approval to market the\nproduct. The submission of an NDA or BLA is subject to the payment of substantial user fees; a waiver of such fees may be obtained under certain limited circumstances.\n19\nTable of Contents\nIn addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act (“PREA”), an NDA, BLA or a supplement thereof must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the\npharmaceutical product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the\nproduct is safe and effective. The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of data or full or partial waivers. Unless otherwise required by regulation, PREA does not apply to any\npharmaceutical product for an indication for which orphan designation has been granted.\nThe FDA reviews all NDAs and BLAs submitted before it accepts them for filing and may request additional information rather than accepting an NDA or BLA for filing.\nOnce the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review of the NDA or BLA. Under the goals and policies agreed to by the FDA under the Prescription Drug\nUser Fee Act (“PDUFA”), the FDA has 10 months in which to complete its initial review of a standard NDA or BLA and respond to the applicant, and six months for a priority\nNDA or BLA. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates for standard and priority NDAs or BLAs. The review process and the PDUFA goal date may be extended by\nthree months if the FDA requests or if the NDA or BLA sponsor otherwise provides additional information or clarification regarding information already provided in the submission\nwithin the last three months before the PDUFA goal date.\nAfter the NDA or BLA submission is accepted for filing, the FDA reviews the NDA or BLA application to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is\nsafe and effective for its intended use, and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP to assure and preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality and\npurity. The FDA may refer applications for novel pharmaceutical products or pharmaceutical products which present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory\ncommittee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under\nwhat conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. During the\npharmaceutical product approval process, the FDA also will determine whether a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (“REMS”), is necessary to assure the safe use of the\npharmaceutical product. If the FDA concludes that a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the NDA or BLA must submit a proposed REMS; the FDA will not approve the NDA or BLA\nwithout a REMS, if required.\nBefore approving an NDA or BLA, the FDA will inspect the facilities at which the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that\nthe manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications.\nAdditionally, before approving an NDA or BLA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites as well as the site where the pharmaceutical product is manufactured to\nassure compliance with GCP and cGMP. If the FDA determines the application, manufacturing process or manufacturing facilities are not acceptable, it will outline the deficiencies\nin the submission and often will request additional testing or information. In addition, the FDA will require the review and approval of product labeling.\nThe NDA and BLA review and approval process is lengthy and difficult and the FDA may refuse to approve an NDA or BLA if the applicable regulatory criteria are not\nsatisfied or may require additional clinical data or other data and information. Even if such data and information are submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA or\nBLA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. Data obtained from clinical studies are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than the sponsor interprets\nthe same data. The FDA will issue a complete response letter if the agency decides not to approve the NDA or BLA. The complete response letter usually describes all of the\nspecific deficiencies in the NDA or BLA identified by the FDA. The deficiencies identified may be minor, for example, requiring labeling changes, or major, for example, requiring\nadditional clinical studies. Additionally, the complete response letter may include recommended actions that the applicant might take to place the application in a condition for\napproval. If a complete response letter is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the NDA or BLA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the\napplication.\n20\nTable of Contents\nIf a product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited,\nwhich could restrict the commercial value of the product. Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling.\nIn addition, the FDA may require Phase 4 testing which involves clinical studies designed to further assess pharmaceutical product safety and effectiveness and may require testing\nand surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized.\nOther International Regulation\nIn addition to regulations in the U.S. and Australia, there are a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical studies and commercial sales and distribution of our future\nproduct candidates. Whether or not FDA or HREC approval is obtained for a product, approval of a product must be obtained by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign\ncountries before clinical studies or marketing of the product can commence in those countries. The approval process varies from country to country, and the time may be longer or\nshorter than that required for FDA or HREC approval. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical studies, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from\ncountry to country. In addition, certain regulatory authorities in select countries may require us to repeat previously conducted preclinical and/or clinical studies under specific\ncriteria for approval in their respective country which may delay and/or greatly increase the cost of approval in certain markets targeted for approval by us.\nUnder E.U. regulatory systems, marketing applications for pharmaceutical products are typically submitted under a centralized procedure to the EMA. The centralized\nprocedure provides for the granting of a single marketing authorization that is valid for all E.U. member states. The EMA also has designations for Orphan Drugs, which, if\napplicable, can provide for faster review, lower fees and more access to advice during drug development. While the marketing authorization in the European Union is centralized,\nthe system for clinical studies (application, review and requirements) is handled by each individual country. Approval to run a clinical study in one country does not guarantee\napproval in any other country. The pharmaceutical industry in Canada is regulated by Health Canada. A New Drug Submission (“NDS”) is the equivalent of a U.S. NDA and must\nbe filed to obtain approval to market a pharmaceutical product in Canada. Marketing regulations and reimbursement are subject to national and provincial laws. In Japan,\napplications for approval to manufacture and market new drugs must be approved by the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare. Nonclinical and clinical studies must meet the\nrequirements of Japanese laws. Results from clinical studies conducted outside of Japan must be supplemented with at least a bridging clinical study conducted in Japanese patients.\nIn addition to regulations in Europe, Canada, Japan, Australia and the U.S., there are a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical studies, commercial distribution\nand reimbursement of future product candidates which we may be subject to as we pursue regulatory approval of the MNPR-101 radiopharmaceutical program, camsirubicin, or any\nfuture product candidates internationally.\n21\nTable of Contents\nCompliance with Environmental Laws\nSince we do not have our own laboratory or manufacturing facilities, we do not estimate any annual costs of compliance with environmental laws.\nEmployees\nOur operations are currently managed by five individuals (including our executive chairman and our Acting Chief Medical Officer), of whom two have a PhD, two have an\nMD, two have an MBA, one has an MSc in health economics and policy, one has an MS from Stanford University, and one is a former CPA. They have worked at industry leading\ncompanies such as BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc., Raptor Pharmaceuticals, and Onyx Pharmaceuticals. As of March 8, 2024, we had ten employees; nine of whom were full-time.\nWe anticipate hiring additional employees in clinical operations, regulatory affairs and other departments, to help manage our clinical studies, regulatory submissions, and\nmanufacturing to support the MNPR-101 program and camsirubicin development, business development and corporate strategy. In addition, to complement our internal expertise,\nwe have contracts with medical and scientific consultants, manufacturers, laboratories, and contract research organizations that specialize in various aspects of drug development\nincluding clinical development, preclinical development, manufacturing, quality assurance, and regulatory affairs.\nCorporate Information\nWe were formed as a Delaware limited liability company in December 2014, with the name Monopar Therapeutics, LLC. In December 2015, we converted to a Delaware C\ncorporation. Our principal executive offices are located at 1000 Skokie Blvd, Suite 350, Wilmette, IL 60091. Our telephone number is (847) 388-0349.

Risk Factors\nRISK FACTORS\nAn investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. A prospective investor should carefully consider the following information about these risks, together\nwith other information appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, before deciding to invest in our common stock. The occurrence of any of the following risks could\nhave a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects and prospective investors could lose all or part of their investment. The\nrisk factors discussed below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are not exhaustive; other significant risks may exist that are not identified in this Annual Report on\nForm 10-K, but that might still materially and adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition, and results of operations were any of such risks to occur.\nRisks Related to Our Financial Condition and Capital Requirements\nWe have a limited operating history, expect to incur significant operating losses, and have a high risk of never being profitable.\nWe commenced operations in December 2014 and have an operating history of approximately nine years. Therefore, there is limited historical financial or operational\ninformation upon which to evaluate our performance. Our prospects must be considered in light of the uncertainties, risks, expenses, and difficulties frequently encountered by\ncompanies in their early clinical stages of operations. Many, if not most, companies in our industry at our stage of development never become profitable and are acquired, merge,\nsell major product assets or go out of business before successfully developing any product that generates revenue from commercial sales and enables profitability.\nFrom inception in December 2014 through December 31, 2023, we have incurred losses of approximately $60.2 million, which includes $13.5 million of non-cash in-\nprocess research and development, which was incurred in connection with our 2017 acquisition of camsirubicin. We expect to continue to incur substantial operating losses over the\nnext several years for the clinical development of our current and future licensed or purchased product candidates and will continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future. We\nexpect that our R&D and G&A expenses will increase to enable the execution of our strategic plan. As a result, we anticipate that we will seek to raise additional capital within the\nnext 12 months to fund our future operations. We will seek to obtain needed capital through a combination of equity offerings, including at-the-market sales programs, debt\nfinancings, strategic collaborations and grant funding. To date, we have funded our operations through net proceeds from the initial public offering of our common stock, net\nproceeds from sales of our common stock through at-the-market sales programs, private placements of our preferred and common stock, and the net receipt of funds related to our\nacquisition of camsirubicin and related assets.\nThe amount of future losses and when, if ever, we will become profitable are uncertain. We do not have any products that have generated revenues from commercial sales,\nand do not expect to generate revenues from the commercial sale of products in the near future, if ever. Our ability to generate revenue and achieve profitability will depend on,\namong other things, successful completion of the development of our product candidates; obtaining necessary regulatory approvals from the FDA and international regulatory\nagencies; establishing manufacturing/quality, sales, and marketing and distribution arrangements with third parties; obtaining adequate reimbursement by third-party payers; and\nraising sufficient funds to finance our activities. If we are unsuccessful at some or all of these undertakings, our business, financial condition, and results of operations are expected\nto be materially and adversely affected.\n23\nTable of Contents\nWe will need to raise substantial additional funding or find one or more suitable pharmaceutical partners to continue to advance our clinical programs and support our\npreclinical activities.\nIn order to be commercially viable, we must successfully research, develop, test, obtain regulatory approval for, manufacture, introduce, market and distribute some or all\nMNPR-101-Zr, MNPR-101 RIT, camsirubicin, and MNPR-202, and, if applicable, any other product candidates we may develop. The estimated required capital and time-frames\nnecessary to achieve these developmental milestones as described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K or as we may state from time to time are subject to inherent risks, which are\nbeyond our control. Clinical development of MNPR-101-Zr, MNPR-101 RIT, camsirubicin and MNPR-202 will require significant funds. Proceeds to-date from the sales of our\ncommon stock we believe could be sufficient for us to complete our planned Phase 1 dosimetry trial of MNPR-101-Zr, continued development of MNPR-101-RIT and the ongoing\nopen-label Phase 1b camsirubicin clinical trial, but will not be sufficient for us to support additional clinical development of MNPR-101 for radiopharmaceutical use in advanced\ncancers and camsirubicin clinical development beyond Phase 1b. To complete the MNPR-101 radiopharmaceutical and camsirubicin clinical programs we will need to raise\nadditional funding in the tens of millions of dollars. Therefore, we will need to raise significant additional funds or find a suitable pharmaceutical partner within the next 12\nmonths to support our current and any future product candidates through completion of clinical trials, approval processes and, if applicable, commercialization. If we are able to\nraise financing, it may be on terms that are unfavorable to us and if we are unable to raise sufficient funds or find a suitable pharmaceutical partner, we may have to discontinue or\ndelay clinical development of our current or future product candidates.\nThe Russia-Ukraine war and/or the Israel-Hamas war will likely have continuing global effects on fuel costs and shipping and broader impacts on economic, trade and\nfinancial market conditions, which could delay the shipping of supplies for our clinical material manufacturing, potentially resulting in increased manufacturing expenses,\ndelays to our clinical programs and adverse effects on our financing activities and financial condition.\nThe Russia-Ukraine war and the Israel-Hamas war are volatile situations, resulting in financial services and banking instability in the respective regions. The U.S. and other\ncountries’ sanctions against Russia and Russian entities, together with existing inflationary conditions and supply chain challenges arising in the wake of the Israel-Hamas war, are\naffecting fuel costs and shipping, resulting in higher costs and delays for various types of supplies. These cost increases and delays may affect our clinical material manufacturing\nwhich will likely have an adverse effect on our financial condition. In addition, at this stage, we are unable to predict whether the wars and resulting instability will have broader\nadverse impacts to European, U.S. or global economic, trade and financial market conditions, which could adversely affect our operations and financial condition in a variety of\nways. In particular, financial market instability or volatility may make it more difficult to raise required financing.\nIf we continue to incur operating losses and fail to obtain the capital necessary to fund our operations, we will be unable to advance our development programs, complete our\nclinical trials, or bring products to market, or may be forced to reduce or cease operations entirely. In addition, any capital obtained by us may be obtained on terms that are\nunfavorable to us, our investors, or both.\n24\nTable of Contents\nWhile we believe adequate cash is currently available to operate at least through June 30, 2025, developing a new drug and conducting clinical trials and the regulatory\nreview processes for one or more disease indications involves substantial costs. We have projected cash requirements for the near term based on a variety of assumptions, but some\nor all of such assumptions are likely to be incorrect and/or incomplete, possibly materially in an adverse direction. Our actual cash needs may deviate materially from those\nprojections, changes in market conditions or other factors may increase our cash requirements, or we may not be successful even in raising the amount of cash we currently project\nwill be required for the near term. We will need to raise additional capital in the future; the amount of additional capital needed will vary as a result of a number of factors, including\nwithout limitation the following:\n● receiving less funding than we require;\n● higher than expected costs to manufacture and ship our active pharmaceutical ingredient, radioisotopes, and our product candidates;\n● higher than expected costs for preclinical testing;\n● the cost and availability of radioisotopes such as Ac-225 or Zr-89, or any other medical isotope we may incorporate into our product candidates;\n● an increase in the number, size, duration, and/or complexity of our clinical trials;\n● slower than expected progress in developing our MNPR-101 radiopharmaceutical program, camsirubicin, and MNPR-202 or other product candidates, including\nwithout limitation, additional costs caused by program delays;\n● higher than expected costs associated with attempting to obtain regulatory approvals, including without limitation additional costs caused by additional regulatory\nrequirements or larger clinical trial requirements;\n● higher than expected personnel, consulting or other costs, such as adding personnel or industry expert consultants or pursuing the licensing/acquisition of additional\nassets; and\n● higher than expected costs to protect our intellectual property portfolio or otherwise pursue our intellectual property strategy.\nWhen we attempt to raise additional financing, there can be no assurance that we will be able to secure such additional financing in sufficient quantities or at all. We may\nbe unable to raise additional capital for reasons including, without limitation, our operational and/or financial performance, investor confidence in us and the biopharmaceutical\nindustry, credit availability from banks and other financial institutions, the status of current projects, and our prospects for obtaining any necessary regulatory approvals. General\neconomic and financial market conditions, which have recently been impacted by inflation, bank instability and other factors, can also adversely impact our ability to raise\nadditional financing. Potential investors’ capital investments may have shifted to other opportunities with perceived greater returns and/or lower risk, thereby reducing capital\navailable to us, if available at all.\nIn addition, any additional financing might not be available, and even if available, may not be available on terms acceptable to us or our then-existing investors. We will\nseek to raise funds through public or private equity offerings, including at-the-market sales programs, debt financings, corporate collaboration or licensing arrangements, mergers,\nacquisitions, sales of intellectual property, or other financing vehicles or arrangements. To the extent that we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities or other securities,\nour then-existing investors will experience dilution. If we raise funds through debt financings or bank loans, we may become subject to restrictive covenants, our assets may be\npledged as collateral for the debt, and the interests of our then-existing investors would be subordinated to the debt holders or banks. In addition, our use of and ability to exploit\nassets pledged as collateral for debt or loans may be restricted or forfeited. To the extent that we raise additional funds through collaboration or licensing arrangements, we may be\nrequired to relinquish significant rights (including without limitation intellectual property rights) to our technologies or product candidates, or grant licenses on terms that are not\nfavorable to us. If we are not able to raise needed funding under acceptable terms or at all, then we will have to reduce expenses, including the possible options of curtailing\noperations, abandoning opportunities, licensing or selling off assets, reducing costs to a point where clinical development or other progress is impaired, or ceasing operations\nentirely.\n25\nTable of Contents\nMarket variables, such as inflation of product costs, labor rates and fuel, freight and energy costs, as well as geopolitical events could likely cause us to suffer significant\nincreases in our operating and administrative expenses.\nIn the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Russia-Ukraine war, the Israel-Hamas war and other geopolitical factors, economic conditions have become strained, with\ninflation and supply chain challenges impacting businesses worldwide. These conditions affect fuel costs and shipping, resulting in higher costs and delays for various types of\nsupplies. These cost increases and delays may affect our clinical material manufacturing which will likely have an adverse effect on our financial condition. In addition, the effects\nof responses to inflationary conditions, such as significantly increased interest rates, on the economy and market conditions are difficult to predict. If U.S. or global economic, trade\nand financial market conditions continue to be challenged or volatile, or we do not effectively manage our response to these conditions, our operations and financial condition could\nbe adversely affected in a variety of ways.\nUnstable market and economic conditions may have serious adverse consequences on our ability to raise funds, which may cause us to delay, restructure or cease our\noperations.\nFrom time to time, global and domestic credit and financial markets have experienced extreme disruptions, including severely diminished liquidity and credit availability,\ndeclines in consumer confidence, declines in economic growth, increases in unemployment rates, and uncertainty about economic stability. Recently, COVID-19, the Russia-\nUkraine war and the Israel-Hamas war have created volatility and uncertainty. Recent instability in the banking industry has added to the volatility and uncertainty. Our financing\nstrategy will be adversely affected by any such economic downturn, volatile business environment and continued unpredictable and unstable market conditions. If the equity and\ncredit markets deteriorate, it may make a debt or equity financing more difficult to complete, costlier, and more dilutive. Failure to secure any necessary financing in a timely\nmanner and on favorable terms will have a material adverse effect on our business strategy and financial performance, and could require us to cease or delay our operations.\nOur operations and financial results could be adversely impacted by resurgences of COVID-19 or any future pandemics, which may negatively impact our ability to\nmanufacture our product candidates for our clinical trials, our ability to accrue and conduct our clinical trials, and may delay regulatory agency responses. Any such impact\nwill negatively impact our financial condition and could require us to delay our clinical development programs.\nIf there is a resurgence of COVID-19 or any future pandemics arise, we may experience disruptions that could severely impact our business, preclinical studies and clinical\ntrials, including:\n● Delays in receiving approval from the FDA, the TGA in Australia and other foreign regulatory authorities to initiate our planned clinical trials;\n● Delays or difficulties in enrolling and monitoring patients in our clinical trials;\n● Delays or difficulties in clinical site initiation, including difficulties in recruiting clinical site investigators and clinical site staff;\n● Delays in trial drug shipments due to vaccine shipments tying up available pharmaceutical product shipping lanes and increasing their cost;\n● Diversion of healthcare resources away from the conduct of clinical trials, including the diversion of hospitals serving as our clinical trial sites and hospital staff\nsupporting the conduct of our clinical trials;\n● Risk that participants enrolled in our clinical trials will acquire diseases while the clinical trial is ongoing, which could impact the results of the clinical trial,\nincluding by increasing the number of observed adverse events;\n26\nTable of Contents\n● Interruption of key clinical trial activities, such as clinical trial site data monitoring, due to limitations on travel imposed or recommended by federal or state\ngovernments, employers and others or interruption of clinical trial subject visits and study procedures, which may impact the integrity of subject data and clinical\nstudy endpoints;\n● Interruption or delays in the operations of the FDA, the TGA, and other foreign regulatory agencies, which may impact approval timelines;\n● Interruption of, or delays in receiving, supplies of our product candidates from our contract manufacturing organizations due to staffing or supply shortages,\nproduction slowdowns, global shipping delays or stoppages and disruptions in delivery systems;\n● Limitation on employee resources that would otherwise be focused on the conduct of our preclinical studies and clinical trials, including because of sickness of our\nemployees or their families or the desire of employees to avoid contact with large groups of people.\n● Refusal of the FDA, the TGA, and other foreign regulatory authorities to accept data from clinical trials in affected geographies; and\n● Impacts from prolonged remote work arrangements, such as increased cybersecurity risks.\nThe extent to which the long-term effects of COVID-19 or any future pandemics further impact our business, including our preclinical studies and clinical trials, results of\noperations and financial condition will depend on future developments which remain highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence.\nRisks Related to Clinical Development and Regulatory Approval\nRadiopharmaceuticals are a relatively novel approach to cancer imaging and treatment, which may create significant and potentially unpredictable challenges for it.\nOur future success depends on the successful development of our product candidates, including MNPR-101 for radiopharmaceutical use and any future\nradiopharmaceutical agent(s) that we may develop in-house, in-license or acquire, which are designed to image, identify or treat cancers by targeted delivery of radioisotopes to\ntumors. While radiation as a therapy for cancers has existed for decades, oncology treatment using systemic delivery of targeted radiopharmaceuticals in general is relatively\nnew. Only a few therapies utilizing systemic delivery of radioisotopes have been approved globally, and only a limited number of clinical trials of products based on radioisotope\ntherapies have been conducted. There are currently no approved therapies which use Ac-225, which we are exploring with MNPR-101. Global supply of Ac-225 is also currently\nlimited and may not be capable of expanding sufficiently to provide the amounts required at commercial scale. As such, it is difficult to accurately predict the developmental\nchallenges that the Company may incur for its product candidates as they proceed through product discovery or identification, preclinical studies and clinical trials, and, if approved,\ncommercialization. In addition, there may be long-term effects from radiopharmaceutical treatment, including late radiation toxicity, with any of the Company's current or future\nproduct radiopharmaceutical candidates that it cannot predict at this time. It is difficult for us to predict the time and cost of the development of our product candidates. Any of these\nfactors may prevent the Company from completing our preclinical and clinical trials that we may initiate, or from commercializing any product candidates we may develop on a\ntimely or profitable basis, if at all. In addition, the success of the Company's current and future radiopharmaceutical programs will depend on several factors, including the\nfollowing:\n● sourcing clinical and, if approved for commercialization, commercial supplies for the materials, such as radioisotopes, used to manufacture our product candidates;\n● sourcing or establishing manufacturing capabilities to produce adequate amounts of our product candidates;\n● securing reliable supply chain for our product candidates given that isotope half-life times are limited;\n● utilizing imaging agents to visualize tumor uptake in advance of administering our therapeutic candidates, which may increase the risk of adverse side effects;\n27\nTable of Contents\n● facilitating patient access to the limited number of facilities able to administer our product candidates;\n● using medicines to manage adverse side effects of our drug candidates that may not adequately control the side effects or that may have detrimental impacts on the\nefficacy of the treatment; and\n● establishing sales and marketing capabilities upon obtaining any regulatory approval to gain market acceptance of the Company's novel radiopharmaceutical imaging\nand therapeutics.\nThe lengthy process of seeking required approvals and the continuing need for compliance with applicable statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial\nresources, and approvals are inherently uncertain. If any of our radiopharmaceutical program product candidates are approved, their commercial success will depend upon\ncompetitive products, public perception of radioisotopes and the degree of their market acceptance by physicians, patients, healthcare payors and others in the medical community.\nAdverse events in clinical trials of our product candidates or in clinical trials of others developing radiopharmaceuticals or similar agents and the resulting negative\npublicity, as well as any other adverse events in the field of radiopharmaceuticals that may occur in the future, could result in a decrease in demand for our product candidates. Also,\nfuture success of our drug candidates, if approved will depend on gaining and maintaining acceptance by physicians, patients, third-party payors and other members of the medical\ncommunity as their being efficacious and cost-effective alternatives to competing products and treatments.\nDue to the radioactive nature of MNPR-101-Zr and MNPR-101 therapeutic agents, as well as our future radiopharmaceutical candidates, once manufactured, our drug\ncandidates will have time-limited stability, and as a result, we may encounter difficulties with fulfilment and logistics. If we or our manufacturers are unable to meet the challenges\nposed by the time-limitations inherent in the composition of our MNPR-101 radiopharmaceutical program or any of our future drug candidates, it would adversely affect our\nbusiness, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nWe expect our other radiopharmaceutical drug candidates to also have time-limited stability. As such, our drug candidates, including MNPR-101 radiopharmaceutical\nprogram, must be manufactured on an as-needed basis, and shipped almost immediately thereafter. Because our drug candidates, including our MNPR-101 radiopharmaceutical\nprogram, cannot be “stockpiled” and stored for even a small number of days ahead of shipment, we or any third-party manufacturer must be able to manufacture our drug\ncandidates on a rolling basis, and any kind of delays, even if seemingly insignificant, could result in an immediate and substantial impact on our ability to deliver the drug candidate\nto patients. Any significant delays in delivering drug candidates to patients could damage our reputation and result in deviations from our clinical trial protocols, which in turn could\naffect our ability to advance the preclinical and clinical development of our MNPR-101 radiopharmaceutical program or our other current and future radiopharmaceutical\ncandidates on a timely basis, or at all. We do not currently maintain a manufacturing facility, and therefore we currently rely on third-party manufacturers for the production of our\nMNPR-101 radiopharmaceutical program in connection with our ongoing studies. We cannot be sure that such manufacturers will be able to meet our demand for our\nradiopharmaceutical programs on a timely basis.\nIn addition, once manufactured, our MNPR-101 radiopharmaceutical program and future radiopharmaceutical drug candidates in the clinic must be quickly and safely\ntransported to the applicable clinical trial site. As we scale our operations and enroll larger clinical trials, and prepare for potential commercialization, we will need to scale our\nshipping capabilities. Labor disputes, government restrictions, work stoppages, pandemics, derailments, damage or loss events, adverse weather conditions, and other events beyond\nour control could interrupt or delay transportation, which could result in the damage to our MNPR-101 radiopharmaceutical program or any current or future drug candidate with\nsimilar shelf-life restrictions.\nIf we or our manufacturers are unable to meet the challenges posed by the time-limitations inherent in the composition of our MNPR-101 radiopharmaceutical program or\nany of our current or future drug candidates, it would adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nPerceptions of these challenges and risks in the market may adversely impact our stock price and our ability to successfully raise funding as we focus our preclinical and\nclinical efforts on our radiopharmaceutical program.\n28\nTable of Contents\nWe do not have and may never have any approved products on the market. Our business is highly dependent upon receiving approvals from various U.S., Australian, and\ninternational governmental agencies and will be severely harmed if we are not granted approval to manufacture and sell our product candidates.\nIn order for us to commercialize any treatment for cancer or any other disease indication, we must obtain regulatory approvals of such treatment for that indication.\nSatisfying regulatory requirements is an expensive process that takes many years and involves compliance with requirements covering research and development, testing,\nmanufacturing, quality control, labeling and promotion of drugs for human use. To obtain necessary regulatory approvals, we must, among other requirements, complete clinical\ntrials demonstrating that our products are safe and effective for a particular indication. There can be no assurance that our products will prove to be safe and effective, that our\nclinical trials will demonstrate the necessary safety and effectiveness of our product candidates, or that we will succeed in obtaining regulatory approval for any treatment we\ndevelop even if such safety and effectiveness are demonstrated.\nAny delays or difficulties we encounter in our clinical trials may delay or preclude regulatory approval from the FDA, or from international regulatory organizations. Any\ndelay or preclusion of regulatory approval would be expected to delay or preclude the commercialization of our products. Examples of delays or difficulties that we may encounter\nin our clinical trials include, without limitation. the following:\n● Clinical trials may not yield sufficiently conclusive results for regulatory agencies to approve the use of our products.\n● Our products may fail to be more effective than current therapies, or to be effective at all.\n● We may discover that our products have adverse side effects, which could cause our products to be delayed or precluded from receiving regulatory approval or reduce\nthe effective size of our target patient population or otherwise expose us to significant commercial and legal risks.\n● It may take longer than expected to determine whether or not a treatment is safe and effective.\n● Patients involved in our clinical trials may suffer severe adverse side effects even up to death, whether as a result of treatment with our products, the withholding of\nsuch treatment, or other reasons which may not include the effects of our treatment (whether within or outside of our control).\n● We may fail to be able to enroll a sufficient number of patients in our clinical trials to meet trial statistical plans and gain statistical significance, or it may take longer\nthan expected to enroll.\n● Patients enrolled in our clinical trials may not have the safety or efficacy characteristics necessary to obtain regulatory approval for a particular indication or patient\npopulation.\n● We may be unable to produce sufficient quantities of product to complete the clinical trials.\n● Even if we are successful in our clinical trials, required governmental approvals may still not be obtained or, if obtained, may not be maintained.\n● If approval for commercialization is granted, it is possible the authorized use will be more limited than is necessary for commercial success, or that approval may be\nconditioned on completion of further clinical trials or other activities, which will cause a substantial increase in costs and which we might not succeed in performing\nor completing.\n● If granted, approval may be withdrawn or limited if problems with our products emerge or are suggested by the data arising from their use or if there is a change in\nlaw or regulation.\nAny success we may achieve at a given stage of our clinical trials does not guarantee that we will achieve success at any subsequent stage, including without limitation\nfinal FDA or other regulatory organizations’ approval.\n29\nTable of Contents\nWe may encounter delays or rejections in the regulatory approval process because of additional government regulation resulting from future legislation or administrative\naction, or from changes in the policies of the FDA or other regulatory bodies during the period of product development, clinical trials, or regulatory review. Failure to comply with\napplicable regulatory requirements may result in criminal prosecution, civil penalties, recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, or an injunction\npreventing certain activity, as well as other regulatory action against our product candidates or us. As a company, we have no experience in successfully obtaining regulatory\napproval for a product and thus may be poorly equipped to gauge, and may prove unable to manage, risks relating to obtaining such approval.\nOutside the U.S., our ability to market a product is contingent upon receiving clearances from appropriate non-U.S. regulatory authorities, including the HREC in\nAustralia. Non-U.S. regulatory approval typically includes all of the risks associated with FDA clearance discussed above as well as geopolitical uncertainties and the additional\nuncertainties and potential prejudices faced by U.S. pharmaceutical companies conducting business abroad. In certain cases, governmental pricing restrictions and practices can\nmake achieving even limited profitability very difficult.\nEven if we complete the clinical trials we discussed with the FDA or TGA, there is no guarantee that at the time of submission the FDA or TGA will accept our new drug\napplication (“NDA”) or biologics license application (\"BLA\") based on the trials discussed.\nAny future decision by the FDA and TGA will be driven largely by the data generated from our currently ongoing or any future planned trials. However, the FDA and other\nregulatory organizations, including the TGA, will learn from their total experience in the review of multiple drugs in multiple indications and they will apply that knowledge of\nbroad and diverse experience even if less than a perfect match with our product. If the FDA or TGA require additional clinical trials it will increase our costs, delay our potential\npath to commercialization and could materially affect our financial condition.\nAs a company, we have never completed a clinical trial and have limited experience in completing regulatory filings and any delays in regulatory filings could materially affect\nour financial condition.\nWhile members of our team have conducted numerous clinical trials at previous companies, and have launched and marketed innovative pharmaceutical products in the\nU.S. and internationally, as a company, we have not yet completed any clinical trials of our product candidates, nor have we demonstrated the ability to obtain marketing approvals,\nmanufacture product candidates at a commercial scale, or conduct sales and marketing activities necessary for the successful commercialization of a product. Consequently, we\nhave no historical basis as a company by which one can evaluate or predict reliably our future success or viability.\nAdditionally, while our team has experience at prior companies with regulatory filings, as a company, we have limited experience with regulatory filings with agencies such\nas the FDA, TGA, or EMA. Any delay in our regulatory filings for our product candidates, and any adverse development or perceived adverse development with respect to the\napplicable regulatory authority’s review of such filings, including, without limitation, the FDA’s issuance of a “refuse to file” letter or a request for additional information, could\nmaterially affect our financial condition.\nWe, or any future collaborators, may not be able to obtain and maintain orphan drug exclusivity for our product candidates in the U.S. and Europe.\nCamsirubicin has been granted orphan drug designation for the treatment of soft tissue sarcoma in the U.S. and in the EU. We may seek additional orphan drug designations\nor regulatory incentives for our pipeline product candidates, for other indications or for future product candidates. There can be no assurances that we will be able to obtain such\ndesignations.\n30\nTable of Contents\nEven if we obtain orphan drug designation for a product candidate, we may not be able to maintain orphan drug exclusivity for that drug. For example, in certain\ngeographies, orphan drug designation may be removed if the prevalence of an indication increases beyond the patient number limit required to maintain designation. Generally, if a\ndrug with an orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first marketing approval for the indication for which it has such designation, the drug is entitled to a period of\nmarketing exclusivity, which precludes the EMA or the FDA from approving another marketing application for the same product in the same indication for that time period. Orphan\ndrug exclusivity may be lost if the FDA or EMA determines that the request for designation was materially defective or if the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient quantity at\nthe specified quality of the product to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition. Moreover, even after an orphan drug is approved, the FDA can subsequently\napprove a different drug for the same condition if the FDA concludes that the later drug is clinically superior in that it is shown to be safer, more effective or makes a major\ncontribution to patient care compared to our product.\nThe FDA may reevaluate the Orphan Drug Act and its regulations and policies, and similarly the EMA may reevaluate its policies and regulations. We do not know if,\nwhen, or how the FDA or EMA may change their orphan drug regulations and policies in the future, and it is uncertain how any changes might affect our business. Depending on\nwhat changes the FDA and/or EMA may make to their orphan drug regulations and policies, our business could be adversely impacted.\nIf serious adverse or undesirable side effects are identified during the development of our product candidates, we may abandon or limit our development or commercialization\nof such product candidates.\nIf our product candidates are associated with undesirable side effects or have unexpected characteristics, we may need to abandon their development or limit development\nto certain uses or subpopulations in which the undesirable side effects or other characteristics are less prevalent, less severe or more acceptable from a risk-benefit perspective.\nIf we elect to or are forced to suspend or terminate any clinical trial with one of our product candidates, the commercial prospects of such product candidate will be harmed,\nand our ability to generate revenue from such product candidate will be delayed or eliminated. Any of these occurrences may harm our business, financial condition and prospects\nsignificantly.\nIf we experience delays or difficulties in the enrollment of subjects to our clinical trials, our receipt of necessary regulatory approvals could be delayed or prevented, which\ncould materially affect our financial condition.\nIdentifying, screening and enrolling patients to participate in clinical trials of our product candidates is critical to our success, and we may not be able to identify, recruit,\nenroll and dose a sufficient number of patients with the required or desired characteristics to complete our clinical trials in a timely manner. The timing of our clinical trials depends\non our ability to recruit patients to participate as well as to subsequently dose these patients and complete required follow-up periods.\n31\nTable of Contents\nIn addition, we may experience enrollment delays related to increased or unforeseen regulatory, legal and logistical requirements and COVID-19-related or other future\npandemic-related as well as issues related to currently ongoing or any future geopolitical risks at certain clinical trial sites. These delays could be caused by reviews by regulatory\nauthorities and contractual discussions with individual clinical trial sites. Any delays in enrolling and/or dosing patients in our current clinical trials could result in increased costs,\ndelays in advancing our product candidates, delays in testing the effectiveness of our product candidates or in termination of the clinical trials altogether.\nPatient enrollment may be affected if our competitors have ongoing clinical trials with products for the same indications as our product candidates, and patients who would\notherwise be eligible for our clinical trials instead enroll in our competitors’ clinical trials. Patient enrollment may also be affected by other factors, including:\n● delays in U.S., Australian or other foreign regulatory approvals to start the clinical trial;\n● coordination with any clinical research organizations to enroll and administer the clinical trials;\n● coordination and recruitment of collaborators and investigators at individual sites;\n● size of the patient population and the effectiveness of the process for identifying patients;\n● design of the clinical trial protocol;\n● eligibility and exclusion criteria;\n● perceived therapeutic risks and benefits of the product candidates being studied;\n● availability of competing commercially available therapies and other competing products’ clinical trials;\n● time of year in which the trials are initiated or conducted;\n● severity and prognosis of the diseases under investigation;\n● ability to obtain and maintain subject consents;\n● ability to enroll and treat patients in a timely manner;\n● risk that enrolled subjects will drop out before completion of the trials;\n● proximity and availability of clinical trial sites for prospective patients;\n● ability to monitor subjects adequately during and after treatment;\n● logistical challenges posed by the time-limited shelf-life of our current or future drug candidates;\n● patient referral practices of physicians; and\n● potential long-term effects of COVID-19, any resurgences thereof or any future pandemics.\n32\nTable of Contents\nOur inability to enroll a sufficient number of patients for clinical trials would result in significant delays and could require us to abandon one or more clinical trials\naltogether. Enrollment delays in these clinical trials may result in increased development costs for our product candidates, which could materially affect our financial condition.\nIf we or our licensees, development collaborators, or suppliers are unable to manufacture our products in sufficient quantities or at defined quality specifications, or are\nunable to obtain regulatory approvals for the manufacturing facility, we may be unable to develop and/or meet demand for our products and lose time to market and potential\nrevenues.\nCompletion of our clinical trials and commercialization of our product candidates require access to, or development of, facilities to manufacture a sufficient supply of our\nproduct candidates. We will utilize third parties to manufacture our MNPR-101 radiopharma program and camsirubicin. We currently have manufacturing arrangements for MNPR-\n101-Zr and camsirubicin for clinical use. We have not yet secured manufacturing agreements for MNPR-101-RIT or MNPR-202 for clinical use.\nIn the future we may become unable, for various reasons, to rely on our sources for the manufacture of our product candidates, either for clinical trials or, at some future\ndate, for commercial distribution. We may not be successful in identifying additional or replacement third-party manufacturers, or in negotiating acceptable terms with any we do\nidentify. We may face competition for access to these manufacturers’ facilities and may be subject to manufacturing delays if the manufacturers give other clients higher priority\nthan they give to us. Even if we are able to identify an additional or replacement third-party manufacturer, the delays and costs associated with establishing and maintaining a\nrelationship with such manufacturer may have a material adverse effect on us.\nBefore we can begin to commercially manufacture camsirubicin, MNPR-101-Zr, MNPR-101 RIT, MNPR-202 or any other product candidate, we must obtain regulatory\napproval of the manufacturing facility and process. Manufacturing of drugs for clinical and commercial purposes must comply with current Good Manufacturing Practices\nrequirements, commonly known as “cGMP.” The cGMP requirements govern quality control and documentation policies and procedures. Complying with cGMP and non-U.S.\nregulatory requirements will require that we expend time, money, and effort in production, recordkeeping, and quality control to ensure that the product meets applicable\nspecifications and other requirements. We, or our contracted manufacturing facility, must also pass a pre-approval inspection prior to FDA or TGA approval. Failure to pass a pre-\napproval inspection will likely significantly delay or prevent FDA, TGA or other international regulatory agencies' approval of our products. If we fail to comply with these\nrequirements, we would be subject to possible regulatory action and may be limited in the jurisdictions in which we are permitted to sell our products and will lose time to market\nand potential revenues.\n33\nTable of Contents\nIt is uncertain whether product liability insurance will be adequate to address product liability claims, or that insurance against such claims will be affordable or available on\nacceptable terms in the future.\nClinical research involves the testing of new drugs on human volunteers pursuant to a clinical trial protocol. Such testing involves a risk of liability for personal injury to or\ndeath of patients due to, among other causes, adverse side effects, improper administration of the new drug, or improper volunteer behavior. Claims may arise from patients, clinical\ntrial volunteers, consumers, physicians, hospitals, companies, institutions, researchers, or others using, selling, or buying our products, as well as from governmental bodies\nincluding a possibility in some states for product liability claims being made based on generic copies of our drugs. In addition, product liability and related risks are likely to\nincrease over time, in particular upon the commercialization or marketing of any products by us or parties with which we enter into development, marketing, or distribution\ncollaborations. Although we have obtained product liability insurance in connection with our clinical trials, there can be no assurance that the amount and scope of such insurance\ncoverage will be appropriate and sufficient in the event any claims arise, that we will be able to secure additional coverage should we attempt to do so, or that our insurers would\nnot contest or refuse any attempt by us to collect on such insurance policies. Regardless of their merit or eventual outcome, product liability claims may result in:\n● withdrawal of clinical trial volunteers;\n● decreased demand for our products when approved;\n● injury to our reputation and significant, adverse media attention; and\n● potentially significant litigation costs, including without limitation, any damages awarded to the plaintiffs if we lose or settle claims.\nIf the market opportunities for our current and potential future drug candidates are smaller than we believe they are, our ability to generate product revenues will be adversely\naffected and our business may suffer.\nOur understanding of the number of patients who have advanced cancers that express uPAR and are eligible for MNPR-101-Zr and MNPR-101-RIT as well as patients who\nhave advanced soft tissue sarcoma (\"ASTS\") is based upon estimates and various scientific publications from governments or academic institutions. These estimates or reports may\nprove to be incorrect, and new studies may demonstrate or suggest a lower estimated incidence or prevalence of patients who might be eligible or amenable to MNPR-101-Zr,\nMNPR-101-RIT, and camsirubicin. Also, eligible or amenable patients may become increasingly difficult to identify and access due to many different factors, such as increasing\ncompetition in the radiopharmaceutical space. Moreover, the targetable population for our MNPR-101 radiopharmaceutical program and camsirubicin may further be reduced if our\nestimates or addressable populations are erroneous or sub-populations of patients within the addressable populations do not benefit from our MNPR-101 radiopharmaceutical\nprogram or camsirubicin.\nRisks Related to Our Reliance on Third Parties\nCorporate, non-profit, and academic collaborators may take actions (including lack of effective actions) to delay, prevent, or undermine the success of our products.\nOur operating and financial strategy for the development, clinical testing, manufacture, and commercialization of product candidates is heavily dependent on us entering\ninto collaborations with corporations, non-profit organizations, academic institutions, licensors, licensees, and other parties. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in\nestablishing such collaborations. Current and future collaborations are and may be terminable at the sole discretion of the collaborator. The activities of any collaborator will not be\nwithin our direct control and may not be in our power to influence. There can be no assurance that any collaborator will perform its obligations to our satisfaction or at all; that we\nwill derive any revenue, profits, or benefit from such collaborations; or that any collaborator will not compete with us. If any collaboration is not pursued, we may require\nsubstantially greater capital to undertake development and commercialization of our proposed products, and may not be able to develop and commercialize such products\neffectively, if at all. In addition, a lack of development and commercialization collaborations may lead to significant delays in introducing proposed products into certain markets\nand/or reduced sales of proposed products in such markets. Furthermore, current and future collaborators may act deliberately or inadvertently in ways detrimental to our interests.\n34\nTable of Contents\nThe termination of third-party licenses could adversely affect our rights to important compounds or technologies.\nWe rely on certain rights to MNPR-101 that we have secured through a non-exclusive license agreement with XOMA. XOMA, as licensor, has the ability to terminate the\nlicense if we breach our obligations under the license agreement and do not remedy any such breach within a set time after receiving written notice of such breach from XOMA. A\ntermination of the license agreement might force us to cease developing and/or selling MNPR-101-Zr or MNPR-101 RIT, if either gets to market.\nData provided by collaborators and other parties upon which we rely have not been independently verified and could turn out to be inaccurate, misleading, or incomplete.\nWe rely on third-party vendors, scientists, and collaborators to provide us with significant data and other information related to our projects, clinical trials, and business. We\ndo not independently verify or audit all of such data (including possibly material portions thereof). As a result, such data may be inaccurate, misleading, or incomplete.\nIn certain cases, we may need to rely on a single supplier for a particular manufacturing material or service, and any interruption in or termination of service by such supplier\ncould delay or disrupt the commercialization of our products.\nWe rely on third-party suppliers for the materials used to manufacture our compounds. Some of these materials may at times only be available from one supplier. Any\ninterruption in or termination of service by such single source suppliers could result in a delay or disruption in manufacturing until we locate an alternative source of supply. There\ncan be no assurance that we would be successful in locating an alternative source of supply or in negotiating acceptable terms with such prospective supplier.\nWe rely on a limited number of contracted manufacturing plants. If we need to enlist new contract manufacturers, it will delay our MNPR-101 radiopharmaceutical program\nand our camsirubicin program and may increase the costs of our clinical trials.\nOur contracted camsirubicin active pharmaceutical ingredient manufacturing plant as well as our contracted raw materials manufacturing plant are in countries in Asia and\nEurope, either of which may be affected by imposed tariffs and regional geopolitical factors outside of their control, including the Russia-Ukraine war and Israel-Hamas war, which\nmay affect the supply of camsirubicin active pharmaceutical ingredient and raw materials. If we need to enlist new contract manufacturers, it will delay our camsirubicin clinical\nprogram and may increase our cost for our Phase 1b and future camsirubicin clinical trials.\nOur contracted MNPR-101-Zr manufacturing plant as well as our raw material supplier are currently located in the U.S., but the Russia-Ukraine war and Israel-Hamas war\nmay adversely affect the sourcing of radioisotopes and timely supply of MNPR-101-Zr to clinical sites. If we need to enlist new contract manufacturers, it will delay our MNPR-\n101-Zr clinical program and may increase our cost for the currently ongoing or future clinical trials.\nWe rely on third parties to conduct our non-clinical studies and our clinical trials. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or meet expected\ndeadlines, we may be unable to obtain regulatory approval for or commercialize our current product candidates or any future products, on a timely and efficient basis or at all,\nand our financial condition will be adversely affected.\nWe do not have the capacity to independently conduct non-clinical studies and clinical trials. We rely on medical institutions, clinical investigators, contract laboratories,\ncollaborative partners and other third parties, such as contract research organizations or clinical research organizations, to conduct non-clinical studies and clinical trials on our\nproduct candidates. The third parties with whom we contract for execution of our non-clinical studies and clinical trials play a significant role in the conduct of these studies and\ntrials and the subsequent collection and analysis of data. However, these third parties are not our employees, and except for contractual duties and obligations, we have limited\nability to control the amount or timing of resources that they devote to our programs.\nAlthough we rely on third parties to conduct our non-clinical studies and clinical trials, we remain responsible for ensuring that each of our non-clinical studies and clinical\ntrials is conducted in accordance with its investigational plan and protocol. Moreover, the FDA, TGA, EMA and other foreign regulatory authorities require us to comply with\nregulations and standards, including some regulations commonly referred to as good clinical practices (“GCPs”), for conducting, monitoring, recording and reporting the results of\nclinical trials to ensure that the data and results are scientifically credible and accurate, and that the trial subjects are adequately informed of the potential risks of participating in\nclinical trials.\n35\nTable of Contents\nIn addition, the execution of non-clinical studies and clinical trials, and the subsequent compilation and analyses of the data produced, requires coordination among various\nparties. In order for these functions to be carried out effectively and efficiently, it is imperative that these parties communicate and coordinate with one another. Moreover, these\nthird parties may also have relationships with other commercial entities, some of which may compete with us. Under certain circumstances, these third parties may be able to\nterminate their agreements with us upon short notice. If the third parties conducting our clinical trials do not perform their contractual duties or obligations, experience work\nstoppages, do not meet expected deadlines, terminate their agreements with us or need to be replaced, or if the quality or accuracy of the clinical data they obtain is compromised\ndue to the failure to adhere to our clinical trial protocols or GCPs, or for any other reason, we may need to enter into new arrangements with alternative third parties, which could be\ndifficult, costly or impossible, and our clinical trials may be extended, delayed or terminated or may need to be repeated. If any of the foregoing were to occur, we may not be able\nto obtain, on a timely and efficient basis or at all, regulatory approval for or to commercialize the product candidate being tested in such trials, and as a result, our financial\ncondition will be adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Commercialization of Our Product Candidates\nWe have no experience as a company in commercializing any product. If we fail to obtain commercial expertise, upon product approval by regulatory agencies, our product\nlaunch and revenues could be delayed.\nAs a company, we have never obtained regulatory approval for, or commercialized, any product. Accordingly, we have not yet begun to build out any sales or marketing or\ndistribution capabilities. If we are unable to establish, or contract for, effective sales and marketing and distribution capabilities, or if we are unable to enter into agreements with\nthird parties to commercialize our product candidates on favorable terms or on any reasonable terms at all, we may not be able to effectively generate product revenues once our\nproduct candidates are approved for marketing. If we fail to obtain commercial expertise or capabilities, upon drug approval, our product launch and subsequent revenues could be\ndelayed and /or fail to reach their commercial potential.\nOur product development efforts are at an early stage. We have not yet undertaken any marketing efforts, and there can be no assurance that future anticipated market testing\nand analyses will validate our marketing strategy. We may need to modify the products, or we may not be successful in either developing or marketing those products.\nAs a company, we have not completed the development or clinical trials of any product candidates and, accordingly, have not yet begun to market or generate revenue from\nthe commercialization of any products. Obtaining approvals of these product candidates will require substantial additional research and development as well as costly clinical trials.\nThere can be no assurance that we will successfully complete development of our product candidates or successfully market them. We may encounter problems and delays relating\nto research and development, regulatory approval, intellectual property rights of product candidates, or other factors. There can be no assurance that our development programs will\nbe successful, that our product candidates will prove to be safe and effective in or after clinical trials, that the necessary regulatory approvals for any product candidates will be\nobtained, or, even if obtained, will be as broad as sought or will be maintained for any period thereafter, that patents will issue on our patent applications, that any intellectual\nproperty protections we secure will be adequate, or that our collaboration arrangements will not diminish the value of our intellectual property through licensing or other\narrangements. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that any product we might market will be received favorably by customers (whether physicians, payers, patients, or all three),\nadequately reimbursed by third-party payers, or that competitive products will not perform better and/or be marketed more successfully. Additionally, there can be no assurances\nthat any future market testing and analyses will validate our marketing strategies. We may need to seek to modify the product labels through additional studies in order to be able to\nmarket them successfully to reach their commercial potential.\nIf we are unable to establish relationships with licensees or collaborators to carry out sales, marketing, and distribution functions or to create effective marketing, sales, and\ndistribution capabilities, we will be unable to market our products successfully.\nOur business strategy may include out-licensing product candidates to or collaborating with larger firms with experience in marketing and selling pharmaceutical products.\nThere can be no assurance that we will successfully be able to establish marketing, sales, or distribution relationships with any third-party, that such relationships, if established,\nwill be successful, or that we will be successful in gaining market acceptance for any products we might develop. To the extent that we enter into any marketing, sales, or\ndistribution arrangements with third parties, our product revenues per unit sold are expected to be lower than if we marketed, sold, and distributed our products directly, and any\nrevenues we receive will depend upon the efforts of such third parties.\n36\nTable of Contents\nIf we are unable to establish such third-party marketing and sales relationships, or choose not to do so, we would have to establish in-house marketing and sales\ncapabilities. We have no experience in marketing or selling oncology pharmaceutical products, and currently have no marketing, sales, or distribution infrastructure and no\nexperience developing or managing such infrastructure for an oncology related product. To market any products directly, we would have to establish a marketing, sales, and\ndistribution force that has technical expertise and could support a distribution capability. Competition in the biopharmaceutical industry for technically proficient marketing, sales,\nand distribution personnel is intense and attracting and retaining such personnel may significantly increase our costs. There can be no assurance that we will be able to establish\ninternal marketing, sales, or distribution capabilities or that these capabilities will be sufficient to meet our needs.\nCommercial success of our product candidates will depend on the acceptance of these products by physicians, payers, and patients.\nAny product candidate that we may develop may not gain market acceptance among physicians, payers and patients. Market acceptance of and demand for any product that\nwe may develop will depend on many factors, including without limitation:\n● Comparative superiority of the efficacy and safety in the treatment of the disease indication compared to alternative treatments;\n● Less incidence, less prevalence and more severity of adverse side effects;\n● Potential advantages over alternative treatments;\n● Cost effectiveness;\n● Convenience and ease of administration, stability and shelf life, for distributor, physician and patient;\n● Sufficient third-party coverage and/or reimbursement;\n● Strength of sales, marketing and distribution support; and\n● Our ability to provide acceptable and compelling evidence of safety and efficacy.\nIf any product candidate developed by us receives regulatory approval but does not achieve an adequate level of market acceptance by physicians, payers, and patients, we\nmay generate insufficient, little, or no product revenue to earn appropriate returns on the investment of product development costs and may not become profitable at sufficient\nproduct sales volumes to earn sustainable profitability.\nOur products may not be accepted for reimbursement or adequately reimbursed by third-party payers.\nThe successful commercialization of any products we might develop will depend substantially on whether the costs of our products and related treatments are reimbursed at\nacceptable levels by government authorities, private healthcare insurers, and other third-party payers, such as health maintenance organizations. Reimbursement rates may vary,\ndepending upon the third-party payer, the type of insurance plan, and other similar or dissimilar factors. If our products do not achieve adequate reimbursement, then the number of\nphysician prescriptions of our products may not be sufficient to make our products profitable, and to earn a sufficient profit to earn a reasonable return on our investment and a\nprovide a cash flow to finance future investments on the next generation of products and investments in new technological platforms.\nComparative effectiveness research demonstrating benefits of a competitor’s product could adversely affect the sales of our product candidates. If third-party payers do not\nconsider our products to be cost-effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover our products as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of payment\nmay not be sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a profitable basis sufficient for our Company to remain competitive and thrive.\n37\nTable of Contents\nAdequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in the product\ndevelopment of that product. In addition, in the U.S. there is a growing emphasis on comparative effectiveness research, both by private payers and by government agencies. To the\nextent other drugs or therapies are found to be more effective than our products, payers may elect to cover such therapies in lieu of our products or reimburse our products at a\nlower rate.\nThe effects of economic and political pressure to lower pharmaceutical prices are a major threat to the economic viability of new research-based pharmaceutical products, and\nany significant decrease in drug prices could materially and adversely affect our prospects.\nEmphasis on managed care and government price controls in the U.S. has increased and we expect this will continue to increase the pressure on pharmaceutical pricing.\nCoverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which\nwe receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.\nAny development along these lines could materially and adversely affect our prospects. We are unable to predict what political, legislative or regulatory changes relating to\nthe healthcare industry, including without limitation any changes affecting governmental and/or private or third-party coverage and reimbursement, may be enacted in the future, or\nwhat effect such legislative or regulatory changes would have on our business. However, if governmental price management does not provide for the very high price of\npharmaceutical research, it could create very demanding challenges for our industry and our prospects or require breakthroughs in research productivity, of which there can be no\nassurance.\nIf we obtain FDA approval for any of our product candidates, we will be subject to various federal and state fraud and abuse laws; these laws may impact, among other things,\nour proposed sales, marketing and education programs. Fraud and abuse laws are expected to increase in breadth and in detail, which will likely increase our operating costs\nand the complexity of our programs to ensure compliance with such enhanced laws.\nIf we obtain FDA approval for any of our product candidates and begin commercializing those products in the U.S., our operations may be directly, or indirectly through\nour customers, distributors, or other business partners, subject to various federal and state fraud and abuse laws, including, without limitation, anti-kickback statutes and false\nclaims statutes which may increase our operating costs. These laws may impact, among other things, our proposed sales, marketing and education programs. In addition, we may be\nsubject to data privacy and security regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct business.\nIf our operations are found to be in violation of any of the federal and state fraud and abuse laws or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to\ncriminal actions and significant civil monetary penalties, which would adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations.\nIf our operations are found to be in violation, even inadvertently, of any of the federal and state fraud and abuse laws, including, without limitation, anti-kickback statutes\nand false claims statutes or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including criminal and significant civil monetary penalties,\ndamages, fines, imprisonment, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely\naffect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations. To the extent that any of our product candidates are ultimately sold in a foreign country, we may be subject to\nsimilar foreign laws and regulations, which may include, for instance, applicable post-marketing requirements, including safety surveillance, anti-fraud and abuse laws, and\nimplementation of corporate compliance programs and reporting of payments or transfers of value to healthcare professionals.\n38\nTable of Contents\nNegotiated prices for our products covered by a Part D prescription drug plan and other government programs will be lower than the prices we might otherwise obtain.\nGovernment payment for some of the costs of prescription drugs may increase demand for our products for which we receive marketing approval; however, any negotiated\nprices for our products covered by a Part D prescription drug plan and other government programs will be lower than the prices we might otherwise obtain. We anticipate that the\nnumber and type of products that will be subject to federal pricing will increase substantially over time. There may be rules to demand that the government and medical institutions,\nwhich are in part supported by government funding, will be granted access to medicines at the same highly favorable prices given to the governmental direct medical care programs.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nIf we and our third-party licensors do not obtain and preserve protection for our respective intellectual property rights, our competitors may be able to take advantage of our\n(and our licensors’) development efforts to develop competing drugs.\nOur commercial success will depend in part on obtaining patent protection for any products and other technologies we might develop, and successfully defending any\npatents we obtain against third-party challenges. See “Business – License, Development and Collaboration Agreements”. The assignment and transfer of the camsirubicin (formerly\nGPX-150) patent portfolio from TacticGem, LLC (“TacticGem”) to us has been completed. We filed and have been granted in the U.S. and various countries around the world\npatents for antibodies that target uPAR for our MNPR-101 program. We have also been granted in the U.S. and various countries around the world patents to a specific sequence of\namino acids on uPAR, to which our MNPR-101 antibody binds. We are currently prosecuting this patent in other countries around the world to further protect MNPR-101. We also\nhave jointly applied for patents with our collaborator, NorthStar, for MNPR-101-Zr and MNPR-101-RIT conjugates. The patent process is subject to numerous risks and\nuncertainties, and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining and defending patents. See “Business - Intellectual Property Portfolio and Exclusivity”. These\nrisks and uncertainties include without limitation the following:\n● Patents that may be issued or licensed may be challenged, invalidated, or circumvented; or may not provide any competitive advantage for other reasons.\n● Our licensors may terminate or breach our existing or future license agreements, thereby reducing or preventing our ability to exclude competition; termination of\nsuch license agreements may also subject us to risk of patent infringement of patents to which we no longer have a license.\n● Our competitors, many of which have substantially greater resources than us and have made significant investments in competing technologies, may seek, or may\nalready have obtained, patents that will limit, interfere with, or eliminate our ability to make, use, and sell our potential products either in the U.S. or in international\nmarkets.\n● As a matter of public policy regarding worldwide health concerns, there may be significant pressure on the U.S. government and other international governmental\nbodies to limit the scope of domestic and international patent protection for cancer treatments that prove successful.\n● Countries other than the U.S. may have less restrictive patent laws than those upheld by the U.S. courts; therefore, non-U.S. competitors could exploit these laws to\ncreate, develop, and market competing products. In some countries, the legal compliance with pharmaceutical patents, patent applications and other intellectual\nproperty regulations is very weak or actively evaded in some cases with government aid.\nIn addition, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (“USPTO”) and patent offices in other jurisdictions have often required that patent applications concerning\npharmaceutical and/or biotechnology-related inventions be limited or narrowed substantially to cover only the specific innovations exemplified in the patent application, thereby\nlimiting their scope of protection against competitive challenges. Thus, even if we or our licensors are able to obtain patents, the scope of the patents may be substantially narrower\nthan anticipated.\nIf we permit our patents to lapse or expire, we will not be protected and will have less of a competitive advantage. The value of our products may be greatly reduced if this\noccurs. Our patents expire at different times and are subject to the laws of multiple countries. Some of our patents are currently near expiration and we may pursue patent term\nextensions for these where appropriate or permit them to lapse. See “Business - Intellectual Property Portfolio and Exclusivity”.\n39\nTable of Contents\nIn addition to patents, we also rely on trade secrets and proprietary know-how. While we take measures to protect this information by entering into confidentiality and\ninvention agreements with our employees, consultants and collaborators, we cannot provide any assurances that these agreements will be fully enforceable and will not be breached,\nthat we will be able to protect ourselves from the harmful effects of disclosure if they are not fully enforceable or are breached, that any remedy for a breach will adequately\ncompensate us, that these agreements will achieve their intended aims, or that our trade secrets will not otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors.\nEnforcing a claim that a party illegally disclosed or misappropriated a trade secret is difficult, expensive and time-consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, some\ncourts inside and outside the U.S., are less willing or unwilling to protect trade secrets. If any of our trade secrets were to be lawfully obtained or independently developed by a\ncompetitor, we would have no right to prevent them from using that technology or information to compete with us. If any of our trade secrets were to be disclosed to or\nindependently developed by a competitor, our competitive position would be harmed, and the value of the trade secrets may be greatly reduced.\nThe patent protection we obtain and preserve for our product candidates may not be sufficient to provide us with any material competitive advantage.\nWe may be subject to competition despite the existence of intellectual property we license or own. We can give no assurances that our intellectual property claims will be\nsufficient to prevent third parties from designing around patents we own or license and developing and commercializing competitive products. The existence of competitive\nproducts that avoid our intellectual property could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. Furthermore, limitations, or perceived limitations, in our\nintellectual property may limit the interest of third parties to partner, collaborate or otherwise transact with us, if third parties perceive a higher than acceptable risk to\ncommercialization of our products or future products. If a competitor were able to successfully design around any method of use and formulation patents we may have now or in the\nfuture, it is highly likely that our business and competitive advantage would be adversely affected.\nPatent terms may be inadequate to protect our competitive position on our product candidates for an adequate amount of time. If this occurs, our competitive position,\nbusiness, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects would be materially harmed.\nPatents have a limited lifespan. In the U.S., if all maintenance fees are timely paid, the natural expiration of a patent is generally 20 years from its earliest U.S. non-\nprovisional filing date. Various extensions may be available, but the life of a patent, and the protection it affords, is limited. Even if patents covering our product candidates are\nobtained, once the patent life has expired for a product candidate, we may be open to competition from competitive medications, including generic medications. Given the amount\nof time required for the development, testing and regulatory review of new product candidates, patents protecting such product candidates might expire before or shortly after such\nproduct candidates are commercialized. As a result, our owned and licensed patent portfolio may not provide us with sufficient rights to exclude others from commercializing\nproduct candidates similar or identical to ours.\nDepending upon the timing, duration and conditions of any FDA marketing approval of our product candidates, one or more of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited\npatent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments, and similar legislation in the\nEuropean Union. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit a patent term extension of up to five years for a patent covering an approved product as compensation for effective\npatent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. However, we may not receive an extension if we fail to exercise due diligence during the\ntesting phase or regulatory review process, fail to apply within applicable deadlines, fail to apply prior to expiration of relevant patents or otherwise fail to satisfy applicable\nrequirements. Moreover, the length of the extension could be less than we request. Only one patent per approved product can be extended, the extension cannot extend the total\npatent term beyond 14 years from approval and only those claims covering the approved drug, a method for using it or a method for manufacturing it may be extended. If we are\nunable to obtain patent term extension or the term of any such extension is less than we request, the period during which we can enforce our patent rights for the applicable product\ncandidate will be shortened and our competitors may obtain approval to market competing products sooner. As a result, our revenue from applicable products could be reduced.\nFurther, if this occurs, our competitors may take advantage of our investment in development and trials by referencing our clinical and preclinical data and launch their product\nearlier than might otherwise be the case, and our competitive position, business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects would be materially harmed.\n40\nTable of Contents\nIntellectual property disputes could require us to spend time and money to address such disputes and could limit our intellectual property rights.\nThe biopharmaceutical industry has been characterized by extensive litigation regarding patents and other intellectual property rights, and companies have employed\nintellectual property litigation and USPTO post-grant proceedings to gain a competitive advantage. We may become subject to infringement claims or litigation arising out of\npatents and pending applications of our competitors, or additional interference proceedings declared by the USPTO to determine the priority and patentability of inventions. The\ndefense and prosecution of intellectual property suits, USPTO proceedings, and related legal and administrative proceedings are costly and time-consuming to pursue, and their\noutcome is uncertain. Litigation may be necessary to enforce our issued patents, to protect our trade secrets and know-how, or to determine the enforceability, scope, and validity of\nthe proprietary rights of others. An adverse determination in litigation or USPTO post-grant and interference proceedings to which we may become a party could subject us to\nsignificant liabilities, require us to obtain licenses from third parties, or restrict or prevent us from selling our products in certain markets. Even if a given patent or intellectual\nproperty dispute were settled through licensing or similar arrangements, our costs associated with such arrangements may be substantial and could include the payment by us of\nlarge, fixed payments and ongoing royalties. Furthermore, the necessary licenses may not be available on satisfactory terms or at all. Even where we have meritorious claims or\ndefenses, the costs of litigation may prevent us from pursuing these claims or defenses and/or may require extensive financial and personnel resources to pursue these claims or\ndefenses. In addition, it is possible there may be defects of form in our current and future patents that could result in our inability to defend the intended claims. Intellectual property\ndisputes arising from the aforementioned factors, or other factors, may materially harm our business.\nWe may not be able to enforce our intellectual property rights throughout the world.\nThe laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the U.S. Companies have encountered significant problems\nin protecting and defending intellectual property rights in certain foreign jurisdictions. The legal systems of some countries, particularly developing countries, do not favor the\nenforcement of patents and other intellectual property protection, especially those relating to life sciences. This could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our patents\nor the misappropriation of our other intellectual property rights. For example, many foreign countries have compulsory licensing laws under which a patent owner must grant\nlicenses to third parties. In addition, many countries limit the enforceability of patents against third parties, including government agencies or government contractors. In these\ncountries, patents may provide limited or no benefit.\nProceedings to enforce our patent rights in foreign jurisdictions, whether or not successful, could result in substantial costs and divert our efforts and attention from other\naspects of our business. Furthermore, while we intend to protect our intellectual property rights in our expected significant markets, we cannot ensure that we will be able to initiate\nor maintain similar efforts in all jurisdictions in which we may wish to market our current or any future product candidates. Accordingly, our efforts to protect our intellectual\nproperty rights in such countries may be inadequate. In addition, changes in the law and legal decisions by courts in the U.S. and foreign countries may affect our ability to obtain\nand enforce adequate intellectual property protection for our products and technology.\nChanges to the patent law in the U.S. and other jurisdictions could diminish the value of patents in general, thereby impairing our ability to protect our product candidates.\nAs is the case with other biopharmaceutical companies, our success is heavily dependent on intellectual property, particularly patents. Obtaining and enforcing patents in\nthe biopharmaceutical industry involves both technological and legal diligence and complexity. Therefore, obtaining and enforcing biopharmaceutical patents is costly, time\nconsuming and inherently uncertain. In addition, the U.S. has recently enacted and is currently implementing wide ranging patent reform legislation. The U.S. Supreme Court has\nruled on several patent cases in recent years, either narrowing the scope of patent protection available in certain circumstances or weakening the rights of patent owners in certain\nsituations. In addition to increasing uncertainty with regard to our ability to obtain patents in the future, this combination of events has created uncertainty with respect to the value\nof patents once obtained. Depending on future actions by the U.S. Congress, the federal courts and the USPTO, as well as other jurisdictions around the world, the laws and\nregulations governing patents could change in unpredictable ways that would weaken our ability to obtain new patents or to enforce our existing patents and patents that we might\nobtain in the future.\n41\nTable of Contents\nObtaining and maintaining our patent protection depends on compliance with various procedural, document submission, fee payment and other requirements imposed by\ngovernmental patent agencies, and our patent protection could be reduced or eliminated for non-compliance with these requirements.\nThe USPTO and various foreign governmental patent agencies require compliance with a number of procedural, documentary, fee payment and other provisions during the\npatent process. There are situations in which noncompliance due to issues beyond our control, can result in abandonment or lapse of a patent or patent application, resulting in\npartial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction. In such an event, competitors might be able to enter the market earlier than would otherwise have been the case.\nIf we fail to comply with our obligations under any license, collaboration or other intellectual property-related agreements, we may be required to pay damages and could lose\nintellectual property rights that may be necessary for developing, commercializing and protecting our current or future technologies or drug candidates or we could lose certain\nrights to grant sublicenses.\nAny license, collaboration or other intellectual property-related agreements impose, and any future license, collaboration or other intellectual property-related agreements\nwe enter into are likely to impose, various development, commercialization, funding, milestone, royalty, diligence, sublicensing, insurance, patent prosecution and enforcement or\nother obligations on us. If we breach any of these obligations, or use the intellectual property licensed to us in an unauthorized manner, we may be required to pay damages and the\nlicensor may have the right to terminate the license. In spite of our best efforts, any of our future licensors might conclude that we have materially breached our license agreements\nand might therefore terminate the license agreements, thereby removing our ability to develop and commercialize products and technologies covered by these license agreements.\nAny license agreements we enter into may be complex, and certain provisions in such agreements may be susceptible to multiple interpretations. The resolution of any contract\ninterpretation disagreement that may arise could narrow what we believe to be the scope our rights to the relevant intellectual property or technology, or increase what we believe to\nbe our financial or other obligations under the relevant agreement, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations,\nand prospects.\nWe may seek to obtain licenses from licensors in the future, however, we may be unable to obtain any such licenses at a reasonable cost or on reasonable terms, if at all. In\naddition, if any of our future licensors terminate any such license agreements, such license termination could result in our inability to develop, manufacture and sell products that\nare covered by the licensed technology or could enable a competitor to gain access to the licensed technology. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our\ncompetitive position, business, financial condition, results of operations, and ability to achieve profitability.\nFurthermore, we may not have the right to control the preparation, filing, prosecution, maintenance, enforcement and defense of patents and patent applications that we\nlicense from third parties. Therefore, we cannot be certain that these patents and patent applications will be prepared, filed, prosecuted, maintained, enforced and defended in a\nmanner consistent with the best interests of our business. If our future licensors fail to prosecute, maintain, enforce and defend patents we may in-license, or lose rights to licensed\npatents or patent applications, our license rights may be reduced or eliminated. In such circumstances, our right to develop and commercialize any of our products or drug\ncandidates that is the subject of such licensed rights could be materially adversely affected. In certain circumstances, our licensed patent rights are subject to our reimbursing our\nlicensors for their patent prosecution and maintenance costs.\nMoreover, our licensors may own or control intellectual property that has not been licensed to us and, as a result, we may be subject to claims, regardless of their merit, that\nwe are infringing, misappropriating or otherwise violating the licensor’s intellectual property rights and the amount of any damages or future royalty obligations that would result, if\nany such claims were successful, would depend on the technology and intellectual property we use in products that we successfully develop and commercialize, if any. Therefore,\neven if we successfully develop and commercialize products, due to such obligations, we may be unable to achieve or maintain profitability.\nThird parties may initiate legal proceedings alleging that we are infringing, misappropriating or otherwise violating their intellectual property rights, the outcome of which\nwould be uncertain and could have a material adverse impact on the success of our business.\nOur commercial success depends, in part, upon our ability or the ability of any of our future collaborators to develop, manufacture, market and sell our current or any future\ndrug candidates and to use our proprietary technologies without infringing, misappropriating or otherwise violating the proprietary and intellectual property rights of third parties.\nThe biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by extensive and complex litigation regarding patents and other intellectual property rights.\n42\nTable of Contents\nWe or any of our future licensors or strategic partners, may be party to, or be threatened with, adversarial proceedings or litigation regarding intellectual property rights\nwith respect to our current or any potential future drug candidates and technologies, including derivation, reexamination, inter partes review, post-grant review or interference\nproceedings before the USPTO and similar proceedings in jurisdictions outside of the U.S. such as opposition proceedings. If we or our licensors or strategic partners are\nunsuccessful in any interference proceedings or other priority or validity disputes (including through any patent oppositions) to which we or they are subject, we may lose valuable\nintellectual property rights through the loss of one or more patents or our patent claims may be narrowed, invalidated, or held unenforceable. In some instances, we may be required\nto indemnify our licensors or strategic partners for the costs associated with any such adversarial proceedings or litigation. Third parties may also assert infringement,\nmisappropriation or other claims against us, our licensors or our strategic partners based on existing patents or patents that may be granted in the future, as well as other intellectual\nproperty rights, regardless of their merit. There is a risk that third parties may choose to engage in litigation or other adversarial proceedings with us, our licensors or our strategic\npartners to enforce or otherwise assert their patent rights or other intellectual property rights. Even if we believe such claims are without merit, a court of competent jurisdiction\ncould hold that these third-party patents and other intellectual property rights are valid, enforceable and infringed, which could have a material adverse impact on our ability to\nutilize our developed technologies or to commercialize our current or any future drug candidates deemed to be infringing. In order to successfully challenge the validity of any such\nU.S. patent in federal court, we would need to overcome a presumption of validity by presenting clear and convincing evidence of invalidity. There is no assurance that a court of\ncompetent jurisdiction, even if presented with evidence we believe to be clear and convincing, would invalidate the claims of any such U.S. patent.\nFurther, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to successfully settle or otherwise resolve such adversarial proceedings or litigation. If we are unable to successfully settle\nfuture claims on terms acceptable to us, we may be required to engage in or to continue costly, unpredictable and time-consuming litigation and may be prevented from or\nexperience substantial delays in marketing our drug candidates. If we or any of our licensors or strategic partners are found to infringe, misappropriate or violate a third-party patent\nor other intellectual property rights, we could be required to pay damages, including treble damages and attorney’s fees, if we are found to have willfully infringed. In addition, we,\nor any of our licensors or strategic partners may choose to seek, or be required to seek, a license from a third-party, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms,\nif at all. Even if a license can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms, the rights may be non-exclusive, which could give our competitors access to the same technology or\nintellectual property rights licensed to us, and we could be required to make substantial licensing and royalty payments. We also could be forced, including by court order, to cease\nutilizing, developing, manufacturing and commercializing our developed technologies or drug candidates deemed to be infringing. We may be forced to redesign current or future\ntechnologies or products. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our ability to generate revenue or achieve profitability and possibly prevent us from\ngenerating revenue sufficient to sustain our operations.\nIn addition, we or our licensors or strategic partners may find it necessary to pursue claims or to initiate lawsuits to protect or enforce our patent or other intellectual\nproperty rights. If we or our licensors or strategic partners were to initiate legal proceedings against a third-party to enforce a patent covering one of our drug candidates or our\ndeveloped technology, the defendant could counterclaim that such patent is invalid or unenforceable. In patent litigation in the U.S., defendant counterclaims alleging invalidity or\nunenforceability are commonplace. Grounds for a validity challenge could be an alleged failure to meet any of several statutory requirements, for example, claiming patent-\nineligible subject matter, lack of novelty, indefiniteness, lack of written description, non-enablement, anticipation or obviousness. Grounds for an unenforceability assertion could\nbe an allegation that someone connected with prosecution of the patent withheld relevant information from the USPTO or made a misleading statement during prosecution. The\noutcome of such invalidity and unenforceability claims is unpredictable. With respect to the validity question, for example, we cannot be certain that there is no invalidating prior\nart of which we or our licensors or strategic partners and the patent examiner were unaware during prosecution. If a defendant were to prevail on a legal assertion of invalidity or\nunenforceability, we could lose at least part, and perhaps all, of the patent protection for one or more of our drug candidates. The narrowing or loss of our owned and licensed patent\nclaims could limit our ability to stop others from using or commercializing similar or identical technologies and products. All of these events could have a material adverse effect on\nour business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Patent and other intellectual property rights also will not protect our drug candidates and technologies if\ncompetitors or third parties design around such drug candidates and technologies without legally infringing, misappropriating or violating our patent or other intellectual property\nrights.\n43\nTable of Contents\nThe cost to us in defending or initiating any litigation or other proceedings relating to our patent or other intellectual property rights, even if resolved in our favor, could be\nsubstantial, and any litigation or other proceedings would divert our management’s attention and distract our personnel from their normal responsibilities. Such litigation or\nproceedings could materially increase our operating losses and reduce the resources available for development activities or any future sales, marketing or distribution activities. We\nmay not have sufficient financial or other resources to conduct such litigation or proceedings adequately. Some of our competitors may be able to more effectively sustain the costs\nof complex patent litigation because they have substantially greater resources. Uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of patent litigation or other proceedings\ncould delay our research and development efforts and materially limit our ability to continue our operations. Furthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required\nin connection with certain such proceedings, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure. In addition, there could be public\nannouncements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments and if securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, such\nannouncements could have a material adverse effect on the price of our common stock.\nIntellectual property rights of third parties could adversely affect our ability to commercialize our current or future technologies or drug candidates, and we might be required\nto litigate or obtain licenses from third parties to develop or market our current or future technologies or drug candidates, which may not be available on commercially\nreasonable terms, or at all.\nThere are numerous companies that have pending patent applications and issued patents broadly covering immune-therapies generally or covering small molecules directed\nagainst the same targets as, or targets similar to, those we are pursuing. Our competitive position may materially suffer if patents issued to third parties or other third-party\nintellectual property rights cover our current or future technologies, drug candidates or elements thereof, or our manufacture or uses relevant to our development plans. In such\ncases, we may not be in a position to develop or commercialize current or future technologies or drug candidates unless we successfully pursue litigation to nullify or invalidate the\nthird-party intellectual property rights concerned or enter into a license agreement with the intellectual property rights holder, if available on commercially reasonable terms. There\nmay be issued patents of which we are not aware, held by third parties that, if found to be valid and enforceable, could be alleged to be infringed by our current or future\ntechnologies or drug candidates. There also may be pending patent applications of which we are not aware that may result in issued patents, which could be alleged to be infringed\nby our current or future technologies or drug candidates. Should such an infringement claim be successfully brought, we may be required to pay substantial damages or be forced to\nabandon our current or future technologies or drug candidates or to seek a license from any patent holders. No assurances can be given that a license will be available on\ncommercially reasonable terms, if at all.\nThird-party intellectual property rights holders may also actively bring infringement, misappropriation or other claims alleging violations of intellectual property rights\nagainst us. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to successfully settle or otherwise resolve such claims. If we are unable to successfully settle future claims on terms acceptable\nto us, we may be required to engage in or to continue costly, unpredictable and time-consuming litigation and may be prevented from, or experience substantial delays in, marketing\nour drug candidates. If we fail in any such dispute, in addition to being forced to pay damages, we may be temporarily or permanently prohibited from commercializing any of our\ncurrent or future technologies or drug candidates that are held to be infringing, misappropriating or otherwise violating third-party intellectual property rights. We might, if possible,\nalso be forced to redesign current or future technologies or drug candidates so that we no longer infringe, misappropriate or violate the third-party intellectual property rights. Any\nof these events, even if we were ultimately to prevail, could require us to divert substantial financial and management resources that we would otherwise be able to devote to our\nbusiness, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Business Operations and Industry\nWe have a limited operating history.\nTo date, we have engaged exclusively in acquiring pharmaceutical product candidates, licensing rights to product candidates, entering into collaboration agreements with\nrespect to key services or technologies for our drug product development, and conducted clinical trials, but have not yet received any governmental approvals, brought any product\nto market, manufactured products in commercial quantities or sold any pharmaceutical products. As a company we have limited experience in negotiating, establishing, and\nmaintaining strategic relationships, conducting clinical trials, and managing the regulatory approval process, all of which will be necessary if we are to be successful. Our lack of\nexperience in these critical areas makes it difficult for a prospective investor to evaluate our abilities and increases the risk that we will fail to successfully execute our strategies.\n44\nTable of Contents\nFurthermore, if our business grows rapidly, our operational, managerial, legal, and financial resources will be strained. Our development will require continued\nimprovement and expansion of our management team and our operational, managerial, legal, and financial systems and controls.\nIn the normal course of business, we have evaluated and expect to evaluate potential acquisitions and/or licenses of patents, compounds, and technologies that our\nmanagement believes could complement or expand our business. In the event that we identify an acquisition or license candidate we find attractive, there is no assurance that we\nwill be successful in negotiating an agreement to acquire or license, or in financing or profitably exploiting, such patents, compounds, or technologies. Furthermore, such an\nacquisition or license could divert management time and resources away from other activities that would further our current business development.\nIf we lose key management leadership, and/or scientific personnel, and if we cannot recruit qualified employees, managers, directors, officers, or other significant personnel, it\nis highly likely that we will experience program delays and increases in compensation costs, and our business will be materially disrupted.\nOur future success is highly dependent on the continued service of principal members of our management, leadership, and scientific personnel, who are able to terminate\ntheir employment with us at any time and may be able to compete with us. The loss of any of our key management, leadership, or scientific personnel including, in particular,\nChristopher M. Starr, our Executive Chairman of the Board of Directors (referred to as the “Board”), and Chandler D. Robinson, our President and CEO, could materially disrupt\nour business and materially delay or prevent the successful product development and commercialization of our product candidates. We have an employment agreement with Dr.\nRobinson which has no term but is for at-will employment, meaning the executive has the ability to terminate his employment at any time. We have a consulting agreement with Dr.\nStarr that is terminable with 30-days’ notice by Dr. Starr or us.\nOur future success will also depend on our continuing ability to identify, hire, and retain highly skilled personnel for all areas of the organization. Competition in the\nbiopharmaceutical industry for scientifically and technically qualified personnel is intense, and we may be unsuccessful in identifying, hiring, and retaining qualified personnel. Our\ncontinued requirement to identify, hire, and retain highly competent personnel may cause our compensation costs to increase materially.\nWe incur costs as a result of operating as a public company, and our management is required to devote substantial time to investor relations, information and communication\nto the public, and related compliance initiatives and corporate governance practices.\nAs a public company, and particularly after we are no longer an emerging growth company after 2024, we will incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses that\nwe did not incur as a private company. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the listing requirements of the Nasdaq Capital\nMarket and other applicable securities rules and regulations impose various requirements on public companies, including establishment and maintenance of effective disclosure and\nfinancial controls and corporate governance practices. Our management and other personnel devote a substantial amount of time to these compliance initiatives. Moreover, these\nrules and regulations increase our legal and financial compliance costs and make some activities more time-consuming and costly. For example, we expect that these rules and\nregulations may make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance, which in turn could make it more difficult for us to attract and\nretain qualified members of our Board. However, these rules and regulations are often subject to varying interpretations, in many cases due to their lack of specificity, and, as a\nresult, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies. This could result in continuing uncertainty regarding\ncompliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices.\n45\nTable of Contents\nDespite ongoing compliance training and periodic education, our employees and consultants may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including noncompliance\nwith regulatory standards and requirements, which could result in delays or terminations of our development programs and adversely affect our business.\nAlthough we regularly train our employees on compliance and we are aware of no misconduct or improper activities to date, we are exposed to the risk of employee or\nconsultant fraud or other misconduct. Misconduct by our employees or consultants could include intentional failures to: comply with FDA regulations; provide accurate information\nto the FDA; comply with manufacturing standards; comply with federal and state healthcare fraud and abuse laws and regulations; report financial information or data accurately or\ndisclose unauthorized activities to us. In particular, sales, marketing and business arrangements in the healthcare industry are subject to extensive laws and regulations intended to\nprevent fraud, kickbacks, self-dealing and other abusive practices. These laws and regulations may restrict or prohibit a wide range of pricing, discounting, marketing and\npromotion, sales commission, customer incentive programs and other business arrangements. Employee and consultant misconduct could also involve the improper use of\ninformation obtained in the course of clinical trials, which could result in regulatory sanctions and serious harm to our reputation. It is not always possible to identify and deter such\nmisconduct, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from\ngovernmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to be in compliance with such laws or regulations. If any such actions are instituted against us, and\nwe are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could have a significant impact on our business, including the imposition of significant fines or\nother sanctions. Such actions could adversely affect our business including delaying or terminating one or more of our development programs.\nWe are an emerging growth company and we cannot be certain if the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies will make our common stock\nless attractive to investors.\nWe are an emerging growth company. Under the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the “JOBS Act”), emerging growth companies can delay adopting new or\nrevised accounting standards until such time as those standards apply to private companies. We have irrevocably elected to opt out of this provision and, as a result, we will comply\nwith new or revised accounting standards when they are required to be adopted by public companies that are not emerging growth companies.\nFor as long as we continue to be an emerging growth company, we intend to take advantage of certain other exemptions from various reporting requirements that are\napplicable to other public companies including, but not limited to, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements,\nexemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory stockholder vote on executive compensation and any golden parachute payments not previously approved,\nexemption from the requirement of auditor attestation in the assessment of our internal control over financial reporting and exemption from any requirement that may be adopted by\nthe Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor’s report providing additional information about the audit\nand the financial statements (auditor discussion and analysis). If we do take advantage of these exemptions, the information that we provide stockholders will be different than what\nis available with respect to other public companies. We cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we will rely on these exemptions. If investors\nfind our common stock less attractive as a result of our status as an emerging growth company, there may be less liquidity for our common stock and our stock price may be more\nvolatile.\nWe will remain an emerging growth company until the earliest of (1) the last day of the year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the completion of our initial public\noffering, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.235 billion or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of\nour common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the prior June 30th, and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible\ndebt securities during the prior three-year period. We anticipate this will be December 31, 2024. Even after we no longer qualify as an emerging growth company, we may remain a\n“smaller reporting company” and “non-accelerated filer” and rely on certain reduced disclosure obligations and/or exemptions available to such companies.\nCompetition and technological change may make our product candidates less competitive or obsolete.\nThe biopharmaceutical industry is subject to rapid technological change. We have many potential competitors, including major drug and chemical companies, specialized\nbiopharmaceutical firms, universities and other research institutions. These companies, firms, and other institutions may develop products that are more effective than our product\ncandidates or that would make our product candidates less competitive or obsolete. Many of these companies, firms, and other institutions have greater financial resources than us\nand may be better able to withstand and respond to adverse market conditions within the biopharmaceutical industry, including without limitation the lengthy product development\nand regulatory approval processes for product candidates.\n46\nTable of Contents\nWe face significant competition from other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, and our operating results will suffer if we fail to compete effectively.\nThe biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary products.\nWhile we believe we have significant competitive advantages with our expertise in small molecules and biologics, and rare disease clinical development, along with a strong\nintellectual property portfolio, we currently face and will continue to face competition for our drug development programs from companies that are developing doxorubicin\nanalogs/replacements, or are targeting uPAR. The competition is likely to come from multiple sources, including larger pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies and\nacademia. Accordingly, our competitors may have more resources and be more successful than us in obtaining approval for treatments and achieving widespread market acceptance.\nFor any products that we may ultimately commercialize, not only will we compete with any existing therapies and those therapies currently in development, we will have to\ncompete with new therapies that may become available in the future.\nWe may engage in strategic transactions that could impact our liquidity, increase our expenses and present significant distractions to our management.\nFrom time to time, we may consider strategic transactions, such as acquisitions of companies, asset purchases, and out-licensing or in-licensing of products, product\ncandidates or technologies. Additional potential transactions that we may consider include a variety of different business arrangements, including spin-offs, strategic partnerships,\njoint ventures, restructurings, divestitures, business combinations and investments. Any such transaction will require us to incur non-recurring or other charges, may increase our\nnear- and long-term expenditures and may pose significant integration challenges or disrupt our management or business, which could adversely affect our operations and financial\nresults. For example, these transactions may entail numerous operational and financial risks, including:\n● exposure to unknown technologies, product candidates, medical conditions and indications, product manufacturing challenges and uncertainties, and other unknown\nfactors of potential high risk;\n● disruption of our business and diversion of our management’s time and attention in order to develop acquired products, product candidates or technologies;\n● incurrence of substantial debt or dilutive issuances of equity securities to pay for acquisitions;\n● higher-than-expected acquisition and integration costs;\n● write-downs of assets, goodwill or impairment charges;\n● increased amortization expenses;\n● difficulty and cost in combining the operations and personnel of any acquired businesses with our operations and personnel;\n● impairment of relationships with key suppliers or customers of any acquired businesses due to changes in management and ownership; and\n● inability to retain key employees of any acquired businesses or for our current business based on changed circumstances.\nAccordingly, although there can be no assurance that we will undertake or successfully complete any transactions of the nature described above, any transactions that we do\ncomplete may be subject to the foregoing or other risks, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.\n47\nTable of Contents\nOur business and operations are vulnerable to computer system failures, cyber-attacks or deficiencies in our cybersecurity, which could increase our expenses, divert the\nattention of our management and key personnel away from our business operations and adversely affect our results of operations.\nDespite the implementation of security measures, our internal computer systems, and those of third parties on which we rely, are vulnerable to damage from: computer\nviruses; malware; natural disasters; terrorism; war; telecommunication and electrical failures; cyber-attacks or cyber-intrusions over the Internet; attachments to emails; persons\ninside our organization; or persons with access to systems inside our organization. The risk of a security breach or disruption, particularly through cyber-attacks or cyber intrusion,\nincluding by computer hackers, foreign governments, and cyber terrorists, has generally increased as the number, intensity and sophistication of attempted attacks and intrusions\nfrom around the world have increased. If such an event were to occur and cause interruptions in our operations, it could result in a material disruption of our product development\nprograms. For example, the loss of clinical trial data from completed or ongoing or planned clinical trials could result in delays in our regulatory approval efforts and significantly\nincrease our costs to recover or reproduce the data. To the extent that any disruption or security breach was to result in a loss of or damage to our data or applications, or\ninappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, we could incur material legal claims and liability, and damage to our reputation, and the further development of\nour product candidates could be delayed. We could be forced to expend significant resources in response to a cyber security breach, including repairing system damage, increasing\ncyber security protection costs by deploying additional personnel and protection technologies, paying regulatory fines and resolving legal claims and regulatory actions, all of which\nwould increase our expenses, divert the attention of our management and key personnel away from our business operations and adversely affect our results of operations.\nFailure to comply with health and data protection laws and regulations could lead to government enforcement actions (which could include civil or criminal penalties), private\nlitigation or adverse publicity and could negatively affect our operating results and business.\nWe and our current and any of our future collaborators may be subject to federal, state and foreign data protection laws and regulations (i.e., laws and regulations that\naddress privacy and data security). In the U.S., numerous federal and state laws and regulations, including federal health information privacy laws (e.g., the Health Insurance\nPortability and Accountability Act (“HIPAA”), as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (“HITECH”)), state data breach\nnotification laws, state health information privacy laws and federal and state consumer protection laws (e.g., Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act), that govern the\ncollection, use, disclosure and protection of health-related and other personal information could apply to our operations or the operations of our collaborators. In addition, we may\nobtain health information from third parties (including research institutions from which we obtain clinical trial data) that are subject to privacy and security requirements under\nHIPAA, as amended by HITECH, or other privacy and data security laws. Depending on the facts and circumstances, we could be subject to criminal penalties if we knowingly\nobtain, use, or disclose individually identifiable health information maintained by a HIPAA-covered entity in a manner that is not authorized or permitted by HIPAA.\nInternational data protection laws, including Regulation 2016/679, known as the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) may also apply to health-related and other\npersonal information obtained outside of the U.S. The GDPR went into effect on May 25, 2018. The GDPR introduced new data protection requirements in the EU, as well as\npotential fines for non-compliant companies of up to the greater of €20 million or 4% of annual global revenue. The regulation imposes numerous new requirements for the\ncollection, use, storage and disclosure of personal information, including more stringent requirements relating to consent and the information that must be shared with data subjects\nabout how their personal information is used, the obligation to notify regulators and affected individuals of personal data breaches, extensive new internal privacy governance\nobligations and obligations to honor expanded rights of individuals in relation to their personal information (e.g., the right to access, correct and delete their data). In addition, the\nGDPR includes restrictions on cross-border data transfers. The GDPR increased our responsibility and liability in relation to personal data that we process where such processing is\nsubject to the GDPR, and we may be required to put in place additional mechanisms to ensure compliance with the GDPR, including as implemented by individual countries.\nIn Australia, they have enacted robust data protection regulations to safeguard personal information of its citizens. These laws include the Federal Privacy Act of 1988 and\nPrivacy Legislation Amendment Act of 2022. These laws also specifically address data protection measures such data residency requirements, requirements for handling personal\nhealth records and data subject rights that detail specific rights Australian citizens have on the collection and use of their personal data.\n48\nTable of Contents\nIn addition, California enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”), which creates new individual privacy rights for California consumers (as defined in the\nlaw) and places increased privacy and security obligations on entities handling personal data of consumers or households. The CCPA requires covered companies to provide new\ndisclosure to consumers about such companies’ data collection, use and sharing practices, provide such consumers new ways to opt-out of certain sales or transfers of personal\ninformation, and provide consumers with additional causes of action. The CCPA went into effect on January 1, 2020, and certain amendments went into effect in 2023. Other states\nhave adopted similar laws. The CCPA, and other state privacy laws, may impact our business activities and exemplify the vulnerability of our business to the evolving regulatory\nenvironment related to personal data and protected health information.\nCompliance with U.S. and international data protection laws and regulations could require us to take on more onerous obligations in our contracts, restrict our ability to\ncollect, use and disclose data, or in some cases, impact our ability to operate in certain jurisdictions. Failure to comply with U.S. and international data protection laws and\nregulations could result in government enforcement actions (which could include civil or criminal penalties), private litigation or adverse publicity and could negatively affect our\noperating results and business.\nIf we, our contract research organizations (“CROs”) or our IT vendors experience security or data privacy breaches or other unauthorized or improper access to, use of, or\ndestruction of personal data, we may face costs, significant liabilities, harm to our brand and business disruption.\nIn connection with our drug research and development efforts, we or our CROs may collect and use a variety of personal data, such as names, mailing addresses, email\naddresses, phone numbers and clinical trial information. Although we have extensive measures in place to prevent the sharing and loss of patient data in our clinical trial processes\nassociated with our developed technologies and drug candidates, any failure to prevent or mitigate security breaches or improper access to, use of, or disclosure of our clinical data\nor patients’ personal data could result in significant liability under state (e.g., state breach notification laws), federal (e.g., HIPAA, as amended by HITECH), and international laws\n(e.g., the GDPR). Any failure to prevent or mitigate security breaches or improper access to, use of, or disclosure of our clinical data or patients’ personal data may cause a material\nadverse impact to our reputation, affect our ability to conduct new studies and potentially disrupt our business. We may also rely on third-party IT vendors to host or otherwise\nprocess some of our data and that of users, and any failure by such IT vendor to prevent or mitigate security breaches or improper access to or disclosure of such information could\nhave similarly adverse consequences for us. If we are unable to prevent or mitigate the impact of such security or data privacy breaches, we could be exposed to litigation and\ngovernmental investigations, which could lead to a potential disruption to our business.\nIf we do not comply with laws regulating the protection of the environment and health and human safety, our business could be adversely affected.\nOur research and development and drug candidates and future commercial manufacturing may involve the use of hazardous materials and various chemicals. We currently\ndo not maintain a research laboratory, but we engage third-party research organizations and manufacturers to conduct our preclinical studies, clinical trials and manufacturing.\nThese third-party laboratories and manufacturers are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the use, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of these\nhazardous materials. We must rely on the third parties’ procedures for storing, handling and disposing of these materials in their facilities to comply with the relevant guidelines of\nthe states in which they operate and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration of the U.S. Department of Labor. Although we believe that their safety procedures for\nhandling and disposing of these materials comply with the standards mandated by applicable regulations, the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials cannot\nbe eliminated. If an accident occurs, this could result in significant delays in our development. We are also subject to numerous environmental, health and workplace safety laws\nand regulations. Although we maintain workers’ compensation insurance to cover us for costs and expenses, we may incur due to injuries to our employees, this insurance may not\nprovide adequate coverage against potential liabilities. Additional federal, state and local laws and regulations affecting our operations may be adopted in the future. We may incur\nsubstantial costs to comply with, and substantial fines or penalties if we violate, any of these laws or regulations.\n49\nTable of Contents\nWe have limited the liability of and indemnified our directors and officers.\nAlthough our directors and officers are accountable to us and must exercise good faith, good business judgement, and integrity in handling our affairs, our Second\nAmended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the “Certificate of Incorporation”) and indemnification agreements executed by all of our non-employee directors and officers\nprovides that our non-employee directors and officers will be indemnified to the fullest extent permitted under Delaware law. As a result, our stockholders may have fewer rights\nagainst our non-employee directors and officers than they would have absent such provisions in our Certificate of Incorporation and indemnification agreements, and a\nstockholder’s ability to seek and recover damages for a breach of fiduciary duties may be reduced or restricted. Delaware law allows indemnification of our non-employee directors\nand officer, if they (a) have acted in good faith, in a manner the non-employee director or officer reasonably believes to be in or not opposed to our best interests, and (b) with\nrespect to any criminal action or proceeding, if the non-employee director or officer had no reasonable cause to believe the conduct was unlawful.\nPursuant to the Certificate of Incorporation and indemnification agreement, each non-employee director and officer who is made a party to a legal proceeding because he or\nshe is or was a non-employee director or officer, is indemnified by us from and against any and all liability, except that we may not indemnify a non-employee director or officer:\n(a) for any liability incurred in a proceeding in which such person is adjudged liable to Monopar or is subjected to injunctive relief in favor of Monopar; (b) for acts or omissions\nthat involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law, fraud or gross negligence; (c) for unlawful distributions; (d) for any transaction for which such non-employee\ndirector or officer received a personal benefit or as otherwise prohibited by or as may be disallowed under Delaware law; or (e) with respect to any dispute or proceeding between\nus and such non-employee director or officer unless such indemnification has been approved by a disinterested majority of the Board or by a majority in interest of disinterested\nstockholders. We are required to pay or reimburse attorney’s fees and expenses of a non-employee director or officer seeking indemnification as they are incurred, provided the non-\nemployee director or officer executes an agreement to repay the amount to be paid or reimbursed if there is a final determination by a court of competent jurisdiction that such\nperson is not entitled to indemnification.\nFuture legislation or executive or private sector actions may increase the difficulty and cost for us to commercialize our products and adversely affect the prices obtained for\nsuch products.\nIn the U.S., there have been and continue to be a number of legislative initiatives to contain healthcare costs. For example, in March 2010, the Affordable Care Act (the\n“ACA”), was enacted, which substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers, and significantly impacted the U.S. pharmaceutical\nindustry.\nSince its enactment, there have been numerous judicial, administrative, executive, and legislative challenges to certain aspects of the ACA, and we expect there will be\nadditional challenges and amendments to the ACA in the future. If any of these developments continue the downward pressure on pharmaceutical pricing, especially under the\nMedicare program, or increase regulatory burdens and operating costs, it could adversely impact our business. We cannot predict what effect further changes to the ACA would\nhave on our business.\nIn addition, government price reporting and payment regulations are complex, and we will be required to continually assess the methods by which we plan to calculate and\nreport any future pricing in accordance with these obligations. Our methodologies for calculations are inherently subjective and may be subject to review and challenge by various\ngovernment agencies, which may disagree with our interpretation. If the government disagrees with our reported calculations, we may need to restate the previously reported data\nand could be subject to additional financial and legal liability.\nFurther, the increasing cost of healthcare as a percentage of GDP and the massive and increasing deferred liabilities behind most governmental healthcare programs (such\nas Medicare and Medicaid and state and local healthcare programs especially for retirement benefits) continue to be an economic challenge which threatens the overall economic\nhealth of the U.S. High cost healthcare products and therapies that are early in their life cycle are attractive targets for parties that believe that the cost of healthcare must be better\ncontrolled and significantly reduced. Pharmaceutical prices and healthcare reform have been debated and acted upon by legislators for many years. Future legislation or executive or\nprivate sector actions related to healthcare reform could materially and adversely affect our business by reducing our ability to generate revenue at prices sufficient to reward for the\nrisks and costs of pharmaceutical development, to raise capital, and to market our products.\n50\nTable of Contents\nThere is no assurance that federal or state healthcare reform will not adversely affect our future business and financial results, and we cannot predict how future federal or\nstate legislative, judicial or administrative changes relating to healthcare reform and third-party payers will affect the pharmaceutical industry in general and our business in\nparticular.\nEven if we are able to commercialize any drug candidate, such drug candidate may become subject to unfavorable pricing regulations or third-party coverage and\nreimbursement policies, which would harm our business.\nOur ability to commercialize any products successfully will depend, in part, on the extent to which coverage and adequate reimbursement for these products and related\ntreatments will be available from third-party payors, such as government authorities, private healthcare insurers and health maintenance organizations. Patients who are prescribed\nmedications for the treatment of their conditions generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the costs associated with their prescription drugs. Coverage and\nadequate reimbursement from government healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and private healthcare insurers are critical to new product acceptance. Patients are\nunlikely to use our future products, if any, unless coverage is provided and reimbursement is adequate to cover a significant portion of the cost.\nCost-containment is a priority in the U.S. healthcare industry and elsewhere. As a result, government authorities and other third-party payors have attempted to control\ncosts by limiting coverage and the amount of reimbursement for particular medications. Increasingly, third-party payors are requiring that drug companies provide them with\npredetermined discounts from list prices and are challenging the prices charged for medical products. Third-party payors also may request additional clinical evidence beyond the\ndata required to obtain marketing approval, requiring a company to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-\neffectiveness of its products. Commercial third-party payors often rely upon Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their reimbursement rates, but also have\ntheir own methods and approval process apart from Medicare determinations. Therefore, coverage and reimbursement for pharmaceutical products in the U.S. can differ\nsignificantly from payor to payor. We cannot be sure that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be available for any product that we commercialize and, if reimbursement is\navailable, that the level of reimbursement will be adequate. Coverage and reimbursement may impact the demand for, or the price of, any drug candidate for which we obtain\nmarketing approval. If coverage and reimbursement are not available or are available only at limited levels, we may not be able to successfully commercialize any drug candidate\nfor which we obtain marketing approval.\nAdditionally, the regulations that govern regulatory approvals, pricing and reimbursement for new drugs and therapeutic biologics vary widely from country to country.\nSome countries require approval of the sale price of a drug or therapeutic biologic before it can be marketed. In many countries, the pricing review period begins after marketing\napproval is granted. In some foreign markets, prescription pharmaceutical pricing remains subject to continuing governmental control even after initial approval is granted. As a\nresult, we might obtain regulatory approval for a product in a particular country, but then be subject to price regulations that delay our commercial launch of the product, possibly\nfor lengthy time periods, and negatively impact the revenues we are able to generate from the sale of the product in that country. Adverse pricing limitations may hinder our ability\nto recoup our investment in one or more drug candidates, even if our drug candidates obtain regulatory approval.\nPolitically divided governmental actions and related political actions outside of government can impact the FDA’s role in the timely and effective review of new pharmaceutical\nproducts in the U.S. and our business may be adversely impacted.\nIn recent years, there has been significant political conflict around budgeting and governmental funding of operations in the U.S. Government. Shutdowns or threats to\ngovernment shutdowns are recurring events. In the past, these events have, limited the FDA to activities necessary to address imminent threats to human life and to activities funded\nby carry-over user fees. Future government shutdowns or other activities which limit the financial resources available to the FDA (and in particular to the Center for Drug\nEvaluation and Research) will delay the processing of new product drug development submissions, reviews, and approvals and other required regulatory actions. Such delays will\nadversely impact our business and financial condition.\n51\nTable of Contents\nEffective collaboration with the FDA for the approval of drug candidates is a highly demanding process which can result in increased time and expense to gain approvals.\nOur Company has in-house expertise and experience in the management of drug approvals. Qualified consultants and drug research organizations are also available to aid\nin our drug approval process; however, there is a meaningful risk that discussions and interactions inherent in the drug approval process and future developments or new\nimprovements will result in delays, added expenses and new scientific/medical requirements which will cause adverse financial results and will likely impact the price of the\nCompany’s stock.\nFuture tax reform measures may negatively impact our financial position.\nTax reform measures are unpredictable and can change as the U.S. Congress and executive leadership changes. For example, on December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs\nAct of 2017 was signed into law that significantly revised the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”). It is difficult to predict what future tax reform measures, if\nany, could be implemented and the extent to which they will impact our financial condition and our business.\nForeign currency exchange rates may adversely affect our consolidated financial statements.\nSales and purchases in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar expose us to fluctuations in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. Dollar and may adversely affect our\nconsolidated financial statements. Increased strength of the U.S. Dollar increases the effective price of our future drug products sold in U.S. Dollars into other countries, which may\nrequire us to lower our prices or adversely affect sales to the extent we do not increase local currency prices. Decreased strength of the U.S. Dollar could adversely affect the cost of\nmaterials, products and services we purchase overseas. Sales and expenses of our non-U.S. businesses are also translated into U.S. Dollars for reporting purposes and the\nstrengthening or weakening of the U.S. Dollar could result in unfavorable foreign currency translation and transaction effects. In addition, certain of our businesses may in the\nfuture invoice customers in a currency other than the business’ functional currency, and movements in the invoiced currency relative to the functional currency could also result in\nunfavorable foreign currency translation and transaction effects. We also face exchange rate risk from our investments in subsidiaries owned and operated in foreign countries.\nOur anticipated operating expenses and capital expenditures over the next year are based upon our management’s estimates of possible future events. Actual amounts and the\ncost of new conditions could differ materially from those estimated by our management.\nDevelopment of pharmaceuticals and cancer drugs is extremely risky and unpredictable. We have estimated operating expenses and capital expenditures over the next year\nbased on certain assumptions. Any change in the assumptions could cause the actual results to vary substantially from the anticipated expenses and expenditures and could result in\nmaterial differences in actual versus forecasted expenses or expenditures. Furthermore, all of the factors are subject to the effect of unforeseeable future events. The estimates of\ncapital expenditures and operating expenses represent forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. Prospective investors are cautioned that any\nsuch forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks and uncertainties. Actual events or results may differ materially from those discussed in\nthe forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including the risk factors set forth under this “Risk Factors” section in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThe financial and operational projections that we may make from time to time are subject to inherent risks.\nThe projections that we provide herein or our management may provide from time to time (including, but not limited to, our success in raising strategic and substantial\nfinancial resources, the cost and timing of our clinical trials, clinical and regulatory timelines, production and supply matters, commercial launch dates, and other financial or\noperational matters) reflect numerous assumptions made by our management, including assumptions with respect to our specific as well as general business, regulatory, economic,\nmarket and financial conditions and other matters, all of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond our control. Accordingly, there is a risk that the assumptions\nmade in preparing the projections, or the projections themselves, will prove inaccurate. There may be differences between actual and projected results, and actual results may be\nmaterially different from those contained in the projections. The inclusion of the projections in this Annual Report on Form 10-K should not be regarded as an indication that our\nmanagement considered or consider the projections to be a guaranteed prediction of future events, and the projections should not be relied upon as such. See “Cautionary Statement\nConcerning Forward-Looking Statements.”\n52\nTable of Contents\nOur present and potential future international operations may expose us to business, political, operational, and financial risks associated with doing business outside of the\nU.S.\nOur business is subject to risks associated with conducting business internationally. Some of our suppliers and clinical research organizations and clinical trial sites are\nlocated outside of the U.S. Furthermore, if we or any future collaborator succeeds in developing any products, we anticipate marketing them in the EU, the United Kingdom and\nother jurisdictions in addition to the U.S. If approved, we or our collaborator may hire sales representatives and conduct physician and patient association outreach activities outside\nof the U.S. Doing business internationally involves a number of risks, including but not limited to:\n● multiple, conflicting and changing laws and regulations such as privacy regulations, tax laws, export and import restrictions, employment laws, regulatory\nrequirements, and other governmental approvals, permits and licenses which can vary jurisdictions to jurisdiction with different degrees of review and enforcement;\n● failure by us to obtain and maintain regulatory approvals for the use of our products in various countries;\n● rejection or qualification of foreign clinical trial data by the competent authorities of other countries;\n● additional potentially relevant third-party patent and other intellectual property rights that may be necessary to develop and commercialize our products and drug\ncandidates;\n● complexities and difficulties in obtaining, maintaining, enforcing and defending our patent and other intellectual property rights;\n● difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations by a small-scale organization;\n● complexities associated with managing multiple payor reimbursement regimes, government payors or patient self-pay systems;\n● limits, as a U.S.-based company, in our ability to penetrate international markets;\n● financial risks, such as longer payment cycles, difficulty collecting accounts receivable, the impact of local and regional financial crises on demand and payment for\nour products and exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations;\n● natural disasters, political and economic instability, including wars, terrorism and political unrest, outbreak of disease, boycotts, curtailment of trade and other\nbusiness restrictions, implementation of tariffs;\n● certain expenses including, among others, expenses for travel, translation and insurance; and\n● regulatory and compliance risks that relate to anti-corruption compliance and record-keeping that may fall within the purview of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices\nAct, its accounting provisions or its anti-bribery provisions or provisions of anti-corruption or anti-bribery laws in other countries.\nAny of these factors could harm our ongoing international clinical operations and supply chain, as well as any future international expansion and operations and,\nconsequently, our business, financial condition, prospects and results of operations.\n53\nTable of Contents\nWe are subject to U.S. and foreign anti-corruption and anti-money laundering laws with respect to our operations and non-compliance with such laws can subject us to\ncriminal or civil liability and harm our business.\nWe are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended (“the FCPA”), the U.S. domestic bribery statute contained in 18 U.S.C. § 201, the U.S. Travel\nAct, the USA PATRIOT Act, and possibly other state and national anti-bribery and anti-money laundering laws in countries in which we conduct activities. Anti-corruption laws are\ninterpreted broadly and prohibit companies and their employees, agents, third-party intermediaries, joint venture partners and collaborators from authorizing, promising, offering or\nproviding, directly or indirectly, improper payments or benefits to recipients in the public or private sector. We interact with officials and employees of government agencies and\ngovernment-affiliated hospitals, universities and other organizations. In addition, we may engage third-party intermediaries to promote our clinical research activities abroad or to\nobtain necessary permits, licenses and other regulatory approvals. We can be held liable for the corrupt or other illegal activities of these third-party intermediaries, our employees,\nrepresentatives, contractors, partners and agents, even if we do not explicitly authorize or have actual knowledge of such activities.\nWe have a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics which mandates compliance with the FCPA and other anti-corruption laws applicable to our business throughout the\nworld. However, we cannot assure you that our employees and third-party intermediaries will comply with this code or such anti-corruption laws. Noncompliance with anti-\ncorruption and anti-money laundering laws could subject us to whistleblower complaints, investigations, sanctions, settlements, prosecution, other enforcement actions,\ndisgorgement of profits, significant fines, damages, other civil and criminal penalties or injunctions, suspension or debarment from contracting with certain persons, the loss of\nexport privileges, reputational harm, adverse media coverage and other collateral consequences. If any subpoenas, investigations or other enforcement actions are launched, or\ngovernmental or other sanctions are imposed, or if we do not prevail in any possible civil or criminal litigation, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be\nmaterially harmed. In addition, responding to any action will likely result in a materially significant diversion of management’s attention and resources and significant defense and\ncompliance costs and other professional fees. In certain cases, enforcement authorities may even cause us to appoint an independent compliance monitor which can result in added\ncosts and administrative burdens.\nRisks Associated with our Common Stock\nExisting and new investors will experience dilution as a result of future sales or issuances of our common stock and future option exercises under our 2016 Stock Incentive\nPlan and any amendments to the plan.\nOur non-employee directors, employees, and certain of our consultants have been and will be issued equity and/or granted options that vest with the passage of time. Up to\na total of 5,100,000 shares of our common stock may be issued as stock options or restricted stock units under the Amended and Restated Monopar Therapeutics Inc. 2016 Stock\nIncentive Plan, and stock options for the purchase of up to 2,119,001 shares of our common stock have already been granted (1,553,867 stock options are exercisable) and are\noutstanding along with 410,136 restricted stock units that have been granted to non-employee directors and employees as of March 8, 2024. The issuance of such equity upon\nvesting of restricted stock units and/or the exercise of such options, and the grant of new equity awards, will dilute both our existing and our new investors. As of March 8, 2024,\n189,346 stock options have been exercised.\nOur existing and our new investors will also experience substantial dilution resulting from the issuance by us of equity securities in connection with certain transactions,\nincluding without limitation, future offering of shares in future fundraising efforts, intellectual property licensing, acquisition, or commercialization arrangements.\nHolders of the shares of our common stock will have no control of our operations or of decisions on major transactions.\nOur business and affairs are managed by or under the direction of our Board. Our stockholders are entitled to vote only on actions that require a stockholder vote under\nfederal or state law. Stockholder approval requires the consent and approval of holders of a majority or more of our outstanding stock. Shares of stock do not have cumulative\nvoting rights and therefore, holders of a majority of the shares of our outstanding stock will be able to elect all Board members. TacticGem, LLC (“TacticGem”) owns 7,166,667\nshares of common stock (41.06%). The limited liability company agreement requires TacticGem to pass through votes (including the vote for the election of directors) to its\nmembers in proportion to their membership percentages in TacticGem (57.367% owned by Tactic Pharma and 42.633% owned by Gem). As a result, Tactic Pharma, our initial\ninvestor, holds an approximately 24.51% beneficial interest in us and together with Gem’s beneficial ownership of approximately 17.50%, the two entities control a significant\nportion of our stock and will have substantial influence in the election of all Board members and control of our affairs. In addition, our Chief Executive Officer and director, as well\nas one of our other directors, are associated with Tactic Pharma.\n54\nTable of Contents\nThe interim analysis for our Validive Phase 2b/3 clinical program yielded a no-go decision resulting in a reduction of our stock price. If our stock price does not increase before\nthe Nasdaq extended deadline for regaining compliance or if we do not win an appeal for additional time, our business could be adversely impacted.\nThe termination of our Validive clinical trial due to the no-go decision at the end of March 2023 resulted in a decrease in our stock price. The closing bid price of our stock\nfell below $1.00 for more than 30 consecutive trading days and on August 28, 2023 we received a notice from Nasdaq stating that we are out of compliance with Nasdaq listing\nstandards giving us 180 days to regain compliance. On February 27, 2024, we were granted a second 180-day period to regain compliance by August 26, 2024. However, there can\nbe no assurance that we will regain compliance. If it is necessary to effect a reverse stock split to attempt to cure the bid price deficiency, the impacts on our stock price are\nuncertain and could be adverse. If we do not regain compliance, we would face delisting and it may have serious adverse consequences on our ability to raise funds, which may\ncause us to delay, restructure or otherwise reconsider our operations.\nOur failure to meet the other continued listing requirements of The Nasdaq Capital Market could result in a de-listing of our common stock.\nIf we fail to satisfy other continued listing requirements of The Nasdaq Capital Market, such as, but not limited to, the corporate governance requirements, the Nasdaq\nStock Market (“Nasdaq”) may take steps to de-list our common stock. Such a de-listing or the announcement of such de-listing will have a negative effect on the price of our\ncommon stock and would impair your ability to sell or purchase our common stock when you wish to do so. In the event of a de-listing, we would take actions to restore our\ncompliance with the Nasdaq listing requirements, but we can provide no assurance that any such action taken by us would allow our common stock to become listed again, stabilize\nthe market price or improve the liquidity of our common stock, prevent our common stock from dropping below the Nasdaq minimum bid price requirement or prevent future non-\ncompliance with the Nasdaq listing requirements.\nThe stock price of our common stock may be volatile or may decline regardless of our operating performance.\nThe market prices for securities of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies have historically been highly volatile, and the market has from time-to-time experienced\nsignificant price and volume fluctuations that appear to be unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. Our common stock has only been trading on the Nasdaq\nCapital Market since December 19, 2019, and has experienced significant volatility in market prices through March 8, 2024, ranging from a low of $0.274 to a high of\n$48.00. From time to time, whether in response to news releases or for uncertain reasons, our stock price has also experienced significant intraday volatility and volume changes.\nOur small public float and relatively low and inconsistent trading volumes exacerbate volatility.\nThe market price of our common stock is likely to remain highly volatile and may fluctuate substantially due to many factors, including:\n● announcements concerning the progress and success of our clinical trials, our ability to obtain regulatory approval for and commercialize our product candidates,\nincluding any requests we receive from the FDA or TGA for additional studies or data that result in delays in obtaining regulatory approval or launching our product\ncandidates, if approved;\n● unstable market conditions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology sectors or the economy as a whole;\n● price and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market;\n● the failure of our product candidates, if approved, to achieve anticipated commercial success; in the time projected by securities analysts and others;\n● announcements of disruptions in supply and manufacturing of radioisotopes or raw materials required to manufacture radioisotopes, and any events that may disrupt\nthe timely supply of radiopharmaceuticals to clinical sites;\n● announcements of the clinical success, NDA approval or introduction of new products by us or our direct competitors;\n● announcements of developments concerning product development results or intellectual property rights of others;\n● litigation or public concern about the safety and/or efficacy of our potential or approved products;\n55\nTable of Contents\n● actual fluctuations in our quarterly or annual operating results, and concerns by investors that such fluctuations may occur in the future and are indicative of internal\nproblems;\n● deviations in our operating results from the estimates of securities analysts or other analyst comments;\n● additions or departures of key personnel;\n● healthcare reform legislation, including measures directed at controlling the pricing of pharmaceutical products, and third-party coverage and reimbursement policies;\n● announcements or publicity concerning current or future strategic collaborations;\n● discussion of our Company, our stock price or our potential future market value by the financial and scientific press and online investor communities; and\n● market responses to the fluctuating conditions of COVID-19 or any future pandemics or to the Russia-Ukraine war or Israel-Hamas war.\nWe may become involved in securities class action litigation that could divert management’s attention and harm our business.\nThe stock markets have from time-to-time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market prices for the common stock of\nbiotechnology and pharmaceutical companies. Our stock price has experienced such fluctuations since our initial public offering. These broad market fluctuations may cause the\nmarket price of our stock to advance or decline. In the past, securities class action litigation has often been brought against a company following a decline in the market price of its\nsecurities. This risk is especially relevant for us because biotechnology and biopharmaceutical companies have experienced significant stock price volatility in recent years. We may\nbecome involved in this type of litigation in the future. Litigation often is expensive and diverts management’s attention and resources, which could adversely affect our business.\nSubstantial amounts of our outstanding shares may be sold into the market. If there are substantial sales of shares of our common stock, the price of our common stock could\ndecline.\nThe price of our common stock could decline if there are substantial sales of our common stock, particularly sales by our non-employee directors, executive officers and\nsignificant stockholders, or if there is a large number of shares of our common stock available for sale and the market perceives that sales will occur. We have 17,454,925\noutstanding shares of our common stock as of March 8, 2024. A substantial portion of our outstanding shares of common stock are currently held by non-employee directors,\nexecutive officers and other affiliates and are subject to volume limitations under Rule 144 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (Securities Act).\nOur largest stockholders have rights, subject to some conditions, to require us to file registration statements covering their shares or to include their shares in registration\nstatements that we may file for ourselves or our stockholders. We have also registered shares of common stock that we have issued and may issue under our employee equity\nincentive plans. These shares are able to be sold freely in the public market upon issuance, subject to existing internal practices which prohibit sales under certain circumstances and\nvolume limitations for affiliates. The market price of the shares of our common stock could decline as a result of the sale of a substantial number of our shares of common stock in\nthe public market or the perception in the market that the holders of a large number of shares intend to sell their shares.\nOur ability to use our net operating loss carry-forwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited.\nUnder Section 382 of the Code, if a corporation undergoes an “ownership change” (generally defined as a greater than 50% change, by value, in its equity ownership over a\nthree-year period), the corporation’s ability to use its pre-change net operating loss carry-forwards and other pre-change tax attributes (such as research tax credits) to offset its post-\nchange income may be limited. We believe that additional fundraising efforts in the next three years, may trigger an “ownership change” limitation in the near future. As a result, if\nwe earn net taxable income, our ability to use our pre-change net operating loss carry-forwards to offset U.S. federal taxable income will be subject to limitations, which could\nresult in increased future tax liability to us had we not been subject to such limitations.\n56\nTable of Contents\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock will depend in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. If one or\nmore of the analysts who covers us downgrades our stock or publishes inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price may decline. If one or more of these\nanalysts ceases coverage of our Company or fails to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our stock could decrease, which might cause our stock price and trading volume to\ndecline.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future and, as a result, your ability to achieve a return on your investment will depend on appreciation in the price of our\ncommon stock.\nWe have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our capital stock, and we do not intend to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Any determination to pay\ndividends in the future will be at the discretion of our Board. Accordingly, investors must rely on sales of their common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as\nthe only way to realize any future gains as a return on their investments.\nThere can be no assurance that we will ever provide liquidity to our investors through a sale of our Company.\nWhile acquisitions of pharmaceutical companies like ours are not uncommon, potential investors are cautioned that no assurances can be given that any form of merger,\ncombination, or sale of our Company will take place or that any merger, combination, or sale, even if consummated, would provide liquidity or a profit for our investors. You\nshould not invest in our Company with the expectation that we will be able to sell the business in order to provide liquidity or a profit for our investors.\nDelaware law and provisions in our amended and restated bylaws could make a merger, tender offer or proxy contest difficult, thereby depressing the potential trading price of\nour common stock.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could make an acquisition of us difficult, limit attempts by our stockholders to replace or\nremove our current management or Board and adversely affect our stock price.\nProvisions of our amended and restated bylaws may delay or discourage transactions involving an actual or potential change in our control or change in our management,\nincluding transactions in which stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares, or transactions that our stockholders might otherwise deem to be in their best\ninterests. Therefore, these provisions could adversely affect the price of our stock. Among other things, our amended and restated bylaws:\n● provide that all vacancies on our Board may only be filled by our Board and not by stockholders;\n● allow the holders of a plurality of the shares of common stock entitled to vote in any election of directors to elect all of the directors standing for election, if they\nshould so choose; and\n● provide that special meetings of our stockholders may be called only by our Board.\nIn addition, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which generally\nprohibits a Delaware corporation from engaging in any of a broad range of business combinations with any “interested” stockholder for a period of three years following the date on\nwhich the stockholder became an “interested” stockholder.\n57\nTable of Contents\nItem 1C. Cybersecurity\nLike many companies, we face significant and persistent cybersecurity risks. The small size of our organization and limited resources could exacerbate these risks.\nHowever, we are committed to maintaining governance and oversight of these risks and to implementing standard operating procedures (“SOPs”) and training to help us assess,\nidentify, monitor and respond to these risks. Some examples of procedures implemented include an internal inventory of software and database exposures, a risk analysis of\ndatabase vendors, review of vendor back-up, security and privacy measures. In addition, we are in the process of drafting an internal cybersecurity policy which will be the basis for\nSOPs and training. Our internal server includes a firewall and is scanned for malware several times a day and the data is backed up in the Cloud for ease of restoration as needed.\nEmployees are trained to avoid phishing emails and our internal controls system is designed to mitigate the risk of payments of fraudulent invoices. While we have not, as of the\ndate of this Form 10-K, experienced cybersecurity threats, including as a result of a prior incident, that resulted in, or that we believe is reasonably likely to result in, a material\nadverse impact to our business strategy, results of operations or financial condition, there can be no guarantee that we will not experience a material incident in the future. Such\nincidents, whether successful or not, could impair our access to critical information including confidential operational and patient records and have the potential to be costly to\neffect remedies. See \"Risk Factors\" for more information on our cybersecurity risks.\nWe aim to incorporate industry best practices for companies of our size and financial strength throughout our cybersecurity program. Our cybersecurity strategy focuses on\nimplementing effective and efficient controls, technologies, and training programs to assess, identify, and manage material cybersecurity risks. Our Board of Directors has ultimate\noversight of cybersecurity risk and has established a Cybersecurity committee headed by our Chief Financial Officer. As a small organization with limited resources, we do not\nhave a dedicated cybersecurity organization or employee personnel with specific cybersecurity expertise. Our Chief Financial Officer was chosen to head our Cybersecurity\ncommittee due to more generalized management experience with financial and operating systems and oversight of third-party providers. Our Management team and our Board of\nDirectors regularly review our cybersecurity program which generally occurs at least annually, or more frequently as determined to be necessary or advisable.\nItem 2. Properties\nWhile we are currently on a month-to-month lease for our executive headquarters at 1000 Skokie Blvd in the Village of Wilmette, Illinois for our corporate offices, we may\nenter into a longer-term lease in the next twelve months.\nItem 3. Legal Proceedings\nWe are currently not, and to date have never been, a party to any adverse material legal proceedings.\n58\nTable of Contents\nPART II\nItem 5. Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities\nMarket Information\nOur common stock is listed under the symbol “MNPR” on the Nasdaq Capital Market.\nHolders\nAs of March 8, 2024, there were 17,454,925 shares of our common stock outstanding held by 30 holders of record and approximately 3,200 beneficial stockholders.\nDividends\nWe have never paid cash dividends on any of our capital stock and we currently intend to retain our future earnings, if any, to fund the development and growth of our\nbusiness. We do not intend to pay cash dividends to holders of our common stock in the foreseeable future.\nRegistration Rights\nWe are subject to an agreement with TacticGem, LLC (“TacticGem”), our largest stockholder, which obligates us to file a Form S-3 or other appropriate form of registration\nstatement covering the resale of any of our common stock by TacticGem, or its members Gem Pharmaceuticals, LLC, or Tactic Pharma, LLC, upon direction by TacticGem.\nThrough the date hereof, TacticGem has not required us to file such a resale registration statement, although there can be no assurance we will not be required to do so in the future.\nRecent Sales of Unregistered Securities.\nThere were no securities issuances that were not registered under the Securities Act during the reporting period.\nItem 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our financial statements and related notes appearing\nat the end of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K,\nincluding information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business and related financing activities, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and\nuncertainties. You should read the “Risk Factors” section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, Item 1A, for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ\nmaterially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis.\n59\nTable of Contents\nOverview\nWe are a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing innovative treatments for cancer patients. We are building a drug development pipeline through\nthe licensing and acquisition of therapeutics in late preclinical or in clinical development stages. We leverage our scientific and clinical experience to help reduce the risk of and\naccelerate the clinical development of our drug product candidates.\nFinancial Status\nOur cash, cash equivalents and investments as of December 31, 2023, were $7.3 million. As discussed further below and elsewhere in this Annual Report, we expect that our\ncurrent funds will be sufficient at least through June 30, 2025 for us to: (1) conduct and conclude our first-in-human clinical trial with our MNPR-101-Zr radiopharmaceutical\nprogram; (2) continue our ongoing open-label Phase 1b camsirubicin clinical trial; and (3) continue to research MNPR-202. We will require additional funding to further advance our\nclinical and preclinical programs and we anticipate that we will seek to raise additional capital within the next 12 months to fund our future operations.\nOur primary funding source over the past three years was sales of shares of our common stock under at-the-market sales programs through Capital on Demand™ Sales\nAgreements with JonesTrading Institutional Services LLC (“Jones Trading”). For the year ended December 31, 2023, we sold 1,793,441 shares of our common stock at an average\ngross price per share of $1.21 for net proceeds of $2,072,503 after fees, commissions and expenses of $98,230.\nFrom January 1 to March 8, 2024, we sold 2,545,305 shares of our common stock at an average gross price per share of $1.29 for net proceeds of $3,194,310, after fees and\ncommissions of $81,932.\nMNPR-101 for Radiopharmaceutical Use, Development Update\nOur proprietary, novel MNPR-101 radiopharmaceutical program is a first-in-class urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (\"uPAR\") targeting radiopharmaceutical for\nadvanced tumors. The Company's radiopharmaceutical development team has conjugated MNPR-101, its proprietary first-in-class humanized monoclonal antibody that is highly\nselective against uPAR, to imaging and therapeutic radioisotopes, to develop highly precise imaging and therapeutic radiopharmaceutical agents that have the potential to image and\neradicate tumors expressing uPAR while sparing healthy tissues. In February 2024, the Company announced promising preclinical data and regulatory clearance in Australia to\ncommence a first-in-human Phase 1 clinical trial of MNPR-101-Zr for imaging tumors in patients with advanced cancers. Monopar is moving aggressively towards opening\nenrollment to patients in this Phase 1.\nCamsirubicin Clinical Update\nThe Phase 1b open-label, dose-escalating clinical trial of camsirubicin in patients with advanced soft tissue sarcoma (“ASTS”) is currently ongoing and enrolling in the fifth\ndose-level cohort (650 mg/m2), which is nearly 2.5x the highest dose evaluated in any prior camsirubicin clinical trial (265 mg/m2).\nMNPR-202 and Related Analogs Updates\nMNPR-202, an analog of camsirubicin designed to potentially treat doxorubicin- and camsirubicin-resistant cancers, is being tested in preclinical models by our collaborator,\nthe Cancer Science Institute of Singapore at the National University of Singapore.\nDiscontinuation of Validive Development\nOn March 27, 2023, we announced that based on Validive not meeting the pre-specified efficacy threshold in our interim clinical trial data analysis, we terminated the study,\ndiscontinued the development of Validive and subsequently terminated the license with Onxeo, SA.\n60\nTable of Contents\nOur Strategy\nOur management team has extensive experience in developing therapeutics and medical technologies through global regulatory approval and commercialization. In\naggregate, companies they co-founded have achieved four drug approvals and three diagnostic medical imaging device approvals in the U.S. and the EU, successfully sold an asset\ndeveloped by management which subsequently had a positive Phase 3 clinical trial, sold two oncology-focused diagnostic imaging businesses to Fortune Global 1000 firms, and\ncompleted the clinical and commercial development and ultimately the sale of a commercial biopharmaceutical company for over $800 million in cash. In addition, the team has\nsupported multiple regulatory submissions with the FDA and EMA and launched multiple drugs in the U.S and the EU. Understanding the preclinical, clinical, regulatory and\ncommercial development processes and hurdles are key factors in successful drug development and the expertise demonstrated by our management team across all of these areas\nincreases the probability of success in advancing the product candidates in our product pipeline. Our strategic goal is to acquire, develop and commercialize promising oncology\nproduct candidates that address important unmet medical needs of cancer patients. Five key elements of our strategy to achieve this goal are to:\n● Continue the development of MNPR-101 for radiopharmaceutical use as a therapeutic as well as a diagnostic imaging agent. Based on promising preclinical\nresults utilizing radiolabeled MNPR-101, we have been cleared to conduct a Phase 1 dosimetry clinical trial of MNPR-101-Zr in patients with advanced cancers in\nAustralia.\n● Advance the clinical development of camsirubicin, by pursuing indications where doxorubicin has demonstrated efficacy. ASTS will be the first indication,\nwhich is anticipated to allow camsirubicin to go head-to-head against doxorubicin, the current first-line treatment. In this indication, camsirubicin previously\ndemonstrated clinical benefit (stable disease or partial response) in 52.6% of patients evaluable for tumor progression in a single-arm Phase 2 study. Clinical benefit\nwas proportional to dose and was consistently observed at higher cumulative doses of camsirubicin (>1000 mg/m2). Camsirubicin was very well tolerated in this\nPhase 2 study and underscored the ability to potentially administer camsirubicin without restriction as to cumulative dose (doxorubicin is limited due to heart toxicity\nto 450 mg/m2 cumulative dose). Our current ongoing Phase 1b clinical trial continues towards establishing a new, higher recommended dose for the next Phase 2\nASTS clinical trial.\n● Continue the development of MNPR-202 and related analogs in multiple types of cancers. The 2-pyrrilino camsirubicin analog (MNPR-202) and related analogs\nrepresent proprietary compositions of matter designed to retain the non-cardiotoxic backbone of camsirubicin yet exhibit novel features in terms of antitumor activity\nand mechanism that distinguish these analogs from camsirubicin as well as from doxorubicin, potentially addressing camsirubicin- and doxorubicin-resistant cancers.\n● Expand our drug development pipeline through in-licensing and acquisition of product candidates. We plan to continue the expansion of our drug development\npipeline through acquiring or in-licensing additional product candidates, particularly those that leverage existing scientific and clinical data that helps reduce the risks\nof the next steps in clinical development.\n● Utilize the expertise and prior experience of our team in the areas of asset acquisition, drug development and commercialization to establish ourselves as a\nleading biopharmaceutical company. Our senior executive team has relevant experience in biopharmaceutical in-licensing and acquisitions as well as developing\nproduct candidates through approval and commercialization. In aggregate, our team has co-founded BioMarin Pharmaceutical (Nasdaq: BMRN), Sensant Corp\n(acquired by Siemens), American BioOptics (assets acquired by Olympus), Raptor Pharmaceuticals ($800 million sale to Horizon Therapeutics), and Tactic Pharma,\nLLC (“Tactic Pharma”) (sale of lead asset, choline tetrathiomolybdate, was ultimately acquired by Alexion in June 2018 for $764 million; Alexion was subsequently\nacquired by AstraZeneca).\n61\nTable of Contents\nImplications of Being an Emerging Growth Company\nWe qualify as an “emerging growth company” as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (“JOBS Act”). An emerging growth company may take\nadvantage of specified reduced reporting burdens that are otherwise applicable generally to public companies. These provisions include, but are not limited to:\n● inclusion of only two years, as compared to three years, of audited financial statements in addition to any required unaudited interim financial statements with\ncorrespondingly reduced “Management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” disclosures;\n● an exemption from the auditor attestation requirement in the assessment of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002\n(“Sarbanes-Oxley Act”);\n● an exemption from compliance with any new requirements adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (“PCAOB”) requiring mandatory audit firm\nrotation;\n● reduced disclosure about executive compensation arrangements; and\n● an exemption from the requirement to seek non-binding advisory votes on executive compensation or golden parachute arrangements.\nWe expect to take advantage of these provisions until we are no longer an emerging growth company. We will remain an emerging growth company until the earliest of (1)\nthe last day of the year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the completion of our initial public offering which is December 2024, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue\nof at least $1.235 billion or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds\n$700 million as of the prior June 30th, and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt during the prior three-year period. We expect to no\nlonger qualify as an emerging growth company at the end of 2024.\nWe have elected to take advantage of certain of the reduced disclosure obligations in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and may elect to take advantage of other reduced\nreporting requirements in future filings. As a result, the information that we provide to our stockholders may be reduced and/or less detailed than what you might find from other\npublic reporting companies.\nIn addition, we are also a “smaller reporting company” as defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and have elected to take advantage of certain of the scaled back\ndisclosure requirements available to smaller reporting companies such as avoiding the extensive narrative disclosure required of other reporting companies, particularly in the\ndescription of executive compensation. Our status as a smaller reporting company will not be impacted by the loss of emerging growth company status at the end of 2024, so we\nmay continue to take advantage of these scaled disclosure requirements so long as we qualify. In addition, the loss of emerging growth status will not impact our “non-accelerated\nfiler” status, which also provides an exemption from the auditor attestation requirement with respect to internal control over financial reporting.\n62\nTable of Contents\nRevenues\nWe are an emerging growth company. We have no approved drugs and have not generated any revenues. To date, we have engaged in acquiring or in-licensing drug product\ncandidates, entering into collaboration agreements for testing and clinical development of our drug product candidates and providing the infrastructure to support the clinical\ndevelopment of our drug product candidates. We do not anticipate commercial revenues from operations until we complete testing and development of one of our drug product\ncandidates and obtain marketing approval or we sell, enter into a collaborative marketing arrangement, or out-license one of our drug product candidates to another party. See\n“Liquidity and Capital Resources”.\nRecently Issued and Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, there were two recently issued accounting pronouncements that are described in more detail in Note 2 of our consolidated\nfinancial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates\nWhile our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in Note 2 of our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form\n10-K, we believe the following accounting policies to be critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.\nClinical Trials Accruals\nWe accrue and expense the costs for clinical trial activities performed by third parties based upon estimates of the percentage of work completed over the life of the\nindividual study in accordance with agreements established with contract research organizations, service providers, and clinical trial sites. We estimate the amounts to accrue based\nupon discussions with internal clinical personnel and external service providers as to progress or stage of completion of trials or services and the agreed upon fee to be paid for such\nservices. Costs of setting up clinical trial sites for participation in the trials are expensed immediately as R&D expenses. Clinical trial site costs related to patient screening and\nenrollment are accrued as patients are screened/entered into the trial.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe account for stock-based compensation arrangements with employees, non-employee directors and consultants using a fair value method, which requires the recognition\nof compensation expense for costs related to all stock-based compensation grants, including stock option and restricted stock unit (“RSU”) grants. The fair value method requires us\nto estimate the fair value of stock-based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model or the closing stock price on the date of grant in the case of RSUs.\nStock-based compensation costs for stock awards granted to our employees, non-employee directors and consultants are based on the fair value of the underlying\ninstruments calculated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model on the date of grant for stock options and using the closing stock price on the date of grant for RSUs and\nrecognized as expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is the vesting period. Determining the appropriate fair value model and related assumptions\nrequires judgment, including selecting methods for estimating our future stock price volatility and expected holding term. For options granted in 2023, the expected volatility rates\nare estimated based on our actual historical volatility over the three-year period from our initial public offering on December 18, 2019, through December 31, 2022. The expected\nterm for stock options granted during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, was estimated using the simplified method. Forfeitures only include actual forfeitures to-date as\nthe Company accounts for forfeitures as they occur due to a limited history of forfeitures. We have not paid dividends and do not anticipate paying a cash dividend in future vesting\nperiods and, accordingly, use an expected dividend yield of zero. The risk-free interest rate is based on the rate of U.S. Treasury securities with maturities consistent with the\nestimated expected term of the awards.\n63\nTable of Contents\nResults of Operations\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2023, and December 31, 2022\nThe following table summarizes the results of our operations for the years ended December 31, 2023, and 2022:\nYear Ended December 31,\n(in thousands) 2023 2022 Variance\nResearch and development expenses $ 5,600 $ 7,592 $ (1,992)\nGeneral and administrative expenses 3,231 2,945 286\nTotal operating expenses 8,831 10,537 (1,706)\nOperating loss (8,831) (10,537) 1,706\nInterest income 429 21 408\nNet loss $ (8,402) $ (10,516) $ 2,114\nResearch and Development (“R&D”) Expenses\nR&D expenses for the year ended December 31, 2023 were $5,600,000, compared to $7,592,000 for the year ended December 31, 2022. This represents a decrease of\n$1,992,000 primarily attributed to (1) a $1,375,000 decrease for Validive clinical trial and manufacturing costs as a result of the termination of that program in March 2023, (2) a\n$904,000 decrease for a reduction in camsirubicin clinical trial and manufacturing costs, (3) a $126,000 decrease in R&D salaries, partially offset by (1) a $408,000 increase related\nto MNPR-101 radiopharma activity and (2) a $5,000 net increase in other R&D expenses.\nGeneral and Administrative (\"G&A\") Expenses\nG&A expenses for the year ended December 31, 2023, were $3,231,000, compared to $2,945,000 for the year ended December 31, 2022. This represents an increase of\n$286,000 primarily attributed to a $220,000 increase in G&A personnel salaries, bonuses, benefits and stock-based compensation for annual (non-cash) equity grants, and a $66,000\nnet increase in other G&A expenses.\nInterest Income\nInterest income for the year ended December 31, 2023, increased by $408,000 versus the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase is due to interest earned on treasury\nbills and money market accounts that yielded higher interest rates in 2023.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nSources of Liquidity\nWe have incurred losses and cumulative negative cash flows from operations since we commenced operations resulting in an accumulated deficit of approximately\n$60.2 million as of December 31, 2023. We anticipate that we will continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future. We expect that our R&D and G&A expenses will increase to\nenable the execution of our strategic plan. As a result, we anticipate that we will seek to raise additional capital within the next 12 months to fund our future operations. We will\nseek to obtain needed capital through a combination of equity offerings, including at-the-market sales programs, debt financings, strategic collaborations and grant funding. To date,\nwe have funded our operations through net proceeds from the initial public offering of our common stock, net proceeds from sales of our common stock through at-the-market sales\nprograms, private placements of our preferred and common stock, and the net receipt of funds related to the acquisition of camsirubicin. We anticipate that the currently available\nfunds as of March 8, 2024, will fund our planned operations at least through June 30, 2025.\nWe invest our cash equivalents in two money market accounts and U.S. Treasury Bills.\n64\nTable of Contents\nCash Flows\nThe following table provides information regarding our cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2023, and 2022.\nYear Ended December 31,\n(in thousands) 2023 2022 Variance\nNet cash used in operating activities $ (7,858) $ (7,228) $ (630)\nNet cash provided by (used in) investing activities 4,928 (4,919) 9,847\nNet cash provided by financing activities 2,027 33 1,994\nEffect of exchange rates (17) (4) (13)\nNet decrease in cash and cash equivalents $ (920) $ (12,118) $ 11,198\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, we had net cash outflows of $920,000 and $12,118,000, respectively, a decrease of $11,198,000. During 2022, we\nbegan investing our idle cash due to the rising interest rates, resulting in a significant increase in cash used in investing activities. During 2023, we had net cash provided\nby investing activities as some of our investments made in 2022 matured and were used in operating activities, as well as higher net cash provided by financing activities due to\nmore funds raised from sales of our common stock under an at-the-market sales program compared to 2022.\nCash Flow Used in Operating Activities\nThe cash flow used in operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to the year ended December 31, 2022 was essentially flat.\nCash Flow Used in Investing Activities\nThe increase to cash flow provided by investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to cash used in investing activities during the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022, of $9,847,000 was related to the fact that our investment in U.S. Treasury Bills commenced in December 2022 with maturities reinvested or used as working\ncapital throughout 2023.\nCash Flow Provided by Financing Activities\nThe increase in cash flow provided by financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to the year ended December 31, 2022, of $1,994,000 was\nprimarily due to higher net proceeds from sales of our common stock through an at-the-market sales program.\nFuture Funding Requirements\nTo date, we have not generated any revenue from product sales. We do not know when, or if, we will generate any revenue from product sales. We do not expect to generate\nany revenue from product sales or royalties unless and until we obtain regulatory approval of and commercialize any of our current or future drug product candidates or we out-\nlicense or sell a drug product candidate to another party. At the same time, we expect our expenses to increase in connection with our ongoing development activities, particularly as\nwe continue the research, development, future preclinical studies and clinical trials of, and seek regulatory approval for, our current and future drug product candidates. If we obtain\nregulatory approval of any of our current or future drug product candidates, we will need substantial additional funding for commercialization requirements and our continuing drug\nproduct development operations.\nAs a company, we have not completed development through marketing approvals of any therapeutic products. We expect to continue to incur significant increases in\nexpenses and increasing operating losses for the foreseeable future. We anticipate that our expenses will increase substantially as we:\n● continue the clinical and preclinical activities of MNPR-101-Zr and MNPR-101-RIT to image and treat cancer;\n● advance the clinical development for camsirubicin;\n● continue the preclinical activities, and potentially later-on enter clinical development, of MNPR-202 (and related analogs) for various cancer indications;\n65\nTable of Contents\n● acquire and/or license additional pipeline drug product candidates and pursue the future preclinical and/or clinical development of such drug product candidates;\n● seek regulatory approvals for any of our current and future drug product candidates that successfully complete registration clinical trials;\n● establish or purchase the services of a sales, marketing and distribution infrastructure to commercialize any products for which we obtain marketing approval;\n● develop or contract for manufacturing/quality capabilities or establish a reliable, high quality supply chain sufficient to support our clinical requirements and to\nprovide sufficient capacity to launch and supply the market for any product for which we obtain marketing approval; and\n● add or contract for required operational, financial and management information systems and capabilities and other specialized expert personnel to support our drug\nproduct candidate development and planned commercialization efforts.\nWe anticipate that the funds available as of March 8, 2024, will fund our obligations at least through June 30, 2025. We have based this estimate on assumptions that may\nprove to be wrong, and we could use our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect. Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the\ndevelopment and commercialization of our drug product candidates, and the extent to which we enter into collaborations with third parties to participate in the development and\ncommercialization of our drug product candidates, we are unable to accurately estimate with high reliability the amounts and timing required for increased capital outlays and\noperating expenditures associated with our current and anticipated drug product candidate development programs.\nOur future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including:\n● the progress of clinical development and regulatory interactions and approvals of our MNPR-101 radiopharma program;\n● the progress of clinical development and regulatory interactions and approvals of camsirubicin;\n● the costs, timing and outcomes of seeking, obtaining, and maintaining FDA, TGA and other international regulatory approvals;\n● the progress of preclinical and potentially clinical development of MNPR-202 (and related analogs);\n● the number and characteristics of other drug product candidates that we may license, acquire, invent or otherwise pursue;\n● the scope, progress, timing, cost and results of research, preclinical development and clinical trials and regulatory requirements for future drug product candidates;\n66\nTable of Contents\n● the costs associated with manufacturing/quality requirements, establishing a reliable supply chain, and establishing or contracting for sales, marketing and\ndistribution capabilities;\n● our ability to maintain, expand and defend the scope of our intellectual property portfolio, including the amount and timing of any payments we may be required to\nmake in connection with the licensing, filing, defense and enforcement of any patents or other intellectual property rights;\n● our need and ability to hire or contract for additional management, administrative, scientific, medical, sales and marketing, and manufacturing/quality and other\nspecialized personnel or external expertise;\n● the effect and timing of entry of competing products or new therapies that may limit market penetration or prevent the introduction of our drug product candidates or\nreduce the commercial potential of our product portfolio;\n● our need to implement additional required internal management, operational, record keeping and other systems and infrastructure; and\n● the economic and other terms, timing and success of our existing collaboration and licensing arrangements and any collaboration, licensing or other arrangements\ninto which we may enter in the future, including the timing of receipt of or payment to or from others of any license, milestone or royalty payments under these\narrangements.\nExpenditures are expected to increase in 2024 and onward for:\n● development of our MNPR-101 radiopharma program to image and treat various advanced cancers;\n● Development of our camsirubicin program if data support development beyond Phase 1b;\n● development of potential new in-licensed product candidates;\n● employee compensation and consulting fees to support the increased scope of activities required for the progress of our product candidate programs including\nMNPR-101 for radiopharmaceutical use, camsirubicin, and MNPR-202 (and related analogs)\nWe are working towards initiating enrollment for our MNPR-101-Zr Phase 1 dosimetry clinical trial. If the tumor uptake, biodistribution, and safety look encouraging in\nthis Phase 1 dosimetry trial, we may proceed to evaluate the efficacy in humans of a therapeutically radio-labeled version of MNPR-101 bound to an isotope such as Ac-225, which\nwill require additional funding or finding a suitable pharmaceutical partner. There can be no assurance that any such events will occur. We intend to continue evaluating drug\nproduct candidates for the purpose of growing our pipeline. Identifying and securing high-quality compounds usually takes time and related expenses; however, our spending could\nbe significantly accelerated in 2024 and onward if additional drug product candidates are acquired and enter clinical development. In this event, we may be required to expand our\nmanagement team, and pay higher contract manufacturing costs, contract research organization fees, other clinical development costs and insurance costs that are not currently\nprojected. Additional long-term funding is needed to generally to support our current and future product candidates through clinical trials, approval processes and, if applicable,\ncommercialization.\n67\nTable of Contents\nUntil we can generate a sufficient amount of product revenue to finance our cash requirements, we expect to finance our future cash needs primarily through a combination\nof equity offerings, including at-the-market sales programs, debt financings, strategic collaborations and grant funding. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale\nof equity or convertible debt securities, the ownership interest of our current stockholders will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other\npreferences that adversely affect our current stockholders’ rights. Debt financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to\ntake specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. If we raise additional funds through marketing and distribution\narrangements or other collaborations, strategic alliances or licensing arrangements with other parties, we likely will have to share or relinquish valuable rights to our technologies,\nfuture revenue streams, research programs or drug product candidates or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us, which will reduce our future returns and affect our\nfuture operating flexibility. If we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our\npipeline product development or commercialization efforts or grant rights to others to develop and market drug product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and\nmarket ourselves.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nLicense, Development and Collaboration Agreements\nXOMA Ltd.\nPursuant to a non-exclusive license agreement with XOMA Ltd. for the humanization technology used in the development of MNPR-101, we are obligated to pay XOMA\nLtd. clinical, regulatory and sales milestones which could reach up to $14.925 million if we achieve all milestones for MNPR-101. The agreement does not require the payment of\nsales royalties. There can be no assurance that we will achieve any milestones. As of March 8, 2024, we had not reached any milestones and had not been required to pay XOMA\nLtd. any funds under this license agreement. The first milestone payment is payable upon first dosing of a human patient in a Phase 2 clinical trial.\nOnxeo S.A.\nIn June 2016, we executed an agreement with Onxeo S.A., a French public company, which gave us the exclusive option to license (on a world-wide exclusive basis) Validive\n(clonidine hydrocholoride mucobuccal tablet; clonidine HCI MBT) a mucoadhesive tablet of clonidine based on the Lauriad mucoadhesive technology. In September 2017, we\nexercised the option to license Validive from Onxeo for $1 million. In March 2023, we discontinued our Validive Phase 2b/3 VOICE trial based upon ours Data Safety Monitoring\nBoard’s determination that the trial did not meet the pre-defined threshold for efficacy of a 15% absolute difference in severe oral mucositis prevention between Validive and placebo.\nWe have not incurred any license or royalty obligations and the license has been terminated effective January 2024.\n68\nTable of Contents\nService Providers\nIn the normal course of business, we contract with service providers to assist in the performance of R&D, including drug product manufacturing, process development,\nclinical and preclinical development, and G&A including financial strategy, audit, tax and legal support. We can elect to discontinue the work under these agreements at any time.\nWe could also enter into collaborative research and development, contract research, manufacturing and supplier agreements in the future, which may require upfront payments\nand/or long-term commitments of cash.\nOffice Lease\nWe are currently leasing office space on a month-to-month basis for our executive headquarters at 1000 Skokie Blvd., in the Village of Wilmette, Illinois for $4,238 per\nmonth.\nLegal Contingencies\nWe are currently not, and to date have never been, a party to any adverse material legal proceedings.\nIndemnification\nIn the normal course of business, we enter into contracts and agreements that contain a variety of representations and warranties and provide for general indemnification.\nOur exposure under these agreements is unknown because it involves claims that may be made against us in the future, but that have not yet been made. To date, we have not paid\nany claims or been required to defend any action related to our indemnification obligations. However, we may record charges in the future as a result of these indemnification\nobligations.\nIn accordance with our Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, Amended and Restated Bylaws and the indemnification agreements entered into with\neach officer and non-employee director, we have indemnification obligations to our officers and non-employee directors for certain events or occurrences, subject to certain limits,\nwhile they are serving at our request in such capacity. There have been no claims to date. See Item 1A - “Risk Factors - We have limited the liability of and indemnified our\ndirectors and officers.”\nItem 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\nThe information required to be filed in this item appears on pages F-1 to F-22 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nItem 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure\nNone.\n69\nTable of Contents\nItem 9A. Controls and Procedures\nOur Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have provided certifications filed as Exhibits 31.1, 31.2 and 32.1. Such certifications should be read in conjunction\nwith the information contained in this Item 9A for a more complete understanding of the matters covered by those certifications.\n(a) Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rule 13a15(f) of the Securities Exchange\nAct of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”). Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of the financial\nreporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. This process includes those policies\nand procedures (i) that pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets, (ii) that receipts\nand expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and non-employee directors, (iii) that provide reasonable assurance regarding\nprevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements, and (iv) that provide\nreasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP. Because of its inherent limitations, internal\ncontrol over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are\nsubject to risk that the internal control may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nOur management has assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023. Management based this assessment on the criteria\nset forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013). Management’s assessment included an\nevaluation of the design of our internal control over financial reporting and testing of the operational effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Based on\nmanagement’s assessment, management has concluded that, as of December 31, 2023, our internal control over financial reporting was effective.\n(b) Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nWe carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the\neffectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2023, pursuant to Rules 13a15(e) and 15d15(e) under the Exchange Act. Based on that evaluation, our\nChief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures, as of such date, were effective.\n(c) Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have concluded that the consolidated financial statements and other financial information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K fairly present in all material\nrespects our financial condition, results of operations and comprehensive loss and cash flows as of, and for, the periods presented.\nThere have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2023 that have materially affected, or are reasonably\nlikely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nItem 9B. Other Information\nDuring the quarter ended December 31, 2023, no director or officer of the Company adopted or terminated a “Rule 10b5- 1 trading arrangement” or “non-Rule 10b5- 1\ntrading arrangement,” as each term is defined in Item 408(a) of Regulation S-K.\n70\nTable of Contents\nPART III\nItem 10.

Employee contributions are held and invested by the plan’s trustee. The\n401(k) plan also permits us to make discretionary profit-sharing contributions and discretionary matching contributions, subject to established limits and a vesting schedule.\nNonqualified Deferred Compensation\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, our named executive officers did not contribute to, or earn any amount with respect to, any defined contribution or other plan\nsponsored by us that provides for the deferral of compensation on a basis that is not tax-qualified.\n78\nTable of Contents\nHedging Policy\nOur Insider Trading Policy prohibits short sales of our stock and short-swing transactions by our officers and non-employee directors. We have not adopted any other\npractices or policies regarding the ability of our employees (including officers) or non-employee directors to purchase financial instruments (including prepaid variable forward\ncontracts, equity swaps, collars, and exchange funds), or otherwise engage in transactions, that hedge or offset, or are designed to hedge or offset, any decrease in the market value\nof our securities that are held by them.\nDirector Compensation for the Year Ended December 31, 2023\nThe following table sets forth the compensation of our non-employee directors during the year ended December 31, 2023.\nOption All Other\nFees Earned or Stock Awards Total\nAwards Compensation\nName Paid in Cash ($) ($) (1) ($) (2) ($) ($)\nChristopher M.

Shares of our common\nstock that may be acquired by an individual or group within 60 days of March 8, 2024, pursuant to the exercise of options, are deemed to be outstanding for the purpose of\ncomputing the percentage ownership of such individual or group, but are not deemed to be outstanding for the purpose of computing the percentage ownership of any other person\nshown in the table. Beneficial ownership percentage is based upon 17,454,925 shares of our common stock outstanding as of March 8, 2024.\nExcept as indicated in footnotes to this table, we believe that the stockholders named in this table have sole voting and investment power with respect to all shares of\ncommon stock shown to be beneficially owned by them, based on information provided to us by such stockholders.\nName and Address of Beneficial Owner\n*Unless otherwise noted, addresses are: 1000\nSkokie Blvd., Suite 350, Wilmette, IL 60091 Common Stock Beneficially Owned Percent of Class Held\nTacticGem, LLC (1) 7,166,667 41.1%\nTactic Pharma LLC (1) 4,277,940 24.5%\nGem Pharmaceutical LLC (1) 941 Lake Forest Cir.,\nBirmingham, AL 35244 3,055,394 17.5%\nDiane Hendricks (1) 3,524,144 20.2%\nChandler D.

Certain Relationships and Related Transactions and Director Independence\nRelationships and Related-Person Transactions\nSince January 2023, we have not engaged reportable transactions with our co-founders, non-employee directors, executive officers, holders of more than 5% of our voting\nsecurities, and affiliates or immediate family members of our non-employee directors, executive officers and holders of more than 5% of our voting securities, and our co-founders.\nRegistration Rights\nWe are subject to an agreement with TacticGem, LLC (“TacticGem”), our largest stockholder, which obligates us to file a Form S-3 or other appropriate form of\nregistration statement covering the resale of any of our common stock by TacticGem, or its members Gem Pharmaceuticals, LLC, or Tactic Pharma, LLC, upon direction by\nTacticGem. Through the date hereof, TacticGem has not required us to file such a resale registration statement, although there can be no assurance we will not be required to do so\nin the future.\nProcedures for Related-Person Transactions\nA “related person” includes any non-employee director, nominee for director or executive officer of the Company; a beneficial owner of more than five percent of any\nclass of our voting securities; and a person who is an immediate family member of any such non-employee director, nominee for director, executive officer or more-than-five\npercent beneficial owner (the term “immediate family member” shall include any child, stepchild, parent, stepparent, spouse, sibling, mother-in-law, father-in-law, son-in-law,\ndaughter-in-law, brother-in-law or sister-in-law and any person (other than a tenant or employee) sharing the household of any such non-employee director, nominee for director,\nexecutive officer or more-than-five percent beneficial owner).\nOur Board has adopted our Audit Committee Charter which delegates the review and approval of related-person transactions to the Audit Committee. The Audit\nCommittee reviews and approves or disapproves any transaction required to be disclosed according to SEC Regulation S-K, Item 404 between the Company and any related party\non an on-going basis and oversees policies and procedures for the Audit Committee’s judgments as to related party transactions as required by Nasdaq. Our Audit Committee will\ndiscuss with our management the business rationale for the transactions and whether appropriate disclosures have been made.\nDirector Independence\nWe believe it is important to have independent directors on our Board who can make decisions without being influenced by personal interests. Consistent with these\nconsiderations, after review of all relevant identified transactions or relationships between each Director, or any of their family members, and us, our senior management and our\nindependent registered public accounting firm, our Board has affirmatively determined that the following directors are independent Directors within the meaning of the applicable\nNasdaq listing standards: Dr. Starr, Mr. Brown, Mr. Anderson and Mr. Klausner. In making this determination, our Board found that none of the Directors had a material or other\ndisqualifying relationship with us. With respect to Dr. Starr, the Board considered that he receives compensation for consulting services, as disclosed elsewhere in this Annual\nReport on Form 10-K, which does not exceed the applicable Nasdaq independence threshold. Dr. Robinson, our President and Chief Executive Officer, and Ms. Tsuchimoto, our\nChief Financial Officer, Secretary and Treasurer, are not independent Directors by virtue of their employment relationship with us.\nOur Audit Committee consists of Mr. Anderson, Mr. Klausner and Mr. Brown, who are independent members as defined by Nasdaq rules applicable to audit committees\nand the SEC under Rule 10A-3 under the Exchange Act. Mr. Anderson serves as chair of the Audit Committee and is a financial expert as defined by Nasdaq and the SEC.\nOur CG&N Committee consists of Mr. Klausner, Mr. Brown and Mr. Anderson who are independent members.

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Monopar Therapeutics\nInc as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2023, in conformity with\naccounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the entity’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We are a\npublic accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (\"PCAOB\") and are required to be independent with respect to Monopar\nTherapeutics Inc. in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether\nthe financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Monopar Therapeutics Inc is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an\naudit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the\npurpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that\nrespond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included\nevaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that\nour audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n/s/ BPM LLP\nWe have served as Monopar Therapeutics Inc.'s auditor since 2015.\nWalnut Creek, California\nMarch 27,

2023\nNote 1 - Nature of Business and Liquidity\nNature of Business\nMonopar Therapeutics Inc. (“Monopar” or the ”Company”) is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing innovative treatments for cancer patients.\nMonopar currently has several compounds in development: 1) MNPR-101-Zr, a clinical stage uPAR-targeted radiodiagnostic imaging agent; 2) MNPR-101-RIT, a late preclinical\nstage radiotherapeutic for advanced cancers; 3) camsirubicin (generic name for MNPR-201, GPX-150; 5-imino-13-deoxydoxorubicin), a Phase 1b clinical stage novel analog of\ndoxorubicin engineered specifically to retain anticancer activity while minimizing toxic effects on the heart; and 4) an early stage camsirubicin analog, MNPR-202, for various\ncancers. On March 27, 2023, the Company discontinued its Validive Phase 2b/3 VOICE trial based upon its Data Safety Monitoring Board’s determination that the trial did not meet\nthe pre-defined threshold for efficacy of a 15% absolute difference in severe oral mucositis prevention between Validive and placebo. The Company continued to record clinical site\nclose-out related expenses for Validive throughout 2023. The Company is not anticipating incurring any license or royalty obligations or incurring any significant expenses beyond\n2023 related to Validive.\nLiquidity\nThe Company has incurred an accumulated deficit of approximately $60.2 million as of December 31, 2023 and since inception has not generated any revenue. To date, the\nCompany has primarily funded its operations with the net proceeds from the Company’s initial public offering of its common stock on Nasdaq, sales of its common stock in the\npublic market through at-the-market sales agreements, private placements of convertible preferred stock and of common stock and cash provided in the camsirubicin asset purchase\ntransaction. Management estimates that currently available cash will provide sufficient funds to enable the Company to meet its obligations at least through June 30, 2025. The\nCompany’s ability to fund its future operations, including the continued clinical development of its MNPR-101 radiopharma program and camsirubicin, is dependent upon its\nability to execute its business strategy, to obtain additional funding and/or to execute collaborative research agreements. There can be no certainty that future financing or\ncollaborative research agreements will occur in the amounts required or at a time needed to maintain operations, if at all.\nRisks and Uncertainties\nThe termination of the Company’s Validive clinical trial at the end of March 2023 resulted in a decrease in the Company’s stock price. The closing bid price of the Company’s stock\nfell below $1.00 for more than 30 consecutive trading days, and on August 28, 2023, the Company received a notice from Nasdaq stating that it is out of compliance with Nasdaq\nlisting standards giving the Company 180 days to regain compliance. On February 27, 2024, the Company was granted a second 180-day period to regain compliance; there can be no\nassurance that the Company will regain compliance within Nasdaq’s extended time limits and requirements. If the Company does not regain compliance, the Company would face\ndelisting and it may have serious adverse consequences on the Company’s ability to raise funds, which may cause Monopar to delay, restructure or otherwise reconsider its operations.\nIf it is necessary to effect a reverse stock split to attempt to cure the bid price deficiency, the impacts on the Company's stock price are uncertain and could be adverse.\nMarket variables over which the Company has no control, such as inflation of product costs, higher capital costs, labor rates and fuel, freight and energy costs, as well as geopolitical\nevents could cause the Company to suffer significant increases in its operating and administrative expenses.\nThe Russia-Ukraine war, and resulting sanctions against Russia and Russian entities or allies, have increased fuel costs and may cause shipping delays. In addition, the Israel-Hamas\nwar has created additional uncertainties. The broader economic, trade and financial market consequences of these events are uncertain at this time, which may increase the cost of\nsupplies for the Company’s clinical materials, may delay the manufacture of its clinical materials, may increase costs of other goods and services, or make it more difficult or costly to\nraise additional financing, any of which could cause an adverse effect on the Company’s clinical and development program and on the Company’s financial condition.\nThere remains uncertainties as to the long-term impacts of COVID-19 or any potential resurgences thereof. The Company is unable to estimate COVID-19’s or any future pandemic\ndisease's financial impact or duration in light of treatment options and potential surges of new cases from current or future COVID-19 variants or a future pandemic or its potential\nimpact on the Company’s current clinical trial and development programs, including COVID-19’s or a future pandemic's effect on drug candidate manufacturing, shipping, patient\nrecruitment at clinical sites and regulatory agencies around the globe.\nF- 7\nTable of Contents\nMONOPAR THERAPEUTICS INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nDecember 31, 2023\nNote 2 - Significant Accounting Policies\nBasis of Presentation\nThese consolidated financial statements include the financial results of Monopar Therapeutics Inc., its wholly-owned French subsidiary, Monopar Therapeutics, SARL, and its\nwholly-owned Australian subsidiary, Monopar Therapeutics Australia Pty Ltd and have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S.\n(“GAAP”) and include all disclosures required by GAAP for financial reporting. All intercompany accounts have been eliminated. The principal accounting policies applied in the\npreparation of these consolidated financial statements are set out below and have been consistently applied in all periods presented. The Company has been primarily involved in\nperforming research activities, developing product candidates, and raising capital to support and expand these activities.\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements contain all normal, recurring adjustments necessary to present fairly the Company’s consolidated financial position as of\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company’s consolidated results of operations and comprehensive loss and the Company’s consolidated cash flows for the years ended December\n31, 2023 and 2022.\nFunctional Currency\nThe Company’s consolidated functional currency is the U.S. Dollar. The Company’s Australian subsidiary and French subsidiary use the Australian Dollar and European Euro,\nrespectively, as their functional currency. At each quarter-end, each foreign subsidiary’s balance sheets are translated into U.S. Dollars based upon the quarter-end exchange rate,\nwhile their statements of operations and comprehensive loss and statements of cash flows are translated into U.S. Dollars based upon an average exchange rate during the period.\nComprehensive Loss\nComprehensive loss represents net loss plus any income or losses not reported in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss, such as foreign currency\ntranslation gains and losses and unrealized gains and losses on debt security investments that are reflected on the Company’s consolidated statements of stockholders’ equity.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities,\ndisclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and reported amounts of expenses in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from\nthose estimates.\nGoing Concern Assessment\nThe Company applies Accounting Standards Codification 205-40 (“ASC 205-40”), Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity’s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern, which the\nFinancial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued to provide guidance on determining when and how reporting companies must disclose going concern uncertainties in their\nfinancial statements. ASC 205-40 requires management to perform interim and annual assessments of an entity’s ability to continue as a going concern within one year of the date\nof issuance of the entity’s financial statements (or within one year after the date on which the financial statements are available to be issued, when applicable). Further, a company\nmust provide certain disclosures if there is “substantial doubt about the entity’s ability to continue as a going concern.” In March 2024, the Company analyzed its cash requirements\nat least through June 30, 2025 and has determined that, based upon the Company’s current available cash, the Company has no substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a\ngoing concern.\nF- 8\nTable of Contents\nMONOPAR THERAPEUTICS INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nDecember 31, 2023\nCash Equivalents\nThe Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with a maturity of three months or less on the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. Cash equivalents as of\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022 consisted of two money market accounts and U.S. Treasury Bills.\nInvestments\nThe Company considers all of its investments in debt securities (U.S. Government or Agencies), with maturities at the date of purchase from three months to one year to be\navailable-for-sale securities. These investments are recorded at fair value with the unrealized gains and losses reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) on the\nCompany’s consolidated balance sheets. Realized gains and losses from the sale of investments, if any, are determined are recorded net in the consolidated statements of operations\nand comprehensive loss. The investments selected by the Company have a low level of inherent credit risk given they are issued by the U.S. government and any changes in their\nfair value are primarily attributable to changes in interest rates and market liquidity. Investments as of December 31, 2022 consisted of U.S. Treasury Bills with maturities of over\nthree months to one year.\nPrepaid Expenses\nPrepayments are expenditures for goods or services before the goods are used or the services are received and are charged to operations as the benefits are realized. Prepaid\nexpenses may include payments to development collaborators in excess of actual expenses incurred by the collaborator, measured at the end of each reporting period. Prepayments\nalso include insurance premiums, dues and subscriptions and software costs of $10,000 or more per year that are expensed monthly over the life of the contract, which is typically\none year. Prepaid expenses are reflected on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets as other current assets.\nLeases\nLease agreements are evaluated to determine whether an arrangement is or contains a lease in accordance with ASC 842, Leases. Right-of-use lease assets and lease liabilities are\nrecognized based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term at the commencement date. The right-of-use lease asset on the Company’s\nconsolidated balance sheets includes any lease payments made and excludes lease incentives. The incremental borrowing taking into consideration the Company’s credit quality and\nborrowing rate for similar assets is used in determining the present value of future payments. Lease expense is recorded as general and administrative expenses on the Company’s\nconsolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.\nConcentration of Credit Risk\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentration of credit risk consist of cash and cash equivalents. The Company maintains cash and cash equivalents at\ntwo reputable financial institutions. As of December 31, 2023, the balance at one financial institution was in excess of the $250,000 Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation\n(“FDIC”) insurable limit. The Company has not experienced any losses on its deposits since inception and management believes the Company is not exposed to significant risks\nwith respect to these financial institutions.\nF- 9\nTable of Contents\nMONOPAR THERAPEUTICS INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nDecember 31, 2023\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nFor financial instruments consisting of cash and cash equivalents, investments, accounts payable, accrued expenses, and other current liabilities, the carrying amounts are\nreasonable estimates of fair value due to their relatively short maturities.\nThe Company adopted ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, as amended, which addresses the measurement of the fair value of financial assets and financial\nliabilities. Under this standard, fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (i.e., the “exit price”) in an orderly transaction\nbetween market participants at the measurement date.\nThe standard establishes a hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring\nthat the most observable inputs be used when available. Observable inputs reflect assumptions market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability based on market data\nobtained from independent sources. Unobservable inputs reflect a reporting entity’s pricing an asset or liability developed based on the best information available under the\ncircumstances. The fair value hierarchy consists of the following three levels:\nLevel 1 – instrument valuations are obtained from real-time quotes for transactions in active exchange markets involving identical assets.\nLevel 2 – instrument valuations are obtained from readily available pricing sources for comparable instruments.\nLevel 3 – instrument valuations are obtained without observable market values and require a high-level of judgment to determine the fair value.\nDetermining which category an asset or liability falls within the hierarchy requires significant judgment. The Company evaluates its hierarchy disclosures each reporting period.\nThere were no transfers between Level 1, 2 or 3 of the fair value hierarchy during the years ended December 31, 2023, and 2022. The following table presents the assets and\nliabilities recorded that are reported at fair value on the Company's consolidated balance sheets on a recurring basis. No values were recorded in Level 2 or Level 3 at December 31,\n2023, and 2022.\nAssets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis\nDecember 31, 2023 Level 1 Total\nAssets:\nCash equivalents(1) $ 6,544,910 $ 6,544,910\nTotal $ 6,544,910 $ 6,544,910\nDecember 31, 2022 Level 1 Total\nAssets:\nCash equivalents(1) $ 7,248,946 $ 7,248,946\nInvestments(2) 4,933,550 4,933,550\nTotal $ 12,182,496 $ 12,182,496\n(1) Cash equivalents as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 represent the fair value of the Company’s investment in two money market accounts and U.S. Treasury Bills with\nmaturities at the date of purchase of three months or less.\n(2) Investments represents the fair value of the Company’s investment in U.S. Treasury Bills with maturities at the date of purchase from three months to one year.\nF- 10\nTable of Contents\nMONOPAR THERAPEUTICS INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nDecember 31, 2023\nNet Loss per Share\nNet loss per share for the years ended December 31, 2023, and 2022, is calculated by dividing net loss by the weighted-average shares of common stock outstanding during the\nperiod. Diluted net loss per share for the years ended December 31, 2023, and 2022 is calculated by dividing net loss by the weighted-average shares of the sum of a) weighted\naverage common stock outstanding (13,823,951 and 12,718,166 shares for the years ended December 31, 2023, and 2022, respectively) and b) potentially dilutive shares of\ncommon stock (such as stock options and restricted stock units) outstanding during the period. As of December 31, 2023, and 2022, potentially dilutive securities included stock-\nbased awards to purchase up to 2,527,092 and 1,915,600 shares of the Company’s common stock, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, potentially\ndilutive securities are excluded from the computation of fully diluted net loss per share as their effect is anti-dilutive.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nResearch and development (“R&D”) costs are expensed as incurred. Major components of R&D expenses include salaries and benefits paid to the Company’s R&D staff,\ncompensation expenses of G&A personnel performing R&D, fees paid to consultants and to the entities that conduct certain R&D activities on the Company’s behalf and materials\nand supplies which were used in R&D activities during the reporting period.\nClinical Trials Accruals\nThe Company accrues and expenses the costs for clinical trial activities performed by third parties based upon estimates of the percentage of work completed over the life of the\nindividual study in accordance with agreements established with contract research organizations, service providers, and clinical trial sites. The Company estimates the amounts to\naccrue based upon discussions with internal clinical personnel and external service providers as to progress or stage of completion of trials or services and the agreed upon fee to be\npaid for such services. Costs of setting up clinical trial sites for participation in the trials are expensed immediately as R&D expenses. Clinical trial site costs related to patient\nscreening and enrollment are accrued as patients are screened/entered into the trial.\nCollaborative Agreements\nThe Company and its collaborative partners are active participants in collaborative agreements and all parties would be exposed to significant risks and rewards depending on the\ntechnical and commercial success of the activities. Contractual payments to the other parties in collaboration agreements and costs incurred by the Company when the Company is\ndeemed to be the principal participant for a given transaction are recognized on a gross basis in R&D expenses. Royalties and license payments are recorded as earned.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2023, and 2022, no milestones were met, and no royalties were earned, therefore, the Company did not pay or accrue/expense any license or\nroyalty payments.\nLicensing Agreements\nThe Company has various agreements licensing technology utilized in the development of its product or technology programs. The licenses contain success milestone obligations\nand royalties on future sales. During the years ended December 31, 2023, and 2022, no milestones were met, and no royalties were earned, therefore, the Company did not pay or\naccrue/expense any license or royalty payments under any of its license agreements.\nF- 11\nTable of Contents\nMONOPAR THERAPEUTICS INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nDecember 31, 2023\nPatent Costs\nThe Company expenses costs relating to issued patents and patent applications, including costs relating to legal, renewal and application fees, as a component of general and\nadministrative expenses in its consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company uses an asset and liability approach for accounting for deferred income taxes, which requires recognition of deferred income tax assets and liabilities for the expected\nfuture tax consequences of events that have been recognized in its financial statements but have not been reflected in its taxable income. Estimates and judgments are required in the\ncalculation of certain tax liabilities and in the determination of the recoverability of certain deferred income tax assets, which arise from temporary differences and carryforwards.\nDeferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets and\nliabilities are expected to be realized or settled.\nThe Company regularly assesses the likelihood that its deferred income tax assets will be realized from recoverable income taxes or recovered from future taxable income. To the\nextent that the Company believes any amounts are not “more likely than not” to be realized, the Company records a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred income tax assets. In\nthe event the Company determines that all or part of the net deferred tax assets are not realizable in the future, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would be charged to\nearnings in the period such determination is made. Similarly, if the Company subsequently determines deferred income tax assets that were previously determined to be unrealizable\nare now realizable, the respective valuation allowance would be reversed, resulting in an adjustment to earnings in the period such determination is made.\nInternal Revenue Code Sections 382 and 383 (“Sections 382 and 383”) limit the use of net operating loss (“NOL”) carryforwards and R&D credits, after an ownership change. To\ndate, the Company has not conducted a Section 382 or 383 study, however, because the Company will continue to raise significant amounts of equity in the coming years, the\nCompany expects that Sections 382 and 383 will limit the Company’s usage of NOLs and R&D credits in the future.\nASC 740, Income Taxes, requires that the tax benefit of net operating losses, temporary differences, and credit carryforwards be recorded as an asset to the extent that management\nassesses that realization is “more likely than not.” Realization of the future tax benefits is dependent on the Company’s ability to generate sufficient taxable income within the\ncarryforward period. The Company has reviewed the positive and negative evidence relating to the realizability of the deferred tax assets and has concluded that the deferred tax\nassets are not “more likely than not” to be realized. As a result, the Company recorded a full valuation allowance as of December 31, 2023, and 2022. U.S. Federal R&D tax credits\nfrom 2016 to 2019 were utilized to reduce payroll taxes in future periods and were recorded as other current assets (anticipated to be received within 12 months), on the Company’s\nconsolidated balance sheets. The Company intends to maintain the valuation allowance until sufficient evidence exists to support its reversal. The Company regularly reviews its tax\npositions. For a tax benefit to be recognized, the related tax position must be “more likely than not” to be sustained upon examination. Any amount recognized is generally the\nlargest benefit that is “more likely than not” to be realized upon settlement. The Company’s policy is to recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters as an income\ntax expense. For the years ended December 31, 2023, and 2022, the Company did not have any interest or penalties associated with unrecognized tax benefits.\nThe Company is subject to U.S. Federal, Illinois and California state income taxes. In addition, the Company is subject to local tax laws of France and Australia. Tax regulations\nwithin each jurisdiction are subject to the interpretation of the related tax laws and regulations and require significant judgment to apply. Monopar was originally formed as an LLC\nin December 2014, then incorporated on December 16, 2015. The Company is subject to U.S. Federal, state and local tax examinations by tax authorities for the tax years 2015\nthrough 2022. The Company does not anticipate significant changes to its current uncertain tax positions through December 31, 2023. The Company plans on filing its U.S. Federal\nand state tax returns for the year ended December 31, 2023, prior to the extended filing deadlines in all jurisdictions.\nF- 12\nTable of Contents\nMONOPAR THERAPEUTICS INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nDecember 31, 2023\nStock-Based Compensation\nThe Company accounts for stock-based compensation arrangements with employees, non-employee directors and consultants using a fair value method, which requires the\nrecognition of compensation expense for costs related to all stock-based awards, including stock option and restricted stock unit (“RSU”) grants. The fair value method requires the\nCompany to estimate the fair value of stock-based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model or the closing stock price on the date of grant in the case of\nRSUs.\nStock-based compensation expense for awards granted to employees, non-employee directors and consultants are based on the fair value of the underlying instrument calculated\nusing the Black-Scholes option-pricing model on the date of grant for stock options and using the closing stock price on the date of grant for RSUs and recognized as expense on a\nstraight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is the vesting period. Determining the appropriate fair value model and related assumptions requires judgment, including\nestimating the future stock price volatility and expected terms. For stock options granted in 2022, the expected volatility rates are estimated based on the Company’s historical\nactual volatility over the two-year period from its initial public offering on December 18, 2019 through December 31, 2021. For stock options granted in 2023, the expected\nvolatility rates are estimated based on the Company’s historical actual volatility over the three-year period from its initial public offering on December 18, 2019 through December\n31, 2022. Forfeitures only include known forfeitures to-date as the Company accounts for forfeitures as they occur due to a limited history of forfeitures. The expected term for\noptions granted to date is estimated using the simplified method. The Company has not paid dividends and does not anticipate paying a cash dividend in the future vesting period\nand, accordingly, uses an expected dividend yield of zero. The risk-free interest rate is based on the rate of U.S. Treasury securities with maturities consistent with the estimated\nexpected term of the awards.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn October 2023, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (\"ASU\") 2023-06, Disclosure Improvements, Codification Amendments in Response to the SEC’s Disclosure\nUpdate and Simplification Initiative. The ASU incorporates certain U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) disclosure requirements and are expected to clarify or improve\ndisclosure and presentation requirements of a variety of Codification Topics, allow users to more easily compare entities subject to the SEC's existing disclosures with those entities\nthat were not previously subject to the requirements, and align the requirements in the Codification with the SEC's regulations. The effective date for each amendment will be the\ndate on which the SEC's removal of that related disclosure from Regulation S-X or Regulation S-K becomes effective with early adoption prohibited. For all other entities, the\namendments will be effective two years later. In accordance with ASU 2023-06, the Company has added Note 8 - Loss per Share.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023- 09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures. The ASU improves income tax disclosure\nrequirements and will require more detailed information on several income tax disclosures, such as income taxes paid and the income tax rate reconciliation table. The standard is\neffective for public business entities with annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024, and early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of\nthis new standard on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.

The initial\nROU asset and associated liability is equal to the present value of the minimum lease payments. Since the rate implicit in the lease is rarely readily determinable, the Company\napplied an incremental borrowing rate taking into consideration the Company's credit quality and borrowing rate for similar assets. The lease terms used to calculate the ROU asset\nand related lease liability does not include an option to extend but does include an option to terminate the lease. Lease costs for operating leases are recognized on a straight-line\nbasis over the expected lease term and recorded as general and administrative expenses on the Company’s consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.\nAmortization of the ROU asset commenced on April 1, 2022, and June 1, 2022, for the two operating leases, respectively.

Shares of our common stock do not have cumulative voting rights. The election of our Board of Directors (“Board”) is decided by a plurality of the votes cast\nat a meeting of our stockholders by the holders of stock entitled to vote in the election.\nDividends\nHolders of our common stock are entitled to receive such dividends as may be declared by our Board out of funds legally available therefor.\nLiquidation\nUpon our dissolution and liquidation, holders of our common stock are entitled to a ratable share of our net assets remaining after payments to our creditors.\nRights and Preferences\nOur stockholders have no preemptive rights to acquire additional shares of our common stock or other securities. The shares of our common stock are not subject\nto redemption.\nPreferred Stock\nWe have no preferred stock authorized or outstanding.\nAnti-Takeover Provisions\nDelaware Law\nWe are subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law. Subject to certain exceptions, Section 203 prevents a publicly held Delaware corporation\nfrom engaging in a \"business combination\" with any \"interested stockholder\" for three years following the date that the person became an interested stockholder, unless the\ninterested stockholder attained such status with the approval of our Board or unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner. A \"business combination\"\nincludes, among other things, a merger or consolidation involving us and the \"interested stockholder\" and the sale of more than 10% of our assets. In general, an \"interested\nstockholder\" is any entity or person beneficially owning 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock and any entity or person affiliated with or controlling or controlled by\nsuch entity or person.\nAuthorized but Unissued Shares\nThe authorized but unissued shares of our common stock are available for future issuance without stockholder approval, subject to any limitations imposed by the\nlisting standards of any exchange on which our shares are listed. These additional shares may be used for a variety of corporate finance transactions, acquisitions and\nemployee benefit plans. The existence of authorized but unissued and unreserved common stock could make more difficult or discourage an attempt to obtain control of us\nby means of a proxy contest, tender offer, merger or otherwise.\nElection of Director by Plurality of Shares; Vacancies\nOur Amended and Restated By-laws provide that directors will be elected by a plurality of votes cast by the shares present in person or by proxy at a meeting of the\nstockholders and entitled to vote thereon, a quorum being present at such meeting. There is no cumulative voting, meaning that Directors may be elected with a vote of\nholders of less than a majority of the outstanding common stock.\nOur Amended and Restated By-laws also provide that vacancies occurring on our Board may be filled by the affirmative votes of a majority of the remaining\nmembers of our Board or by the sole remaining director, and not by our stockholders.

(“Monopar” or the “Company”) (Nasdaq: MNPR), a clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on developing innovative treatments for patients with unmet medical needs, today announced third quarter 2024 financial results and summarized recent developments.</p> <p><strong>Recent Developments</strong></p> <p><strong><em> ALXN-1840 for Wilson disease – Late Stage</em></strong></p> <ul type=\"disc\"><li>On October 23, 2024, the Company entered into an exclusive license with Alexion, AstraZeneca Rare Disease whereby the Company gained worldwide rights to develop and commercialize ALXN-1840 (bis-choline tetrathiomolybdate). ALXN-1840 is a drug candidate for Wilson disease that is in late-stage development, having already completed a Phase 3 clinical trial. Monopar will be assembling a regulatory package and initiating discussions with the FDA, with an initial focus on Wilson disease patients with more severe symptoms. More details on this transaction can be found here (<a href=\"https://ir.monopartx.com/press-releases/detail/105/monopar-announces-agreement-with-alexion-astrazeneca-rare\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">link</a>).<br> </li></ul> <p align=\"justify\"><strong><em>MNPR</em></strong>-<strong><em>101 for Radiopharmaceutical Use – Phase 1</em></strong></p> <ul type=\"disc\"> <li>In August 2024, the Company received regulatory clearance in Australia to commence a first-in-human Phase 1a therapeutic clinical trial of its novel urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR)-targeted radiopharmaceutical therapy MNPR-101-Lu (MNPR-101 conjugated to lutetium-177) in patients with advanced solid cancers. The Company activated its first clinical trial site and launched the study in October 2024; the trial is currently active and recruiting patients.<br> </li> <li>In September 2024, the Company announced positive early clinical data from its ongoing open-label Phase 1 imaging and dosimetry clinical trial of MNPR-101-Zr that validate the tumor-targeting ability of MNPR-101-Zr. In October, the Company presented additional clinical data at the European Association of Nuclear Medicine Annual Congress 2024. The data demonstrate clear and durable tumor uptake of MNPR-101-Zr in a patient with advanced ovarian cancer and show favorable biodistribution with low off-target binding.<br> </li> <li>The Company is also actively exploring opportunities to expand its radiopharmaceutical pipeline primarily through internal development efforts. In October 2024, the Company announced the filing of a provisional patent application for new radiopharmaceutical compounds and a family of linkers used to connect radioisotopes with targeting agents, including its uPAR-targeting antibody MNPR-101. This provisional patent could enable the Company to use these linkers to create new proprietary radiopharmaceuticals to pursue well-established, high-value cancer targets of interest.<br> </li> </ul> <p><strong><em>Capital Raise</em></strong></p> <ul type=\"disc\"><li>On October 30, 2024, the Company completed a registered public offering of 1,181,540 shares of the Company’s common stock at $16.25 per share, generating net proceeds of approximately $17.7 million, after deducting placement agent fees and other estimated offering expenses.<br> </li></ul> <p><strong>Results for the Third Quarter Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to the Third Quarter Ended September 30, 2023 </strong></p> <p><strong><em> Cash and Net Loss</em></strong></p> <p>Cash and cash equivalents as of September 30, 2024, were $6.0 million. As noted above, the Company completed a registered public offering on October 30, 2024 that yielded net proceeds to the Company of approximately $17.7 million, after deducting placement agent fees and other estimated offering expenses.</p> <p>Monopar projects that its current funds will be sufficient to continue operations at least into the first half of 2026, including to: (1) assemble a regulatory package and initiate discussions with the FDA on ALXN-1840 for Wilson disease; (2) continue to conduct and conclude its first-in-human imaging and dosimetry Phase 1 clinical trial with MNPR-101-Zr; (3) continue to conduct its first-in-human therapeutic radiopharma clinical trial with MNPR-101-Lu; (4) advance its preclinical MNPR-101-Ac program into the clinic, and (5) invest in internal R&amp;D projects to expand its radiopharma pipeline.</p> <p>Net loss for the third quarter of 2024 was $1.3 million, or $0.37 per share, compared to net loss of $2.0 million, or $0.69 per share, for the third quarter of 2023.</p> <p><strong><em>Research and Development (R&amp;D) Expenses</em></strong></p> <p>R&amp;D expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were $984,000, compared to $1,317,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. This represents a decrease of $333,000 attributed to (1) a decrease in camsirubicin manufacturing costs of $301,000 due to the Company’s decision to wind down that program, and (2) a decrease of $218,000 in Validive clinical trial related expenses due to the closure of the trial in March 2023. These decreases were partially offset by a net increase of $186,000 due to other R&amp;D expenses attributable to MNPR-101 for radiopharmaceutical use.</p> <p><strong><em>General and Administrative (G&amp;A) Expenses</em></strong></p> <p>G&amp;A expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were $591,000, compared to $749,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. This represents a decrease of $158,000 primarily attributed to (1) a reduction of stock based compensation expenses of $146,000 due to the full vesting of the 2020 grants in the fourth quarter of 2023, and (2) a decrease in stock-based compensation to the CEO and the board of directors of $64,000 as no equity awards have been issued to the CEO and the board of directors to date in 2024, partially offset by a net increase in consulting and other G&amp;A expenses of $52,000.</p> <p><strong>About Monopar Therapeutics</strong></p> <p>Monopar Therapeutics Inc. is a clinical-stage biotechnology company with late-stage ALXN-1840 for Wilson disease, and radiopharma programs including Phase 1-stage MNPR-101-Zr for imaging advanced cancers, and Phase 1a-stage MNPR-101-Lu and late preclinical-stage MNPR-101-Ac225 for the treatment of advanced cancers.

(Nasdaq: MNPR), a clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on developing innovative treatments for patients with unmet medical needs, today announced that it has entered into an agreement with Alexion, AstraZeneca Rare Disease for an exclusive worldwide license to ALXN-1840 (bis-choline tetrathiomolybdate), a drug candidate for Wilson disease that Alexion has progressed through a Phase 3 clinical trial that met its primary endpoint. Monopar will be responsible for all future global development and commercialization activities.</p> <p>Chandler D. Robinson, MD, Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer of Monopar previously researched tetrathiomolybdate at the laboratory bench, published his results in <em>Science</em>, and helped launch a company around what became known as ALXN-1840. The focus was on Wilson disease. Dr. Robinson came to know the Wilson disease community well through his efforts. At the Wilson Disease Association’s request, he delivered the keynote address at their 2013 Annual Conference celebrating their 30<sup>th</sup> anniversary, sharing his experience helping advance ALXN-1840 from the laboratory bench to patients. In 2023, Alexion terminated the ALXN-1840 program in Wilson disease based on review of results from Phase II mechanistic trials and discussions with regulatory authorities.</p> <p>Chris Starr, PhD, Co-Founder and Executive Chair of Monopar said, “Upon the 2023 announcement, Chandler, due to his long history with the program and the continued high level of unmet medical need, was contacted by Wilson disease patients, executives and board members of the Wilson Disease Association, as well as physicians regarding the potential for Monopar to obtain rights to ALXN-1840. Due in no small measure to the testimonials Chandler received from clinical trial patients who reported benefit while on the drug for years, we decided that this was an opportunity Monopar needed to pursue, and it fits well with my rare disease drug development and commercialization background as well as Chandler’s background.” Dr. Starr also previously co-founded the orphan drug companies BioMarin and Raptor Pharma (acquired by Horizon Pharma, now a part of Amgen).</p> <p>Dr. Robinson commented, “Alexion has generated a substantial clinical data package on ALXN-1840, including a completed Pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial. The medical data gathered from Alexion’s clinical trials furthers our understanding of Wilson disease and stands to benefit this community.”</p> <p>Under the terms of the license agreement, Monopar will pay Alexion an upfront in the form of a cash payment and equity in Monopar. Future payments are based on tiered royalties on net sales and pre-determined regulatory and sales milestones.</p> <p>“We are excited to have Alexion and AstraZeneca as partners of Monopar as, in addition to Alexion’s work in Wilson disease, AstraZeneca maintains a significant presence in the radiopharma field, in which Monopar is committed to continue growing as Monopar recently announced positive human clinical data with our novel radiopharma program (<a href=\"https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=oG7yI7Cn2JUKMpwET7eFhDodsWuNMYQjFRsDmLKngJHXm-7bDmqHhRk3oBLGjwdbD5F6XkNj7Kmw6G_knDt5uIT1M9Rjtd1jmnQRNIgaQxZJN-LKgOgFWDvth-Dn4oSz\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">link</a>),” stated Andrew Cittadine, Chief Operating Officer of Monopar.</p> <p><strong>About Wilson Disease</strong></p> <p>Wilson disease is a rare and progressive genetic condition in which the body’s pathway for removing excess copper is compromised.<sup> 1</sup> It affects one in 30,000 live births in the US.<sup>1</sup> Over time this results in the build-up of toxic copper levels in the liver, brain, and other organs, leading to damage that greatly impacts a patient’s life.<sup> 1</sup> Patients can develop a wide range of symptoms, including liver disease and/or psychiatric or neurological symptoms, such as personality changes, tremors and difficulty walking, swallowing or talking.<sup> 1</sup> In some cases, the damage and loss of function may be irreversible.<sup> 1,2,3</sup></p> <p><strong>About ALXN-1840</strong></p> <p>ALXN-1840 (bis-choline tetrathiomolybdate) is an investigational once-daily, oral medicine in development for the treatment of Wilson disease. This novel molecule is designed to selectively and tightly bind and remove copper from the body’s tissues and blood. ALXN-1840 has been granted Orphan Drug Designation in the United States and orphan designation in the European Union for Wilson disease.</p> <p><strong>About the Phase 3 “FoCus” Clinical Trial</strong></p> <p>The FoCus trial was a pivotal Phase 3, randomized, rater-blinded, multi-center clinical trial designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ALXN-1840 versus standard-of-care (SoC) in patients with Wilson disease aged 12 years and older. The primary endpoint assessed copper mobilization over 48 weeks, defined as daily mean AUEC (Area Under the Effect Curve) for dNCC (directly measured non-ceruloplasmin-bound copper). In the trial, 214 patients were enrolled in one of two cohorts on a 3:1 basis (treatment-experienced:treatment-naïve). Each cohort was then randomized 2:1 (ALXN1840:SoC). The first cohort enrolled 161 patients who received SoC (chelation therapy with penicillamine or trientine, zinc therapy or a combination of both chelation and zinc therapy) for more than 28 days and the second cohort enrolled 53 patients who were treatment-naïve or had received SoC for 28 days or less. The FoCus trial met its primary endpoint demonstrating three-times greater copper mobilization from tissues compared to the SoC arm (Least Square Mean Difference [LSM Diff] 2.18 µmol/L; p&lt; 0.0001), including in patients who had been treated previously for an average of 10 years. In the trial, people taking ALXN-1840 experienced rapid copper mobilization, with a response at four weeks and sustained through the 48 weeks. ALXN-1840 was generally well-tolerated with most reported adverse events considered mild to moderate, and no neurological worsening upon initiation of treatment was observed. In the ALXN-1840 treatment group, the most frequently reported adverse event was a reversible increase in transaminase levels.</p> <p><strong>About Monopar Therapeutics Inc.</strong></p> <p>Monopar Therapeutics is a clinical-stage biotechnology company with late-stage ALXN-1840 for Wilson disease, and radiopharma programs including Phase 1-stage MNPR-101-Zr for imaging advanced cancers, and Phase 1a-stage MNPR-101-Lu and late preclinical-stage MNPR-101-Ac225 for the treatment of advanced cancers.

These include a majority of all triple-negative breast, colorectal, bladder, ovarian, gastric, and pancreatic cancers.</p> <p>A total-body positron emission tomography (PET) image was taken at 168 hours (7 days) post administration of MNPR-101-Zr (a zirconium-89 imaging radioisotope conjugated to MNPR-101) of the first cancer patient in the trial with one of the known high uPAR-expressing cancer types. The results, seen in Figure 1, demonstrate the specificity, durability, and uptake of MNPR-101-Zr in the metastatic tumors relative to normal tissue.

(Nasdaq: MNPR), a clinical-stage radiopharma company focused on developing innovative treatments for cancer patients, today announced the successful dosing of the first patient in its open-label Phase 1 imaging and dosimetry clinical trial of its uPAR-targeted imaging radiopharmaceutical MNPR-101-Zr.<br></p> <p>MNPR-101-Zr was well-tolerated with no serious adverse reactions reported through the last imaging timepoint and the corresponding initial safety review. Preliminary analysis of MNPR-101-Zr’s pharmacokinetics and biodistribution suggests the low radiation dose to healthy tissue aligns with what was anticipated based on the previously presented MNPR-101-Zr preclinical biodistribution data. Dosimetry analysis showed absorbed organ doses were well below accepted safety limits; for example, the radiation dose to red bone marrow was about 14 mGy, which is around 150 times less than the generally accepted limit of 2-to-3 Gy. No unanticipated or excessive uptake of MNPR-101-Zr was observed in any critical organs through the end of the subject’s imaging period. The patient has metastatic disease from a cancer type not known for high uPAR expression. The study aims to include several patients with cancers known to express high levels of uPAR to gain insight into MNPR-101-Zr’s tumor uptake profile, in addition to patients with cancers of unknown uPAR expression.</p> <p>“The safety profile observed thus far, along with the encouraging biodistribution data, gives us an increased confidence as we continue to advance our Phase 1 study and prepare to launch our therapeutic study,” said Andrew Cittadine, Monopar’s Chief Operating Officer.</p> <p>Further information about the ongoing MNPR-101-Zr trial is available at www.ClinicalTrials.gov under study identifier <strong>NCT06337084</strong>.</p> <p><strong>About Monopar Therapeutics Inc.</strong></p> <p>Monopar Therapeutics is a clinical-stage radiopharmaceutical company focused on developing innovative treatments for cancer patients, including Phase 1-stage MNPR-101-Zr for imaging advanced cancers and late preclinical-stage MNPR-101 radio-immuno-therapeutic (RIT) for the treatment of advanced cancers, as well as early development programs against solid cancers.

(Monopar or the Company) (Nasdaq: MNPR), a clinical-stage radiopharmaceutical company focused on developing innovative treatments for cancer patients, today announced second quarter 2024 financial results and summarized recent developments.<br></p> <p><strong>Recent Developments</strong></p> <p><strong><em>MNPR-101 for Radiopharmaceutical Use</em></strong></p> <ul><li>MNPR-101 is a uPAR-targeting antibody being developed as a precision radiopharmaceutical for both imaging and treatment of various cancers.</li></ul> <ul><li>MNPR-101-Zr is a cancer imaging agent radiolabeled with Zirconium-89, a positron emission tomography (PET) imaging isotope. Preclinical imaging studies have shown selective, high, and enduring tumor uptake across multiple uPAR-expressing cancers including pancreatic, colorectal, and triple negative breast cancers. An open-label Phase 1 imaging and dosimetry clinical trial of MNPR-101-Zr was recently initiated and is currently active and enrolling patients.</li></ul> <ul><li>An open-label Phase 1 clinical trial for Monopar’s therapeutic radiopharmaceutical MNPR-101-RIT is on track to initiate as early as Q4 2024. Preclinical in vivo studies of therapeutic radioisotopes, such as actinium-225 and lutetium-177, bound to MNPR-101 have shown near complete elimination of uPAR-expressing tumors after just a single injection.</li></ul> <ul><li>Monopar’s MNPR-101-RIT abstract was selected as a Top-Rated Oral Presentation at the European Association of Nuclear Medicine (EANM) 2024 Annual Congress that will be held in Hamburg, Germany in October 2024.</li></ul> <ul><li>A long-term supply agreement with NorthStar Medical Radioisotopes LLC was entered into under which NorthStar agreed to provide actinium-225 for Monopar’s development stage and potential future commercial stage programs.</li></ul> <ul><li>The NorthStar collaboration agreement was amended, with one primary impact being Monopar gaining full ownership and title to its lead MNPR-101 radiopharmaceutical platform.</li></ul> <p><strong><em>Reverse Stock Split</em></strong><br></p> <ul><li>On August 5, 2024, the stockholders approved the reverse stock split proposal at the Annual Meeting of Stockholders, which provided the Board of Directors with authority to effect a reverse split within the range of ratios approved by stockholders. Subsequently, the Board of Directors approved a reverse stock split of 1 for 5 shares of the Company's common stock in an attempt to regain compliance with the Nasdaq's continued listing requirements. The Company expects that the reverse stock split will become effective at 5:00 pm on Monday, August 12, 2024, and its common stock will begin trading on a split-adjusted basis at the open of trading on Tuesday, August 13, 2024.</li></ul> <p><strong>Results for the Second Quarter Ended June 30, 2024 Compared to the Second Quarter Ended June 30, 2023 </strong><br><strong><em>Cash and Net Loss</em></strong></p> <p>Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments as of June 30, 2024, were $7.1 million. Monopar projects that its current funds will be sufficient to continue operations at least through August 31, 2025, including to continue to conduct and conclude our first-in-human clinical trial with our MNPR-101-Zr radiopharmaceutical imaging program and to advance our MNPR-101-RIT program into the clinic. We are in the process of winding down the camsirubicin Phase 1b clinical trial and the preclinical development of MNPR-202 due to focusing our finite financial resources on our radiopharmaceutical programs. We will require additional funding to further advance our clinical and preclinical programs, and we anticipate that we will seek to raise additional capital within the next 12 months to fund our future operations.</p> <p>Net loss for the second quarter of 2024 was $1.7 million, or $0.10 per share, compared to net loss of $2.2 million, or $0.16 per share, for the second quarter of 2023.</p> <p><strong><em>Research and Development (R&amp;D) Expenses</em></strong></p> <p>R&amp;D expenses for the quarter ended June 30, 2024 were $1,131,000, compared to $1,595,000 for the quarter ended June 30, 2023. This represents a decrease of $464,000 attributed to (1) a decrease of $636,000 in Validive clinical trial-related expenses due to the closure of the trial in March 2023, and (2) decrease in camsirubicin manufacturing costs of $138,000. These decreases were partially offset by a net increase of $310,000 due to other R&amp;D expenses attributable to MNPR-101 for radiopharma use. </p> <p><strong><em>General and Administrative (G&amp;A) Expenses</em></strong></p> <p>G&amp;A expenses for the quarter ended June 30, 2024 were $658,000, compared to $733,000 for the quarter ended June 30, 2023. This represents a decrease of $75,000 primarily attributed to (1) a decrease in stock-based compensation to the board of directors of $64,000 as no equity awards were issued to the board of directors to-date in 2024, and (2) a net decrease in consulting, tax services and other G&amp;A expenses of $11,000.</p> <p align=\"justify\"><strong><em>Principal Effects of the Pending Reverse Stock Split</em></strong></p> <p>The number of shares authorized remains at 40,000,000. After effectiveness of the anticipated reverse stock split, the unaudited proforma number of shares issued and outstanding will be approximately 3,520,366.

(Nasdaq: MNPR), a clinical-stage radiopharma company focused on developing innovative treatments for cancer patients, today announced that it will effect a 1-for-5 reverse stock split of its outstanding shares of common stock (the “Reverse Stock Split”). The Company expects that the Reverse Stock Split will become effective at 5:00 pm on Monday August 12, 2024, and its common stock will begin trading on a split-adjusted basis at the open of trading on Tuesday, August 13, 2024 under the new CUSIP number 61023L207. Monopar’s common stock will continue to trade on the NASDAQ Capital Market under the symbol “MNPR”. The Reverse Stock Split is an effort to regain compliance with Nasdaq's listing rules.</p> <p align=\"left\">The Reverse Stock Split was approved by the Company's stockholders at its Annual Meeting of Stockholders held on August 5, 2024, to be effected by the Company's Board of Directors within approved parameters. The Company’s Board of Directors approved the Reverse Stock Split at a ratio of 1-for-5 on August 5, 2024.</p> <p align=\"left\">As a result of the Reverse Stock Split, each 5 shares of the Company's issued and outstanding common stock will be automatically combined and converted into one issued and outstanding share of common stock, resulting in the number of outstanding shares of Monopar's common stock being reduced from approximately 17.6 million to approximately 3.5 million immediately following the effectiveness of the Reverse Stock Split. The Reverse Stock Split will affect all holders of shares of our common stock uniformly and each stockholder will hold the same percentage of our common stock outstanding immediately following the reverse stock split as that stockholder held immediately prior to the reverse stock split, except for adjustments that may result from the treatment of fractional shares as described below. The Reverse Stock Split will not affect the number of authorized shares of common stock or the par value of the common stock.</p> <p align=\"left\">Monopar’s transfer agent, VStock Transfer LLC, which is also acting as the exchange agent for the Reverse Stock Split, will provide instructions to stockholders regarding the process for exchanging physical share certificates. Stockholders holding their shares in book-entry form will not need to take any action in connection with the Reverse Stock Split. Stockholders will not receive fractional shares of common stock in connection with the Reverse Stock Split. Instead, stockholders who would have been entitled to a fractional share will receive such additional fraction of a share of common stock as is necessary to increase the fractional share to which they were entitled to a full share.</p> <p align=\"left\">Additional information on the Reverse Stock Split can be found in the Company’s definitive proxy statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on July 22, 2024, which is available on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov and on the Company’s website, www.monopartx.com.</p> <p align=\"left\"><strong>About Monopar Therapeutics Inc.</strong></p> <p align=\"left\">Monopar Therapeutics is a clinical-stage radiopharmaceutical company focused on developing innovative treatments for cancer patients, including Phase 1-stage MNPR-101-Zr for imaging advanced cancers and late preclinical-stage MNPR-101 radio-immuno-therapeutic (RIT) for the treatment of advanced cancers, as well as early development programs against solid cancers.
