These developments underscore the Company's commitment to advancing the hydrogen economy and solidifying its market and financial position in the industry.\n\n**Financial Highlights**\n\n  * **Q3 Financial Performance:** Plug reported revenue of $173.7 million in Q3 2024, representing an inflection in electrolyzer deployments, continued expansion of its internally produced hydrogen network, and increased leverage on its manufacturing footprint. \n    * **Operating Cash Flows:** Improved 31% Quarter-Over-Quarter (QoQ) reflecting improvement in margins, working capital efficiency, and leverage of existing inventory. Plug expects to continue to see improvements as revenues increase in the fourth quarter, allowing for further leverage on inventory and fixed manufacturing costs.\n    * **Gross Margin Loss** : Decreased 37% QoQ. This was driven by multiple revenue streams, equipment improving 42%, service improving 776%, Power Purchase Agreements (PPA) improving 13%, and fuel improving 9%.\n    * **Net Loss:** Plug recorded an Earnings-Per-Share loss of $0.25 for Q3 2024, compared to $0.36 for Q2 2024. The Company recorded a net loss of $211.2 million in Q3 2024, compared to $262.3 million in Q2 2024. This net loss included strategic investments, new product deployments, and market dynamics. This net loss also included ~$70.5 million of non-cash charges such as depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, provision for common stock warrants, inventory adjustments, and impairment charges.\n\n\n\n**Operational and Strategic Highlights**\n\n  * **Electrolyzer Deployment and Revenue Inflection:** Plug reported an inflection point for revenue in Q3 2024 with electrolyzer sales increasing 285% QoQ with contribution from 5MW (megawatt) system sales being recognized and additional revenue recognized from a large-scale order being deployed. In Q3 2024, the Company announced an order for 25 MW from bp and Iberdola’s joint venture at the Castellon refinery project in Spain. This quarter marks a major milestone for Plug’s electrolyzer business as it scales and is a significant inflection point for the industry overall, with Q4 2024 expected to see significant deployments continue. This positions the product platform for growth in 2025 and beyond.\n  * **Leveraging Plug’s Hydrogen Production Network:** Hydrogen fuel margins continue to improve as the Company effectively leverages its internal network of hydrogen plants. Planned downtime and maintenance at its Georgia and Tennessee facilities in Q3 2024 limited margin contribution but is expected to improve with higher utilization in Q4 2024. Additionally, our Joint Venture hydrogen plant with Olin Corporation in Louisiana is progressing and is currently in the process of commissioning, with liquid production expected to ramp up to nameplate capacity during Q1 2025**.**\n  * **Basic Engineer and Design Package (BEDP) Contracts:** To date, Plug has grown to over 8 GW (gigawatts) in global BEDP contracts, which includes further progress in Q3 2024 to a binding framework agreement to provide Allied Green Ammonia (AGA) with 3 GW of electrolyzer capacity for its ammonia plant in Australia. Plug and AGA are in the final stages of completing purchase agreements, expected to be finalized in the coming months. Progress with BEDP customers has continued globally, and anticipated finalization of the 45V tax credit in the U.S. is expected to support acceleration in BEDP work and project FIDs in coming quarters.\n  * **Continued Momentum in Material Handling:** This quarter Plug saw additional benefits of price increases implemented during Q2 2024, primarily in its fuel and service business, with additional pricing benefits expected from PPAs in Q4 2024. Alongside this progress, Plug expanded its material handling portfolio by partnering with Carreras Grupo Logistico to establish Spain’s first hydrogen-powered logistics site. Plug plans to deliver a complete green hydrogen ecosystem to this site, including hydrogen fuel cells, a 1 MW electrolyzer, and a hydrogen refueling station, marking a key milestone in advancing hydrogen adoption in European logistics.\n  * **Groundbreaking 8 MW Stationary Hydrogen Fuel Cell System for Energy Vault:** Plug Power has completed the installation of an 8 MW hydrogen fuel cell system, designed and integrated by Energy Vault, for a first-of-its-kind hybrid microgrid in California. Combining battery storage with green hydrogen, this system will deliver reliable power during wildfires and emergencies, setting a new benchmark for clean, resilient energy solutions in the U.S.\n  * **Department of Energy (DOE) Support:** Plug continues to progress with the DOE loan, which aims to support the expansion of its green hydrogen initiatives and infrastructure for up to six hydrogen sites. Additionally, the Company was awarded a $10 million DOE grant to lead the development of advanced hydrogen refueling stations in Washington State in Q3 2024.\n  * **Revenue Outlook:** Plug anticipates its 2024 revenue to range between $700 million and $800 million, driven by a pipeline of orders in the electrolyzer, cryogenic, and material handling businesses in the second half of 2024. Despite the speed and development of the hydrogen economy continuing to impact hydrogen equipment deployments, the mid-term and long-term outlook remains positive.\n\n\n\n**CEO Statement**\n\nPlug Power CEO Andy Marsh stated: “Plug Power's performance this quarter underscores our commitment to building a sustainable and profitable hydrogen future. Our progress in electrolyzer deployments, advancements in hydrogen production, and expansion into new markets reflect our team's dedication to leading the build out of the hydrogen economy.”\n\n**2024 Plug symposium**\n\nPlug will host its 6th annual symposium on November 13th at its headquarters in Slingerlands, N.Y. The event will bring together Plug leadership and industry experts to showcase groundbreaking projects that are reshaping the hydrogen industry and to present innovative solutions for the future.\n\nWe invite all stakeholders to join us virtually for this important industry event.

(NASDAQ: PLUG), a global leader in comprehensive hydrogen solutions for the green hydrogen economy, today announced further progress on its strategic and operational initiatives and path to profitability in the third quarter of 2024. These developments underscore the Company's commitment to advancing the hydrogen economy and solidifying its market and financial position in the industry.\n\n**Financial Highlights**\n\n  * **Q3 Financial Performance:** Plug reported revenue of $173.7 million in Q3 2024, representing an inflection in electrolyzer deployments, continued expansion of its internally produced hydrogen network, and increased leverage on its manufacturing footprint. \n    * **Operating Cash Flows:** Improved 31% Quarter-Over-Quarter (QoQ) reflecting improvement in margins, working capital efficiency, and leverage of existing inventory. Plug expects to continue to see improvements as revenues increase in the fourth quarter, allowing for further leverage on inventory and fixed manufacturing costs.\n    * **Gross Margin Loss** : Decreased 37% QoQ. This was driven by multiple revenue streams, equipment improving 42%, service improving 776%, Power Purchase Agreements (PPA) improving 13%, and fuel improving 9%.\n    * **Net Loss:** Plug recorded an Earnings-Per-Share loss of $0.25 for Q3 2024, compared to $0.36 for Q2 2024. The Company recorded a net loss of $211.2 million in Q3 2024, compared to $262.3 million in Q2 2024. This net loss included strategic investments, new product deployments, and market dynamics. This net loss also included ~$70.5 million of non-cash charges such as depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, provision for common stock warrants, inventory adjustments, and impairment charges.\n\n\n\n**Operational and Strategic Highlights**\n\n  * **Electrolyzer Deployment and Revenue Inflection:** Plug reported an inflection point for revenue in Q3 2024 with electrolyzer sales increasing 285% QoQ with contribution from 5MW (megawatt) system sales being recognized and additional revenue recognized from a large-scale order being deployed. In Q3 2024, the Company announced an order for 25 MW from bp and Iberdola’s joint venture at the Castellon refinery project in Spain. This quarter marks a major milestone for Plug’s electrolyzer business as it scales and is a significant inflection point for the industry overall, with Q4 2024 expected to see significant deployments continue. This positions the product platform for growth in 2025 and beyond.\n  * **Leveraging Plug’s Hydrogen Production Network:** Hydrogen fuel margins continue to improve as the Company effectively leverages its internal network of hydrogen plants. Planned downtime and maintenance at its Georgia and Tennessee facilities in Q3 2024 limited margin contribution but is expected to improve with higher utilization in Q4 2024. Additionally, our Joint Venture hydrogen plant with Olin Corporation in Louisiana is progressing and is currently in the process of commissioning, with liquid production expected to ramp up to nameplate capacity during Q1 2025**.**\n  * **Basic Engineer and Design Package (BEDP) Contracts:** To date, Plug has grown to over 8 GW (gigawatts) in global BEDP contracts, which includes further progress in Q3 2024 to a binding framework agreement to provide Allied Green Ammonia (AGA) with 3 GW of electrolyzer capacity for its ammonia plant in Australia. Plug and AGA are in the final stages of completing purchase agreements, expected to be finalized in the coming months. Progress with BEDP customers has continued globally, and anticipated finalization of the 45V tax credit in the U.S. is expected to support acceleration in BEDP work and project FIDs in coming quarters.\n  * **Continued Momentum in Material Handling:** This quarter Plug saw additional benefits of price increases implemented during Q2 2024, primarily in its fuel and service business, with additional pricing benefits expected from PPAs in Q4 2024. Alongside this progress, Plug expanded its material handling portfolio by partnering with Carreras Grupo Logistico to establish Spain’s first hydrogen-powered logistics site. Plug plans to deliver a complete green hydrogen ecosystem to this site, including hydrogen fuel cells, a 1 MW electrolyzer, and a hydrogen refueling station, marking a key milestone in advancing hydrogen adoption in European logistics.\n  * **Groundbreaking 8 MW Stationary Hydrogen Fuel Cell System for Energy Vault:** Plug Power has completed the installation of an 8 MW hydrogen fuel cell system, designed and integrated by Energy Vault, for a first-of-its-kind hybrid microgrid in California. Combining battery storage with green hydrogen, this system will deliver reliable power during wildfires and emergencies, setting a new benchmark for clean, resilient energy solutions in the U.S.\n  * **Department of Energy (DOE) Support:** Plug continues to progress with the DOE loan, which aims to support the expansion of its green hydrogen initiatives and infrastructure for up to six hydrogen sites. Additionally, the Company was awarded a $10 million DOE grant to lead the development of advanced hydrogen refueling stations in Washington State in Q3 2024.\n  * **Revenue Outlook:** Plug anticipates its 2024 revenue to range between $700 million and $800 million, driven by a pipeline of orders in the electrolyzer, cryogenic, and material handling businesses in the second half of 2024. Despite the speed and development of the hydrogen economy continuing to impact hydrogen equipment deployments, the mid-term and long-term outlook remains positive.\n\n\n\n**CEO Statement**\n\nPlug Power CEO Andy Marsh stated: “Plug Power's performance this quarter underscores our commitment to building a sustainable and profitable hydrogen future. Our progress in electrolyzer deployments, advancements in hydrogen production, and expansion into new markets reflect our team's dedication to leading the build out of the hydrogen economy.”\n\n**2024 Plug symposium**\n\nPlug will host its 6th annual symposium on November 13th at its headquarters in Slingerlands, N.Y.

Actual performance or results may differ materially from those expressed in these statements as a result of various factors, including, but not limited to, the following: the risk that our ability to achieve our business objectives and to continue to meet our obligations is dependent upon our ability to maintain a certain level of liquidity, which will depend in part on our ability to manage our cash flows; the risk that the funding of our loan guarantee from the Department of Energy may be delayed and the risk that we may not be able to satisfy all of the technical, legal, environmental or financial conditions acceptable to the DOE to receive the loan guarantee; the risk that we may continue to incur losses and might never achieve or maintain profitability; the risk that we may not realize the anticipated benefits and actual savings in connection with the restructuring; the risk that we may not be able to raise additional capital to fund our operations and such capital may not be available to us on favorable terms or at all; the risk that we may not be able to expand our business or manage our future growth effectively; the risk that we may not be able to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting; the risk that global economic uncertainty, including inflationary pressures, fluctuating interest rates, currency fluctuations, and supply chain disruptions, may adversely affect our operating results; the risk that we may not be able to obtain from our hydrogen suppliers a sufficient supply of hydrogen at competitive prices or the risk that we may not be able to produce hydrogen internally at competitive prices; the risk that delays in or not completing our product and project development goals may adversely affect our revenue and profitability; the risk that our estimated future revenue may not be indicative of actual future revenue or profitability; the risk of elimination, reduction of, or changes in qualifying criteria for government subsidies and economic incentives for alternative energy products, including the Inflation Reduction Act and our qualification to utilize the PTC; and the risk that we may not be able to manufacture and market products on a profitable and large-scale commercial basis.

Nature of Operations\nPlug Power Inc. (the “Company”, “Plug”, “we” or “our”) is facilitating the paradigm shift to an increasingly\nelectrified world by innovating cutting-edge hydrogen and fuel cell solutions. While we continue to develop commercially\nviable hydrogen and fuel cell product solutions, we have expanded our offerings to support a variety of commercial operations\nthat can be powered with clean hydrogen. We provide electrolyzers that allow customers — such as refineries, producers of\nchemicals, steel, fertilizer and commercial refueling stations — to generate hydrogen on-site. We are focusing our efforts on\n(a) industrial mobility applications, including electric forklifts and electric industrial vehicles, at multi shift high volume\nmanufacturing and high throughput distribution sites where we believe our products and services provide a unique\ncombination of productivity, flexibility, and environmental benefits; (b) production of hydrogen; and (c) stationary power\nsystems that will support critical operations, such as data centers, microgrids, and generation facilities, in either a backup\npower or continuous power role, and replace batteries, diesel generators or the grid for telecommunication logistics,\ntransportation, and utility customers. Plug expects to support these products and customers with an ecosystem of vertically\nintegrated products that produce, transport, store and handle, dispense, and use hydrogen for mobility and power applications.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe Company’s working capital was $847.1 million as of September 30, 2024, which included unrestricted cash and\ncash equivalents of $93.9 million and restricted cash of $906.3 million. On January 17, 2024, the Company entered into the At\nMarket Issuance Sales Agreement (the “Original ATM Agreement”) with B. Riley Securities, Inc. (“B. Riley”), pursuant to\nwhich the Company may, from time to time, offer and sell through or to B. Riley, as sales agent or principal, shares of the\nCompany’s common stock, having an aggregate gross sales price of up to $1.0 billion. As of February 23, 2024, the Company\nhad $697.9 million remaining authorized for issuance under the Original ATM Agreement. On February 23, 2024, the\nCompany and B. Riley entered into Amendment No. 1 to the Original ATM Agreement (“Amendment No. 1” and, together\nwith the Original ATM Agreement, the “ATM Agreement”) to increase the aggregate gross sales price of shares of the\nCompany’s common stock available for future issuance under the Original ATM Agreement to $1.0 billion. Under the ATM\nAgreement, the Company has the right at its sole discretion to direct B. Riley to act on a principal basis and purchase directly\nfrom the Company up to $11.0 million of shares of its common stock on any trading day (the “Maximum Commitment\nAdvance Purchase Amount”) if the Company’s market capitalization is more than $1.0 billion (or up to $10.0 million if the\nCompany’s market capitalization is less than $1.0 billion) and up to $55.0 million of shares in any calendar week (the\n“Maximum Commitment Advance Purchase Amount Cap”) if the Company’s market capitalization is more than $1.0 billion\n(or up to $30.0 million if the Company’s market capitalization is less than $1.0 billion). As of November 7, 2024, the\nCompany had offered and sold 219,835,221 shares of common stock having an aggregate gross sales price of approximately\n$677.2 million under the ATM Agreement and shares of the Company’s common stock having an aggregate gross sales price\nof approximately $624.8 million remained available for issuance and sale under the ATM Agreement.\nOn November 7, 2024, the Company entered into Amendment No. 2 to the Original ATM Agreement (“Amendment\nNo. 2” and together with the ATM Agreement, the “Amended ATM Agreement”) with B. Riley. Amendment No. 2 increased\nthe aggregate gross sales price of the Company’s common stock the Company may offer and sell pursuant to the Amended\nATM Agreement by approximately $375.2 million to $1.0 billion. From and after November 7, 2024, through and including\nFebruary 7, 2025, the Company has the right at its sole discretion to direct B. Riley to act on a principal basis and purchase\nfrom the Company up to the Maximum Commitment Advance Purchase Amount of $11.0 million and up to the Maximum\nCommitment Advance Purchase Amount Cap of $55.0 million (including any shares sold by B. Riley in agency transactions)\nin any calendar week. If the Company’s market capitalization is less than $1.0 billion on and after February 8, 2025, the\nMaximum Commitment Advance Purchase Amount shall be decreased to $10.0 million and the Maximum Commitment\nAdvance Purchase Amount Cap shall be decreased to $30.0 million.\nOn November 11, 2024, the Company entered into a Debenture Purchase Agreement with YA II PN, Ltd. under\nwhich the Company agreed to sell and issue to the Investor an unsecured convertible debenture in aggregate principal amount\nof $200.0 million in exchange for the payment by the Investor to the Company of $190.0 million.

Riley to purchase\nshares directly from the Company under the Amended ATM Agreement, will be sufficient to fund its on-going operations for a\nperiod of at least 12 months subsequent to the issuance of the accompanying unaudited interim condensed consolidated\nfinancial statements.\n2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of the Company\nand its wholly-owned subsidiaries. Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. In addition,\nwe include our share of the results of our joint ventures with Renault SAS (“Renault”) named HyVia SAS, a French société\npar actions simplifiée (“HyVia”), AccionaPlug S.L. (“AccionaPlug”), and SK Plug Hyverse Co., Ltd. (“SK Plug Hyverse”),\nand our investment in Clean H2 Infra Fund, using the equity method based on our economic ownership interest and our ability\nto exercise significant influence over the operating and financial decisions of HyVia, AccionaPlug, SK Plug Hyverse and\nClean H2 Infra Fund.\nInterim Financial Statements\nThe accompanying unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared pursuant to\nthe rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). In the opinion of management, all adjustments,\nwhich consist solely of normal recurring adjustments, necessary to present fairly, in accordance with U.S. generally accepted\naccounting principles (“GAAP”), the financial position, results of operations and cash flows for all periods presented, have\nbeen made. The results of operations for the interim periods presented are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be\nexpected for the full year.\nCertain information and footnote disclosures normally included in annual consolidated financial statements prepared\nin accordance with GAAP have been condensed or omitted. These unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial\nstatements should be read in conjunction with the Company’s audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto\nincluded in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 (the “2023 Form 10-\nK”).\nThe information presented in the accompanying unaudited interim condensed consolidated balance sheets as of\nDecember 31, 2023 has been derived from the Company’s 2023 audited consolidated financial statements.\nThe unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements contained herein should be read in conjunction\nwith our 2023 Form 10-K.\nClean Hydrogen Production Tax Credit\nBeginning in the second quarter of 2024, the Company determined that it qualifies for the clean hydrogen production\ntax credit (“PTC”) under Section 45V as part of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (“IRA”) resulting from operation of the\nCompany’s hydrogen production plant located in Georgia. The PTC is available for qualified clean hydrogen produced and\nsold during the 10-year period beginning on the date the qualified clean hydrogen production facility was originally placed in\nservice. The Company has chosen elective pay, also referred to as direct pay, for the 2024 taxable year. This election makes\nthe PTC refundable, as the Company can receive the full value of the credit from the Internal Revenue Service. This election\nwill apply to the 2024 taxable year and the four subsequent taxable years unless\n9\nTable of Contents\nrevoked. During the remaining five years of the 10-year period to receive the PTC, the Company can elect to transfer all or a\nportion of the PTC to a third party buyer in exchange for cash. The Company has analogized the accounting of the PTC to\naccounting for government grants due to the ability to receive payment for the credit regardless of whether the Company has\nan income tax liability. As a result, the Company recorded approximately $1.6 million and $2.9 million for the three and nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as a reduction to the “fuel delivered to customers and related equipment”\ncosts of revenue financial statement line item in the unaudited interim condensed consolidated statement of operations and\n$3.3 million as of September 30, 2024 as an increase to the “other assets” financial statement line item in the unaudited\ninterim condensed consolidated balance sheet.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nRecently Adopted Accounting Guidance\nThere have been no significant changes in our reported financial position or results of operations and cash flows\nresulting from the adoption of new accounting pronouncements.\nRecent Accounting Guidance Not Yet Effective\nOther than the standards mentioned in our 2023 Form 10-K, all issued but not yet effective accounting and reporting\nstandards as of September 30, 2024 are either not applicable to the Company or are not expected to have a material impact on\nthe Company.\n3.

Earnings Per Share\nBasic earnings per common stock are computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of common\nstock outstanding during the reporting period. Since the Company is in a net loss position, all common stock equivalents\nwould be considered anti-dilutive and are therefore not included in the determination of diluted earnings per share.\nAccordingly, basic and diluted loss per share are the same.\n10\nTable of Contents\nThe potentially dilutive securities are summarized as follows:\nAs of September 30,\n2024 2023\nStock options outstanding (1) 33,180,236 35,463,759\nRestricted stock and restricted stock units outstanding (2) 4,824,497 7,261,132\nCommon stock warrants (3) 82,022,634 78,561,263\nConvertible Senior Notes (4) 44,661,605 39,170,766\nNumber of dilutive potential shares of common stock 164,688,972 160,456,920\n(1) During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company granted options for 1,726,500 and 2,255,096\nshares of common stock, respectively.

Warrant Transaction Agreements\nAmazon Transaction Agreement in 2022\nOn August 24, 2022, the Company and Amazon entered into a Transaction Agreement (the “2022 Amazon\nTransaction Agreement”), under which the Company concurrently issued to Amazon.com NV Investment Holdings LLC, a\nwholly owned subsidiary of Amazon, a warrant (the “2022 Amazon Warrant”) to acquire up to 16,000,000 shares (the “2022\nAmazon Warrant Shares”) of the Company’s common stock, subject to certain vesting events described below. The Company\nand Amazon entered into the 2022 Amazon Transaction Agreement in connection with a concurrent commercial arrangement\nunder which Amazon agreed to purchase hydrogen fuel from the Company through August 24, 2029.\n1,000,000 of the 2022 Amazon Warrant Shares vested immediately upon issuance of the 2022 Amazon Warrant.\n15,000,000 of the 2022 Amazon Warrant Shares will vest in multiple tranches over the 7-year term of the 2022 Amazon\nWarrant based on payments made to the Company directly by Amazon or its affiliates, or indirectly through third parties, with\n15,000,000 of the 2022 Amazon Warrant Shares fully vesting if Amazon-related payments of $2.1 billion are made in the\naggregate. The exercise price for the first 9,000,000 2022 Amazon Warrant Shares is $22.9841 per share and the fair value on\nthe grant date was $20.36. The exercise price for the remaining 7,000,000 2022 Amazon Warrant Shares will be an amount per\nshare equal to 90% of the 30-day volume weighted average share price of the Company’s common stock as of the final vesting\nevent that results in full vesting of the first 9,000,000 2022 Amazon Warrant Shares. The 2022 Amazon Warrant is exercisable\nthrough August 24, 2029.\nUpon the consummation of certain change of control transactions (as defined in the 2022 Amazon Warrant) prior to\nthe vesting of at least 60% of the aggregate 2022 Amazon Warrant Shares, the 2022 Amazon Warrant will automatically vest\nand become exercisable with respect to an additional number of 2022 Amazon Warrant Shares such that 60% of the aggregate\n2022 Amazon Warrant Shares shall have vested. If a change of control transaction is consummated after the vesting of at least\n60% of the aggregate 2022 Amazon Warrant Shares, then no acceleration of vesting will occur with respect to any of the\nunvested 2022 Amazon Warrant Shares as a result of the transaction. The exercise price and the 2022 Amazon Warrant Shares\nissuable upon exercise of the 2022 Amazon Warrant are subject to customary antidilution adjustments.\nOn August 24, 2022, 1,000,000 of the 2022 Amazon Warrant Shares associated with tranche 1 vested. The warrant\nfair value associated with the vested shares of tranche 1 of $20.4 million was capitalized to contract assets based on the grant\ndate fair value and is subsequently amortized ratably as a reduction to revenue based on the Company’s estimate of revenue\nover the term of the agreement. As of September 30, 2024, the balance of the contract asset related to tranche 1 was $18.8\nmillion which is recorded in contract assets in the Company’s unaudited interim condensed consolidated balance sheet. During\nthe second quarter of 2023, all 1,000,000 of the 2022 Amazon Warrant Shares associated with tranche 2 vested. The warrant\nfair value associated with the vested shares of tranche 2 was $20.4 million and was determined on the grant date of August 24,\n2022. As of September 30, 2024, the balance of the contract asset related to tranche 2 was $18.8 million. Tranche 3 will vest\nover the next $1.0 billion of collections from Amazon and its affiliates. The grant date fair value of tranche 3 will also be\namortized ratably as a reduction to revenue based on the Company’s estimate of revenue over the term of the agreement. As of\nSeptember 30, 2024, the balance of the contract asset related to tranche 3 was $3.6 million. Because the exercise price has yet\nto be determined, the fair value of tranche 4 will be remeasured at each reporting period end and amortized ratably as a\nreduction to revenue based on the Company’s estimate of revenue over the term of the agreement.\nAs of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, 2,500,000 and 2,000,000 of the 2022 Amazon Warrant Shares had\nvested, respectively, and none of the 2022 Amazon Warrant Shares had been exercised. The total amount of provision for\ncommon stock warrants recorded as a reduction of revenue for the 2022 Amazon Warrant during the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 and 2023 was $2.0 million and $1.6 million, respectively. The total amount of provision for common\nstock warrants recorded as a reduction of revenue for the 2022 Amazon Warrant during the nine months ended September 30,\n2024 and 2023 was $4.4 million and $4.3 million, respectively.\n18\nTable of Contents\nThe assumptions used to calculate the valuations of the 2022 Amazon Warrant as of August 24, 2022 and September\n30, 2024 are as follows:\nTranches 1-3 Tranche 4\nAugust 24, 2022 September 30, 2024\nRisk-free interest rate 3.15% 3.51%\nVolatility 75.00% 95.00%\nExpected average term (years) 7.00 1.15\nExercise price $22.98 $2.03\nStock price $20.36 $2.26\nWalmart Transaction Agreement\nOn July 20, 2017, the Company and Walmart entered into a Transaction Agreement (the “Walmart Transaction\nAgreement”), pursuant to which the Company agreed to issue to Walmart a warrant (the “Walmart Warrant”) to acquire up to\n55,286,696 shares of the Company’s common stock, subject to certain vesting events (the “Walmart Warrant Shares”). The\nCompany and Walmart entered into the Walmart Transaction Agreement in connection with existing commercial agreements\nbetween the Company and Walmart with respect to the deployment of the Company’s GenKey fuel cell technology across\nvarious Walmart distribution centers. The existing commercial agreements contemplate, but do not guarantee, future purchase\norders for the Company’s fuel cell technology. The vesting of the warrant shares was conditioned upon payments made by\nWalmart or its affiliates (directly or indirectly through third parties) pursuant to transactions entered into after January 1, 2017\nunder existing commercial agreements.\nThe exercise price for the first and second tranches of Walmart Warrant Shares was $2.1231 per share. After Walmart\nhas made payments to the Company totaling $200.0 million, the third tranche of 20,368,784 Walmart Warrant Shares will vest\nin eight installments of 2,546,098 Walmart Warrant Shares each time Walmart or its affiliates, directly or indirectly through\nthird parties, make an aggregate of $50.0 million in payments for goods and services to the Company, up to payments totaling\n$400.0 million in the aggregate. The exercise price of the third tranche of the Walmart Warrant Shares is $6.28 per share,\nwhich was determined pursuant to the terms of the Walmart Warrant as an amount equal to 90% of the 30-day volume\nweighted average share price of the Company’s common stock as of October 30, 2023, the final vesting date of the second\ntranche of the Walmart Warrant Shares. The Walmart Warrant is exercisable through July 20, 2027. The Walmart Warrant\nprovides for net share settlement that, if elected by the holder, will reduce the number of shares issued upon exercise to reflect\nnet settlement of the exercise price. The Walmart Warrant provides for certain adjustments that may be made to the exercise\nprice and the number of shares of common stock issuable upon exercise due to customary anti-dilution provisions based on\nfuture events. The Walmart Warrant is classified as an equity instrument. As of September 30, 2024, the balance of the\ncontract asset related to the Walmart Warrant was $5.4 million.\nAs of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, 40,010,108 and 34,917,912 of the Walmart Warrant Shares had\nvested, respectively, and the Walmart Warrant was exercised with respect to 13,094,217 shares of the Company’s common\nstock. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, there were no exercises with respect to the\nWalmart Warrant. The total amount of provision for common stock warrants recorded as a reduction of revenue for the\nWalmart Warrant during the three months ended September 30, 2024 was $3.9 million compared to a negative provision for\ncommon stock warrants recorded as an addition to revenue of $3.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023.\nThe total amount of provision for common stock warrants recorded as a reduction of revenue for the Walmart Warrant during\nthe nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was $11.6 million and $8.4 million, respectively.\n19\nTable of Contents\n13.

Income Taxes\nThe Company recorded $0.1 million of income tax expense and $4.7 million of income tax benefit for the three\nmonths ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The Company recorded $0.1 million of income tax benefit and $6.9\nmillion of income tax benefit for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The income tax benefit\nfor the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was due to an incremental change to the valuation allowance recorded in\nforeign jurisdictions. The Company has not changed its overall conclusion with respect to the need for a valuation allowance\nagainst its domestic net deferred tax assets, which remain fully reserved, and its valuation allowances recorded in foreign\njurisdictions.\nThe domestic net deferred tax asset generated from the Company’s net operating loss has been offset by a full\nvaluation allowance because it is more likely than not that the tax benefits of the net operating loss carryforward will not\n21\nTable of Contents\nbe realized. The Company recognizes accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits, if any, as a\ncomponent of income tax expense.\nThe Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development Inclusive Framework on Base Erosion and Profit\nShifting has proposed a global minimum corporate tax rate of 15% on multi-national corporations, commonly referred to as\nthe Pillar Two rules that has been agreed upon in principle by over 140 countries. While the United States has not adopted the\nPillar Two rules, numerous foreign countries have enacted legislation to implement the Pillar Two rules, effective beginning\nJanuary 1, 2024, or are expected to enact similar legislation. As of September 30, 2024, the Company did not meet the\nconsolidated revenue threshold and is not subject to the GloBE Rules under Pillar Two. The Company will continue to\nmonitor the implementation of rules in the jurisdictions in which it operates.\n15. Fair Value Measurements\nThe Company records the fair value of assets and liabilities in accordance with ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement\n(“ASC 820”). ASC 820 defines fair value as the price received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly\ntransaction between market participants at the measurement date and in the principal or most advantageous market for that\nasset or liability. The fair value should be calculated based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the\nasset or liability, not on assumptions specific to the entity.\nIn addition to defining fair value, ASC 820 expands the disclosure requirements around fair value and establishes a\nfair value hierarchy for valuation inputs. The hierarchy prioritizes the inputs into three levels based on the extent to which\ninputs used in measuring fair value are observable in the market. Each fair value measurement is reported in one of the three\nlevels, which is determined by the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety.\nThese levels are:\n● Level 1 — quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\n● Level 2 — quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets or inputs that are observable for the\nasset or liability, either directly or indirectly through market corroboration, for substantially the full term of the\nfinancial instrument.\n● Level 3 — unobservable inputs reflecting management’s own assumptions about the inputs used in pricing the\nasset or liability at fair value.\nThere were no transfers between Level 1, Level 2, or Level 3 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024.\nFinancial instruments not recorded at fair value on a recurring basis include equity method investments that have not been\nremeasured or impaired in the current period, such as our investments in HyVia, AccionaPlug, SK Plug Hyverse and Clean H2\nInfra Fund.\nAssets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis are summarized below (in thousands):\nAs of September 30, 2024\nCarrying Fair Fair Value Measurements\nAmount Value Level 1 Level 2 Level 3\nLiabilities\nContingent consideration $ 91,987 $ 91,987 $ — $ — $ 91,987\nAs of December 31, 2023\nCarrying Fair Fair Value Measurements\nAmount Value Level 1 Level 2 Level 3\nLiabilities\nContingent consideration 126,216 126,216 — — 126,216\nThe liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis that have unobservable inputs and are therefore categorized\nas level 3 are related to contingent consideration. The fair value as of September 30, 2024 of $92.0 million is comprised of\ncontingent consideration related to the Joule Processing LLC (“Joule”) acquisition in 2022 and the Frames Holding B.V.\n(“Frames”) acquisition in 2021.\n22\nTable of Contents\nIn connection with the Joule acquisition, the Company initially recorded on its unaudited interim condensed\nconsolidated balance sheet a liability of $41.7 million representing the fair value of contingent consideration payable. The fair\nvalue of this contingent consideration was $60.0 million and $75.5 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023,\nrespectively. The decrease compared to the year ended December 31, 2023 was primarily due to payments that reduced the\nfair value of the liability by $10.0 million during the first quarter of 2024 and by $57 thousand during the third quarter of\n2024. A decrease of $1.4 million and $5.5 million was recorded in change in fair value of contingent consideration in the\nunaudited interim condensed consolidated statement of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024,\nrespectively.\nIn connection with the Frames acquisition, the Company initially recorded on its unaudited interim condensed\nconsolidated balance sheet a liability of $29.1 million representing the fair value of contingent consideration payable. The fair\nvalue of this contingent consideration was $32.0 million and $31.8 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023,\nrespectively. The increase compared to the year ended December 31, 2023 was primarily due to an increase in foreign\ncurrency translation losses of $1.3 million and $0.3 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024,\nrespectively. The increase was partially offset by a decrease of $0.1 million recorded in change in fair value of contingent\nconsideration in the unaudited interim condensed consolidated statement of operations for the nine months ended September\n30, 2024, partially offset by an increase of $1.5 million recorded in change in fair value of contingent consideration in the\nunaudited interim condensed consolidated statement of operations for the three months ended September 30, 2024.\nIn connection with the United Hydrogen Group Inc. (“UHG”) acquisition, the Company initially recorded on its\nunaudited interim condensed consolidated balance sheet a liability of $1.1 million representing the fair value of contingent\nconsideration payable. The contingent consideration was fully settled during the second quarter of 2024 and the fair value of\nthis contingent consideration was $0.9 million as of December 31, 2023. The decrease of $0.9 million was due to payments\nthat reduced the fair value of the liability by $1.0 million during the second quarter of 2024. Partially offsetting this decrease\nwas an increase of $0.1 million recorded in change in fair value of contingent consideration in the unaudited interim\ncondensed consolidated statement of operations during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The $1.0 million payment\nmade during the second quarter of 2024 settled the remaining earn-out obligation.\nIn connection with the Giner acquisition, the Company initially recorded on its unaudited interim condensed\nconsolidated balance sheet a liability of $16.0 million representing the fair value of contingent consideration payable. The\ncontingent consideration was fully settled during the second quarter of 2024 and the fair value of this contingent consideration\nwas $18.0 million as of December 31, 2023. The decrease of $18.0 million was due to payments that reduced the fair value of\nthe liability by $18.2 million during the second quarter of 2024. Partially offsetting this decrease was an increase of $0.2\nmillion recorded in change in fair value of contingent consideration in the unaudited interim condensed consolidated statement\nof operations during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The $18.2 million payment during the second quarter of\n2024 was paid in common stock and warrants and settled the remaining obligation of the earn-out.

These leases expire over the next one to seven years. Minimum rent payments under\noperating leases are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.\nLeases contain termination clauses with associated penalties, the amount of which cause the likelihood of\ncancellation to be remote. At the end of the lease term, the leased assets may be returned to the lessor by the Company, the\nCompany may negotiate with the lessor to purchase the assets at fair market value, or the Company may negotiate with the\nlessor to renew the lease at market rental rates. No residual value guarantees are contained in the leases. No financial\ncovenants are contained within the lease; however, the lease contains customary operational covenants such as the\nrequirement that the Company properly maintain the leased assets and carry appropriate insurance. The leases include credit\nsupport in the form of either cash, collateral or letters of credit. See Note 19, “Commitments and Contingencies”, for a\ndescription of cash held as security associated with the leases.\nThe Company has finance leases associated with its property and equipment in Slingerlands, New York and at\ncustomer fueling locations.\nFuture minimum lease payments under operating and finance leases (with initial or remaining lease terms in excess\nof one year) as of September 30, 2024 were as follows (in thousands):\nFinance Total\nOperating Lease Lease Lease\nLiability Liability Liabilities\nRemainder of 2024 $ 25,078 $ 2,978 $ 28,056\n2025 95,840 14,792 110,632\n2026 86,964 11,934 98,898\n2027 73,267 8,256 81,523\n2028 50,874 1,941 52,815\n2029 and thereafter 151,713 3,299 155,012\nTotal future minimum payments 483,736 43,200 526,936\nLess imputed interest (167,572) (5,244) (172,816)\nTotal $ 316,164 $ 37,956 $ 354,120\nRental expense for all operating leases was $26.0 million and $25.0 million for the three months ended September\n30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

Commitments and Contingencies\nRestricted Cash\nIn connection with certain of the above noted sale/leaseback agreements, cash of $507.8 million and $573.5 million\nwas required to be restricted as security as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, which restricted cash\nwill be released over the lease term. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company also had certain letters\nof credit backed by security deposits totaling $307.9 million and $370.7 million, respectively, of which $276.5 million and\n$340.0 million are security for the above noted sale/leaseback agreements, respectively, and $31.4 million and $30.7 million\nare customs related letters of credit, respectively.\nAs of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had $80.0 million and $76.8 million held in escrow\nrelated to the construction of certain hydrogen production plants, respectively.\nThe Company also had $0.1 million and $1.2 million of consideration held by our paying agent in connection with\neach of the Joule and CIS acquisitions, respectively, reported as restricted cash as of September 30, 2024, with a\ncorresponding accrued liability on the Company’s unaudited interim condensed consolidated balance sheet. Additionally, the\nCompany had $9.3 million and $11.7 million in restricted cash as collateral resulting from the Frames acquisition as of\nSeptember 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.\nLitigation\nLegal matters are handled in the ordinary course of business. The outcome of any such matters, regardless of the\nmerits, is inherently uncertain; therefore, assessing the likelihood of loss and any estimated damages is difficult and subject to\nconsiderable judgment. Liabilities for loss contingencies arising from claims, assessments, litigation, fines, and penalties and\nother sources are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably\n27\nTable of Contents\nestimated. Legal costs incurred in connection with loss contingencies are expensed as incurred. While we are not in a position\nto accurately predict the outcome of any legal or other proceedings, where there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss\nmay be incurred, GAAP requires us to disclose an estimate of the reasonably possible loss or range of loss, if material, or\nmake a statement that such an estimate cannot be made. Except for a $0.6 million accrual relating to a settled matter subject to\npending court approval, which has not been paid as of September 30, 2024, a reasonably possible loss or range of loss\nassociated with any individual legal proceeding cannot be currently estimated.\nSecurities Litigation and Related Stockholder Derivative Litigation\n2021 Securities Action and Related Derivative Litigation\nOne action is pending in which alleged stockholders of the Company assert claims derivatively, on the Company’s\nbehalf, based on allegations and claims that were asserted in In re Plug Power, Inc. Securities Litigation, No. 1:21-cv-2004\n(S.D.N.Y.), an earlier putative securities class action that is no longer pending (the “2021 Securities Action”). In an opinion\nand order entered in August 2023, the district court dismissed the 2021 Securities Action with prejudice, and the plaintiffs in\nthat action did not appeal.\nA consolidated stockholder derivative action relating to the claims and allegations in the 2021 Securities Action is\npending in the Court of Chancery for the State of Delaware, styled In re Plug Power Inc. Stockholder Derivative Litigation,\nCons. C.A. No. 2022-0569-KSJM (Del. Ch.). By stipulation and order, the action was stayed until motions to dismiss were\nfinally resolved in the 2021 Securities Action. On March 8, 2024, the alleged stockholder plaintiffs filed a consolidated\namended complaint asserting claims against our officers Andrew J. Marsh, Paul B. Middleton, Gerard L. Conway, Jr., and\nKeith Schmid, and against our current or former directors George C. McNamee, Gary K. Willis, Maureen O. Helmer,\nJohannes M. Roth, Gregory L. Kenausis, Lucas Schneider, and Jonathan Silver. The Company is named as nominal defendant.\nPrimarily based on allegations in the 2021 Securities Action, the plaintiffs assert claims against the individual defendants for\nalleged breaches of fiduciary duty, disgorgement, and unjust enrichment based on alleged transactions in the Company’s\nsecurities while allegedly in possession of material non-public information concerning (i) the Company’s financial accounting\nprior to the announcement that the Company would need to restate certain financial statements and (ii) the potential\namendment and termination of a warrant agreement between the Company and a significant customer. On May 10, 2024, the\nCompany, as nominal defendant, and all of the individual defendants filed a motion to dismiss (a) for failure to make a pre-suit\ndemand or to adequately allege demand futility and (b) by the individual defendants, for failure to state a claim. Oral argument\non the motion was held on November 4, 2024.\n2023 Securities Action and Related Derivative Litigation\nA consolidated action is pending in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware asserting claims\nunder the federal securities laws against the Company and certain of its senior officers on behalf of a putative class of\npurchasers of the Company’s securities, styled In re Plug Power, Inc. Securities Litigation, No. 1:23-cv-00576-MN (the “2023\nSecurities Action”). The plaintiffs filed a consolidated complaint on September 28, 2023, in which they assert claims under the\nfederal securities laws against the Company and four of its senior officers, Mr. Marsh, Mr. Middleton, Sanjay Shrestha, and\nformer officer David Mindnich, on behalf of a putative class of purchasers of the Company’s common stock between January\n19, 2022 and March 1, 2023. The complaint alleges that the defendants made “materially false and/or misleading statements”\nabout the Company’s business and operations, including the Company’s revenue goals for 2022, its ability to effectively\nmanage its supply chain and product manufacturing, and its progress in construction of new hydrogen production capacity.\nThe defendants filed a motion to dismiss the complaint on December 14, 2023, and briefing was completed in March 2024.\nAll proceedings are stayed pending resolution of the motion to dismiss.\nBeginning on September 13, 2023, three separate actions were filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of\nDelaware and in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York asserting claims derivatively, on behalf of the\nCompany, against certain former and current Company officers and directors based on the allegations and claims in the 2023\nSecurities Action. Those cases have been consolidated in the District of Delaware under the caption In re Plug Power, Inc.\nStockholder Deriv. Litig., No. 1:23-cv-01007-MN (D. Del.). The defendants named in the constituent complaint were Mr.\nMarsh, Mr. Middleton, Mr. Mindnich, Martin Hull, Ms. Helmer, Mr. Kenausis, Mr. McNamee, Mr.\n28\nTable of Contents\nSchneider, Mr. Silver, Mr. Willis, and current or former directors Jean Bua, Kavita Mahtani, and Kyungyeol Song.

Plug\nPower, Inc. et al., No. 1:24-cv-00406-MAD-DJS (N.D.N.Y.). The complaint alleges that the defendants made misstatements\nconcerning the Company’s progress in construction of new hydrogen production capacity and its ability to effectively manage\nits supply chain. On April 30, 2024, a second complaint asserting substantially similar claims against the same defendants, but\non behalf of a putative class of purchasers of the Company’s common stock between March 1, 2023 and January 16, 2024,\nwas filed in the Northern District of New York, styled Lee v. Plug Power, et al., No. 1:24;cv-0598-MAD-DJS (N.D.N.Y.). The\nCourt has approved stipulations in both actions extending the time for all defendants to respond to any pleading until after the\nCourt appoints lead plaintiff(s).\nOther Litigation\nOn May 2, 2023, a lawsuit entitled Jacob Thomas and JTurbo Engineering & Technology, LLC v. Joule Processing,\nLLC and Plug Power Inc., Case No. 4:23-cv-01615, was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of\nTexas against Joule Processing, LLC and the Company. The only claims that remain are misappropriation of trade secrets\nunder the federal Defend Trade Secrets Act of 2016, 18 U.S.C. § 1836, misappropriation of trade secrets under the Texas\nUniform Trade Secrets Act, and breach of contract. Currently pending before the United States District Court for the Southern\nDistrict of Texas is Plaintiff[s’] Verified Amended Application for Temporary Restraining Order, Preliminary Injunction and\nPermanent Injunctive Relief, which was filed on November 17, 2023. Also pending is Defendants Joule Processing, LLC’s\nand the Company’s Motion for Summary Judgment, which was filed on August 19, 2024, and Plaintiffs’ Amended Motion for\nPartial Summary Judgment, which was filed on October 1, 2024.\nOn July 24, 2023, an action entitled Felton v. Plug Power, Inc., Case No. 1:23-cv-887, was filed in the U.S. District\nCourt for the Northern District of New York asserting claims against the Company pursuant to the New York State Human\nRights Law. The complaint asserts that the plaintiff is seeking damages to redress injuries suffered as a result of harassment\nand discrimination on the basis of his race, together with creating a hostile work environment, and retaliation. The Company\ndisagrees with plaintiff’s representations about his time at the Company and intends to vigorously defend against his\nallegations. Plaintiff’s counsel moved to withdraw from the case, which the court approved on March 18, 2024, and therefore\nplaintiff is now pro se. The current discovery deadline is January 31, 2025.\nOn October 23, 2024, a case entitled First Solar, Inc. v. Plug Power Inc., Index No. 655610/2024 was filed in the\nNew York State Supreme Court, New York County, asserting a claim for breach of contract associated with a purchase order\nfor solar panels manufactured by First Solar to be purchased by the Company. The complaint seeks monetary relief along with\npre-judgment interest.\nConcentrations of Credit Risk\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject the Company to credit risk consist principally of cash, cash equivalents,\nrestricted cash and accounts receivable. Cash and restricted cash are maintained in accounts with financial institutions, which,\nat times may exceed the Federal depository insurance coverage of $250 thousand. The Company has not experienced losses on\nthese accounts and management believes, based upon the quality of the financial institutions, that the credit risk with regard to\nthese deposits is not significant.\nConcentrations of credit risk with respect to receivables exist due to the limited number of select customers with\nwhom the Company has commercial sales arrangements. To mitigate credit risk, the Company performs appropriate\nevaluation of a prospective customer’s financial condition.\n29\nTable of Contents\nAs of September 30, 2024, one customer individually exceeded 10% of total consolidated accounts receivable\nbalance with a balance of $34.1 million, or 20.4%, of the Company’s consolidated accounts receivable balance. At December\n31, 2023, one customer individually exceeded 10% of total consolidated accounts receivable balance with a balance of $52.4\nmillion, or 21.5%, of the Company’s consolidated accounts receivable balance.\nFor purposes of assigning a customer to a sale/leaseback transaction completed with a financial institution, the\nCompany considers the end user of the assets to be the ultimate customer. For the three months ended September 30, 2024,\ntwo customers individually exceeded 10% of total consolidated revenues. One of the customers accounted for $29.0 million,\nor 16.7%, and one of the customers accounted for $24.6 million, or 14.2%, of total consolidated revenues.

As part of\nthe agreement, our wholly-owned subsidiary, Plug Power France, was required to issue a guarantee to Bpifrance in the amount\nof €20 million through the end of January 2027. Plug Power France is liable to the extent of the guarantee for sums due to\nBpifrance from HyVia under the agreement based on the difference between the total amount paid by Bpifrance and the final\namount certified by HyVia and Bpifrance. As part of the agreement, there are certain milestones that HyVia is required to\nmeet, and the nonperformance of these milestones or termination of this agreement could result in this guarantee being called\nupon. As of September 30, 2024, no payments related to this guarantee have been made by the Company and Plug Power\nFrance did not record a liability for this guarantee as the likelihood of the guarantee being called upon is remote.\nUnconditional Purchase Obligations\nThe Company has entered into certain off–balance sheet commitments that require the future purchase of goods or\nservices (“unconditional purchase obligations”). The Company’s unconditional purchase obligations primarily consist of\nsupplier arrangements, take or pay contracts and service agreements. For certain vendors, the Company’s unconditional\nobligation to purchase a minimum quantity of raw materials at an agreed upon price is fixed and determinable; while certain\nother raw material costs will vary due to product forecasting and future economic conditions.\nFuture payments under non-cancelable unconditional purchase obligations with a remaining term in excess of one\nyear as of September 30, 2024, were as follows (in thousands):\nRemainder of 2024 $ 25,989\n2025 8,023\n2026 8,023\n2027 2,638\n2028 —\n2029 and thereafter —\nTotal 44,673\n30\nTable of Contents\n20.

Segment and Geographic Area Reporting\nOur organization is managed from a sales perspective based on “go-to-market” sales channels, emphasizing shared\nlearning across end-user applications and common supplier/vendor relationships. These sales channels are structured to serve a\nrange of customers for our products and services. As a result of this structure, we concluded that we have one operating and\nreportable segment — the design, development and sale of hydrogen products and solutions that help customers meet their\nbusiness goals while decarbonizing their operations. Our chief executive officer was identified as the chief operating decision\nmaker (CODM). All significant operating decisions made by management are largely based upon the analysis of Plug Power\nInc. on a total company basis, including assessments related to our incentive compensation plans.\nThe revenue and long-lived assets based on geographic location are as follows (in thousands):\nRevenues Revenues Long-Lived Assets\nThree months ended Nine months ended As of\nSeptember 30, 2024 September 30, 2023 September 30, 2024 September 30, 2023 September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nNorth America $ 107,798 $ 156,645 $ 326,647 $ 557,644 $ 1,923,649 $ 1,881,315\nEurope 50,958 34,097 80,714 86,367 162,748 122,489\nAsia 11,155 3,128 20,334 12,746 143 —\nOther 3,819 4,841 9,649 12,422 3,710 884\nTotal $ 173,730 $ 198,711 $ 437,344 $ 669,179 $ 2,090,250 $ 2,004,688\n22.

Restructuring\nIn February 2024, in a strategic move to enhance our financial performance and ensure long-term value creation in a\ncompetitive market, we approved a comprehensive initiative that encompasses a broad range of measures, including\noperational consolidation, strategic workforce adjustments, and various other cost-saving actions (the “Restructuring Plan”).\nThese measures are aimed at increasing efficiency, improving scalability, and maintaining our leadership position in the\nrenewable energy industry. We began executing the Restructuring Plan in February 2024 and expect the Restructuring Plan to\nbe completed in the fourth quarter of 2024, subject to local law and consultation requirements.\nThe determination of when we accrue for involuntary termination benefits under restructuring plans depends on\nwhether the termination benefits are provided under an ongoing benefit arrangement or under a one-time benefit arrangement.\nWe account for involuntary termination benefits that are provided pursuant to one-time benefit arrangements in accordance\nwith ASC 420, Exit or Disposal Cost Obligations (“ASC 420”) whereas involuntary termination benefits that are part of an\nongoing written or substantive plan are accounted for in accordance with ASC 712, Nonretirement Postemployment Benefits\n(“ASC 712”). We accrue a liability for termination benefits under ASC 420 in the period in which the plan is communicated to\nthe employees and the plan is not expected to change significantly. For ongoing benefit arrangements, inclusive of statutory\nrequirements, we accrue a liability for termination benefits under ASC 712 when the existing situation or set of circumstances\nindicates that an obligation has been incurred, it is probable the benefits will be paid, and the amount can be reasonably\nestimated. The restructuring charges that have been incurred but not yet paid are recorded in accrued expenses and other\ncurrent liabilities in our unaudited interim condensed consolidated balance sheets, as they are expected to be paid within the\nnext twelve months.\nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2024, we incurred $0.6 million in restructuring costs recorded as\nseverance expenses of $0.1 million and other restructuring costs of $0.5 million in the restructuring financial statement line\nitem in the unaudited interim condensed consolidated statement of operations. During the nine months ended September 30,\n2024, we incurred $8.2 million in restructuring costs recorded as severance expenses of $6.9 million and other restructuring\ncosts of $1.3 million in the restructuring financial statement line item in the unaudited interim condensed consolidated\nstatement of operations. Future restructuring costs are not expected to be material in subsequent quarters. The actual timing\nand amount of costs associated with these restructuring actions may differ from our current expectations and estimates and\nsuch differences may be material.\nSeverance expense recorded during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 in accordance with ASC\n420 was a result of the separation of full-time employees associated with the Restructuring Plan. As of September 30, 2024,\n$0.1 million of accrued severance-related costs were included in accrued expenses in our unaudited interim condensed\nconsolidated balance sheets and are expected to be paid during the fourth quarter of 2024. For the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024, other costs were represented by $0.5 million of other one-time employee termination benefits. For the\nnine months ended September 30, 2024, other costs were represented by (1) $0.2 million of legal and professional services\ncosts, and (2) $1.1 million of other one-time employee termination benefits. As of September 30, 2024, $29 thousand of\naccrued other costs were included in accrued expenses in our unaudited interim condensed consolidated balance sheets and are\nexpected to be paid during the fourth quarter of 2024.\n24.

The Company expects to close the issuance of the Convertible Debenture on or about November\n12, 2024, subject to customary closing conditions, including the Company’s filing of a prospectus supplement registering the\nresale of the shares of the Company’s common stock, par value $0.01 per share (the “Common Stock”), that may be issuable\nupon conversion of the Convertible Debenture. The Convertible Debenture ranks pari passu in right of payment with all other\noutstanding and future senior indebtedness of the Company. The Convertible Debenture will be issued in a private placement\nin reliance upon an exemption from registration provided by Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act.\nThe Convertible Debenture bears interest at a rate of 6.00% per annum and is payable on the second year anniversary\nof the issuance date of the Convertible Debenture (the “Maturity Date”) or earlier redemption date.\nThe Investor may convert all or any portion of the principal amount of the Convertible Debenture and if there are\ncertain events of default, the Investor may require the Company to amortize $22.5 million of the principal amount of the\nConvertible Debenture. The Company has the right to redeem the Convertible Debenture under certain circumstances.\nThe Convertible Debenture includes customary covenants and events of default that are typical for transactions of\nthis type and certain affirmative and negative covenants.\n36\nTable of Contents\nItem 2 — Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with our accompanying unaudited interim condensed\nconsolidated financial statements and notes thereto included within this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, and our audited and\nnotes thereto included in our 2023 Form 10-K.

We are focusing our efforts on (a) industrial mobility applications, including electric forklifts and\nelectric industrial vehicles, at multi shift high volume manufacturing and high throughput distribution sites where we believe\nour products and services provide a unique combination of productivity, flexibility, and environmental benefits; (b) production\nof hydrogen; and (c) stationary power systems that will support critical operations, such as data centers, microgrids, and\ngeneration facilities, in either a backup power or continuous power role, and replace batteries, diesel generators or the grid for\ntelecommunication logistics, transportation, and utility customers. Plug expects to support these products and customers with\nan ecosystem of vertically integrated products that produce, transport, store and handle, dispense, and use hydrogen for\nmobility and power applications.\nOur current product and service portfolio includes:\nGenDrive: GenDrive is our hydrogen fueled PEM fuel cell system, providing power to material handling electric\nvehicles (“EVs”), including Class 1, 2, 3 and 6 electric forklifts, automated guided vehicles, and ground support\nequipment.\nGenSure: GenSure is our stationary fuel cell solution providing scalable, modular PEM fuel cell power to support\nthe backup and grid-support power requirements of the telecommunications, transportation, and utility sectors; our\nGenSure High Power Fuel Cell Platform supports large scale stationary power and data center markets.\nProGen: ProGen is our fuel cell stack and engine technology currently used globally in mobility and stationary fuel\ncell systems, and as engines in electric delivery vans. This includes Plug’s membrane electrode assembly (“MEA”), a\ncritical component of the fuel cell stack used in zero-emission fuel cell EV engines.\nGenFuel: GenFuel is our liquid hydrogen fueling, delivery, generation, storage, and dispensing system.\nGenCare: GenCare is our ongoing “Internet of Things”-based maintenance and on-site service program for\nGenDrive fuel cell systems, GenSure fuel cell systems, GenFuel hydrogen storage and dispensing products and\nProGen fuel cell engines.\nGenKey: GenKey is our vertically integrated “turn-key” solution combining either GenDrive or GenSure fuel cell\npower with GenFuel fuel and GenCare aftermarket service, offering complete simplicity to customers transitioning to\nfuel cell power.\nElectrolyzers: The design and implementation of 5MW and 10MW electrolyzer systems that are modular, scalable\nhydrogen generators optimized for clean hydrogen production. Electrolyzers generate hydrogen from water using\nelectricity and a special membrane and “green” hydrogen is generated by using renewable energy inputs, such as\nsolar or wind power.\nLiquefaction Systems: Plug’s 15 ton-per-day and 30 ton-per-day liquefiers are engineered for high efficiency,\nreliability, and operational flexibility — providing consistent liquid hydrogen to customers. This design increases\nplant reliability and availability while minimizing parasitic losses like heat leak and seal gas losses.\n39\nTable of Contents\nCryogenic Equipment: Engineered equipment including trailers and mobile storage equipment for the distribution\nof liquified hydrogen, oxygen, argon, nitrogen and other cryogenic gases.\nLiquid Hydrogen: Liquid hydrogen provides an efficient fuel alternative to fossil-based energy. We produce liquid\nhydrogen through our electrolyzer systems and liquefaction systems. Liquid hydrogen supply will be used by\ncustomers in material handling operations, fuel cell electric vehicle fleets, and stationary power applications.\nWe provide our products and solutions worldwide through our direct sales force, and by leveraging relationships with\noriginal equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) and their dealer networks. Plug is currently targeting Asia, Australia, Europe,\nMiddle East and North America for expansion in adoption. The European Union has rolled out ambitious targets for the\nhydrogen economy, with the United Kingdom also taking steps in this direction, and Plug is seeking to execute on our strategy\nto become one of the European leaders in the hydrogen economy. This includes a targeted account strategy for material\nhandling, securing strategic partnerships with European OEMs, energy companies, utility leaders and accelerating our\nelectrolyzer business.\nWe manufacture our commercially viable products in Latham, New York; Rochester, New York; Slingerlands, New\nYork; Houston, Texas; Lafayette, Indiana; and Spokane, Washington, and support liquid hydrogen production and logistics in\nCharleston, Tennessee and Kingsland, Georgia.\nResults of Operations\nOur primary sources of revenue are from sales of equipment, related infrastructure and other, services performed on\nfuel cell systems and related infrastructure, power purchase agreements, and fuel delivered to customers and related\nequipment. A certain portion of our sales result from acquisitions in legacy markets, which we are working to transition to\nrenewable solutions. Revenue from sales of equipment, related infrastructure and other represents sales of our GenDrive units,\nGenSure stationary backup power units, cryogenic stationary and on road storage, hydrogen liquefaction systems,\nelectrolyzers and hydrogen fueling infrastructure. Revenue from services performed on fuel cell systems and related\ninfrastructure represents revenue earned on our service and maintenance contracts and sales of spare parts. Revenue from\npower purchase agreements primarily represent payments received from customers who make monthly payments to access the\nCompany’s GenKey solution. Revenue associated with fuel delivered to customers and related equipment represents the sale\nof hydrogen to customers that has been purchased by the Company from a third party or generated at our hydrogen production\nplant.\nProvision for Common Stock Warrants\nOn August 24, 2022, the Company issued to Amazon.com NV Investment Holdings LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary\nof Amazon, a warrant (the “2022 Amazon Warrant”) to acquire up to 16,000,000 shares of the Company’s common stock (the\n“2022 Amazon Warrant Shares”), subject to certain vesting events described below under “Common Stock Transactions –\nAmazon Transaction Agreement in 2022”.\nIn 2017, the Company issued a warrant to Walmart (the “Walmart Warrant”) to purchase up to 55,286,696 shares of\nthe Company’s common stock (the “Walmart Shares”), subject to certain vesting events described below under “Common\nStock Transactions – Walmart Transaction Agreement”.

Revenue from sales of equipment, related\ninfrastructure and other represents sales of our GenDrive units, GenSure stationary backup power units, cryogenic stationary\nand on road storage, hydrogen liquefaction systems, electrolyzers and hydrogen fueling infrastructure referred to at the site\nlevel as hydrogen installations. Revenue from sales of equipment, related infrastructure and other for the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 decreased $38.0 million, or 26.2%, to $107.1 million from $145.1 million for the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023. Primarily contributing to the decrease in revenue was a decrease in sales of hydrogen infrastructure, sales\nof cryogenic equipment and liquefiers and sales of fuel cell systems, partially offset by an increase in sales of electrolyzers.\nThe decrease in revenue from sales of hydrogen infrastructure of $26.4 million was due to three hydrogen site installations for\nthe three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to ten for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Additionally,\nrevenue from sales of cryogenic equipment and liquefiers decreased $13.4 million for the three months ended September 30,\n2024 primarily due to product mix with respect to cryogenic equipment and fewer projects and a slower rate of progress on\nexisting liquefier projects as they near completion compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in\nrevenue related to sales of fuel cell systems of $29.5 million was due primarily to a decrease in volume of GenDrive units\nsold, with 522 units sold for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 1,452 units sold for the three months\nended September 30, 2023. Also, the pace of development of the\n41\nTable of Contents\nhydrogen economy has been slower than anticipated and has impacted hydrogen equipment deployments. Partially offsetting\nthese decreases, revenue from sales of electrolyzers increased $31.2 million, primarily due to an increase in electrolyzer\nsystems for which revenue was recognized, with 16 systems sold for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to\none system sold for the three months ended September 30, 2023.\nRevenue from sales of equipment, related infrastructure and other for the nine months ended September 30, 2024\ndecreased $291.3 million, or 53.6%, to $252.2 million from $543.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\nPrimarily contributing to the decrease in revenue was a decrease in sales of hydrogen infrastructure, sales of cryogenic\nequipment and liquefiers and sales of fuel cell systems, partially offset by an increase in sales of electrolyzers. The decrease in\nsales of hydrogen infrastructure revenue of $108.3 million was due to a decrease in volume with 11 hydrogen site installations\nfor the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 41 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Additionally,\nrevenue from sales of cryogenic equipment and liquefiers decreased $77.2 million for the nine months ended September 30,\n2024 primarily due to product mix with respect to cryogenic equipment, fewer projects and a slower rate of progress on\nexisting liquefier projects as they near completion compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in\nrevenue related to sales of fuel cell systems of $98.4 million was primarily due to a decrease in volume of GenDrive units\nsold, with 2,545 units sold for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 5,167 units sold for the nine months\nended September 30, 2023. Additionally, there was a decrease in revenue of $7.9 million related to decreased sales of\nengineered equipment from the Frames acquisition, for which sales are not expected to continue beyond current commitments.\nFurthermore, there was an increase in the provision for common stock warrants recorded as a reduction of revenue to $3.4\nmillion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to a provision of $1.9 million for the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023. Also, the pace of development of the hydrogen economy has been slower than anticipated and has\nimpacted hydrogen equipment deployments. Partially offsetting the decrease in revenue was an increase in revenue from sales\nof electrolyzers of $0.3 million primarily due to an increase in electrolyzer systems for which revenue was recognized\ndiscussed above offset by a decrease in electrolyzer stack sales during the first half of 2024.\nRevenue – services performed on fuel cell systems and related infrastructure. Revenue from services performed on\nfuel cell systems and related infrastructure represents revenue earned on our service and maintenance contracts and sales of\nspare parts. Revenue from services performed on fuel cell systems and related infrastructure for the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 increased $4.8 million, or 51.6%, to $14.1 million from $9.3 million for the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023. The increase in revenue from services performed on fuel cell systems and related infrastructure was\nprimarily related to the increase in number of units in service, with the number of GenDrive units under maintenance contracts\nduring the three months ended September 30, 2024 of 22,235 compared to 20,417 for the three months ended September 30,\n2023, coupled with an increase in contract rates negotiated with certain customers.\nRevenue from services performed on fuel cell systems and related infrastructure for the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 increased $13.1 million, or 48.3%, to $40.2 million from $27.1 million for the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023. The increase in revenue from services performed on fuel cell systems and related infrastructure was\nprimarily related to the increase in number of units in service during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to\nthe nine months ended September 30, 2023, as discussed above, coupled with an increase in contract rates negotiated with\ncertain customers.\nRevenue – power purchase agreements. Revenue from Power Purchase Agreements (“PPAs”) represents payments\nreceived from customers for power generated through the provision of equipment and service. Revenue from PPAs for the\nthree months ended September 30, 2024 increased $0.4 million, or 2.0%, to $20.5 million from $20.1 million for the three\nmonths ended September 30, 2023. The increase in revenue was a result of an increase in the number of units and customer\nsites party to these agreements as well as an increase in pricing rates, partially offset by an increase in the provision for\ncommon stock warrants. There were 31,715 GenDrive units under PPA arrangements as of September 30, 2024 compared to\n31,484 as of September 30, 2023. In addition, there were 154 hydrogen sites under PPA arrangements as of September 30,\n2024 compared to 138 as of September 30, 2023. Furthermore, pricing rates were favorable in the third quarter of 2024\ncompared to the third quarter of 2023. Offsetting the increase in revenue was an increase in the provision for common stock\nwarrants recorded as a reduction of revenue, which increased to $1.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024\ncompared to a negative provision of $1.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023.\n42\nTable of Contents\nRevenue from PPAs for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased $14.3 million, or 32.4%, to $58.4\nmillion from $44.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in revenue was a result of an increase\nin the number of units and customer sites party to these agreements, as discussed above, as well as more favorable pricing\nrates during the first three quarters of 2024 compared to the first three quarters of 2023. Finally, the provision for common\nstock warrants recorded as a reduction of revenue was relatively flat, decreasing to $4.4 million for the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 compared to $4.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\nRevenue – fuel delivered to customers and related equipment. Revenue associated with fuel and related equipment\ndelivered to customers represents the sale of hydrogen that has been purchased by the Company from a third party or\ngenerated at our hydrogen production plant. Revenue associated with fuel delivered to customers for the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 increased $10.4 million, or 53.6%, to $29.8 million from $19.4 million for the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023. The increase in revenue was primarily due to an increase in the number of sites with fuel contracts, with\n260 sites receiving fuel delivery as of September 30, 2024 compared to 237 sites as of September 30, 2023. Furthermore,\nincreased fuel prices were negotiated with certain customers during the second quarter of 2024. Partially offsetting the\nincrease in revenue was an increase in the provision for common stock warrants recorded as a reduction of revenue, which\nincreased to $3.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to a negative provision of $0.8 million for\nthe three months ended September 30, 2023.\nRevenue associated with fuel delivered to customers for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased $30.6\nmillion, or 64.6%, to $78.0 million from $47.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in\nrevenue was primarily due to an increase in the number of sites with fuel contracts. Furthermore, increased fuel prices were\nnegotiated with certain customers in the second quarter of 2024. Partially offsetting the decrease, there was an increase in the\nprovision for common stock warrants recorded as a reduction of revenue to $6.9 million for the nine months ended September\n30, 2024 compared to $5.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\nCost of Revenue\nCost of revenue – sales of equipment, related infrastructure and other.

As a result, the Company recorded a loss on\nextinguishment of debt of $14.0 million in the unaudited interim condensed consolidated statement of operations during the\nfirst quarter of 2024. Loss on extinguishment of debt arises from the difference between the net carrying amount of the\nCompany’s debt and the fair value of the assets transferred to extinguish the debt.\nThe 7.00% Convertible Senior Notes are the Company’s senior, unsecured obligations and are governed by the terms\nof an Indenture (the “Indenture”), dated as of March 20, 2024, entered into between the Company and Wilmington Trust,\nNational Association, as trustee.

The conversion rate and conversion\nprice are subject to customary adjustments upon the occurrence of certain events. Prior to the close of business on the business\nday immediately preceding December 1, 2025, the 7.00% Convertible Senior Notes will be convertible at the option of the\nholders of the 7.00% Convertible Senior Notes only upon the satisfaction of specified conditions and during certain periods.\nOn or after December 1, 2025 until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the\nmaturity date, the 7.00% Convertible Senior Notes will be convertible at the option of the\n52\nTable of Contents\nholders of the 7.00% Convertible Senior Notes at any time regardless of these conditions.

These leases expire over the next one to seven years. Minimum rent payments under\noperating leases are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.\nLeases contain termination clauses with associated penalties, the amount of which cause the likelihood of\ncancellation to be remote. At the end of the lease term, the leased assets may be returned to the lessor by the Company, the\nCompany may negotiate with the lessor to purchase the assets at fair market value, or the Company may negotiate with the\nlessor to renew the lease at market rental rates.

The Company’s unconditional purchase obligations primarily consist of\nsupplier arrangements, take or pay contracts and service agreements. For certain vendors, the Company’s unconditional\nobligation to purchase a minimum quantity of raw materials at an agreed upon price is fixed and determinable; while certain\nother raw material costs will vary due to product forecasting and future economic conditions.\nFuture payments under non-cancelable unconditional purchase obligations with a remaining term in excess of one\nyear as of September 30, 2024, were as follows (in thousands):\nRemainder of 2024 $ 25,989\n2025 8,023\n2026 8,023\n2027 2,638\n2028 —\n2029 and thereafter —\nTotal 44,673\n58\nTable of Contents\nRestructuring\nIn February 2024, in a strategic move to enhance our financial performance and ensure long-term value creation in a\ncompetitive market, we approved a comprehensive initiative that encompasses a broad range of measures, including\noperational consolidation, strategic workforce adjustments, and various other cost-saving actions (the “Restructuring Plan”).\nThese measures are aimed at increasing efficiency, improving scalability, and maintaining our leadership position in the\nrenewable energy industry. We began executing the Restructuring Plan in February 2024 and expect the Restructuring Plan to\nbe completed in the fourth quarter of 2024, subject to local law and consultation requirements.\nThe determination of when we accrue for involuntary termination benefits under restructuring plans depends on\nwhether the termination benefits are provided under an ongoing benefit arrangement or under a one-time benefit arrangement.\nWe account for involuntary termination benefits that are provided pursuant to one-time benefit arrangements in accordance\nwith ASC 420, Exit or Disposal Cost Obligations (“ASC 420”) whereas involuntary termination benefits that are part of an\nongoing written or substantive plan are accounted for in accordance with ASC 712, Nonretirement Postemployment Benefits\n(“ASC 712”). We accrue a liability for termination benefits under ASC 420 in the period in which the plan is communicated to\nthe employees and the plan is not expected to change significantly. For ongoing benefit arrangements, inclusive of statutory\nrequirements, we accrue a liability for termination benefits under ASC 712 when the existing situation or set of circumstances\nindicates that an obligation has been incurred, it is probable the benefits will be paid, and the amount can be reasonably\nestimated. The restructuring charges that have been incurred but not yet paid are recorded in accrued expenses and other\ncurrent liabilities in our unaudited interim condensed consolidated balance sheets, as they are expected to be paid within the\nnext twelve months.\nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2024, we incurred $0.6 million in restructuring costs recorded as\nseverance expenses of $0.1 million and other restructuring costs of $0.5 million in the restructuring financial statement line\nitem in the unaudited interim condensed consolidated statement of operations. During the nine months ended September 30,\n2024, we incurred $8.2 million in restructuring costs recorded as severance expenses of $6.9 million and other restructuring\ncosts of $1.3 million in the restructuring financial statement line item in the unaudited interim condensed consolidated\nstatement of operations. Future restructuring costs are not expected to be material in subsequent quarters. The actual timing\nand amount of costs associated with these restructuring actions may differ from our current expectations and estimates and\nsuch differences may be material.\nSeverance expense recorded during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 in accordance with ASC\n420 was a result of the separation of full-time employees associated with the Restructuring Plan. As of September 30, 2024,\n$0.1 million of accrued severance-related costs were included in accrued expenses in our unaudited interim condensed\nconsolidated balance sheets and are expected to be paid during the fourth quarter of 2024. For the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024, other costs were represented by $0.5 million of other one-time employee termination benefits. For the\nnine months ended September 30, 2024, other costs were represented by (1) $0.2 million of legal and professional services\ncosts, and (2) $1.1 million of other one-time employee termination benefits. As of September 30, 2024, $29 thousand of\naccrued other costs were included in accrued expenses in our unaudited interim condensed consolidated balance sheets and are\nexpected to be paid during the fourth quarter of 2024.\n59\nTable of Contents\nExtended Maintenance Contracts\nOn a quarterly basis, we evaluate any potential losses related to our extended maintenance contracts for sales of\nequipment, related infrastructure and other that have been sold. The following table shows the roll forward of balances in the\naccrual for loss contracts, including changes due to the provision for loss accrual, releases to service cost of sales, increase to\nloss accrual related to customer warrants, and foreign currency translation adjustment (in thousands):\nNine months ended Year ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nBeginning balance $ 137,853 $ 81,066\nProvision for loss accrual 37,997 85,375\nReleases to service cost of sales (38,823) (29,713)\nIncrease to loss accrual related to customer warrants 268 971\nForeign currency translation adjustment 214 154\nEnding balance $ 137,509 $ 137,853\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nThe consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared in conformity with U.S. generally\naccepted accounting principles, which require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported\namounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial\nstatements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an on-going basis, we evaluate\nour estimates and judgments, including but not limited to those related to revenue recognition, valuation of inventories,\nintangible assets, valuation of long-lived assets, accrual for service loss contracts, operating and finance leases, allowance for\ndoubtful accounts receivable, unbilled revenue, common stock warrants, stock-based compensation, income taxes, and\ncontingencies. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors and assumptions\nthat are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about (1)\nthe carrying values of assets and liabilities and (2) the amount of revenue and expenses realized that are not readily apparent\nfrom other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nThere have been no changes in our critical accounting estimates from those reported in our 2023 Form 10-K.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nRecently Adopted Accounting Guidance\nThere have been no significant changes in our reported financial position or results of operations and cash flows\nresulting from the adoption of new accounting pronouncements.\nRecently Issued and Not Yet Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\nOther than the standards mentioned in our 2023 Form 10-K, all issued but not yet effective accounting and reporting\nstandards as of September 30, 2024 are either not applicable to the Company or are not expected to have a material impact on\nthe Company.\nItem 3 — Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\nThere has been no material change from the information provided in the Company’s 2023 Form 10-K under the\nsection titled Item 7A, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk”.\n60\nTable of Contents\nItem 4 — Controls and Procedures\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nWe maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed\nin our reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act, are recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the\ntime periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our\nmanagement, including our Chief Executive Officer (our principal executive officer) and Chief Financial Officer (our\nprincipal financial officer) as appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nOur management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the\neffectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-\n15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of September 30, 2024. Based on such evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief\nFinancial Officer have concluded that such disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere were no changes during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 in our internal control over financial reporting\nthat have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nPart II. OTHER INFORMATION\nItem 1 – Legal Proceedings\nSee Note 19, “Commitments and Contingencies”, within Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for a\ndiscussion regarding material legal proceedings.\nExcept as otherwise noted, there have been no material developments in legal proceedings. For previously reported\ninformation about legal proceedings, refer to Part I, Item 3, “Legal Proceedings”, of the Company’s 2023 Form 10-K.\nItem 1A – Risk Factors\nIn addition to the other information set forth in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, you should carefully consider\nthe risk factors that could materially affect the Company’s business, financial condition or future results discussed in the\nCompany’s 2023 Form 10-K in Part I, Item 1A “Risk Factors” and the Company’s Form 10-Q for the quarters ended March\n31, 2024 and June 30, 2024 in Part II, Item 1A “Risk Factors”. The risks described in the 2023 Form 10-K and the Form 10-Q\nfor the quarters ended March 31, 2024 and June 30, 2024 are not the only risks that could affect the Company. Additional risks\nand uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also materially adversely affect\nour business, financial condition and/or operating results in the future. As a supplement to the risk factors identified in the\n2023 Form 10-K and the Form 10-Q for the quarters ended March 31, 2024 and June 30, 2024, below we have set forth\nupdated risk factors. Other than as provided below, there have been no material changes to the risk factors identified in the\n2023 Form 10-K and the Form 10-Q for the quarters ended March 31, 2024 and June 30, 2024.\nThe funding of the loan guarantee from the Department of Energy may be delayed, and we may not be able to satisfy all of\nthe technical, legal, environmental or financial conditions acceptable to the Department of Energy to receive the loan\nguarantee.\nAs previously announced, the Company received a conditional commitment for an up to $1.66 billion loan guarantee\nfrom the Department of Energy’s (“DOE”) Loan Programs Office to finance the development, construction, and ownership of\nup to six green hydrogen production facilities. Our ability to benefit from this loan guarantee is subject to\n61\nTable of Contents\ncertain technical, legal, environmental and financial conditions, including negotiation of definitive financing documents, to be\nsatisfied before funding of the loan guarantee. Whether and when our DOE loan guarantee will be funded is subject to a\nnumber of factors outside of our control, including political administration changes, legislative enactments, administrative\nactions. The funding of such loan guarantee may take longer than we expect, and if we are not able to satisfy all of the\ntechnical, legal, environmental or financial conditions acceptable to the DOE to receive the loan guarantee, our business may\nbe adversely affected.\nWe are subject to legal proceedings and legal compliance risks that could harm our business.\nWe are currently, and in the future may continue to be, subject to legal proceedings and similar disputes. In\nconnection with any disputes or litigation in which we are involved, we may incur costs and expenses in connection with\ndefending ourselves or in connection with the payment of any settlement or judgment or compliance with any ruling in\nconnection therewith. It is often challenging to predict the outcome of legal proceedings and similar disputes with certainty.\nDetermining reserves for any litigation is a complex and fact-intensive process that requires significant judgment calls. There\ncan be no assurance that our expectations will prove correct, and even if these matters are resolved in our favor or without\nsignificant cash settlements, these matters, and the time and resources necessary to litigate or resolve them, including\ndiversion of management resources, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial\ncondition and cash flows.\nItem 2 - Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds\n(a) Not applicable.\n(b) Not applicable.\n(c) None.\nItem 3 — Defaults Upon Senior Securities\nNone.\nItem 4 — Mine Safety Disclosures\nNone.\nItem 5 — Other Information\n(c) Director and Officer Trading Arrangements\nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2024, none of the Company’s directors or officers (as defined in Rule\n16a-1(f) of the Securities Exchange Act) adopted, terminated or modified a Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement or non-Rule\n10b5-1 trading arrangement (as such terms are defined in Item 408 of Regulation S-K).\n62\nTable of Contents\nItem 6 — Exhibits\n3.1 Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of Plug Power Inc.

The Buyer does not presently have any agreement or understanding, directly or indirectly, with any\nPerson (as defined below) to distribute any of the Securities in violation of applicable securities laws (this\nrepresentation and warranty not limiting the Buyer’s right to sell the Securities in compliance with applicable\nsecurities laws). As used herein, “Person” means a corporation, a limited liability company, an association, a\npartnership, an organization, a business, an individual, a governmental or political subdivision thereof or a\ngovernmental\n2\nagency.\n(b) Accredited Investor Status.

The Buyer understands that the Securities are being offered and sold to it in\nreliance on specific exemptions from the registration requirements of U.S. federal and state securities laws and that\nthe Company is relying in part upon the truth and accuracy of, and the Buyer’s compliance with, the representations,\nwarranties, agreements, acknowledgments and understandings of the Buyer set forth herein in order to determine the\navailability of such exemptions and the eligibility of the Buyer to acquire the Securities.\n(d) Access to Information.

The\nBuyer understands that nothing in this Agreement or any other materials presented by or on behalf of the Company to\nthe Buyer in connection with the purchase of the Securities constitutes legal, tax or investment advice. The Buyer\nhas sought such accounting, legal and tax advice as it has considered necessary to make an informed investment\ndecision with respect to its acquisition of the Securities.\n(e) Transfer or Resale. The Buyer understands that: (i) the Securities have not been registered under the\nSecurities Act or qualified under any state securities laws, and may not be offered for sale, sold, pledged, assigned or\ntransferred unless (A) subsequently registered thereunder, (B) such Buyer shall have delivered to the Company an\nopinion of counsel, in form reasonably acceptable to the Company, to the effect that such Securities to be sold,\nassigned or transferred may be sold, assigned or transferred pursuant to an exemption from such registration\nrequirements, or (C) such Buyer provides the Company with reasonable assurances (in the form of seller and broker\nrepresentation letters) that such Securities can be sold, assigned or transferred pursuant to Rule 144 promulgated\nunder the Securities Act, as amended (or a successor rule thereto) (collectively, “Rule 144”), in each case following\nthe applicable holding period set forth therein; and (ii) any sale of the Securities made in reliance on Rule 144 may\nbe made only in accordance with the terms of Rule 144 and further, if Rule 144 is not applicable, any resale of the\nSecurities under circumstances in which the seller (or the Person through whom the sale is made) may be deemed to\nbe an underwriter (as that term is defined in the Securities\n3\nAct) may require compliance with some other exemption under the Securities Act or the rules and regulations of the\nSEC thereunder.\n(f) Legends.

THE SECURITIES [AND\nTHOSE SECURITIES INTO WHICH THEY ARE CONVERTIBLE] HAVE BEEN ACQUIRED SOLELY FOR\nINVESTMENT PURPOSES AND NOT WITH A VIEW TOWARD RESALE AND MAY NOT BE OFFERED FOR\nSALE, SOLD, PLEDGED, TRANSFERRED OR ASSIGNED IN THE ABSENCE OF AN EFFECTIVE\nREGISTRATION STATEMENT FOR THE SECURITIES UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS\nAMENDED, OR APPLICABLE STATE SECURITIES LAWS, OR AN OPINION OF COUNSEL, IN A\nGENERALLY ACCEPTABLE FORM, THAT REGISTRATION IS NOT REQUIRED UNDER SAID ACT OR\nAPPLICABLE STATE SECURITIES LAWS.\nCertificates evidencing the Conversion Shares shall not be required to contain any legend (including the legend set\nforth above), (i) while the Conversion Shares are sold or transferred pursuant to an effective registration statement,\n(ii) following any sale of such Conversion Shares pursuant to Rule 144 (assuming the transferor is not an affiliate of\nthe Company), (iii) if such Conversion Shares are eligible to be sold under Rule 144 (provided that the Buyer\nprovides the Company with reasonable assurances that such securities are eligible for sale under Rule 144), or (iv) if\nsuch legend is not required under applicable requirements of the Securities Act (including judicial interpretations and\npronouncements issued by the staff of the SEC).

No\nsuch rescission or annulment shall affect any subsequent Event of Default or impair any right consequent thereon.\nCONVERSION OF DEBENTURE. This Debenture shall be convertible into Common Shares, on the terms\nand conditions set forth in this Section (4).\nK. Conversion Right. Subject to the limitations of Section (4)(c), at any time or times on\nor after the Issuance Date, the Holder shall be entitled to convert any portion of the outstanding and unpaid\nConversion Amount (as defined below) into fully paid and nonassessable Common Shares in accordance with\nSection (4)(b), at the Conversion Price (as defined below). The number of Common Shares issuable upon conversion\nof any Conversion Amount pursuant to this Section (4)(a) shall be determined by dividing (x) such Conversion\nAmount by (y) the Conversion Price. The Company shall not issue any fraction of a Common Shares upon any\nconversion. All calculations under this Section (4) shall be rounded to the nearest $0.0001. If the issuance would\nresult in the issuance of a fraction of a Common Shares, the Company shall round such fraction of a Common Shares\nup to the nearest whole share. The Company shall pay any and all transfer, stamp and similar taxes that may be\npayable with respect to the issuance and delivery of Common Shares upon conversion of any Conversion Amount.\n1. \"Conversion Amount\" means the portion of the Principal and accrued Interest\nto be converted with respect to which this determination is being made.\n42\n2. \"Conversion Price\" means, as of any Conversion Date (as defined below) or\nother date of determination, $2.90 per Common Share (the “Fixed Price”); provided that for purposes of the second\nsentence of Section (3)(b), Section (4)(b)(i)(2), Section (4)(c)(iii)(1), Section (4)(c)(iii)(2)(ii) (and for purposes of\nSection (4)(a) to the extent a conversion is pursuant to the second sentence of Section (3)(b), Section (4)(b)(i)(2),\nSection (4)(c)(iii)(1) or Section (4)(c)(iii)(2)(ii)) and Section (5)(d) “Conversion Price” means, as of any Conversion\nDate or other date of determination, the lower of (i) the Fixed Price and (ii) 97.25% of the lowest daily VWAP for the\nCommon Shares during the three (3) Trading Days immediately preceding the applicable Conversion Date or other\ndate of determination (the “Market Price”), but which Market Price shall not be lower than the Floor Price then in\neffect. The Fixed Price shall be adjusted from time to time pursuant to the other terms and conditions of this\nDebenture.\nL. Mechanics of Conversion.\n1. Optional Conversion.\n(a) To convert any Conversion Amount into Common Shares on any date (a\n\"Conversion Date\"), the Holder shall (A) transmit by email (or otherwise deliver), for receipt on or prior to 11:59\np.m., New York time, on such date, a copy of an executed notice of conversion in the form attached hereto as Exhibit\nI (the \"Conversion Notice\") to the Company and (B) if required by Section (4)(b)(iii), surrender this Debenture to a\nnationally recognized overnight delivery service for delivery to the Company (or an indemnification undertaking\nreasonably satisfactory to the Company with respect to this Debenture in the case of its loss, theft or destruction). On\nor before the second (2nd) Trading Day following the date of receipt of a Conversion Notice (the \"Share Delivery\nDate\"), the Company shall (X) if legends are not required by applicable law as reasonably determined by the\nCompany to be placed on certificates or the book-entry position of the Common Shares and provided that the\nCompany’s transfer agent is participating in the Depository Trust Company's (\"DTC\") Fast Automated Securities\nTransfer Program, instruct such transfer agent to credit such aggregate number of Common Shares to which the\nHolder shall be entitled to the Holder's or its designee's balance account with DTC through its Deposit Withdrawal\nAgent Commission system or (Y) if the Company’s transfer agent is not participating in the DTC Fast Automated\nSecurities Transfer Program, or if restrictive legends are required by applicable law as reasonably determined by the\nCompany to be placed on certificates or book-entry positions of the Common Shares, issue and deliver to the address\nas specified in the Conversion Notice, a certificate or book-entry position, registered in the name of the Holder or its\ndesignee, for the number of Common Shares to which the Holder shall be entitled. If this Debenture is physically\nsurrendered for conversion and the outstanding Principal of this Debenture is greater than the Principal portion of the\nConversion Amount being converted, then the Company shall as soon as practicable and in no event later than five\n(5) Business Days after receipt of this Debenture and at its own expense, issue and deliver to the Holder a new\nDebenture representing the outstanding Principal not converted. The Person or Persons entitled to receive the\nCommon Shares issuable upon a conversion of this Debenture shall be treated for all purposes as the record holder or\nholders of such Common Shares upon the transmission of a Conversion Notice.\n(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing Section (4)(b)(i)(1), but subject to\nSection (4)(c)(iii)(2), prior to the Holder submitting any Conversion Notice at a\n43\nConversion Price equal to the Market Price (each such conversion, a “Market Price Conversion”), the Holder shall\nsubmit a notice in the form attached hereto as Exhibit II to the Company (a “Market Price Conversion Notice”) no\nearlier than twenty (20) Business Days and no less than five (5) Business Days prior to the first calendar day of any\nCalendar Month during which the Holder intends to submit Market Price Conversions. Upon receipt of a Market\nPrice Conversion Notice, the Company may elect to either (i) permit the Holder to submit Market Price Conversions\nduring such Calendar Month in accordance with the maximum aggregate amount of such Market Price Conversions\nset forth therein and in accordance with Section (4)(c)(iii)(1) or (ii) prohibit Market Price Conversions during such\nCalendar Month; provided, that the Company may only prohibit Market Price Conversions during such Calendar\nMonth if (x) the Company delivers notice to the Holder of its election to do so prior to the first calendar day of such\nCalendar Month (a “Market Price Conversion Payment Notice”) and (y) the Company makes a cash payment to the\nHolder by wire transfer of immediately available funds on or before the last Trading Day of such Calendar Month in\nan amount equal to (A) $22,500,000 of Principal plus (B) the Payment Premium on such Principal amount plus (C)\nall accrued and outstanding Interest on such Principal as of the first calendar day of such Calendar Month (such cash\npayment, a “Market Price Conversion Payment“). If the Holder does not receive a Market Price Conversion Payment\nNotice prior to the first calendar day of such Calendar Month, the Company shall be deemed to have elected to\npermit the Holder to submit Market Price Conversions during the applicable Calendar Month beginning on the first\ncalendar day of such Calendar Month. For the avoidance of doubt and without implication that the opposite would\notherwise be true, the Holder shall not be required to convert any portion of this Debenture at any time, including,\nbut not limited to, following its submission of a Market Price Conversion Notice. Any and all conversions of this\nDebenture shall be at the sole discretion of the Holder. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the foregoing, (x)\na Market Price Conversion Notice may not be submitted (and will be void if submitted) during the period beginning\non the date an Amortization Event occurs and ending on the date the obligation of the Company to make monthly\nAmortization Payments related to such Amortization Event ceases (any such period, the “Amortization Period”) and\n(y) if an Amortization Period begins after the submission of a Market Price Conversion Notice, no further\nconversions of the Debenture will be permitted pursuant to this Section 4(b)(i)(2) and no Market Price Conversion\nPayment will be owed in relation to such Market Price Conversion Notice; provided, any Market Price Conversions\nundertaken prior to such Amortization Period beginning will be honored and if the Company elected to allow Market\nPrice Conversions with respect to such Market Price Conversion Notice pursuant to clause (i) of this Section (4)(b)(i)\n(2) above, the Holder may continue to make Market Price Conversions pursuant to such Market Price Conversion\nNotice under which no Market Price Conversion Payment was contemplated.\n2. Company's Failure to Timely Convert. If the Company shall fail, for any\nreason or for no reason, on or prior to an applicable Share Delivery Date to comply with its obligations to issue and\ndeliver Common Shares to the Holder pursuant to Section (4)(b)(i)(1) to which the Holder is entitled upon such\nHolder's conversion of any Conversion Amount in respect of such Share Delivery Date (a \"Conversion Failure\"), and\nif on or after such Trading Day the Holder purchases (in an open market transaction or otherwise) Common Shares to\ndeliver in satisfaction of a sale by the Holder of Common Shares issuable upon such conversion that the Holder\nanticipated receiving from the Company (a \"Buy-In\"), then the Company shall, within three (3) Business Days after\nthe Holder's request and in the Holder's discretion, either (i)\n44\npay cash to the Holder in an amount equal to the Holder's total purchase price (including reasonable and documented\nbrokerage commissions and other reasonable and documented out of pocket expenses, if any) for the Common\nShares so purchased (the “Buy-In Price”), at which point the Company's obligation to deliver such certificate (and to\nissue such Common Shares) shall terminate, or (ii) promptly honor its obligation to deliver such Common Shares in\naccordance with Section (4)(b)(i)(1) and pay cash to the Holder in an amount equal to the excess (if any) of the Buy-\nIn Price over the product of (A) such number of Common Shares multiplied by (B) the Closing Price on the\nConversion Date, and compliance by the Company with the foregoing will constitute a cure of any default or Event\nof Default for failing to so comply with its obligations to issue and deliver Common Shares to the Holder pursuant to\nSection (4)(b)(i)(1) to which the Holder is entitled upon such Holder's conversion of any Conversion Amount;\nprovided, the Company shall only be permitted to cure such an Event of Default for failing to comply with its\nobligations to issue and deliver Common Shares to the Holder by timely satisfying its obligations under this Section\n(4)(b)(ii) and for which the Holder exercised its Buy-in right on two (2) occasions during the term of this Debenture,\nand any subsequent Event of Default for failing to comply with its obligations to issue and deliver Common Shares\nto the Holder and for which the Holder exercised its Buy-in right shall not be curable by timely satisfying its\nobligations under this Section (4)(b)(ii).\n3. Registration; Book-Entry. The Company shall maintain a register (the\n“Register”) for the recordation of the name and address of the Holder of this Debenture (and the name and address of\nany Person who is transferred all or any portion of this Debenture to the extent permitted by the terms hereof or the\nPurchase Agreement) and the Principal amount (and stated Interest with respect thereto) held by the Holder (and any\nPerson who is transferred all or any portion of this Debenture to the extent permitted by the terms hereof or the\nPurchase Agreement) (the “Registered Debenture”). The entries in the Register shall be conclusive and binding for\nall purposes absent manifest error. The Company and the holders of this Debenture shall treat each Person whose\nname is recorded in the Register as the owner of this Debenture for all purposes, including, without limitation, the\nright to receive payments of Principal and Interest hereunder, notwithstanding notice to the contrary. A Registered\nDebenture may be assigned, transferred or sold in whole or in part as permitted by the terms hereof or the Purchase\nAgreement, and any such permitted assignment, transfer or sale shall be reflected on the Register by the Company.\nNotwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, upon conversion of any portion of this Debenture in\naccordance with the terms hereof, the Holder shall not be required to physically surrender this Debenture to the\nCompany unless (A) the full Conversion Amount represented by this Debenture is being converted or (B) the Holder\nhas provided the Company with prior written notice (which notice may be included in a Conversion Notice)\nrequesting reissuance of this Debenture upon physical surrender of this Debenture. The Holder and the Company\nshall maintain records showing the Principal and Interest converted and the dates of such conversions or shall use\nsuch other method, reasonably satisfactory to the Holder and the Company, so as not to require physical surrender of\nthis Debenture upon any partial conversion.\nM. Limitations on Conversions.\n1. Beneficial Ownership. The Holder shall not have the right to convert any\nportion of this Debenture to the extent that after giving effect to such conversion, the Holder, together with any\naffiliate thereof, would beneficially own (as determined in accordance with Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act and\nthe rules promulgated thereunder) in\n45\nexcess of 4.99% of the number of Common Shares outstanding immediately after giving effect to such conversion.\nThe Holder shall have the authority and obligation to determine whether the restriction contained in this Section (4)\n(c)(i) will limit any particular conversion hereunder and to the extent that the Holder determines that the limitation\ncontained in this Section (4)(c)(i) applies, the determination of which portion of the Principal amount of this\nDebenture is convertible shall be the responsibility and obligation of the Holder. The provisions of this Section (4)(c)\n(i) may be waived by a holder (but only as to itself and not to any other holder) upon not less than 65 days prior\nnotice to the Company. Other holders shall be unaffected by any such waiver.\n2. Principal Market Limitation. Notwithstanding anything in this Debenture to the\ncontrary, the Company shall not issue any Common Shares pursuant to the terms of this Debenture if the issuance of\nsuch Common Shares would exceed the aggregate number of Common Shares that the Company may issue upon\nconversion of this Debenture and under the other Transaction Documents in compliance with the Company’s\nobligations under the rules or regulations of the Principal Market (the number of shares which may be issued without\nviolating such rules and regulations is 182,148,267 and shall be referred to as the “Exchange Cap”), except that such\nlimitation shall not apply in the event that the Company (A) obtains the approval of its stockholders as required by\nthe applicable rules of the Principal Market for issuances of Common Shares in excess of such amount or (B) as\nadvised by outside counsel to the Company that such approval is not required.\n3. Other Conversion Limitations.\n(a) Subject to Sections (3)(b), (4)(c)(i), (4)(c)(ii) and (4)(c)(iii)(2), Market\nPrice Conversions may be made during any Calendar Month but only to the extent permitted under Section (4)(b)(i)\n(2); provided that Market Price Conversions made during any Calendar Month shall not be in respect of more than\n$22,500,000 of Principal plus (y) all accrued and unpaid Interest on such Principal so converted at the Market Price.\n(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Debenture or\nin any other Transaction Document, there shall be no limitations, including, but not limited to, with respect to timing\nor amount, on conversions of this Debenture (i) at the Fixed Price at any time and (ii) at the Market Price following a\nSpecified Event of Default for so long as such Specified Event of Default is continuing, other than, in either case of\nthe foregoing clauses (i) and (ii) of this sentence, those limitations set forth in Sections (4)(c)(i) and (4)(c)(ii) of this\nDebenture in accordance with their respective terms.\nN. Other Provisions.\n1. All calculations under this Section (4) shall be rounded to the nearest $0.0001\nor whole share.\n2. The Company covenants that it will at all times reserve and keep available out\nof its authorized and unissued Common Shares at least 125,000,000 Common Shares for issuance upon conversion\nof this Debenture (the “Required Reserve Amount”), provided that such Required Reserve Amount may be reduced\n(i) to zero in connection with the cancellation of this Debenture, (ii) proportionately in connection with a reverse\nstock split\n46\nundertaken by the Company and (iii) to the maximum number of Common Shares issuable upon conversion of this\nDebenture (assuming for purposes of this clause (iii) that (x) this Debenture is convertible at the Floor Price as of the\ndate of determination and (y) any such conversion shall not take into account any limitations on the conversion of the\nDebenture set forth herein) if such maximum number of Common Shares is less than the Required Reserve Amount\nthen in effect. The Required Reserve Amount shall be proportionately adjusted upward in connection with any stock\nsplit, stock dividend or other similar corporate action that results in an increase in the number of Common Shares\noutstanding (other than, for the avoidance of doubt, issuances of Common Shares not in connection with any stock\nsplit or stock dividend or other similar corporate action). The Company covenants that, upon issuance in accordance\nwith conversion of this Debenture in accordance with its terms, the Common Shares, when issued, will be validly\nissued, fully paid and nonassessable.\n3. Nothing herein shall limit a Holder's right to pursue actual damages or declare\nan Event of Default pursuant to Section (3) herein for the Company’s failure to deliver Common Shares upon\nconversion in the manner and within the time period specified herein and such Holder shall have the right to pursue\nall remedies available to it at law or in equity including, without limitation, a decree of specific performance and/or\ninjunctive relief, in each case without the need to post a bond or provide other security. The exercise of any such\nrights shall not prohibit the Holder from seeking to enforce damages pursuant to any other Section hereof or under\napplicable law.\n4. Legal Opinions. The Company is obligated, upon reasonable notice, to use its\ncommercially reasonable efforts to cause its legal counsel to promptly deliver legal opinions to the Company’s\ntransfer agent in connection with any restrictive legend removal, if required by such transfer agent, upon (A) the\nresale of the Underlying Securities from time to time pursuant to the Registration Statement (if the Registration\nStatement is available for use in connection with such resale), or (B) the expiration of any holding period or other\nrequirement, as determined by the Company upon advice of legal counsel, for which the Underlying Securities may\nbear legends restricting the transfer thereof. To the extent such opinions are not provided (either promptly or at all),\nthen, other than because of an action or inaction of the Holder including if the Holder has failed to deliver reasonably\nrequested representations to such transfer agent, the Company and the Company’s legal counsel in connection with\nsuch opinion, then, in addition to being a default that may mature into an Event of Default in accordance with\nSection (3)(a)(xi), the Company agrees to reimburse the Holder for all reasonable and documented costs incurred by\nthe Holder in connection with any legal opinions paid for by the Holder in connection with sale or transfer of\nUnderlying Securities. The Holder shall notify the Company of any such costs and expenses it incurs that are referred\nto in this section from time to time and all amounts owed hereunder shall be paid by the Company with reasonable\npromptness.\n5. The Company hereby expressly acknowledges and agrees that (i) the Purchase\nAgreement and all Transaction Documents to which it is a party are ratified and confirmed and shall remain in full\nforce and effect and (ii) it has no set off, counterclaim, defense or other claim or dispute with respect to any\nTransaction Document as of the Issuance Date.\n47\n6. The Company hereby covenants and agrees that, upon the reasonable request of\nthe Holder, the Company shall take all reasonably necessary action, at the Company’s sole expense, to ensure the\ncontinued registration for resale of the Registrable Securities, in accordance with applicable securities laws and\nregulations and subject to the occurrence and duration of any Blackout Period.\nADJUSTMENTS TO CONVERSION PRICE.\nO. Adjustment of Fixed Price and Floor Price in Certain Circumstances. If the Company,\nat any time while this Debenture is outstanding, shall (a) pay a stock dividend or otherwise make a distribution or\ndistributions on its Common Shares in Common Shares, (b) subdivide outstanding Common Shares into a larger\nnumber of shares, (c) combine (including by way of reverse stock split) outstanding Common Shares into a smaller\nnumber of shares, or (d) issue by reclassification of shares of the Common Shares any shares of capital stock of the\nCompany, then each of the Fixed Price and the Floor Price shall be multiplied by a fraction of which the numerator\nshall be the number of Common Shares (excluding treasury shares, if any) outstanding before such event and of\nwhich the denominator shall be the number of Common Shares outstanding after such event. Any adjustment made\npursuant to this Section (5)(a) shall become effective immediately after the record date for the determination of\nstockholders entitled to receive such dividend or distribution and shall become effective immediately after the\neffective date in the case of a subdivision, combination or re-classification.\nP. Adjustment of Fixed Price upon Issuance of Common Shares. If the Company, at any\ntime while this Debenture is outstanding, issues or sells any Common Shares or Convertible Securities (other than\nshares issued or sold by the Company in connection with any Excluded Securities), for a consideration per share\n(plus any related underwriting spread or placement agent fee paid to an underwriter or placement agent in connection\nwith such issuance or sale) (the “New Issuance Price”) less than a price equal to the Fixed Price in effect\nimmediately prior to such issue or sale (such price the \"Applicable Price\") (the foregoing a “Dilutive Issuance”), then\nimmediately after such Dilutive Issuance the Fixed Price then in effect shall be reduced to an amount equal to the\nNew Issuance Price. For the purposes hereof, if the Company in any manner issues or sells any Convertible\nSecurities (other than shares issued or sold by the Company in connection with any Excluded Securities) and the\nlowest price per share for which one Common Share is issuable upon such conversion or exchange or exercise\nthereof is less than the Applicable Price (without giving effect to any “make-whole” shares issuable in connection\nwith a fundamental change, change of control, delisting or liquidation or dissolution or a redemption (in each case,\nhowever so defined)), then such Common Shares shall be deemed to be outstanding and to have been issued and sold\nby the Company at the time of the issuance or sale of such Convertible Securities for such price per share. No further\nadjustment of the Fixed Price shall be made upon the actual issuance of such Common Shares upon conversion or\nexchange or exercise of such Convertible Securities.\nQ. Other Events. If any event occurs of the type contemplated by the provisions of\nSection (5)(a) or (b) but not expressly provided for by such provisions, then the Company's Board of Directors will\nmake an appropriate adjustment in the Fixed Price so as to protect the rights of the Holder under this Debenture;\nprovided that no such adjustment will increase the Fixed Price as otherwise determined pursuant to this Section (5).\nIf the Company issues\n48\nany Convertible Securities with a variable conversion formula that is more favorable than this Debenture, then at the\noption of the Holder, the Market Price formula shall be changed to match that of the new Convertible Securities (it\nbeing understood that a customary “make-whole” provision for conversions in connection with certain change of\ncontrol transactions, delisting events or the approval of a liquidation or dissolution or redemptions does not constitute\na variable conversion formula).\nR. Other Corporate Events. In addition to and not in substitution for any other rights\nhereunder, prior to the consummation of any Fundamental Transaction pursuant to which holders of Common Shares\nare entitled to receive securities or other assets with respect to or in exchange for Common Shares (a \"Corporate\nEvent\"), the Company shall make appropriate provision to ensure that the Holder will thereafter have the right to\nreceive upon a conversion of this Debenture such securities or other assets received by the holders of Common\nShares in connection with the consummation of such Corporate Event in such amounts as the Holder would have\nbeen entitled to receive had this Debenture initially been issued with conversion rights for the form of such\nconsideration (as opposed to Common Shares) at a conversion rate for such consideration commensurate with the\nConversion Price (as of the effective date of the Corporate Event). Provision made pursuant to the preceding\nsentence shall be in a form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Required Holders.
