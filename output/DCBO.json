(NASDAQ: DCBO; TSX: DCBO), a leading provider of learning platforms with a foundation in artificial intelligence (AI) and innovation, has teamed up with Intercap Impact, a division of Intercap Equity Inc. (Intercap), to create OWL (Open World Learning Inc.), a free e-learning platform designed for small Canadian and US charities and nonprofits.\n\nThis partnership will remove the cost barrier associated with e-learning, a challenge many smaller charities and nonprofit organizations face. Using OWL, powered by Docebo, eligible organizations will now be able to build stronger teams and empower staff, volunteers, and board members with essential e-learning in key areas, including HR Compliance, DEI, Mental Health, Board Governance, Leadership, professional development, and more.\n\n“When it comes to online learning, charitable organizations with small budgets have been left behind—until now,” said Randi Myers, Director of Impact at Intercap. “We’re thrilled to be able to offer the award-winning Docebo learning platform to help them build skills and talent, and save time and money.”\n\nDocebo CEO Alessio Artuffo shares, \"With OWL, we are turning our belief in the limitless power of learning into action. This collaboration removes the cost barrier and extends high-quality training to organizations doing critical work on tight budgets.” He adds, “By providing smaller charitable and nonprofit organizations access to e-learning they couldn't otherwise afford, we're unlocking the potential of learning for all.\"\n\nThe new CSR initiative will be formally announced on October 22, 2024 at the 6th annual [Partnership Conference](https://thepartnershipconference.com/) in Toronto, where Intercap Chairman and CEO Jason Chapnik will join Randi Myers in introducing OWL to Canadian corporate and nonprofit professionals.\n\nThe partnership underscores Docebo’s commitment to CSR and to leveraging technology and innovation for social good. By enabling charitable organizations to focus on their missions while strengthening their teams, Docebo and Intercap are bridging the digital gap and making a lasting, positive impact in communities across Canada and the US.\n\n**About OWL** OWL (Open World Learning) offers access to free e-learning powered by Docebo. OWL is designed and funded by Intercap Impact, the CSR branch of Intercap, a merchant bank that invests in technology-focused startups. Charities and nonprofits with less than 300 active users per month can join OWL at [www.owl.inc](http://www.owl.inc) or [www.join.owl.inc](http://www.join.owl.inc) or download the OWL - Open World Learning app on the App Store and Google Play.\n\n**About Docebo** Docebo (NASDAQ:DCBO; TSX:DCBO) is redefining the way enterprises leverage technology to create and manage content, deliver training, and measure the business impact of their learning programs.

(Nasdaq:DCBO; TSX:DCBO) (\"Docebo\" or the \"Company\") , a global leader in [AI-powered learning solutions](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.docebo.com%2Fproducts%2Flearn-lms%2F&esheet=54156155&newsitemid=20241121073158&lan=en-US&anchor=AI-powered+learning+solutions&index=1&md5=833f05f4bc52bba81b54a0d99d00ce81), today announced a strategic alliance with Deloitte to help mid-size and large organizations build robust, growth-focused learning ecosystems. This alliance will guide companies as they evolve from transactional learning systems into agile and indispensable learning organizations, fully integrated with long-term business growth and operating efficiency.\n\nThis alliance combines Docebo's cutting-edge learning technology with Deloitte's consulting and implementation knowledge to deliver scalable, tailored solutions that meet the rapidly changing needs of complex organizations across U.S. commercial and government sectors. By bringing together Deloitte’s experience in corporate transformation and Docebo’s innovative learning platform, the alliance provides a clear pathway for organizations to develop high-impact learning cultures that boost [employee engagement](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.docebo.com%2Flearning-network%2Fblog%2Fincrease-employee-engagement%2F&esheet=54156155&newsitemid=20241121073158&lan=en-US&anchor=employee+engagement&index=2&md5=969b0d85a23a49cac505810dba93a268) and drive measurable business success.\n\nTravis Burke, EVP of Corporate Development & Partnerships at Docebo, commented: “Our alliance with Deloitte is a pivotal step in supporting organizations that want to harness learning as a driver for growth and operating efficiency. By combining our scalable technology with Deloitte's industry experience, we’re creating an ecosystem where learning is more than a simple support function; it becomes a catalyst for strategic transformation across the business.”\n\nFranz Gilbert, Managing Director, Human Capital Ecosystems & Alliances Leader at Deloitte Consulting LLP, shared: \"Delivering engaging learning experiences is not optional anymore; it is a critical necessity for organizations aiming to stay competitive in today’s fast-paced business world. With Docebo’s cutting-edge learning platform and our Workforce Transformation practice capabilities, we can help businesses develop the skills and knowledge they need to thrive amid rapid technological advancements and changes.\"\n\nStuart Rosenberg, Managing Director at Deloitte Consulting LLP, added: \"Our collaboration with Docebo reflects a shared vision of transforming workforce development through immersive learning experiences like [Deloitte Academies](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww2.deloitte.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Fpages%2Fhuman-capital%2Farticles%2Fdeloitte-academies-workforce-training.html&esheet=54156155&newsitemid=20241121073158&lan=en-US&anchor=Deloitte+Academies&index=3&md5=e1e7ca0a31d9fd75967952bb4dee339d).

This alliance allows us to deliver customized learning experiences that not only address current skill gaps but also anticipate future needs, helping our clients build a future-ready workforce capable of driving sustained business success.\"\n\nFrom Transactional to Transformational Learning\n\nAs announced by Deloitte at the 2024 Inspire Dallas conference, the Docebo-Deloitte alliance introduces a structured maturity model, guiding organizations through four distinct stages of development in their learning functions:\n\n  1. Transactional & Essential - Learning is disconnected and reactive, serving as a basic support function.\n  2. Established & Striving - Intentional learning strategies emerge, setting the foundation for leading-edge capabilities.\n  3. Comprehensive & Scaling - Learning becomes scalable, with a strong cultural footprint and L&D operational mastery.\n  4. Agile & Indispensable - A fully integrated learning culture supporting continuous improvement for short and long-term growth.\n\n\n\nCurrently, only [12% of organizations](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Faction.deloitte.com%2Finsight%2F3708%2Flearning-and-the-path-to-maturity&esheet=54156155&newsitemid=20241121073158&lan=en-US&anchor=12%25+of+organizations&index=4&md5=9e4ac57cd7d21cf932fb46fb5644ad48) operate at the “Agile & Indispensable” level, indicating a significant opportunity for transformation.\n\n**About Deloitte**\n\nDeloitte provides industry-leading audit, consulting, tax and advisory services to many of the world’s most admired brands, including nearly 90% of the Fortune 500® and more than 8,500 U.S.-based private companies.

Statements containing forward-looking information are not historical facts but instead represent management’s expectations, estimates and projections regarding future events or circumstances.\n\nThe forward-looking information in this press release includes, but is not limited to, statements regarding the Company’s business; the expected impact of the Docebo-Deloitte alliance on the Company’s business and the organizations such alliance is intended to help; the learning management industry; addressable markets for the Docebo-Deloitte alliance; the achievement of advances in and expansion of the Docebo platform; and the Company’s business plans and strategies. This forward-looking information is based on our opinions, estimates and assumptions in light of our experience and perception of historical trends, current conditions and expected future developments, as well as other factors that we currently believe are appropriate and reasonable in the circumstances. Despite a careful process to prepare and review the forward-looking information, there can be no assurance that the underlying opinions, estimates and assumptions will prove to be correct. Certain assumptions include: our ability to continue working with Deloitte in connection with the strategic alliance; our ability to build our market share and enter new markets and industry verticals; our ability to attract and retain key personnel; our ability to maintain and expand geographic scope; our ability to execute on our expansion plans; our ability to continue investing in infrastructure to support our growth; our ability to obtain and maintain existing financing on acceptable terms; our ability to execute on profitability initiatives; currency exchange and interest rates; the impact of inflation and global macroeconomic conditions; the impact of competition; our ability to respond to the changes and trends in our industry or the global economy; and the changes in laws, rules, regulations, and global standards are material factors made in preparing forward-looking information and management’s expectations.\n\nForward-looking information is necessarily based on a number of opinions, estimates and assumptions that, while considered by the Company to be appropriate and reasonable as of the date of this press release, are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties, assumptions and other factors that may cause the actual results, level of activity, performance or achievements to be materially different from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking information, including but not limited to:\n\n  * the Company’s ability to execute its growth strategies;\n  * the impact of changing conditions in the global corporate e-learning market;\n  * increasing competition in the global corporate e-learning market in which the Company operates;\n  * fluctuations in currency exchange rates and volatility in financial markets;\n  * changes in the attitudes, financial condition and demand of our target market;\n  * the Company’s ability to operate its business and effectively manage its growth under evolving macroeconomic conditions, such as high inflation and recessionary environments;\n  * developments and changes in applicable laws and regulations;\n  * fluctuations in the length and complexity of the sales cycle for our platform, especially for sales to larger enterprises;\n  * issues in the use of AI in our platform and potential resulting reputational harm or liability; and\n  * such other factors discussed in greater detail under the “Risk Factors” section of our Annual Information Form dated February 22, 2024 (“AIF”), which is available under our profile on SEDAR+ at [www.sedarplus.ca](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sedarplus.ca&esheet=54156155&newsitemid=20241121073158&lan=en-US&anchor=www.sedarplus.ca&index=10&md5=df2a95d6dee22550a9dc736d11a7f83b).\n\n\n\nIf any of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or if the opinions, estimates or assumptions underlying the forward-looking information prove incorrect, actual results or future events might vary materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking information. The opinions, estimates or assumptions referred to above and described in greater detail in the “Summary of Factors Affecting our Performance” section of our MD&A for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and in the “Risk Factors” section of our AIF, should be considered carefully by prospective investors.\n\nAlthough we have attempted to identify important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in forward-looking information, there may be other risk factors not presently known to us or that we presently believe are not material that could also cause actual results or future events to differ materially from those expressed in such forward-looking information. There can be no assurance that such information will prove to be accurate, as actual results and future events could differ materially from those anticipated in such information.

(NASDAQ: DCBO; TSX: DCBO), a leading provider of learning platforms with a foundation in artificial intelligence (AI) and innovation, has teamed up with Intercap Impact, a division of Intercap Equity Inc. (Intercap), to create OWL (Open World Learning Inc.), a free e-learning platform designed for small Canadian and US charities and nonprofits.\n\nThis partnership will remove the cost barrier associated with e-learning, a challenge many smaller charities and nonprofit organizations face. Using OWL, powered by Docebo, eligible organizations will now be able to build stronger teams and empower staff, volunteers, and board members with essential e-learning in key areas, including HR Compliance, DEI, Mental Health, Board Governance, Leadership, professional development, and more.\n\n“When it comes to online learning, charitable organizations with small budgets have been left behind—until now,” said Randi Myers, Director of Impact at Intercap. “We’re thrilled to be able to offer the award-winning Docebo learning platform to help them build skills and talent, and save time and money.”\n\nDocebo CEO Alessio Artuffo shares, \"With OWL, we are turning our belief in the limitless power of learning into action. This collaboration removes the cost barrier and extends high-quality training to organizations doing critical work on tight budgets.” He adds, “By providing smaller charitable and nonprofit organizations access to e-learning they couldn't otherwise afford, we're unlocking the potential of learning for all.\"\n\nThe new CSR initiative will be formally announced on October 22, 2024 at the 6th annual [Partnership Conference](https://thepartnershipconference.com/) in Toronto, where Intercap Chairman and CEO Jason Chapnik will join Randi Myers in introducing OWL to Canadian corporate and nonprofit professionals.\n\nThe partnership underscores Docebo’s commitment to CSR and to leveraging technology and innovation for social good. By enabling charitable organizations to focus on their missions while strengthening their teams, Docebo and Intercap are bridging the digital gap and making a lasting, positive impact in communities across Canada and the US.\n\n**About OWL** OWL (Open World Learning) offers access to free e-learning powered by Docebo. OWL is designed and funded by Intercap Impact, the CSR branch of Intercap, a merchant bank that invests in technology-focused startups. Charities and nonprofits with less than 300 active users per month can join OWL at [www.owl.inc](http://www.owl.inc) or [www.join.owl.inc](http://www.join.owl.inc) or download the OWL - Open World Learning app on the App Store and Google Play.\n\n**About Docebo** Docebo (NASDAQ:DCBO; TSX:DCBO) is redefining the way enterprises leverage technology to create and manage content, deliver training, and measure the business impact of their learning programs.

(Nasdaq:DCBO; TSX:DCBO) (\"Docebo\" or the \"Company\") , a global leader in [AI-powered learning solutions](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.docebo.com%2Fproducts%2Flearn-lms%2F&esheet=54156155&newsitemid=20241121073158&lan=en-US&anchor=AI-powered+learning+solutions&index=1&md5=833f05f4bc52bba81b54a0d99d00ce81), today announced a strategic alliance with Deloitte to help mid-size and large organizations build robust, growth-focused learning ecosystems. This alliance will guide companies as they evolve from transactional learning systems into agile and indispensable learning organizations, fully integrated with long-term business growth and operating efficiency.\n\nThis alliance combines Docebo's cutting-edge learning technology with Deloitte's consulting and implementation knowledge to deliver scalable, tailored solutions that meet the rapidly changing needs of complex organizations across U.S. commercial and government sectors. By bringing together Deloitte’s experience in corporate transformation and Docebo’s innovative learning platform, the alliance provides a clear pathway for organizations to develop high-impact learning cultures that boost [employee engagement](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.docebo.com%2Flearning-network%2Fblog%2Fincrease-employee-engagement%2F&esheet=54156155&newsitemid=20241121073158&lan=en-US&anchor=employee+engagement&index=2&md5=969b0d85a23a49cac505810dba93a268) and drive measurable business success.\n\nTravis Burke, EVP of Corporate Development & Partnerships at Docebo, commented: “Our alliance with Deloitte is a pivotal step in supporting organizations that want to harness learning as a driver for growth and operating efficiency. By combining our scalable technology with Deloitte's industry experience, we’re creating an ecosystem where learning is more than a simple support function; it becomes a catalyst for strategic transformation across the business.”\n\nFranz Gilbert, Managing Director, Human Capital Ecosystems & Alliances Leader at Deloitte Consulting LLP, shared: \"Delivering engaging learning experiences is not optional anymore; it is a critical necessity for organizations aiming to stay competitive in today’s fast-paced business world. With Docebo’s cutting-edge learning platform and our Workforce Transformation practice capabilities, we can help businesses develop the skills and knowledge they need to thrive amid rapid technological advancements and changes.\"\n\nStuart Rosenberg, Managing Director at Deloitte Consulting LLP, added: \"Our collaboration with Docebo reflects a shared vision of transforming workforce development through immersive learning experiences like [Deloitte Academies](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww2.deloitte.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Fpages%2Fhuman-capital%2Farticles%2Fdeloitte-academies-workforce-training.html&esheet=54156155&newsitemid=20241121073158&lan=en-US&anchor=Deloitte+Academies&index=3&md5=e1e7ca0a31d9fd75967952bb4dee339d).

This alliance allows us to deliver customized learning experiences that not only address current skill gaps but also anticipate future needs, helping our clients build a future-ready workforce capable of driving sustained business success.\"\n\nFrom Transactional to Transformational Learning\n\nAs announced by Deloitte at the 2024 Inspire Dallas conference, the Docebo-Deloitte alliance introduces a structured maturity model, guiding organizations through four distinct stages of development in their learning functions:\n\n  1. Transactional & Essential - Learning is disconnected and reactive, serving as a basic support function.\n  2. Established & Striving - Intentional learning strategies emerge, setting the foundation for leading-edge capabilities.\n  3. Comprehensive & Scaling - Learning becomes scalable, with a strong cultural footprint and L&D operational mastery.\n  4. Agile & Indispensable - A fully integrated learning culture supporting continuous improvement for short and long-term growth.\n\n\n\nCurrently, only [12% of organizations](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Faction.deloitte.com%2Finsight%2F3708%2Flearning-and-the-path-to-maturity&esheet=54156155&newsitemid=20241121073158&lan=en-US&anchor=12%25+of+organizations&index=4&md5=9e4ac57cd7d21cf932fb46fb5644ad48) operate at the “Agile & Indispensable” level, indicating a significant opportunity for transformation.\n\n**About Deloitte**\n\nDeloitte provides industry-leading audit, consulting, tax and advisory services to many of the world’s most admired brands, including nearly 90% of the Fortune 500® and more than 8,500 U.S.-based private companies.

Zoom helps people and businesses accomplish more with secure and frictionless video communication.\n\nJen Dunham is the Global Manager of Customer Enablement at Zoom and is quoted throughout this case study.\n\n[Visit Zoom](https://zoom.us/)\n\n## The Challenge\n\n### An exponentially-growing customer base required a scalable learning solution\n\nWhen the pandemic struck and in-person interactions pivoted to video, Zoom quickly became the go-to video platform to host birthday parties, elementary school classrooms, doctor’s appointments, and more. This was great for business, but it meant a huge influx of new users—and a massive and immediate training need.\n\nZoom customers needed a simple and centralized place to learn, and the learning needed to update organically as new products and features were released. There weren’t enough hours in the week for Zoom CSMs to teach newer customers the basics of the product and enable veteran customers on best practices. Zoom’s goal was to centralize customer learning and expand offerings to include on-demand and just-in-time learning—allowing users to learn anywhere, anytime, and in a way that works best for them.\n\nThey aimed to provide personalized learning experiences that empowered customers to dive into their product, strengthen customer loyalty, and drive adoption and renewals.\n\nTo get there, Zoom aligned their learning strategy with the business goals and knew they needed a best-in-class learning suite to deploy this initiative. To make it happen, they chose Docebo.\n\n_“We aimed to reach as many Zoom users as possible, offer foundational content that met the highest priority needs, and deliver happiness with a best-in-class user experience.”_\n\n## The Solution\n\n### The Zoom Learning Center, powered by Docebo\n\nWith Docebo, the Zoom team was able to deliver and launch their learning center in under five months. And it wasn’t a barebones minimum viable product (MVP); it was a robust platform above and beyond their original expectations.\n\nWhen they were building out the strategy, they started with an assessment to identify learner needs and help them keep the UX and content practical and focused. Then they got deep into the Docebo Learn platform, exploring all the options for learning, personalization, and automation. They experimented and iterated, stacking different tools against each other to see what worked best for their users and with their content.\n\nAfter testing, they launched with a bang, marketing the launch internally (through email signatures, virtual backgrounds, and more) and externally (through blogs and social media posts).\n\nAt launch, their custom, on-brand learning platform [powered by Docebo] already hosted dozens of courses, videos, and learning plans for their entire suite of products. Now, it’s easy for Zoom to manage the platform and update it with new content, from e-learning to live training.\n\nFor users looking for quick support on a specific product, the Zoom Learning Center is fast and easy to use. But it’s also powerful enough to serve in-depth training courses to users working on expert-level qualifications. Best of all, the robust functionality doesn’t create complexity and confusion for their admins or end-users: The Zoom Learning Center is intuitive and easy for all audiences.\n\n_“We built the Learning Center to empower our customers to achieve anything imaginable on Zoom. And we’re just getting started.”_\n\n## The Results\n\n### Exceptional training for hundreds of thousands of engaged learners\n\nWithin one month of launch, Zoom’s learning center had served over 100,000 learners. The average course review is 4.1 out of 5, and 69.26% of users feel very or extremely confident in applying what they learned.\n\nThe only thing more impressive than the launch are the results that came afterwards. To date, over 600,000 users have registered and over half of those users are paid account holders, so Zoom knows that they are serving their best customers well. And people aren’t just registering for quick tips or troubleshooting—nearly 89,000 users have completed full courses. Zoom has manifested a highly engaged audience through their powerful learning experiences.\n\nThe learning center is also driving efficiencies throughout the business: CSMs report less time spent supporting customers with the basics and more time providing customized solutions; within one month of launch, Zoom’s YouTube channel received 8.2M returning viewers as they replace legacy training videos with new ones; and the Zoom Security team can now point users to a course where customers can earn a Security Champion badge in under 10 minutes (like thousands of other users to date).\n\nIt’s efficient, consistent, and great for the brand.\n\n_“We wouldn’t exist if not for our customers. Putting ourselves in our customers’ shoes will always steer us in the right direction, and leveraging Docebo helps us make them powerful.”_\n\nWant to read this story later?\n\n[Get the case

Cheney Dent is the Senior Learning Platform Specialist for Booking.com.\n\n[Visit Booking.com](https://www.booking.com/)\n\n## The Challenge\n\n### Replacing a learning platform with limited functionality and no scalability\n\nIn the past, the remit of the learning operations team at Booking.com was heavily restricted. The learning platform that they were using had limited functionality, and the team knew there was no use brainstorming customizations and updates that their learning platform didn’t have the features to support.\n\nSenior Learning Specialist Cheney Dent and her team spent most of their time working outside of the learning platform, writing emails, creating documentation, and sending calendar invites.\n\nAutomation was non-existent, and the learning team was overwhelmed with manual administrative tasks for workshop operations. They had to individually email learners when they enrolled in courses and manually send them calendar invites for workshops, training, and events—not an easy feat for a company of over 15,000 employees.\n\nBecause of these limitations, and for ease of work, many learning initiatives took place entirely through Google Docs and Calendar invites instead of being managed in one central learning management system, which made it impossible to track learning efforts or accurately measure performance.\n\nWhen the learning team looked at their setup, they realized that the learning platform was hindering them from meeting their goals. They needed a new learning platform with better admin functionality and automation so that they could offer a customized, personalized experience to both enhance and simplify the learner experience.\n\n“Before Docebo, our team had become complacent because we knew there was so much we couldn’t accomplish. So we never brought up new ideas for the platform, we never prioritized that or planned that in.”\n\n## The Solution\n\n### Customization, personalization, and automation with Docebo\n\nWith Docebo, the only limit to Booking.com’s learning setup and configuration is the team’s imagination.\n\nThey’ve created personalized homepages so that users open the portal and immediately see learning that’s relevant to them. They use course catalogs to help learners easily find role specific content without being overwhelmed by the volume of content or range of topics available.\n\nThey’ve automated most of the course operations tasks that were previously draining a lot of the learning team’s time and resources. Notifications alert users when a new relevant course is available and let managers know when one of their team members completes a training. Data security and compliance can be easily adhered to by managing admin access, permissions, and visibility of different groups in the platform.\n\nWith [Docebo Connect](https://www.docebo.com/products/connect/), Booking.com has integrated both their Google Calendar and their HRIS platform with their learning.\n\nThe Google Calendar integration automates calendar invites for courses, eliminating the need for manual scheduling.\n\nThe integration with Workday, their HRIS, allows them to automate the creation and deactivation of users when people start their jobs or leave the company. It automatically updates user profile information to match their employee file, saving the learning team considerable time and effort in updating employee information across systems.\n\nThe integration has also helped them automate and accelerate their employee onboarding. They used an enrollment rule to automatically begin onboarding for new employees—instead of manually inviting them to a series of onboarding events, as they did previously. With all new employees enrolled in the platform from the start, they can immediately experience the company’s ‘Learn Forever’ value.\n\nThanks to Docebo, all learning initiatives are consolidated, and the learning team no longer needs to spend so much time duplicating work in and outside of the platform. They can track and measure the impact of every learning initiative with Docebo’s analytic capabilities.\n\n“The amount of customization that you can do within the platform is endless.”\n\n## The Results\n\n### Over 800 hours of learning operations time saved\n\nToday, Docebo is the home of all of Booking.com’s learning experiences, including eLearning, ILTs (instructor-led training), vILTs (virtual instructor-led training), micro-learnings and resources. They use over 40 enrollment rules to manage it all.\n\nIn 2023, they were able to increase their learning programs by 30%, with minimal impact on their operational workload. Training driven by subject matter experts has been able to scale up by 40%, as they can now self-manage their courses thanks to features like pre-enrollment rules and waitlists.\n\nThey estimate they have reduced administration overhead on complex programs by as much as 80%. A single course that used to require 20 hours of admin time each week now takes less than four, saving the team over 800 hours of learning admin time each year.\n\nThanks to Docebo’s scalability, they can offer courses to many more people without any increased effort. As a result, they’ve also significantly increased the number of ILTs they offer, from 20 to 120.\n\nAnd, of course, the learner experience has been significantly improved with one home for learning, a consistent experience, timely notifications, and calendar invites.\n\nThe time that Docebo saves the learning operations team has allowed them to allocate resources to other projects, find and create new learning opportunities, or even take advantage of learning opportunities themselves. Most importantly, they can also take a more active role in leadership conversations and ILT design sessions to consult on learning solutions for business needs and suggest anything from workshops to learning plans, ILTs, channels, assets, or playlists—none of which were options before Docebo.\n\nEssentially, Docebo’s increased functionality and flexibility make it possible for the learning team to get creative and design innovative learning solutions—they know the platform can support whatever they come up with.\n\n“Docebo is a forward-thinking company and their platform is highly customizable and that’s exactly what we desperately needed. We’ve left the chaos and apathy behind and are now trusted experts, proactively collaborating with our learning teams to create inspiring learning experiences at scale.”\n\nWant to read this story

Designed for universities of all sizes, the platform provides solutions for departments such as finance, IT, student services, human resources, recruiting, and admissions.\n\nShawn Dinnocenti is the Learning Technology Administrator at Ellucian.\n\n[Visit Ellucian](https://www.ellucian.com/)\n\n## The Challenge\n\n### Accessing the learning data they need to run their business\n\nAs an enterprise software provider for higher education with over 3,000 employees, Ellucian generates a lot of data.\n\nHaving access to all of that data—including learning data from Docebo Learning Platform—is critical for the company’s strategic decision-making and success.\n\nBut integrating the data from their learning system with other sources, like Salesforce, was tricky. Ellucian needed a way to efficiently deliver customized reports to to multiple departments by combining learning data with other business data to make data driven decisions.\n\nLearning Technology Administrator Shawn Dinnocenti would pull information from Docebo and combine that learning data with information from other sources to create reports in their CRM, so that other teams and departments who needed access to the information could find it.\n\nEllucian needed more flexible, automated access to all their learning data, so that they could integrate it with other sources of data into a single system, create the visual reporting they wanted, and easily correlate that data with other business data.\n\n_For anybody working with Docebo reports, having Learn Data is like having the keys to the kingdom. You get to go behind the scenes. You can go in and pull out the reports you want yourself. And that’s been worth every penny.”_\n\n## The Solution\n\n### Centralizing their data in their existing BI with Docebo Learn Data\n\nWith Docebo Learn Data powered by Snowflake data warehouse technology, Ellucian can add all their learning data into the central repository: their existing BI and data ecosystem.\n\nEllucian created their own reports within Snowflake using the raw data that they were able to extract with Learn Data. From there, they were able to customize different visuals and tables and add those to dashboards designed for different users.\n\nNow, their Docebo learning data is combined with insights from Gainsight and Salesforce to Tableau, so that multiple business units can access visual data reports instantly.\n\nEllucian uses Docebo for different purposes, including partner training, customer enablement, and internal training. For each of these, having centralized data and clear reporting has given the company valuable insights that have driven business decision-making.\n\n_We wanted more data to run our business. And training is part of the business, even if people don’t always think about it that way. The reports that were in Docebo were really good, but they didn’t provide us with the whole picture, and no one outside of the learning team could access them.”_\n\n## The Results\n\n### Managing their business with better data\n\nNow that Ellucian can easily combine learning data with data from different sources into a single place, the company leadership can use L&D data for better strategic decision-making.\n\nHaving all of this data in one environment also helps them blend and enrich data, leading to even more data-driven decisions in the future.\n\nAll of the reports that Shawn built and distributed each morning are now generated and shared automatically, saving her half an hour of her day — over 130 hours each year. She can use that time on the more strategic aspects of her job, like creating testing plans for learning platform upgrades.\n\nWith Learn Data, Ellucian has also been able to see revenue trends and track which courses are most profitable to increase their ROI from Docebo.\n\nEllucian has only been using Learn Data for a short time, but as their usage evolves, they are excited to be able to correlate more data and see what they can accomplish next.\n\n_“Docebo Learn Data allows us to see all of our learning data where we want to see it, and it allows us to combine that with other business data in a very visual way. It takes our reporting from good to great.”_\n\nWant to read this story later?\n\n[Get the case study](https://www.docebo.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Docebo-Ellucian-Snapshot.pdf?x79330)\n\n#####

These solutions streamline workflows by enabling the capture and visualization of data for a connected world of productivity, safety, reassurance and sustainability. By giving things a digital identity, SATO helps businesses in retail, manufacturing, food, health care and transport & logistics run smoothly.\n\nJoao Celestino is a Human Resources Development Specialist for SATO. Prior to SATO, he worked as a consultant that specialized in HR solutions and setting up BPO (Business Process Outsourcing) operations for multinationals and is quoted throughout this case study.\n\n[Visit SATO Global](https://www.sato-global.com/)\n\n## The Challenge\n\n### Streamlining learning for 26+ countries with one global platform\n\nWhen HR Specialist Joao Celestino first started working at SATO Holdings, the company was in the middle of a global initiative, aptly named “ONE SATO,” to unify its company culture and processes.\n\nWith offices across 26 countries spanning a wide variety of cultures, languages, and audiences, the company was decentralized. Offices shared the SATO name, but employees didn’t feel connected to colleagues in other regions and HR initiatives were fragmented across offices.\n\nThe company realized that one of its major roadblocks was its inability to create global L&D initiatives: Their existing learning system was outdated and severely limited. Language localization and analytics were non-existent. Because of this, new employee onboarding was designed and conducted locally. Each office had its own processes, there were no companywide standards, and implementing anything from HQ was difficult. Onboarding a new employee could take over nine months, costing the company time and wasting valuable resources—not to mention increasing employee frustration.\n\nEmployees also didn’t have any way to learn about the company’s new products—they had to rely on individual managers for training. In addition, industry information provided by headquarters was difficult to share due to inconsistent knowledge levels across SATO employees. As a result, employees sometimes felt unsupported and they didn’t know where to turn to learn more about SATO’s products and solutions.\n\n_“I give Docebo 10/10. If you’re looking for a system that’s easy to implement and your company is serious about L &D, Docebo is definitely the right choice. Hands down.”_\n\n## The Solution\n\n### A global learning suite to standardize onboarding worldwide\n\nAs a Japanese company, SATO was invested in a process called Nemawashi (根回し), which involves getting all of the major stakeholders on board with a demo version before choosing a learning system.\n\nDuring this live demo consideration stage, Docebo stood out from its competitors for its supportive, collaborative approach, long before a contract was signed. Docebo helped SATO build a robust test learning environment and worked with them to answer questions about configurations and features.\n\nWith advanced localization options, multilingual capabilities, audience segmentation, and the capacity to scale and serve thousands of employees worldwide, Docebo checked all of SATO Holdings’ boxes—including boxes they hadn’t realized they had, like AI auto-tagging, API integrations, and course catalogs. SATO Holdings was quickly able to build and launch standardized, industry-specific employee onboarding materials in all of their local languages.\n\nThey also created product training materials, so that existing employees could fill knowledge gaps and build their skills. With easy-to-find, self-serve training available for every SATO product, employees could easily complete product training, while managers could track their progress and completion rates through Docebo’s analytics.\n\nFrom the early demo days to their current learning suite, the Docebo account manager’s unwavering support has made Joao’s work so much easier, from implementing the initial system to choosing features and solutions for SATO’s specific use case as the company scaled its L&D efforts.\n\n_“I have absolute trust in our account manager. They’ve made it so easy to implement the system and they’ve always made it easy to understand which solution we need for whatever challenge we’re currently facing.”_\n\n## The Results\n\n### Cutting employee ramp-up time in half\n\nSince implementing Docebo, SATO Holdings has cut average new employee onboarding time in half, from 9 months to 4.5 months. This means new employees can start generating value for the company much sooner. Employee headcount has also grown by 20%—supported by their new global standardized onboarding.\n\nExisting employees are also reaping the benefits of the new learning system: They can easily find product information and training without having to ask their managers, enabling a culture of continuous learning throughout the SATO Group.\n\nSATO’s siloed culture is slowly transitioning towards a more open one, as employees report feeling more connected to their colleagues across the world. Employee turnover rates for new employees have decreased from 30% down to below 10%, and employees report higher job satisfaction, too.\n\nManagers have been empowered to take an active role in their employees’ development. Now, they can easily track training completion rates and guide employees interested in promotion towards the right courses to build the skills they need.\n\nThe company has managed to build a stronger sense of unity worldwide, bringing it closer to the idea of “ONE SATO”.\n\n_“A lot of the employee feedback we’ve gotten about the learning management project and Docebo is that employees feel connected now.

As the business was scaling and growing, enablement became a critical priority.\n\nThey already had a talented in-house team of instructional designers and training content producers. Next, they needed to find an agile learning management system (LMS) with the technical capability to scale with them as their company continued to grow.\n\nTo make matters trickier, FintechOS had a hard launch deadline a little over two months away, at their annual digital banking & insurance summit. They were expecting hundreds of people to register for the new FintechOS Academy at the event directly from their mobile devices.\n\nIf the LMS wasn’t ready in time for the event or if customers encountered technical issues, FintechOS would miss out on a key opportunity to drive adoption.\n\n_“This announcement was one of the highlights of our annual global event, and it was critical for us to have a smooth process. If we didn’t, we would miss out on a huge communication opportunity.”_\n\n## The Solution\n\n### Easy implementation and stellar technical support from a trusted partner\n\nFintechOS began looking for an agile learning platform to support their vision. They needed to find a system that was approachable, with a learning experience that was intuitive and accessible. FintechOS chose Docebo Learn LMS for its scalability and flexibility–but they also realized that Docebo’s supportive solution deployment managers (SDMs), great technical support, and clear documentation would help them move quickly through the implementation process.\n\nThe FintechOS team went through several enablement sessions with their Docebo SDM, which helped them grasp the system’s capabilities and configure the platform. Having the support of a technical team they could count on made it easy to trust the platform’s capabilities.\n\nOnboarding the training department went smoothly. FintechOS leveraged a power user framework to provide visibility and divide ownership of the learning lifecycle, from content creation to session delivery, management and administration of learning content, as well as reporting.\n\nDocebo’s automation and templated reports, as well as the ease of setting up power user roles, all contributed to the smooth administrative operations required for launch and scaling.\n\n_“We were looking for a partner; a vendor we could trust. Our ambitious launch required a collaborative relationship with technical support and the deployment managers. And from the very beginning, the account executives at Docebo handled everything so well. The communication with them was great.”_\n\n## The Results\n\n### A successful global launch for FintechOS Academy\n\nAfter seven weeks, FintechOS launched the platform internally for over 400 employees. Then, only nine weeks after procurement, the big day arrived: FintechOS launched FintechOS Academy for their partner ecosystem at their global conference.\n\nThe launch was a phenomenal success. FintechOS was able to capitalize on this messaging opportunity and introduce this platform to a huge portion of their user base at once. Users were able to register directly from their phones and begin learning right away.\n\nSince their launch, each user has completed an average of five to seven courses. Thanks to a smooth launch and a productive partnership with the Docebo team, FintechOS Academy continues to be a fantastic success for the company.\n\n_“Between assessing the training needs and designing the content, launching an academy is a high-stake and stressful project. But having an LMS that was so reliable simplified the whole process. Docebo gave us the full support to accomplish everything we set out to do.”_\n\nWant to read this story later?\n\n[Get the case
