This grant, along with our access to an additional $10 million in cash through the recent Loan and Security Agreement, provides further momentum for advancing the intravenous formulation towards clinical testing. We also believe the grant further validates the significant and growing unmet medical need for an emergency antidote to acute cannabis-induced toxicity. In particular, acute cannabis exposure in children can result in serious and potentially life-threatening consequences, including CNS depression, respiratory depression, coma, and in rare cases death. Research has shown that children are much more sensitive to the toxic effects of cannabis, due in part to age-related differences in the abundance of cannabis receptors in their brains. As a direct consequence, cannabis ingestion in children can result in much more serious outcomes than in adults, and a much greater risk of hospitalization and admission to intensive care. If approved, we believe selonabant has the potential to offer a much-needed targeted therapy for rapidly reversing the serious and life-threatening consequences of accidental cannabis ingestion in children.”\n\n**Financial Results for the three months ended September 30, 2024**\n\n  * Operating expenses in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 were $2.4 million compared with $2.5 million in the same period in fiscal 2024.\n  * Net loss in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 was $2.2 million, or $(0.08) per share, compared with a net loss of $2.5 million, or $(0.10) per share, in the first quarter of fiscal 2024.\n  * Cash and cash equivalents were $1.4 million as of September 30, 2024. The Company has access to an additional $10 million in cash through the Loan and Security Agreement executed on November 13, 2023.\n\n\n\n**About Selonabant (ANEB-001)**\n\nThe Company’s lead product candidate is selonabant (ANEB-001), a potent, small molecule antagonist of the cannabinoid receptor type-1 (“CB1”), under development to address the unmet medical need for a specific antidote for acute cannabis-induced toxicity, including acute cannabinoid intoxication (“ACI”) in adults and unintentional cannabis poisoning in pediatric subjects. The Company anticipates that selonabant will rapidly reverse key symptoms of cannabis toxicity. Selonabant has been successfully formulated for oral administration in clinical studies and t as a potential IV treatment. In a Phase 2 proof-of-concept study in adult subjects challenged with oral delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (“THC”) ([www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT05282797](http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT05282797)), oral selonabant blocked or reversed key CNS effects of THC. Selonabant was well tolerated in this study and there were no serious adverse events. In the open-label extension of the study, THC challenge doses of 40 mg and 60 mg were well-tolerated when dosed in combination with oral selonabant, and all treatment-related adverse events were mild and transient. The prior Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies of oral selonabant have together enrolled a total of 250 subjects, of which 189 received selonabant. Selonabant is protected by two issued patents covering various methods of use of the compound and composition of matter of the crystalline form of selonabant. Anebulo also has multiple pending applications covering various methods of use of the compound and delivery systems. An observational study in patients presenting to Emergency Departments with cannabis toxicity is currently ongoing. The study is intended to determine concentrations of cannabinoids and metabolites in plasma and gather information on signs and symptoms, patients’ disposition and selected subjective assessments.\n\n**About Anebulo Pharmaceuticals, Inc.**\n\nAnebulo Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is a clinical-stage pharmaceutical company developing novel solutions for people suffering from acute cannabinoid intoxication and unintentional cannabis intoxication. Its lead product candidate, selonabant, has completed a Phase 2 clinical trial evaluating its utility in blocking and reversing the negative effects of acute cannabinoid intoxication in healthy adults challenged with oral THC. Rather than proceeding directly with Phase 3 studies of oral selonabant in adults with ACI, the Company is prioritizing the advancement of a selonabant IV formulation as a potential treatment for pediatric patients with acute cannabis-induced toxicity, which it believes offers the potential for a faster timeline to approval relative to the adult oral product. Anebulo is currently scaling up the intravenous formulation for initial clinical safety studies. Selonabant is a competitive antagonist at the human CB1 receptor.

The grant comes in the form of two tranches with the initial award of $0.9 million and subsequent funding of approximately $1 million subject to certain milestones. The grant was awarded under NIH award number 1U01DA059995-01. \n\n“We are honored to receive this cooperative grant award from NIDA to support the further development of intravenous selonabant,” commented Ken Cundy, CSO of Anebulo Pharmaceuticals. “We believe this provides additional validation of the significant and growing unmet medical need for an emergency antidote to cannabis. Acute cannabis exposure in children represents a potentially life-threatening condition that can result in CNS depression, respiratory depression, coma, and in rare cases death. Research has shown that children are much more sensitive to the toxic effects of cannabis. Younger children have an underdeveloped endocannabinoid system with significantly more of the primary cannabinoid receptor type 1 (CB1) receptors present in their brains. As a direct consequence, pediatric cannabis ingestion can result in much more serious outcomes than in adults, and a much greater risk of hospitalization and admission to intensive care.” \n\n“This important grant from NIDA recognizes the progress we have already made with the successful Phase 2 proof of concept study of oral selonabant and provides further momentum for advancing the intravenous formulation towards clinical testing,” said Richie Cunningham, CEO, Anebulo Pharmaceuticals. “If approved, we believe selonabant has the potential to offer a much-needed targeted therapy for rapidly reversing the serious and life-threatening consequences of accidental cannabis ingestion in children. This grant aligns with our recent decision to prioritize development of the intravenous formulation and we look forward to working closely with NIDA scientific staff on this important program.” \n\n**About Selonabant (ANEB-001)**\n\nOur lead product candidate is selonabant (ANEB-001), a potent, small molecule antagonist of CB1, under development to address the unmet medical need for a specific antidote for cannabis toxicity, including ACI and unintentional cannabis poisoning. Selonabant is an orally bioavailable, readily absorbed treatment candidate that we anticipate will rapidly reverse key symptoms of ACI. Selonabant is also under development as a parenteral treatment for unintentional cannabis poisoning. Selonabant is protected by two issued patents covering various methods of use of the compound and composition of matter of the crystalline form of selonabant. We also have multiple pending applications covering various methods of use of the compound and delivery systems. An observational study in patients presenting to Emergency Departments with ACI is currently ongoing. The study will determine concentrations of cannabinoids and metabolites in plasma and gather information on signs and symptoms, patients’ disposition and selected subjective assessments. \n\n**About Anebulo Pharmaceuticals, Inc.**\n\nAnebulo Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing novel solutions for people suffering from acute cannabinoid intoxication, unintentional cannabis intoxication and, longer term, for substance use disorders. Its lead product candidate, selonabant, has completed dosing in a Phase 2 clinical trial ([www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT05282797](http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT05282797)) evaluating its utility in blocking and reversing the negative effects of acute cannabinoid intoxication. Selonabant is a competitive antagonist at the human CB1.

This grant, along with our access to an additional $10 million in cash through the recent Loan and Security Agreement, provides further momentum for advancing the intravenous formulation towards clinical testing. We also believe the grant further validates the significant and growing unmet medical need for an emergency antidote to acute cannabis-induced toxicity. In particular, acute cannabis exposure in children can result in serious and potentially life-threatening consequences, including CNS depression, respiratory depression, coma, and in rare cases death. Research has shown that children are much more sensitive to the toxic effects of cannabis, due in part to age-related differences in the abundance of cannabis receptors in their brains. As a direct consequence, cannabis ingestion in children can result in much more serious outcomes than in adults, and a much greater risk of hospitalization and admission to intensive care. If approved, we believe selonabant has the potential to offer a much-needed targeted therapy for rapidly reversing the serious and life-threatening consequences of accidental cannabis ingestion in children.”\n\n**Financial Results for the three months ended September 30, 2024**\n\n  * Operating expenses in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 were $2.4 million compared with $2.5 million in the same period in fiscal 2024.\n  * Net loss in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 was $2.2 million, or $(0.08) per share, compared with a net loss of $2.5 million, or $(0.10) per share, in the first quarter of fiscal 2024.\n  * Cash and cash equivalents were $1.4 million as of September 30, 2024. The Company has access to an additional $10 million in cash through the Loan and Security Agreement executed on November 13, 2023.\n\n\n\n**About Selonabant (ANEB-001)**\n\nThe Company’s lead product candidate is selonabant (ANEB-001), a potent, small molecule antagonist of the cannabinoid receptor type-1 (“CB1”), under development to address the unmet medical need for a specific antidote for acute cannabis-induced toxicity, including acute cannabinoid intoxication (“ACI”) in adults and unintentional cannabis poisoning in pediatric subjects. The Company anticipates that selonabant will rapidly reverse key symptoms of cannabis toxicity. Selonabant has been successfully formulated for oral administration in clinical studies and t as a potential IV treatment. In a Phase 2 proof-of-concept study in adult subjects challenged with oral delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (“THC”) ([www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT05282797](http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT05282797)), oral selonabant blocked or reversed key CNS effects of THC. Selonabant was well tolerated in this study and there were no serious adverse events. In the open-label extension of the study, THC challenge doses of 40 mg and 60 mg were well-tolerated when dosed in combination with oral selonabant, and all treatment-related adverse events were mild and transient. The prior Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies of oral selonabant have together enrolled a total of 250 subjects, of which 189 received selonabant. Selonabant is protected by two issued patents covering various methods of use of the compound and composition of matter of the crystalline form of selonabant. Anebulo also has multiple pending applications covering various methods of use of the compound and delivery systems. An observational study in patients presenting to Emergency Departments with cannabis toxicity is currently ongoing. The study is intended to determine concentrations of cannabinoids and metabolites in plasma and gather information on signs and symptoms, patients’ disposition and selected subjective assessments.\n\n**About Anebulo Pharmaceuticals, Inc.**\n\nAnebulo Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is a clinical-stage pharmaceutical company developing novel solutions for people suffering from acute cannabinoid intoxication and unintentional cannabis intoxication. Its lead product candidate, selonabant, has completed a Phase 2 clinical trial evaluating its utility in blocking and reversing the negative effects of acute cannabinoid intoxication in healthy adults challenged with oral THC. Rather than proceeding directly with Phase 3 studies of oral selonabant in adults with ACI, the Company is prioritizing the advancement of a selonabant IV formulation as a potential treatment for pediatric patients with acute cannabis-induced toxicity, which it believes offers the potential for a faster timeline to approval relative to the adult oral product. Anebulo is currently scaling up the intravenous formulation for initial clinical safety studies. Selonabant is a competitive antagonist at the human CB1 receptor.
