With many travelers being mindful of their spending, Allegiant is committed to providing budget-friendly options that allow customers to enjoy their dream vacation. Additionally, the airline has added three airports to its network: Gulf Shores International Airport (GUF), Colorado Springs Airport (COS) and Columbia Metropolitan Airport (CAE).\n\n\"We're excited to announce that Allegiant is expanding nationwide, offering even more travel options to our customers,\" said Drew Wells, Allegiant's chief commercial officer. \"These additions reflect our ongoing commitment to meet customer demand.

Throughout the quarter, we observed sustained strength in demand, with unit revenues turning positive on a year-over-year basis in the final weeks. Particularly noteworthy was the ancillary revenue per passenger, which reached $74.02, reflecting a three percent increase from the previous year due in part to the success of both the Allegiant Extra product and the cobrand credit card.\n\n\"As we entered the fourth quarter, our network experienced substantial disruptions due to the severe impact of Hurricane Milton and the continuing effects of Hurricane Helene. Ensuring the safety of our customers and team members remains our top priority, and I am extremely proud of our team's response during these challenging times. The hurricanes have led to a temporary decline in demand in certain cities along the West Coast of Florida and in Asheville, North Carolina. Approximately 25 percent of the seats scheduled to be flown in the fourth quarter are to destinations currently facing this short-term demand weakness. We anticipate that demand will return to normal by the end of the year and have adjusted our capacity accordingly. Load factors in the affected areas are expected to stay lower, resulting in a four-percentage point decline in our airline-only operating margin during the fourth quarter, which we now estimate to be around seven percent.\n\n\"Despite these short-term headwinds, I am pleased with the progress the team has made towards our three key initiatives - restoring peak utilization, the integration of the Boeing MAX aircraft, and various revenue initiatives.\n\n  1. **Restoring peak utilization:** Peak December utilization is scheduled to be up 25 percent over the prior year and down only six percent versus December 2019. As we move into 2025, March utilization is scheduled to be within five percent of 2019 levels.\n  2. **Boeing MAX Integration:** We achieved a major milestone during the third quarter by taking delivery of our first Boeing MAX aircraft. This airplane began revenue service mid-October and initial data supports significant improvements in the operating economics of this aircraft type over our current fleet. We remain in active discussions with Boeing around a reliable delivery schedule.\n  3. **Revenue initiatives** : The team delivered a Navitaire win late in the third quarter by restoring functionality around our third bundled product offering. Since going live, we have seen take rates for this offering mirror the rates observed pre-Navitaire launch, resulting in an incremental $1 in ancillary revenue per passenger. Additionally, I am happy to report we are on track to retrofit over 50 of our aircraft with the Allegiant Extra premium product by year end. We record approximately $3 per passenger in incremental ancillary revenue on aircraft equipped with this configuration. Finally, our Allegiant Allways Visa card continues to exceed our expectations. We expect total remuneration from the bank to exceed $140 million in 2024, with continued growth in 2025.\n\n\n\n\"Lastly we continue to work with our experienced hospitality team alongside our best-in-class advisors to help us optimize the value of the asset and appropriately navigate discussions with potential partners. Sunseeker is an amazing resort that we see meaningful asset value in and are committed to making decisions that align with the best interest of our stakeholders.\n\n\"I am incredibly proud of the progress the team is making to restore the earnings potential of our unique model. We are building the foundation to improved financial performance in 2025 and beyond.\"\n\n**_Third Quarter 2024 Results and Highlights_**\n\n  * **Total operating revenue** of $562.2M, down 0.6 percent over the prior year\n    * Total fixed fee contract revenue of $20.6M, up 15.9 percent year-over-year\n    * Total average ancillary fare of $74.02, up 3.1 percent year-over-year driven by strength in seats, bags, and cobrand\n  * **Operating loss, excluding specials,(1)(2)** of $17.6M, yielding an adjusted operating margin of (3.1) percent\n    * Airline-only operating income, excluding specials,**(1)(2)** of $0.6M, yielding an airline-only adjusted operating margin of 0.1 percent\n  * **Loss before income tax, excluding specials,(1)(2) **of $34.7M, yielding an adjusted pre-tax margin of (6.2) percent \n    * Airline-only loss before income tax, excluding specials,**(1)(2)** of $11.0M, yielding an adjusted pre-tax margin of (2.0) percent\n  * **Consolidated EBITDA, excluding specials,(1)(2)** of $46.3M, yielding an adjusted EBITDA margin of 8.2 percent\n    * Airline-only EBITDA, excluding specials,**(1)** of $56.6M, yielding an adjusted airline-only EBITDA margin of 10.3 percent\n  * **Airline-only operating CASM, excluding fuel and special charges,(2) **of 8.89 ¢, up 4.7 percent year-over-year\n  * **$36.5M in total cobrand credit card remuneration received from Bank of America,** up 18.7 percent from the prior year\n    * As of September 30, 2024, we had 535K total Allegiant Allways Rewards Visa cardholders\n  * Enrolled **448K new Allways Rewards members** during the third quarter\n  * Published the**2023 Sustainability Report** reaffirming the company's sustainability goals designed to add value both short- and long-term for our stakeholders\n  * Named the number one**Best Airline Credit Card and Best Frequent Flyer program in USA TODAY's 10Best 2024 Readers' Choice Awards** for the sixth consecutive year\n\n\n\n_(1)_ | _Denotes a non-GAAP financial measure.

We also present these airline-only metrics excluding special charges related to aircraft accelerated depreciation on early retirement of certain airframes, a ratification bonus for the new collective bargaining agreement for our flight attendants, and an organizational restructuring of certain administrative personnel. Management believes the exclusion of these special charges enhances comparability of financial information between periods. Airline earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (\"Airline EBITDA\") and Airline EBITDA excluding special charges eliminate the effects of non-airline operating activity and other items. As such, all of these are non-GAAP financial measures. We believe the presentation of these measures is relevant and useful for investors because it allows them to better gauge the performance of the airline and to compare our results to other airlines.\n\nWe also present both operating expense and CASM excluding aircraft fuel expense and excluding the airline special charges listed in the table below. Fuel price volatility impacts the comparability of year over year financial performance as do the airline special charges. We believe the adjustments for fuel expense and airline special charges allow investors to better understand our non-fuel costs and related performance.\n\nWe present consolidated operating income, EBITDA, and diluted earnings (loss) per share excluding Sunseeker special charges, net of recoveries, and airline special charges, to exclude the impact of losses and insurance recoveries incurred primarily as the result of hurricanes and other insured events at Sunseeker and to exclude the airline special charges listed in the table below. Management believes these measures enhance comparability of financial information between periods.\n\nConsolidated EBITDA, Consolidated EBITDA excluding special charges, Airline EBITDA excluding special charges, estimated airline only and consolidated earnings (loss) per share excluding special charges, and Sunseeker estimated EBITDA, as presented in this press release, are supplemental measures of our performance that are not required by, or presented in accordance with, accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (\"GAAP\"). These are not measurements of our financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to net income or any other performance measures derived in accordance with GAAP or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of our liquidity.\n\nWe define \"EBITDA\" as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. We also adjust EBITDA within this release to exclude non-airline activity and special charges. We caution investors that amounts presented in accordance with this definition may not be comparable to similar measures disclosed by other issuers, because not all issuers and analysts calculate EBITDA in the same manner.\n\nWe use EBITDA and Airline EBITDA to evaluate our operating performance and liquidity, and these are among the primary measures used by management for planning and forecasting of future periods. We believe these presentations of EBITDA are relevant and useful for investors because they allow investors to view results in a manner similar to the method used by management and make it easier to compare our results with other companies that have different financing and capital structures. EBITDA has important limitations as an analytical tool. These limitations include the following:\n\n  * EBITDA does not reflect our capital expenditures, future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments to purchase capital equipment;\n  * EBITDA does not reflect interest expense or the cash requirements necessary to service principal or interest payments on our debt;\n  * although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets that we currently depreciate and amortize will likely have to be replaced in the future, and EBITDA does not reflect the cash required to fund such replacements; and\n  * other companies in our industry may calculate EBITDA differently than we do, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure.\n\n\n\nPresented below is a quantitative reconciliation of these adjusted numbers to the most directly comparable GAAP financial performance measure.\n\nThe SEC has adopted rules (Regulation G) regulating the use of non-GAAP financial measures. Because of our use of non-GAAP financial measures in this press release to supplement our consolidated financial statements presented on a GAAP basis, Regulation G requires us to include in this press release a presentation of the most directly comparable GAAP measure, which is operating expenses, operating income (loss), income (loss) before income taxes, net income (loss), and net earnings (loss) per share and a reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measure. Our utilization of non-GAAP measurements is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for operating expenses, income (loss) before income taxes, net income (loss), earnings (loss) per share, or other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. Our use of these non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies in the airline and travel industry. The reconciliation of each of these measures to the most comparable GAAP measure for the periods is indicated below.\n\n**Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures**  \n---  \n**Three Months Ended
