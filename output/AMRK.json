(NASDAQ: AMRK)** , a leading fully integrated precious metals platform, reported results for the fiscal first quarter ended September 30, 2024.\n\n**Management Commentary**\n\n“Our first quarter results reflect the continued strength of our fully-integrated platform,” said A-Mark CEO Greg Roberts. “Despite slower market conditions marked by elevated precious metals prices and subdued demand, we delivered $0.37 per diluted share and generated $17.8 million in non-GAAP EBITDA.\n\n\"We also took significant steps this quarter to continue to position the business for long-term success. We amended our $422.5 million Trading Credit Facility, extending its maturity date to September 30, 2026, providing the company with stable, long term access to capital for the business. We also made significant progress on our A-Mark Global Logistics (AMGL) facility expansion and logistics automation initiatives. The expected completion in the coming months is anticipated to increase operational capacity and produce efficiencies and long term cost savings. We are also advancing our reach in Asia and have made substantial progress towards establishing a trading office and DTC presence in Singapore and broadening our reach into the surrounding region.\n\n“As noted in our recent press release, during October, Silver Towne Mint acquired all of the assets of Regency Mint Manufacturing, LLC, including its minting equipment and its customer list, further enhancing our minting capacity and expanding our customer base. We are pleased with our recent accomplishments and remain optimistic that our proven integrated business model will allow us to sustain profitability. We remain committed to exploring opportunities that enhance our market reach and deliver value to our shareholders over the long term.”\n\n**Three Months Ended September 30,**  \n---  \n**2024** |  **2023**  \n(in thousands, except Earnings per Share)  \n**Selected Key Financial Statement Metrics:**  \nRevenues | $ | 2,715,096 | $ | 2,484,618  \nGross profit | $ | 43,443 | $ | 49,405  \nDepreciation and amortization expense | $ | (4,709 | ) | $ | (2,792 | )  \nNet income attributable to the Company | $ | 8,984 | $ | 18,827  \n**Earnings per Share:**  \nBasic | $ | 0.39 | $ | 0.81  \nDiluted | $ | 0.37 | $ | 0.77  \n**Non-GAAP Measures(1):**  \nAdjusted net income before provision for income taxes | $ | 14,784 | $ | 26,779  \nEBITDA | $ | 17,782 | $ | 30,448  \n(1) See Reconciliation of U.S. GAAP to Non-GAAP Measures below and on pages 17-18  \nA reconciliation of net income before provision for income taxes to adjusted net income before provision for income taxes for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 follows (in thousands):  \n---  \n**Three Months Ended September 30,**  \n**2024** | **2023**  \nNet income before provision for income taxes | $ | 10,173 | $ | 23,935  \nAdjustments:  \nContingent consideration fair value adjustments | (150 | ) | —  \nAcquisition costs | 52 | 52  \nAmortization of acquired intangibles | 3,864 | 2,165  \nDepreciation expense | 845 | 627  \nAdjusted net income before provision for income taxes (non-GAAP) | $ | 14,784 | $ | 26,779  \n**Three Months Ended**  \n---  \n**September 30, 2024** |  **June 30,****2024**  \n(in thousands, except Earnings per Share)  \n**Selected Key Financial Statement Metrics:**  \nRevenues | $ | 2,715,096 | $ | 2,524,955  \nGross profit | $ | 43,443 | $ | 42,971  \nDepreciation and amortization expense | $ | (4,709 | ) | $ | (2,845 | )  \nNet income attributable to the Company | $ | 8,984 | $ | 30,940  \n**Earnings per Share:**  \nBasic | $ | 0.39 | $ | 1.35  \nDiluted | $ | 0.37 | $ | 1.29  \n**Non-GAAP Measures(1):**  \nAdjusted net income before provision for income taxes | $ | 14,784 | $ | 20,144  \nEBITDA | $ | 17,782 | $ | 38,380  \n(1) See Reconciliation of U.S. GAAP to Non-GAAP Measures below and on pages 17-18  \nA reconciliation of net income before provision for income taxes to adjusted net income before provision for income taxes for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024 follows (in thousands):  \n---  \n**Three Months Ended**  \n**September 30, 2024** |  **June 30,****2024**  \nNet income before provision for income taxes | $ | 10,173 | $ | 33,975  \nAdjustments:  \nRemeasurement gain on pre-existing equity interest | — | (16,669 | )  \nContingent consideration fair value adjustments | (150 | ) | (370 | )  \nAcquisition costs | 52 | 363  \nAmortization of acquired intangibles | 3,864 | 2,066  \nDepreciation expense | 845 | 779  \nAdjusted net income before provision for income taxes (non-GAAP) | $ | 14,784 | $ | 20,144  \n  \n**Fiscal First Quarter 2025 Financial Highlights**\n\n  * Revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased 9% to $2.72 billion from $2.48 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and increased 8% from $2.52 billion for the three months ended June 30, 2024.

For the three months ended June 30, 2024, approximately 92% of the new customers were attributable to the acquisition of a controlling interest in SGB\n  * Direct-to-Consumer active customers for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased 22% to 129,900 from 106,400 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, and increased 13% from 114,600 for the three months ended June 30, 2024. The increase in the number of active customers was primarily due to the Company acquiring a controlling interest in SGB in June 2024\n  * Direct-to-Consumer average order value for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased $527, or 22% to $2,967 from $2,440 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, and increased $77, or 3% from $2,890 for the three months ended June 30, 2024\n  * JM Bullion’s average order value for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased $41, or 2% to $2,198 from $2,239 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, and decreased $441, or 17% from $2,639 for the three months ended June 30, 2024. The decrease in the average order value is partially driven by a higher mix of silver vs. gold orders during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared with the previous periods noted\n\n\n\n**Fiscal First Quarter 2025 Financial Summary**\n\nRevenues increased 9% to $2.72 billion from $2.48 billion in the same year-ago quarter. Excluding an increase of $217.4 million of forward sales, our revenues increased $13.1 million, or 0.9%, which was due to higher average selling prices of gold and silver, partially offset by a decrease in gold and silver ounces sold.\n\nThe Direct-to-Consumer segment contributed 18% and 13% of the consolidated revenue in the fiscal first quarters of 2025 and 2024, respectively. JMB’s revenue represented 11% of the consolidated revenues for the fiscal first quarter of 2025 compared with 12% for the prior year fiscal first quarter.\n\nGross profit decreased 12% to $43.4 million (1.60% of revenue) from $49.4 million (1.99% of revenue) in the same year-ago quarter. The decrease in gross profit was due to lower gross profits earned from the Wholesale Sales & Ancillary Services segment, partially offset by an increase in gross profits earned by the Direct-to-Consumer segment. The Direct-to-Consumer segment contributed 54% and 43% of the consolidated gross profit in the fiscal first quarters of 2025 and 2024, respectively. Gross profit contributed by JMB represented 37% of the consolidated gross profit in the fiscal first quarter of 2025 and 36% of the consolidated gross profit for the prior year fiscal first quarter.\n\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased 22% to $26.6 million from $21.8 million in the same year-ago quarter. The change was primarily due to an increase in compensation expense (including performance-based accruals) of $2.6 million, higher advertising costs of $0.7 million, an increase in consulting and professional fees of $0.2 million, an increase in information technology costs of $0.2 million, and an increase in insurance costs of $0.2 million. SG&A expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 include $5.3 million of expenses incurred by LPM and SGB, our recently consolidated subsidiaries which were not included in our prior year Q1 results.\n\nDepreciation and amortization expense increased 69% to $4.7 million from $2.8 million in the same year-ago quarter. The change was primarily due to an increase in amortization expense of $2.2 million relating to intangible assets acquired through our acquisition of LPM and acquisition of a controlling interest in SGB, partially offset by a decrease in JMB intangible asset amortization of $0.5 million.\n\nInterest income increased 16% to $7.1 million from $6.1 million in the same year-ago quarter. The increase in interest income was primarily due to an increase in other finance product income of $0.6 million and an increase in interest income earned by our Secured Lending segment of $0.3 million.\n\nInterest expense increased 2% to $10.0 million from $9.8 million in the same year-ago quarter. The increase in interest expense was primarily due to an increase of $0.7 million associated with our Trading Credit Facility due to increased borrowings as well as an increase in interest rates and an increase of $0.7 million related to product financing arrangements, partially offset by a decrease of $1.4 million related to the AMCF Notes (including amortization of debt issuance costs) due to their repayment in December 2023.\n\nEarnings from equity method investments decreased 79% to $0.6 million from $2.7 million in the same year-ago quarter. The decrease was due to decreased earnings of our equity method investees.\n\nNet income attributable to the Company totaled $9.0 million or $0.37 per diluted share, compared to net income of $18.8 million or $0.77 per diluted share in the same year-ago quarter.\n\nAdjusted net income before provision for income taxes for the three months ended September 30, 2024 totaled $14.8 million, a decrease of $12.0 million or 45% compared to $26.8 million in the same year-ago quarter. The decrease was principally due to lower net income before provision for income taxes.\n\nEBITDA for the three months ended September 30, 2024 totaled $17.8 million, a decrease of $12.6 million or 41% compared to $30.4 million in the same year-ago quarter. The net decrease was principally due to lower net income of $10.6 million.\n\n**Quarterly Cash Dividend Policy**\n\nA-Mark’s Board of Directors has re-affirmed its previously announced regular quarterly cash dividend policy of $0.20 per common share ($0.80 per share on an annual basis). The Company paid a $0.20 quarterly cash dividend on October 22, 2024 to stockholders of record as of October 8, 2024. It is expected that the next quarterly dividend will be paid in January 2025.

This includes press releases and other information about financial performance, reports filed or furnished with the SEC, information on corporate governance, and investor presentations.\n\n**Important Cautions Regarding Forward-Looking Statements** Statements in this press release that relate to future plans, objectives, expectations, performance, events and the like are \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These include statements regarding expectations with respect to future profitability and growth, international expansion, operational enhancements, and the amount or timing of any future dividends. Future events, risks and uncertainties, individually or in the aggregate, could cause actual results or circumstances to differ materially from those expressed or implied in these statements. Factors that could cause actual results to differ include the following: the failure to execute the Company’s growth strategy, including the inability to identify suitable or available acquisition or investment opportunities; greater than anticipated costs incurred to execute this strategy; government regulations that might impede growth, particularly in Asia; the inability to successfully integrate recently acquired businesses; changes in the current international political climate, which historically has favorably contributed to demand and volatility in the precious metals markets but also has posed certain risks and uncertainties for the Company, particularly in recent periods; potential adverse effects of the current problems in the national and global supply chains; increased competition for the Company’s higher margin services, which could depress pricing; the failure of the Company’s business model to respond to changes in the market environment as anticipated; changes in consumer demand and preferences for precious metal products generally; potential negative effects that inflationary pressure may have on our business; the inability of the Company to expand capacity at Silver Towne Mint; the failure of our investee companies to maintain, or address the preferences of, their customer bases; general risks of doing business in the commodity markets; and the strategic, business, economic, financial, political and governmental risks and other Risk Factors described in in the Company’s public filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nThe Company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements.\n\n**Use and Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures** In addition to presenting the Company’s financial results determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, management believes the following non-GAAP measures are useful in evaluating the Company’s operating performance: “adjusted net income before provision for income taxes” and “earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization” (“EBITDA”). Management believes the “adjusted net income before provision for income taxes” non-GAAP financial performance measure assists investors and analysts by facilitating comparison of period-to-period operational performance on a consistent basis by excluding items that management does not believe are indicative of the Company’s core operating performance. The items excluded from this financial measure may have a material impact on the Company’s financial results. Certain of those items are non-recurring, while others are non-cash in nature. Management believes the EBITDA non-GAAP liquidity measure assists investors and analysts by facilitating comparison of our business operations before investing activities, interest, and income taxes with other publicly traded companies. Non-GAAP measures do not have standardized definitions and should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for or superior to, the comparable measures prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and should be read in conjunction with the financial statements included in the Company’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q to be filed with the SEC. Management encourages investors and others to review the Company’s financial information in its entirety and not to rely on any single financial or liquidity measure.\n\nIn the Company’s reconciliation from its reported U.S. GAAP “net income before provision for income taxes” to its non-GAAP “adjusted net income before provision for income taxes”, the Company eliminates the impact of the following five amounts: acquisition expenses; amortization expenses related to intangible assets acquired; depreciation expense; remeasurement gains or losses; and contingent consideration fair value adjustments. The Company’s reconciliations from its reported U.S. GAAP “net income before provision for income taxes” to its non-GAAP “adjusted net income before provision for income taxes”, and “net income” and “net cash provided by (used in) operating activities” to its non-GAAP “EBITDA” are provided below and are also included in the Company’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q to be filed with the SEC for the quarterly period ended September 30, 2024.\n\n**Company Contact:** Steve Reiner, Executive Vice President, Capital Markets & Investor RelationsA-Mark Precious Metals, Inc.1-310-587-1410[sreiner@amark.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=g1JxuSH_6s3uKX4NXmZWswu8l2EUR3BN3JC3zl1tiUspCeMKm7GcY0ek6t4NNx9b5duJ_MTHKsbaraMn3Zd_D1pDbzmfSi8Y8wXnVY2G3mY=)\n\n**Investor Relations Contact:** Matt Glover or Greg BradburyGateway Group, Inc.1-949-574-3860[AMRK@gateway-grp.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=jJG35zzZQ0_2VPN4mqOiDOpBb4MViY6dVeJGakn1lEd6-u7YMlRSkbdAWtJRKCSfPq0lMNUAApfhJoLTzx5PSnozaIQhePKy25n9Oox4gLE=)\n\n**A-MARK PRECIOUS METALS, INC.

Regency Mint, a 25-year old family-owned and operated business located in Orem, Utah, is an ISO 9001:2015 certified mint that sells primarily to distributors and retailers of precious metals.\n\nWith the acquisition, Silver Towne Mint acquired all of Regency Mint’s minting equipment, which is expected to be moved shortly to the Silver Towne Mint’s facility in Winchester, Indiana, as well as its entire customer list. Among the immediate benefits of the acquisition to Silver Towne Mint include additional capacity for proof-quality coins and rounds and breakable rounds, along with new extrusion equipment that will enable faster and more efficient production of fractional products.\n\nThe equipment from Regency Mint is expected to eventually increase Silver Towne Mint’s capacity of struck products from 30 million to more than 50 million ounces per year. Combined with large-format bars, the total minting capacity in the long term should exceed 100 million ounces per year. Some of the acquired equipment will be placed in storage until more facility space is created to fully utilize the new machinery.\n\n“This acquisition marks another significant step forward, enhancing our minting capacity and expanding our customer base,” said A-Mark CEO Greg Roberts. “Regency Mint’s state-of-the-art equipment will not only improve our production processes but also substantially increase our output capabilities. We’re excited to welcome Regency Mint’s customers and serve them through our newly enhanced operations, offering an even broader range of services and products.”\n\nRegency Mint CEO Josh Tanner added: “After 25 years of producing bullion and custom rounds as a family-owned and operated business, we are confident in our decision to entrust our long-standing relationships with over 2,000 customers into the care of A-Mark and Silver Towne Mint, who we believe demonstrate Regency Mint’s same core values of integrity, exceptional customer service and product excellence. Our customers should benefit greatly from the expanded services and products available through A-Mark’s vertically integrated business.”\n\n**About A-Mark Precious Metals** Founded in 1965, A-Mark Precious Metals, Inc. is a leading fully integrated precious metals platform that offers an array of gold, silver, platinum, palladium, and copper bullion, numismatic coins, and related products to wholesale and retail customers via a portfolio of channels.

(NASDAQ: AMRK)** , a leading fully integrated precious metals platform, reported results for the fiscal first quarter ended September 30, 2024.\n\n**Management Commentary**\n\n“Our first quarter results reflect the continued strength of our fully-integrated platform,” said A-Mark CEO Greg Roberts. “Despite slower market conditions marked by elevated precious metals prices and subdued demand, we delivered $0.37 per diluted share and generated $17.8 million in non-GAAP EBITDA.\n\n\"We also took significant steps this quarter to continue to position the business for long-term success. We amended our $422.5 million Trading Credit Facility, extending its maturity date to September 30, 2026, providing the company with stable, long term access to capital for the business. We also made significant progress on our A-Mark Global Logistics (AMGL) facility expansion and logistics automation initiatives. The expected completion in the coming months is anticipated to increase operational capacity and produce efficiencies and long term cost savings. We are also advancing our reach in Asia and have made substantial progress towards establishing a trading office and DTC presence in Singapore and broadening our reach into the surrounding region.\n\n“As noted in our recent press release, during October, Silver Towne Mint acquired all of the assets of Regency Mint Manufacturing, LLC, including its minting equipment and its customer list, further enhancing our minting capacity and expanding our customer base. We are pleased with our recent accomplishments and remain optimistic that our proven integrated business model will allow us to sustain profitability. We remain committed to exploring opportunities that enhance our market reach and deliver value to our shareholders over the long term.”\n\n**Three Months Ended September 30,**  \n---  \n**2024** |  **2023**  \n(in thousands, except Earnings per Share)  \n**Selected Key Financial Statement Metrics:**  \nRevenues | $ | 2,715,096 | $ | 2,484,618  \nGross profit | $ | 43,443 | $ | 49,405  \nDepreciation and amortization expense | $ | (4,709 | ) | $ | (2,792 | )  \nNet income attributable to the Company | $ | 8,984 | $ | 18,827  \n**Earnings per Share:**  \nBasic | $ | 0.39 | $ | 0.81  \nDiluted | $ | 0.37 | $ | 0.77  \n**Non-GAAP Measures(1):**  \nAdjusted net income before provision for income taxes | $ | 14,784 | $ | 26,779  \nEBITDA | $ | 17,782 | $ | 30,448  \n(1) See Reconciliation of U.S. GAAP to Non-GAAP Measures below and on pages 17-18  \nA reconciliation of net income before provision for income taxes to adjusted net income before provision for income taxes for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 follows (in thousands):  \n---  \n**Three Months Ended September 30,**  \n**2024** | **2023**  \nNet income before provision for income taxes | $ | 10,173 | $ | 23,935  \nAdjustments:  \nContingent consideration fair value adjustments | (150 | ) | —  \nAcquisition costs | 52 | 52  \nAmortization of acquired intangibles | 3,864 | 2,165  \nDepreciation expense | 845 | 627  \nAdjusted net income before provision for income taxes (non-GAAP) | $ | 14,784 | $ | 26,779  \n**Three Months Ended**  \n---  \n**September 30, 2024** |  **June 30,****2024**  \n(in thousands, except Earnings per Share)  \n**Selected Key Financial Statement Metrics:**  \nRevenues | $ | 2,715,096 | $ | 2,524,955  \nGross profit | $ | 43,443 | $ | 42,971  \nDepreciation and amortization expense | $ | (4,709 | ) | $ | (2,845 | )  \nNet income attributable to the Company | $ | 8,984 | $ | 30,940  \n**Earnings per Share:**  \nBasic | $ | 0.39 | $ | 1.35  \nDiluted | $ | 0.37 | $ | 1.29  \n**Non-GAAP Measures(1):**  \nAdjusted net income before provision for income taxes | $ | 14,784 | $ | 20,144  \nEBITDA | $ | 17,782 | $ | 38,380  \n(1) See Reconciliation of U.S. GAAP to Non-GAAP Measures below and on pages 17-18  \nA reconciliation of net income before provision for income taxes to adjusted net income before provision for income taxes for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024 follows (in thousands):  \n---  \n**Three Months Ended**  \n**September 30, 2024** |  **June 30,****2024**  \nNet income before provision for income taxes | $ | 10,173 | $ | 33,975  \nAdjustments:  \nRemeasurement gain on pre-existing equity interest | — | (16,669 | )  \nContingent consideration fair value adjustments | (150 | ) | (370 | )  \nAcquisition costs | 52 | 363  \nAmortization of acquired intangibles | 3,864 | 2,066  \nDepreciation expense | 845 | 779  \nAdjusted net income before provision for income taxes (non-GAAP) | $ | 14,784 | $ | 20,144  \n  \n**Fiscal First Quarter 2025 Financial Highlights**\n\n  * Revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased 9% to $2.72 billion from $2.48 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and increased 8% from $2.52 billion for the three months ended June 30, 2024.

For the three months ended June 30, 2024, approximately 92% of the new customers were attributable to the acquisition of a controlling interest in SGB\n  * Direct-to-Consumer active customers for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased 22% to 129,900 from 106,400 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, and increased 13% from 114,600 for the three months ended June 30, 2024. The increase in the number of active customers was primarily due to the Company acquiring a controlling interest in SGB in June 2024\n  * Direct-to-Consumer average order value for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased $527, or 22% to $2,967 from $2,440 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, and increased $77, or 3% from $2,890 for the three months ended June 30, 2024\n  * JM Bullion’s average order value for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased $41, or 2% to $2,198 from $2,239 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, and decreased $441, or 17% from $2,639 for the three months ended June 30, 2024. The decrease in the average order value is partially driven by a higher mix of silver vs. gold orders during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared with the previous periods noted\n\n\n\n**Fiscal First Quarter 2025 Financial Summary**\n\nRevenues increased 9% to $2.72 billion from $2.48 billion in the same year-ago quarter. Excluding an increase of $217.4 million of forward sales, our revenues increased $13.1 million, or 0.9%, which was due to higher average selling prices of gold and silver, partially offset by a decrease in gold and silver ounces sold.\n\nThe Direct-to-Consumer segment contributed 18% and 13% of the consolidated revenue in the fiscal first quarters of 2025 and 2024, respectively. JMB’s revenue represented 11% of the consolidated revenues for the fiscal first quarter of 2025 compared with 12% for the prior year fiscal first quarter.\n\nGross profit decreased 12% to $43.4 million (1.60% of revenue) from $49.4 million (1.99% of revenue) in the same year-ago quarter. The decrease in gross profit was due to lower gross profits earned from the Wholesale Sales & Ancillary Services segment, partially offset by an increase in gross profits earned by the Direct-to-Consumer segment. The Direct-to-Consumer segment contributed 54% and 43% of the consolidated gross profit in the fiscal first quarters of 2025 and 2024, respectively. Gross profit contributed by JMB represented 37% of the consolidated gross profit in the fiscal first quarter of 2025 and 36% of the consolidated gross profit for the prior year fiscal first quarter.\n\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased 22% to $26.6 million from $21.8 million in the same year-ago quarter. The change was primarily due to an increase in compensation expense (including performance-based accruals) of $2.6 million, higher advertising costs of $0.7 million, an increase in consulting and professional fees of $0.2 million, an increase in information technology costs of $0.2 million, and an increase in insurance costs of $0.2 million. SG&A expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 include $5.3 million of expenses incurred by LPM and SGB, our recently consolidated subsidiaries which were not included in our prior year Q1 results.\n\nDepreciation and amortization expense increased 69% to $4.7 million from $2.8 million in the same year-ago quarter. The change was primarily due to an increase in amortization expense of $2.2 million relating to intangible assets acquired through our acquisition of LPM and acquisition of a controlling interest in SGB, partially offset by a decrease in JMB intangible asset amortization of $0.5 million.\n\nInterest income increased 16% to $7.1 million from $6.1 million in the same year-ago quarter. The increase in interest income was primarily due to an increase in other finance product income of $0.6 million and an increase in interest income earned by our Secured Lending segment of $0.3 million.\n\nInterest expense increased 2% to $10.0 million from $9.8 million in the same year-ago quarter. The increase in interest expense was primarily due to an increase of $0.7 million associated with our Trading Credit Facility due to increased borrowings as well as an increase in interest rates and an increase of $0.7 million related to product financing arrangements, partially offset by a decrease of $1.4 million related to the AMCF Notes (including amortization of debt issuance costs) due to their repayment in December 2023.\n\nEarnings from equity method investments decreased 79% to $0.6 million from $2.7 million in the same year-ago quarter.

This includes press releases and other information about financial performance, reports filed or furnished with the SEC, information on corporate governance, and investor presentations.\n\n**Important Cautions Regarding Forward-Looking Statements** Statements in this press release that relate to future plans, objectives, expectations, performance, events and the like are \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These include statements regarding expectations with respect to future profitability and growth, international expansion, operational enhancements, and the amount or timing of any future dividends. Future events, risks and uncertainties, individually or in the aggregate, could cause actual results or circumstances to differ materially from those expressed or implied in these statements. Factors that could cause actual results to differ include the following: the failure to execute the Company’s growth strategy, including the inability to identify suitable or available acquisition or investment opportunities; greater than anticipated costs incurred to execute this strategy; government regulations that might impede growth, particularly in Asia; the inability to successfully integrate recently acquired businesses; changes in the current international political climate, which historically has favorably contributed to demand and volatility in the precious metals markets but also has posed certain risks and uncertainties for the Company, particularly in recent periods; potential adverse effects of the current problems in the national and global supply chains; increased competition for the Company’s higher margin services, which could depress pricing; the failure of the Company’s business model to respond to changes in the market environment as anticipated; changes in consumer demand and preferences for precious metal products generally; potential negative effects that inflationary pressure may have on our business; the inability of the Company to expand capacity at Silver Towne Mint; the failure of our investee companies to maintain, or address the preferences of, their customer bases; general risks of doing business in the commodity markets; and the strategic, business, economic, financial, political and governmental risks and other Risk Factors described in in the Company’s public filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nThe Company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements.\n\n**Use and Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures** In addition to presenting the Company’s financial results determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, management believes the following non-GAAP measures are useful in evaluating the Company’s operating performance: “adjusted net income before provision for income taxes” and “earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization” (“EBITDA”). Management believes the “adjusted net income before provision for income taxes” non-GAAP financial performance measure assists investors and analysts by facilitating comparison of period-to-period operational performance on a consistent basis by excluding items that management does not believe are indicative of the Company’s core operating performance. The items excluded from this financial measure may have a material impact on the Company’s financial results. Certain of those items are non-recurring, while others are non-cash in nature. Management believes the EBITDA non-GAAP liquidity measure assists investors and analysts by facilitating comparison of our business operations before investing activities, interest, and income taxes with other publicly traded companies. Non-GAAP measures do not have standardized definitions and should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for or superior to, the comparable measures prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and should be read in conjunction with the financial statements included in the Company’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q to be filed with the SEC. Management encourages investors and others to review the Company’s financial information in its entirety and not to rely on any single financial or liquidity measure.\n\nIn the Company’s reconciliation from its reported U.S. GAAP “net income before provision for income taxes” to its non-GAAP “adjusted net income before provision for income taxes”, the Company eliminates the impact of the following five amounts: acquisition expenses; amortization expenses related to intangible assets acquired; depreciation expense; remeasurement gains or losses; and contingent consideration fair value adjustments. The Company’s reconciliations from its reported U.S. GAAP “net income before provision for income taxes” to its non-GAAP “adjusted net income before provision for income taxes”, and “net income” and “net cash provided by (used in) operating activities” to its non-GAAP “EBITDA” are provided below and are also included in the Company’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q to be filed with the SEC for the quarterly period ended September 30, 2024.\n\n**Company Contact:** Steve Reiner, Executive Vice President, Capital Markets & Investor RelationsA-Mark Precious Metals, Inc.1-310-587-1410[sreiner@amark.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=g1JxuSH_6s3uKX4NXmZWswu8l2EUR3BN3JC3zl1tiUspCeMKm7GcY0ek6t4NNx9b5duJ_MTHKsbaraMn3Zd_D1pDbzmfSi8Y8wXnVY2G3mY=)\n\n**Investor Relations Contact:** Matt Glover or Greg BradburyGateway Group, Inc.1-949-574-3860[AMRK@gateway-grp.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=jJG35zzZQ0_2VPN4mqOiDOpBb4MViY6dVeJGakn1lEd6-u7YMlRSkbdAWtJRKCSfPq0lMNUAApfhJoLTzx5PSnozaIQhePKy25n9Oox4gLE=)\n\n**A-MARK PRECIOUS METALS, INC.

DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS\nOverview\nA-Mark, also referred to (together with its subsidiaries) as \"we\", \"us\" and the \"Company\", is a fully integrated precious metals\nplatform that offers an array of gold, silver, platinum, palladium, and copper bullion, numismatic coins, and related products to wholesale\nand retail customers via a portfolio of channels. The Company conducts its operations through three complementary segments:\nWholesale Sales & Ancillary Services, Direct-to-Consumer, and Secured Lending. A-Mark believes it has one of the largest customer\nbases in each of its markets and provides one of the most comprehensive offerings of products and services in the precious metals trading\nindustry. Our global customer base, spanning four continents, includes mints, manufacturers and fabricators, refiners, coin and bullion\ndealers, e-commerce retailers, banks and other financial institutions, commodity brokerage houses, industrial users of precious metals,\ninvestors, collectors, and retail customers.\nSpecifically, A-Mark:\n• operates as a wholesaler of gold, silver, platinum, and palladium bullion and related products, including bars, wafers, grain,\nand coins;\n• distributes gold and silver coins and bars from sovereign and private mints;\n• sells to and purchases from the retail community;\n• provides financing and other services relating to the purchase and sale of bullion and numismatics;\n• offers secure storage for precious metal products;\n• provides our customers a platform of turn-key logistics services; and\n• provides a variety of custom fabricated gold and silver bullion and other specialty products through sovereign and private\nmint suppliers and its mint operations.\nA-Mark believes its businesses largely function independently of the price movement of the underlying commodities. However,\nfactors such as global economic activity or uncertainty and inflationary trends, which affect market volatility, have the potential to\nimpact demand, supply, volumes, and margins.\nHistory\nA-Mark was founded in 1965 and has grown into a significant participant in the bullion and coin market. Over the years, A-Mark\nhas been steadily expanding its products and services. In 1986, A-Mark became an authorized purchaser of gold and silver bullion coins\nstruck by the United States Mint. Similar arrangements with other sovereign mints followed, so that by the early 1990s, A-Mark had\n(and continues to have) relationships with all major sovereign mints offering bullion coins and bars internationally. The Company\nbecame a publicly traded company in March 2014.\nIn 2005, the Company launched Collateral Finance Corporation (\"CFC\"), a wholly-owned subsidiary, for the purpose of making\nsecured loans primarily collateralized by bullion and numismatic material. Since then, CFC has expanded the value of its aggregate loan\nportfolio and number of its customers and also makes secured loans collateralized by graded sport cards. CFC has achieved its growth\nthrough both loan origination and acquisitions of loan portfolios from wholesale customers of A-Mark.\nThe Company opened an overseas office in Vienna, Austria in 2009, for the purpose of marketing A-Mark's goods and services\nin the international markets. The office operates through A-Mark Trading AG (\"AMTAG\"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company.\nIn 2012, the Company formed Transcontinental Depository Services, LLC. (\"TDS\"), a wholly-owned subsidiary, for the purpose of\nproviding customers with turn-key global storage solutions for their precious metal products.\nIn July 2015, the Company launched its Las Vegas-based logistics fulfillment center, A-M Global Logistics, LLC. (\"AMGL\" or\n\"Logistics\"), a wholly-owned subsidiary, for the purpose of providing our customers a platform of complementary services, including\npackaging, shipping, handling, receiving, processing, and inventorying of precious metals, custom coins, and graded sports cards on a\nsecure basis.\n4\nIn August 2016, the Company formed a joint venture, AM&ST Associates, LLC. (\"AMST\"), with SilverTowne, L.P., an Indiana-\nbased fabricator of silver bullion products, for the purpose of acquiring and operating SilverTowne, L.P.'s minting business unit (\"Silver\nTowne Mint\" or the \"Mint\"). Since the formation of AMST, the Company has invested in minting equipment and fabrication tools to\nexpand output capabilities, increase production efficiencies and improve product quality, and has leveraged the Mint’s fabrication\ncapabilities and coin die portfolio to expand our custom coin programs, as well as to introduce new custom products for individual\ncustomers. In April 2021, the Company purchased the 31% interest in AMST previously held by the joint venture partner and currently\nowns 100% of AMST.\nIn August 2017, the Company acquired substantially all of the assets of Goldline, LLC, a direct retailer of precious metals to the\ninvestor community, and now conducts those operations through its subsidiary Goldline, Inc. (\"Goldline\"). Goldline, LLC was formed\nin 1960 and became well-known to collectors and investors for its distribution of gold, silver, and platinum bullion coins and bars, in\npart, due to its television, radio, and internet marketing and customer service outreach. Since our acquisition, Goldline has expanded its\nproduct offerings and improved its delivery times.\nIn August 2019, Goldline entered into a joint venture agreement with a U.S. subsidiary of Silver Gold Bull, Inc. (\"SGB\") to form\nPrecious Metals Purchasing Partners, LLC (\"PMPP\"), primarily for the purpose of purchasing precious metals from the partners' retail\ncustomers for resale back into the marketplace. We currently own a controlling interest in PMPP, both through Goldline's 50% ownership\ninterest and through our majority ownership interest in SGB. PMPP commenced operations in fiscal 2020.\nIn September 2014, the Company made an initial equity investment in JM Bullion, Inc. (“JMB”), and in October 2016, we made\nan additional investment in JMB, increasing our equity interest to approximately 20.5%. In March 2021, the Company acquired the\n79.5% interest in JMB that we did not previously own. JMB is a leading e-commerce retailer providing access to a broad array of gold,\nsilver, copper, platinum, and palladium products through its own websites. In April 2022, JMB commercially launched the CyberMetals\nonline platform, where customers can purchase fractional ounces of digital gold, silver, platinum, and palladium in a range of\ndenominations, with the option to convert their digital holdings to fabricated precious metals products via an integrated redemption flow\nwith JMB. JMB owns and operates numerous websites targeting specific niches within the precious metals retail market, including\nJMBullion.com, ProvidentMetals.com, Silver.com, CyberMetals.com, GoldPrice.org, SilverPrice.org, BGASC.com, BullionMax.com,\nand Gold.com. JMB had approximately 2.4 million total customers as of June 30, 2024, and approximately 466,300 active customers\nfor the year ended June 30, 2024.\nIn April 2021, CFC Alternative Investments, LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of CFC, formed a joint venture with a third party\nknown as Collectible Card Partners, LLC, which was established for the purpose of making commercial loans collateralized by graded\nsports cards.\nIn February 2024, AM/LPM Ventures, LLC, a consolidated subsidiary of the Company, acquired LPM Group Limited (\"LPM\"),\none of Asia's largest precious metals dealers. AM/LPM Ventures, LLC serves as the Company's Asia headquarters. LPM extends A-\nMark's global reach by offering its full-service precious metals products and services in Asia and internationally.\nIn 2014, the Company acquired its initial ownership interest in SGB. In 2018 and 2022, the Company made incremental\ninvestments to increase its ownership interest in SGB to 47.4% as of June 2022. In June 2024, the Company acquired an additional 8%\nownership interest in SGB, increasing its ownership interest to 55.4%. Founded in 2009, SGB is a leading e-commerce precious metals\nretailer in Canada focused on providing online innovation, high-quality products, competitive pricing, and enhanced customer service.\nSGB had approximately 523,000 total customers as of June 30, 2024.\nThrough strategic relationships with its customers and suppliers and vertical integration across its markets, A-Mark seeks to grow\nits business volume, expand its presence in non-U.S. markets around the globe, and enlarge its offering of complementary products and\nservices. A-Mark seeks to continue its expansion by building on its strengths and what it perceives to be its competitive advantages.\nThese include:\n• integrated operations that span trading, distribution, logistics, minting, storage, hedging, financing, and consignment\nproducts and services;\n• an extensive and varied customer base that includes banks and other financial institutions, coin dealers, collectors, private\ninvestors, retail customers, investment advisors, industrial manufacturers, refiners, sovereign and private mints, and mines;\n• the ability to cost effectively acquire and retain new retail customers, with approximately 466,300 active customers on the\nJMB platform and approximately 15,600 active Goldline customers during the year ended June 30, 2024;\n• the ability to offer secured financing to customers;\n• our expertise in e-commerce and marketing;\n• secure storage and turn-key logistic services for precious metals products;\n• long-standing relationships with the United States Mint and other sovereign mints, including a working relationship with\nthe United States Mint of over 35 years;\n5\n• access to primary market makers, suppliers and refiners that, along with government mints, provide a dependable supply of\nprecious metals and precious metal products;\n• the ability to obtain more favorable pricing and financing terms due to our size;\n• minting operations and partnerships which produce silver bullion and custom coins, allowing for a ready response to\nchanging market demands;\n• the ability to design and fabricate proprietary silver products for customers;\n• the largest precious metals dealer network;\n• depository relationships in major financial centers around the world;\n• our global trading systems, coupled with experienced traders who also effectively manage A-Mark's exposure to commodity\nprice risk; and\n• a strong management team, with over 100 years of collective industry experience.\nAs part of our growth strategy, we are focused on:\n• Continuing to grow our consumer facing brands—We own numerous unique direct-to-consumer brands and have partial\nownership interests in four additional consumer facing brands. Each of these brands has a differentiated market positioning\nand target customer demographic, which allows us to tailor our merchandising, pricing, and advertising strategies to\nmaximize the growth and profitability of each brand. We plan to continue to invest in the Direct-to-Consumer segment, to\nfacilitate both the acquisition of new customers and the retention of our existing customers.\n• Cross-selling existing A-Mark products and services to JMB customers—As of June 30, 2024, JMB had approximately 2.4\nmillion total customers and 466,300 active customers. We believe there are continued opportunities to offer new products\nand services provided by A-Mark to this customer base, including new, proprietary minted precious metals products, secure\nstorage and logistics.\n• Leveraging our minting capabilities to sell additional proprietary products—We have long-standing relationships with the\nUnited States Mint and other major international sovereign mints. We also own one mint, Silver Towne, and have a\nnoncontrolling interest in another mint. We leverage our relationships with these mints to offer proprietary products to our\nwholesale and direct-to-consumer customers. The growth in our direct-to-consumer customer base allows us to increase the\nnumber of proprietary products we design, source, and ultimately sell.\n• Expanding our global footprint—We currently serve customers on four continents. Although the majority of our current\nsales are to customers located in the United States, in addition to acquiring LPM in February 2024 and a controlling interest\nin SGB in June 2024, we believe there is a meaningful opportunity to continue to expand our capabilities in order to offer\nadditional products and services to customers in Canada, Europe, and Asia.\n• Leveraging technology to deliver new products and increased services to customers—We are dedicating significant time\nand resources to enhance our technology platform and capabilities across all aspects of our business. We intend to develop\nnew digital products that will allow customers to more easily buy, sell, and arrange for storage of physical metal products\nthrough a mobile interface. We also intend to continue to improve our customer interfaces to allow more seamless order\nprocessing, better cross-selling of products and services across our business units, to increase our new customer targeting\nand acquisition strategies, and to further improve our fulfillment and inventorying capabilities.\n• Pursuing strategic investments and acquisitions—Since our initial investment in JMB in 2014, we have acquired Goldline,\nmade minority investments in several additional consumer facing precious metals retailers, acquired the entire equity interest\nin JMB, acquired new brands which we have fully integrated into JMB, acquired the entire equity interest in Silver Towne\nMint, acquired a noncontrolling interest in a private mint, and recently acquired LPM in February 2024 and a controlling\ninterest in SGB in June 2024. We intend to continue to evaluate new investment and acquisition opportunities that allow us\nto broaden our product offerings, allow us to better serve our existing customer base, enter new geographic regions and\ntarget new customer demographics.\nBusiness Segments\nThe Company conducts its operations in three reportable segments: (i) Wholesale Sales & Ancillary Services, (ii) Direct-to-\nConsumer, and (iii) Secured Lending. See Note 19 to the Company’s consolidated financial statements for further information regarding\nour reportable segments.\n6\nWholesale Sales & Ancillary Services\nA-Mark operates through several business units that comprise the Wholesale Sales & Ancillary Services segment, including\nIndustrial, Coin and Bar, Trading and Finance, Storage, Logistics, and Mint.\nIndustrial. Our Industrial unit sells gold, silver, platinum, and palladium to industrial and commercial users. Customers include\ncoin fabricators such as mints and industrial manufacturers, encompassing electronics and component parts companies and refiners.\nDepending on the intended usage, the metals are either investment or industrial grade and are generally in the form of bars or grains.\nCoin and Bar. Our Coin and Bar unit deals in approximately 2,100 different products, including gold and silver coins from around\nthe world and gold, silver, platinum and palladium bars and ingots in a variety of weights, shapes, and sizes. Our customers include coin\nand bullion dealers, banks and other financial institutions, commodity brokerage houses, manufacturers, investors, investment advisors,\nand collectors who qualify as “eligible commercial entities” and “eligible contract participants,” as those terms are defined in the\nCommodity Exchange Act.\nWe are an authorized distributor (and, in the case of the United States Mint, an authorized purchaser) of gold and silver coins for\nall of the major sovereign mints and various private mints. The sovereign mints include the United States Mint, the Australian (Perth)\nMint, the Austrian Mint, the Royal Canadian Mint, the China Mint, Banco de Mexico, the South African Mint (Rand Refinery) and the\nRoyal Mint (United Kingdom). We purchase and take delivery of coins from the mints for resale to coin dealers, financial institutions,\nand other qualified purchasers.\nOur distribution and purchase agreements with the mints are non-exclusive and may be terminated by the mints at any time,\nalthough in practice our relationships with the mints are long-standing, in some cases, as with the United States Mint, extending back\nfor over 35 years. In some cases, we have developed exclusive products with sovereign and private mints for distribution through our\ndealer network.\nIn our Industrial and Coin and Bar units, orders are taken telephonically and on an electronic trading platform that can be accessed\nby qualified wholesale customers at www.amark.com. Pricing is generally based on screen quotes for bullion transactions in the spot\nmarket, with two-day settlement, although special pricing and extended settlement terms are also available. Almost all customers in\nthese units take physical delivery of the precious metal. Product is shipped upon receipt of payment, except where the purchase is\nfinanced under credit arrangements between A-Mark and the customer. We have relationships with precious metal depositories around\nthe world to facilitate shipment of product from our inventory to the customer, in many cases for next day delivery. Product may either\nbe shipped to the customer's location or delivered to a depository or other storage facility designated by the customer. The Company\nalso periodically loans metals to customers on a short-term consignment basis and may charge interest fees based on the value of the\nmetals loaned.\nTrading and Finance. Our Trading and Finance units engage in commodity hedging as well as borrowing and lending transactions\nin support of our Industrial and Coin and Bar units.\nThe Trading unit hedges the commodity risk on A-Mark's inventory in order to protect A-Mark from market price fluctuations.\nA-Mark maintains relationships with major market-makers and multiple futures brokers in order to provide a variety of alternatives for\nits hedging needs. Our traders employ a combination of future and forward contracts to hedge our market exposure. Because it seeks to\nsubstantially hedge its market exposure, A-Mark believes that its business largely functions independently of the price movements of\nthe underlying commodities. Through its hedging activities, A-Mark may also earn contango yields, in which futures price are higher\nthan the current spot prices, or backwardation yields, in which futures prices are lower than the spot prices. A-Mark also offers precious\nmetals price quotes in a number of foreign currencies.\nOur Finance unit engages in precious metals borrowing and lending transactions and other customized financial transactions with\nor on behalf of our customers and other counterparties. These arrangements range from simple hedging structures to complex inventory\nfinance arrangements and forward purchase and sale structures, tailored to the needs of our customers.\nStorage. Our Transcontinental Depository Services, LLC (\"TDS\") subsidiary provides storage solutions for precious metals and\nnumismatic coins for financial institutions, dealers, investors, and collectors worldwide. TDS contracts on behalf of our clients with\nindependent secure storage facilities in the United States, Canada, Europe, Singapore, and Hong Kong, for either fully segregated or\nallocated storage. We assist our clients in developing appropriate storage options for their particular requirements, and we manage the\noperational aspects of the storage with the third-party facilities on our clients' behalf. TDS's marketing efforts are conducted both in\nconjunction with A-Mark's trading operations and independently, including through its dedicated website www.tdsvaults.com.\nLogistics. Our A-M Global Logistics, LLC (\"Logistics\") subsidiary, located in Las Vegas, Nevada, supports our Wholesale Sales\nbusiness by providing a significant amount of the secured storage and shipping and delivery services that had historically been\noutsourced to third-party depositories in their various locations. By consolidating those operations into one central location under our\ncontrol, we reduced our dependence on third-party service providers while enhancing quality control and reducing operating costs.\nLogistics also provides turn-key logistics services to our customers engaged in the retail business. We provide these customers inventory\nhandling, packaging, storage, and drop-shipping services.\n7\nAMTAG. Our A-Mark Trading AG (\"AMTAG\") subsidiary promotes the Company's products and services to certain international\nmarkets.\nMint. Through its AMST subsidiary, the Company owns the minting operations of the Silver Towne Mint (or the \"Mint\"),\nproviding greater product selection to our customers and greater pricing stability within the supply chain, as well as increased access to\nfabricated silver products during volatile market environments. A-Mark has leveraged Silver Towne Mint’s fabrication capabilities to\nintroduce new custom products for individual customers.\nAlthough the Company is the Mint’s primary customer, the Mint also markets its products at www.silvertownemint.com. In March\n2023, the Mint achieved ISO 9000:2015 certification which allows all products produced by the Mint to be accepted into individual\nretirement accounts (\"IRA\").\nLPM. Based in Hong Kong, LPM serves as the Company's Asia headquarters, offering the Company's full-service precious metals\nproducts and services in Asia and internationally. LPM has a large numismatics showroom in the heart of Hong Kong's Central Financial\nDistrict.\nDirect-to-Consumer\nThe Company operates its Direct-to-Consumer segment through its wholly-owned subsidiaries JM Bullion, Inc. (“JMB”) and\nGoldline, Inc. (“Goldline”), and through its investment in Silver Gold Bull, Inc. (\"SGB\"). The Company’s Direct-to-Consumer segment\nexpands the Company’s distribution capabilities with a retail distribution channel. It diversifies the products and services offered to the\nCompany’s retail customers by providing them access to the Company’s wider assortment of precious metal coins and bars, as well as\nTDS’s storage and asset protection services.\nJMB\nJMB is a leading internet retailer of precious metal products that it sells through its proprietary websites.\nProducts. JMB’s products consist primarily of coins, rounds, and bars. Coins are minted by a sovereign government, are legal\ncurrency and have a face value, although the face value is typically less than the value of their precious metal content. Rounds are coin-\nlike objects with thematic designs minted by private mints, have no face value and are not legal currency, and their value is solely based\nupon their precious metal content. Bars are ingot-shaped precious metal objects that are usually produced by private mints. Like rounds,\nbars have no face value, are not legal currency and are valued based on their precious metal content. Coins, rounds, and bars are made\nfrom silver, gold, platinum, or palladium and in some cases copper. JMB occasionally sells jewelry products fashioned around coins or\nrounds as well.\nJMB offers over 6,000 different products, measured by stock keeping units or SKUs, on its websites during a fiscal year. This\nnumber can vary over time, particularly when demand is high. As a service to its customers, JMB makes available for sale on its websites\nprotective accessories for precious metal products, including acrylic coin holders and capsules, coin tubes and silver bar tubes.\nJMB owns and operates numerous websites targeting specific niches within the precious metals retail market, including\nJMBullion.com, ProvidentMetals.com, Silver.com, CyberMetals.com, GoldPrice.org, SilverPrice.org, BGASC.com, BullionMax.com,\nand Gold.com. GoldPrice.org and SilverPrice.org publish data on precious metal and cryptocurrency pricing and generate leads for its\nother websites.\nThrough the CyberMetals online platform, customers can purchase and sell fractional shares of digital gold, silver, platinum, and\npalladium bars in a range of denominations. CyberMetals’ customers have the option to convert their digital holdings to fabricated\nprecious metals products via an integrated redemption flow with JMB. These products may be designated for storage by the Company\nor shipped directly to the customer.\nCustomers may order product on each of the JMBullion.com, BGASC.com, BullionMax.com, ProvidentMetals.com and\nSilver.com websites. While each of these sites appeals to a different customer clientele and may from time to time have slightly different\nproduct offerings, all orders are processed in the same manner. Customers may place their orders online, or they may use the toll-free\ntelephone number available on the websites to order through a customer representative. The SilverPrice.org and GoldPrice.org websites\nprovide real time price information on silver, gold, and cryptocurrencies. We also own the gold.com domain, one of the most\nrecognizable domains in the precious metals industry. Although customers cannot order product on these websites, the websites direct\nvisitors to JMBullion.com for placing orders.\nJMB utilizes an internally developed search engine optimization strategy to drive traffic to its websites, particularly to\nJMBullion.com. JMB also pays for placement on the major search engines, including Google, Bing, Apple, and Yahoo!, employing\ninternally developed strategies to reach a targeted audience and to optimize the cost effectiveness of paid for searches.\n8\nJMB's Direct-to-Consumer Purchase Program. JMB also offers to purchase precious metal products through its websites. With\nthis program, JMB provides collectors of precious metal products with a means to dispose of their holdings at transparent and competitive\nprices. Generally, JMB will indicate on its websites the products that it is interested in purchasing, and a collector seeking to sell such\nproducts may arrange the sale online. Alternatively, the collector may call a customer representative using the toll-free number on the\nwebsite and arrange a sale by telephone.\nThe Direct-to-Consumer Purchase Program is a source of inventory for JMB, which enables JMB to acquire product for resale at\na discount to dealer prices.\nLogistics. The Company's main distribution facility in Las Vegas, Nevada, together with its ancillary facility in Dallas, Texas,\nhandle the back end logistics for the Company's Direct-to-Consumer Purchase Program and the secured storage for CyberMetals'\nprecious metals.\nGoldline\nGoldline, acquired by the Company in August 2017, is a direct retailer of precious metals to the investor community. Goldline\nmarkets its precious metal products on television, radio, podcasts, and the internet, as well as through customer service outreach,\nparticularly to Goldline’s repeat customers. Online orders are taken on an electronic trading platform that can be accessed by qualified\nretail customers at www.goldline.com.\nGoldline customers are required to enter into an account agreement that specifies the terms and conditions of purchase and explains\nthe availability of certain programs and services offered by Goldline to its customers.\nProducts. Goldline offers a variety of products from gold, silver, and platinum bullion in the form of bars and coins, as well as\nrare coins.\nGoldline's and SGB's Direct-to-Consumer Purchase Program. Through Precious Metals Purchasing Partners, LLC (\"PMPP\"), a\njoint venture between Goldline and SGB, Goldline and SGB acquire precious metals from their retail customers in order to diversify\ntheir supply of product offerings and provide discounted pricing to their affiliates. This program provides Goldline's and SGB's\ncustomers with a means to monetize their holdings efficiently and at competitive prices.\nIntellectual Property. AM IP Assets, LLC (\"AMIP\"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Goldline, manages certain intellectual\nproperty of Goldline, including customer lists and a sales lead data base.\nSGB\nThe Company acquired its initial ownership interest in SGB in 2014, increasing its investment to 55.4% in June 2024. SGB is a\nleading e-commerce precious metals retailer in Canada. The Company's investment in SGB expands the Company's direct-to-consumer\nfootprint in the international market.\nThrough its website, SilverGoldBull.com, SGB offers a variety of products from gold, silver, platinum, and palladium bars, coins\nand rounds, as well as certified coins from mints around the world.\nSecured Lending\nThe Company operates its Secured Lending segment through its wholly-owned subsidiary, CFC, which in turn owned AM Capital\nFunding, LLC (“AMCF”). CFC has been operating since fiscal year 2005; AMCF was dissolved in June 2024. CFC Alternative\nInvestments, LLC (“CAI”), a subsidiary of CFC, is a party to a joint venture known as Collectible Card Partners, LLC (“CCP”), which\nwas formed for the purpose of making commercial loans collateralized by graded sports cards.\nCFC is a California licensed finance lender that, directly and through its subsidiaries, originates and acquires commercial loans\nsecured by bullion, numismatic coins, and graded sports cards. CFC's customers include coin and precious metal dealers, investors, and\ncollectors. As of June 30, 2024, the aggregate balance of CFC's secured loans was approximately $113.1 million which is comprised of\napproximately 15% of loans acquired from third-parties and approximately 85% of loans originated by CFC.\nAMCF was a special purpose entity whose sole activity consisted of operating, owning, and financing precious metal inventory\nthrough the issuance of notes (the “AMCF Notes”). In December 2023, the AMCF Notes were repaid and AMCF was dissolved in June\n2024. AMCF Notes were primarily payable from, and secured by, (i) precious metals obtained by AMCF, (ii) a portfolio of bullion loans\ncollateralized by precious metals, which loans were originated by either CFC or acquired by CFC from third parties and conveyed by\nCFC to AMCF, and (iii) cash. The indenture governing the AMCF Notes required AMCF to maintain a specified level of collateral. The\nindenture also provided that AMCF’s assets were not to be commingled with those of CFC or A-Mark (or any affiliate) and that AMCF\nwas to maintain separate books and records.\n9\nGeneral. The secured loans that CFC issues consist of on-demand loans and loans with a term of three months to 364 days, with\na typical term of approximately six months. Repayment of the loans can be made at any time without penalty. Because the loans are of\nrelatively short duration, CFC does not have significant exposure to interest rate fluctuations, even in a rising interest rate environment.\nLoans carried by CFC range in size up to approximately $14.0 million.\nAll loans are fully secured by bullion, numismatic coins, graded sports cards, or other eligible alternative investment assets. TDS,\non behalf of CFC, takes physical custody of the coins or bullion collateralizing the loans. CFC requires loan-to-value (\"LTV\") ratios of\nbetween 50% and 85%. LTV ratio refers to the principal amount of the loan divided by the liquidation value of the collateral, as\nconservatively estimated by CFC for numismatic loans and based on daily spot market prices for bullion loans. The LTV ratio varies\nwith the nature of the collateral, with CFC allowing, for example, a higher LTV ratio for bullion than for rare coins. If, because of\nfluctuations in the market price of the pledged collateral, the LTV ratio on a loan increases above a prescribed maximum ratio, typically\n85%, CFC can make a margin call on the loan. If the borrower does not meet the margin call, either by wiring payment or supplying\nadditional collateral, CFC is authorized to sell the collateral, which it does through its A-Mark affiliates. CFC has never experienced\nlosses of principal on its loans.\nOrigination Activity. CFC's origination activities are complementary to the Company’s coin and bullion businesses and afford our\ncustomers a convenient means of financing their inventory or collections. CFC also attempts to leverage the worldwide storage\ncapabilities of its TDS affiliate by offering clients TDS’s asset protection services in connection with the loans. CFC’s marketing efforts\nfor its origination activity are conducted both in conjunction with A-Mark's trading operations, particularly with respect to dealers, and\nindependently, including though its dedicated website www.cfcgoldloans.com. Interest rates on loans originated by CFC are determined\nbased on current market conditions, borrower profile and type or mix of collateral. CFC also offers a variety of custom loan services to\nits origination clients, including renewal options, options to increase loan size, financing arrangements tailored to facilitate participation\nin numismatic auctions, and revolving loan arrangements. CFC services the loans that it originates.\nAcquisition Activity. CFC also acquires portfolios of loans secured by bullion and numismatics coins from third-party originators.\nThe loans acquired by CFC are sold subject to customary representations and warranties for loan portfolios of this type and must comply\nwith CFC’s criteria for quality of collateral, LTV ratio, term and interest rate. Upon acquisition of a loan portfolio, CFC takes physical\npossession of the collateral securing the loans. In the event that a loan is non-performing, we will typically liquidate the collateral on\nbehalf of the originator in order to retire the loan. Typically, loan portfolios acquired by CFC are serviced by the originator for a fee.\nFinancing Activity. CFC has historically financed its loan origination and acquisition activity primarily through A-Mark's demand\nline of credit with a syndicate of several financial institutions.\nLiquidity\nOur business depends substantially on our ability to obtain financing for our operations. Sources of cash generated from operating\nactivities include receipts upon the sales of precious metals, and cash collected from interest payments on secured loans.\nSources of cash provided by financing activities are our uncommitted line of credit, fixed interest rate notes, and other structured\nfinancing products. The Company’s line of credit provides it with the liquidity to buy and sell billions of dollars of precious metals\nannually, and is used to fund a substantial portion of the operations of the Company. As of June 30, 2024, A-Mark's uncommitted line\nof credit provided access up to $422.5 million. The maturity date of the credit facility is September 2025.\nThe Company also generates funds from other finance products that include product financing arrangements with customers,\nwhereby the Company sells its inventory with an option to repurchase, and through precious metal borrowing and leasing arrangements\nwith its suppliers.\nWe periodically purchase our own common stock that is traded on public markets as part of our announced stock repurchase\nprogram. See more information regarding our share repurchase program in Part II, Item 5 of this Annual Report.\nMarket Making Activity\nWe act as a principal market maker, maintaining a two-way market for buying and selling precious metals. This means we both\nsell product to and purchase product from our customers.\nMaterial Resources\nWe maintain a substantial inventory of bullion and coins in order to provide our customers with selection and prompt delivery.\nWe acquire product for our inventory in the course of our trading activities with our customers, directly from government and private\nmints, mines, and refiners, and from commodities brokers and dealers, privately and in transactions on established commodity\nexchanges.\n10\nA-Mark’s precious metals inventories are subject to market value changes created by change in the underlying commodity price,\nas well as supply and demand of the individual products the Company trades. Our inventory is marked-to-market daily for accounting\nand financial reporting purposes, except for a relatively insignificant amount of inventory that is accounted for at lower of cost or net\nrealizable value. A-Mark’s policy is to remain substantially hedged as to its inventory position and its individual sale and purchase\ncommitments. A-Mark seeks to minimize the effect of price changes of the underlying commodity through the use of financial derivative\ninstruments, such as forward and futures contracts.\nSales and Marketing\nWe market our products and services to our wholesale customers primarily through our offices in El Segundo, California, Hong\nKong, and Vienna, Austria, our websites, and our dealer network, which we believe is the largest of its kind. The dealer network consists\nof approximately 1,200 independent precious metal and coin companies, with whom we transact on a non-exclusive basis. The\narrangements with the dealers vary, but generally the dealers acquire product from us for resale to their customers. In some instances,\nwe deliver bullion to the dealers on a consignment basis. We also participate from time to time in trade shows and conventions, at which\nwe promote our products and services. As a vertically integrated precious metals company, a key element of our marketing strategy is\nbeing able to cross-sell our products and services to customers within our various business units.\nJMB and SGB market their products over the internet through their proprietary websites, using an internally developed search\noptimization strategy and paid placements with major search engines. Goldline reaches its retail customer base on television, radio, and\nthe internet, as well as through customer service outreach.\nWe market our secured loan products and services to customers primarily through our proprietary websites, print advertising, and\nstrategic partnerships.\nOperational Support\nThe Wholesale Sales & Ancillary Services segment maintains administrative and operational support related to its trading,\nhedging, and finance product operations at its global headquarters in El Segundo, California and regional headquarters in Hong Kong.\nWe believe that our existing administrative and operational support infrastructure has the capacity to scale with our business activities.\nWe store our inventories of bullion and numismatics at third-party depositories in major financial centers around the world and at our\nsecured facility in Las Vegas, Nevada.\nThe Direct-to-Consumer segment maintains administrative and operational support at its offices in Dallas, Texas, Los Angeles,\nCalifornia, and Calgary, Canada for originating and processing its retail orders. The Company's Trading, Finance, and Logistics business\nunits provide supporting services such as hedging and order fulfillment.\nThe Secured Lending segment maintains administrative support at its headquarters in El Segundo, California for the processing\nof its originated loans, including billing, managing margin calls, and tracking of precious metal collateral. For the processing and\nadministration of loans that are acquired from a third party (which may be a customer of A-Mark), customer invoices are typically\nprocessed by the originating dealer of the loan portfolio through a fee-based servicing arrangement. Collateral custody and security is\nmanaged by our Logistics business unit.\nCustomer Concentrations\nFor the year ended June 30, 2024, we had one customer that comprised more than 10% of our revenues. See Note 18 to the\nCompany’s consolidated financial statements. The Company's largest customers generally are engaged with us in significant forward\ncontract sales activity (as opposed to those customers with whom we principally have physical trading activity), which are entered into\nin order to hedge the Company's commodity holding risks, and not for speculative purposes.\nCompetition\nA-Mark's activities cover a broad spectrum of the precious metals industry, with a concentration on the physical market. We\nservice public, industrial, and private sector consumers of precious metals which include industrial manufacturers, refiners, minting\nfacilities, banks, brokerage houses, and private investors. We frequently face different competitors in each area, and it is not uncommon\nfor a customer and/or a supplier in one market segment to be a competitor in another.\nOur Direct-to-Consumer segment competes with numerous online and other retailers of direct-to-consumer precious metal\nproducts. The principal competitors of JMB include APMEX, SD Bullion, and Bullion Exchanges. Competition is based primarily on\nprice and customer service, including the ability to offer same day shipping. To a lesser extent, competition is also based on product\navailability, although all major ecommerce retailers will typically stock the products that are most in demand.\nOur Secured Lending segment's market is believed to have limited direct competition. We believe factors, including access to\ncapital, secure storage facilities, bullion and numismatic expertise, and other related services and offerings, provide us a competitive\nadvantage in that marketplace.\n11\nSeasonality and Other Factors Influencing Demand\nOur business is generally not seasonal, although demand in the retail market tends to be lower in the summer months. On the other\nhand, we believe our business is directly impacted by the perception of market trends and global economic activity. Historically, higher\nlevels of demand for precious metals are brought on during periods of macroeconomic uncertainty. Typically, factors that impact such\nuncertainty and correlate with a higher level of demand for precious metals include volatility in the equity markets, increases in rates of\ninflation, and the weakening of the U.S. dollar.\nCompliance with Government Regulations\nWe are subject to a variety of domestic and foreign laws that relate particularly to our business. Because of the nature and value\nof the precious metal products in which deal, we must be careful to assure compliance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and a\nvariety of anti-money laundering and know-your-customer rules in response to the USA Patriot Act, and similar foreign statutory\nregimes.\nBy reason of our direct-to-consumer business in particular, we collect personal data and are subject to European General Data\nProtection Regulation, the California Consumer Privacy Act and similar domestic and foreign statutes that address the collection, use\nand monitoring of such data. We continue to devote substantial resources to comply with these laws and regulations.\nOur CFC financing subsidiary operates under a California Finance Lenders License issued by the California Department of\nFinancial Protection and Innovation. CFC is required to submit a finance lender law annual report to the state which summarizes certain\nloan portfolio and financial information regarding CFC, which are subject to audit.\nHuman Capital\nThe efforts and expertise of our team members are critical to our success. We are devoted to the attraction, development, and\nretention of our employees, which enable us to deliver a high level of service to our customers. Because we have a small number of\nemployees, and certain of our subsidiaries are geographically dispersed as a result of various acquisitions as well as from internal growth,\nour focus is on maintaining a relationship-based and collaborative work environment within each of our geographical locations. For the\nmost part, our operating businesses are authorized to establish specific policies and practices concerning the attraction and retention of\nperson in their organizations, addressing, among other things: maintaining a safe work environment for employees, customers and other\nbusiness partners, offering competitive compensation and benefits to employees, and hiring practices intended to identify qualified\ncandidates and promote diversity and inclusion in the workforce.\nAt the same time, we recognize the importance of “Tone at the Top”, and we have adopted company-wide corporate governance\npolicies and procedures which emphasize accountability, transparency, fairness, and responsibility. A-Mark’s senior management is\nresponsible for establishing and monitoring A-Mark’s corporate governance practices, including monitoring governance efforts at each\nlocation, and participating in the resolution of governance-related issues as needed. A-Mark’s Code of Business Conduct and Ethics\nemphasizes, among other things, the commitment to ethics and compliance with the law and provides basic standards for ethical and\nlegal behavior of all its employees.\nAs of June 30, 2024, the Company had 489 employees, with 439 located in North America, 48 located in Asia, and 2 located in\nEurope; all except 7 of these employees were considered full-time employees. Our overall employee retention rate for the year ended\nJune 30, 2024 was 83%; excluding the Mint and Logistics operations, which hire largely in response to fluctuating business demands,\nour retention rate was 93%. For the companies we have owned for more than five years, the percentage of employees who have more\nthan five years of service was 36%. For the companies we have owned and operated for less than five years, the percentage of employees\nwho have continued their employment since the respective acquisition dates was 73%.\nA-Mark is committed to supporting our employees’ financial, mental, and physical well-being. Across our various companies, we\noffer competitive pay and benefits, including annual short-term incentive awards and long-term equity awards, an employee savings\n401(k) plan and company matching contributions, health insurance, disability insurance, life insurance, health savings and flexible\nspending accounts, wellness incentives, paid time off, family leave, parental leave, and employee assistance programs.\nA-Mark provides equal employment opportunities to all qualified individuals without regard to race, color, religion, sex, gender\nidentity, sexual orientation, pregnancy, age, national origin, physical or mental disability, military or veteran status, genetic information,\nor any other protected classification. Equal employment opportunity includes, but is not limited to, hiring, training, promotion, demotion,\ntransfer, leaves of absence, and termination. The diversity of our workforce is essential, and we are committed to diversity and inclusion\nthroughout the Company to ensure a wide range of experiences, perspectives, and skills to provide better solutions, drive innovation and\ncreativity, and enhance decision making. As of June 30, 2024, approximately 34% of our employees identified as female, and 46% of\nour employees were made up of underrepresented minorities.\n12\nCorporate Information\nOur executive offices are located at 2121 Rosecrans Avenue, Suite 6300, El Segundo CA 90245.

RISK FACTORS\nSummary of Risk Factors\nThe following summary provides an overview of the material risks we are exposed to in the normal course business. This risk\nfactor summary does not contain all of the information that may be important to you, and you should read these together with the more\ndetailed discussion of risks set forth following this section, as well as elsewhere in this report under the heading “Management’s\nDiscussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” Additional risks beyond those summarized below, or\ndiscussed elsewhere in “Risk Factors” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,”\nmay apply to our activities or operations as currently conducted or as we may conduct them in the future, or to the markets in which we\ncurrently operate or may in the future operate.\n• Preferences and perceptions regarding ownership of precious metals may change.\n• We may not be successful in responding to changing market realities, particularly in our direct-to-consumer business.\n• Our business is heavily dependent on our credit facility, and the failure to renew or replace this credit facility could limit\nour ability to conduct our business and have other adverse consequences.\n• We provide a variety of financing alternatives to our customers, and there is no assurance that the methods we use to\nminimize losses on the credit we extend will be sufficient.\n• Liquidity constraints may limit our ability to grow our business.\n• Interruptions to us in the supply of coin and bullion products that we sell or silver for our minting operations could result\nin our inability to satisfy our customers and loss of sales.\n• We are dependent on key management, particularly our CEO, Mr. Greg Roberts.\n• We are dependent on our computer systems for executing trades and conducting our direct-to-consumer business, and\nbreaches, damage and malfunctions affecting these systems could interrupt our ability to conduct our business.\n• Because our business is dependent on the volatility and pricing of precious metals, we are likely to be influenced by world\nevents more than businesses in other economic sectors.\n• The level of growth and profitability that we experienced as a consequence of the uncertainties and volatility in the\nfinancial markets during the last several years may not be attainable in future periods, as global circumstances change.\n• We derive a significant portion of our business outside the United States, and are subject to the risk of foreign operations,\nparticularly in the Peoples Republic of China as a result of our recent LPM acquisition.\n• Our Wholesale Sales and Ancillary Services segment is dependent on our relationships with government mints.\n• Our mint operations are subject to the risk of catastrophic loss and other business interruptions.\n• Our Wholesale Sales and Ancillary Services segment is dependent on a concentrated customer base.\n• Because retail investors are more vulnerable to economic loss, we may be subject to claims of unfair business practices\nthat could subject us to government enforcement actions.\n• Our Direct-to Consumer segment is subject to intense competition from other online retailers, traditional coin stores and\ngeneral online merchandisers.\n• Our strategy for growing our direct-to-consumer business includes acquisitions that may be unsuccessful.\n• JMB’s search engine optimization (SEO) has provided it with a competitive advantage, but its competitors are improving\ntheir own SEO strategies which may reduce JMB’s advantage.\n13\n• Our Direct-to-Consumer segment must be able to effectively respond to changes in technology and could make\ntechnological missteps.\n• The performance of our Secured Lending Segment is subject to our ability to maintain, through origination or acquisition,\na loan portfolio of sufficient size, but we may not be able to do so.\n• The growth of Secured Lending segment is likely to require significant resources, that we may determine are better\napplied elsewhere in our business.\n• Our business is heavily influenced by volatility in commodity prices, so that our results may vary considerably from\nperiod-to-period.\n• We hedge the value of our precious metals inventory against changes in commodity prices, but the hedges may prove\nineffective, and we are at risk of default by our counterparties.\n• If commodity prices were to rise significantly, we would be able to carry less inventory, which would adversely affect our\nability to service our customers.\n• The Commodities Trading Futures Commission has in the past brought an action against us and may seek to regulate our\nbusiness activities.\n• Recently enacted rules in California and the European Union, and by the SEC, will require us to spend considerable time\nand resources on environmental reporting.\n• Our direct-to-consumer business collects personal data and information, and as a consequence we are subject to a growing\nnumber of complex data protection and privacy statutes, whose violation could subject us to sanctions.\n• Because we ship products throughout the United States, we are subject to laws requiring us to collect out-of-state sales\ntax, and we could have liability if we fail to comply.\n• Our Direct-to-Consumer segment relies on lead providers and other marketing affiliates to generate sales, but these\narrangements have been subject to regulatory challenges and in some cases have been terminated.\n• Our consumer advertising and marketing materials are subject to regulation, and consistent with the retailing industry\ngenerally are coming under increasing scrutiny.\n• Our board of directors has adopted a policy of paying regular cash dividends, but there is no assurance that dividends will\nbe paid in the future.\n• Our shareholders’ equity interest in the Company could be diluted by future issuances of stock, including in connection\nwith acquisitions and minority investments.\n• Our board and management own approximately 22% of our outstanding common stock, and acting together can exert\nsubstantial influence over matters submitted to stockholders for their vote.\nIntroductory Risks\nThe demand for our products and our profitability ultimately depends on preferences and perceptions regarding the desirability of\nowning precious metals, but those preferences and perceptions are subject to change.\nWhile the Company operates at both the wholesale and direct-to-consumer levels, the demand for our products is dependent upon\nthe perceptions and preferences in the global market regarding the ownership of precious metals and numismatics. These perceptions\nand preferences depend on a variety of factors, including world events (as discussed more fully below), business and economic\nconditions, inflationary and other currency related trends and alternative investment opportunities. All such factors may change over\ntime and as a consequence the results of our operations, profitability and stock price may vary over both the short and the long term.\nWe regularly seek to innovate and to anticipate market changes, but there is no assurance that we will be successful in doing so.\nWe are alert to the special sensitivity of our business to economic, social and political trends and events, and we attempt to project\ntheir effects on our business over the long term. For example, we have placed increasing emphasis on our direct-to-consumer business,\nin anticipation that the economic uncertainties, market volatilities and global challenges that we face will continue to make investment\nin precious metals and numismatics more attractive to individual consumers. There can be no assurance, however, that we will be correct\nin our assessments of market trends or evolving business and consumer preferences, or that, even if our judgments are correct, our\nresponse to projected trends and preferences will be timely or effective. Moreover, because of the sensitivity of our business to macro-\neconomic, social and political circumstances, there may be no effective strategy to insulate us from the adverse effects that these\ncircumstances could have on our business.\n14\nRisks Relating to our Operations\nOur business is heavily dependent on our credit facility.\nOur business depends substantially on our ability to obtain financing for our operations. On December 21, 2021, we entered into\na committed facility provided by a syndicate of financial institutions (the “Trading Credit Facility”), with a total current revolving\ncommitment of up to $422.5 million and with a termination date of September 20, 2025. The Trading Credit Facility provides the\nCompany with the liquidity to buy and sell billions of dollars of precious metals annually. A-Mark routinely uses funds drawn under the\nTrading Credit Facility to purchase metals from its suppliers and for operating cash flow purposes. Our CFC subsidiary also uses the\nfunds drawn under the Trading Credit Facility to finance certain of its lending activities.\nThe Trading Credit Facility requires us to comply with customary affirmative and negative covenants, and with a variety of\nfinancial covenants, including a minimum working capital requirement; a fixed charge coverage ratio; a ratio of total recourse debt to\nconsolidated tangible net worth; and limitations on the amount of ownership-based financings (as defined). Owing to the cyclicality of\nour business, we may be required to request limited waivers of compliance with certain financial covenants under the Trading Credit\nFacility. There can be no assurance that such waivers will be granted. Upon the occurrence of an event of default under the Trading\nCredit Facility that was not cured or waived pursuant to the terms of the Trading Credit Facility, the lenders under the Trading Credit\nFacility could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under the Trading Credit Facility to be due and payable immediately.\nIf we are unable to access funds under the Trading Credit Facility, we may be limited in the manner in which we conduct our\nbusiness, and we may be unable to engage in favorable business activities or finance future operations or capital needs.\nWe cannot assure you that our assets or cash flow would be sufficient to fully repay borrowings under our outstanding debt\ninstruments, including the Trading Credit Facility, upon acceleration or at maturity, or that we would be able to refinance or restructure\nthe payments under the Trading Credit Facility. Our failure to renew or replace the Trading Credit Facility under such circumstances\nwould reduce the financing available to us and could limit our ability to conduct our business, including certain lending activity of our\nCFC subsidiary. There can be no assurance that we could procure replacement financing on commercially acceptable terms on a timely\nbasis, or at all. We have pledged a significant portion of our assets as collateral under the Trading Credit Facility, and if we were unable\nto repay the amounts outstanding thereunder, the administrative agent under the Trading Credit Facility could proceed against the\ncollateral securing such indebtedness.\nWe are subject to fluctuations in interest rates based on the variable interest terms of the Trading Credit Facility, and we may not\nbe able to pass along to our customers and borrowers some or any part of an increase in the interest that we are required to pay under\nthe Trading Credit Facility.\nLoans under our credit facility may bear interest based on SOFR, but experience with SOFR based loans is limited.\nRevolving loans under the Trading Credit Facility are at our option either Based Rate Loans that bear interest at a base rate plus\na prescribed margin, or SOFR Loans that bear interest at rates selected by us based on the Secured Overnight Financing Rate published\nby the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (SOFR) plus prescribed margins. The use of SOFR based rates replaced rates based on the\nLondon interbank offered rate (LIBOR), and reflects the cessation of the publication of LIBOR rates by regulators in the United Kingdom\nand the discontinuation of the use of LIBOR in the financial markets. The use of SOFR based rates may result in interest rates and/or\npayments that are higher or lower than the rates and payments that we experienced under our prior Trading Credit Facility, where interest\nrates were based on LIBOR. Also, the use of SOFR based rates is relatively new, and there could be unanticipated difficulties or\ndisruptions with the calculation and publication of SOFR based rates. In particular, if the agent under the Trading Credit Facility\ndetermines that SOFR Rates cannot be determined or the agent or the lenders determine that SOFR based rates do not adequately reflect\nthe cost of funding the SOFR Loans, outstanding SOFR Loans will be converted into Base Rate Loans. This could result in increased\nborrowing costs for the Company.\nWe could suffer losses with our financing operations.\nWe engage in a variety of financing activities with our customers:\n• Receivables from our customers with whom we trade in precious metal products are effectively short-term, non-interest\nbearing extensions of credit that are, in certain cases, secured by the related products maintained in the Company’s\npossession or by a letter of credit issued on behalf of the customer. On average, these receivables are outstanding up to 10\ndays.\n• We make advances to our customers on unrefined metals secured by materials received from the customer. These advances\nare limited to a portion of the materials received.\n• The Company makes unsecured, short-term, non-interest bearing advances to wholesale metals dealers and government\nmints.\n• The Company periodically extends short-term credit through the issuance of notes receivable to approved customers at\ninterest rates determined on a customer-by-customer basis.\n15\n• The Company operates a financing business through CFC which makes secured loans at loan-to-value ratios—principal\nloan amount divided by the liquidation value, as conservatively estimated by management, of the collateral—of, in most\ncases, 50% to 85%. These loans are both variable and fixed interest rate loans, with some maturities on-demand and others\nfrom three to twelve months.\nOur ability to minimize losses on the credit that we extend to our customers depends on a variety of factors, including:\n• our loan underwriting and other credit policies and controls designed to assure repayment, which may prove inadequate to\nprevent losses;\n• our ability to sell collateral upon customer defaults for amounts sufficient to offset credit losses, which can be affected by\na number of factors outside of our control, including (i) changes in economic conditions, (ii) increases in market rates of\ninterest and (iii) changes in the condition or value of the collateral; and\n• the reserves we establish for loan losses, which may prove insufficient.\nLiquidity constraints may limit our ability to grow our business.\nWe will require adequate sources of liquidity to fund both our existing business and our strategy for expansion, evidenced by our\nacquisition of JMB and other acquisition activity. Currently, our main sources of liquidity are the cash that we generate from operations,\nand our borrowing availability under the Trading Credit Facility. There can be no assurance that our sources of liquidity will be adequate\nto support the growth that we are hoping to achieve or that additional sources of financing for this purpose, in the form of additional\ndebt or equity financing, will be available to us, on satisfactory terms or at all. Also, the Trading Credit Facility contains, and any future\ndebt financing is likely to contain, various financial and other restrictive covenants. The need to comply with these covenants may limit\nour ability to implement our growth initiatives.\nWe may experience supply chain disruptions in our operations.\nAs a result of various macro-economic factors, businesses in a variety of industries have experienced difficulty in obtaining the\nsource materials required for their operations. We require coin and other bullion products, particularly products manufactured by\ngovernment mints, for resale to our customers, and silver for the productions of bullion bars and rounds by our Silver Towne Mint. We\nhave multiple sources for obtaining the bullion products which we resell to our customers, and our relationships with major refiners\nhave to date provided us with an adequate source of material for our minting operations. We also maintain a supply of metal in case we\nexperience a shortage of raw materials for our Silver Towne Mint. However, while we do not currently anticipate that our business will\nsuffer as a consequence of problems in the national and global supply chains, we cannot assure you that this will continue to be the case.\nOur operations could be adversely impacted if we did not have an adequate source of supply for our Silver Towne Mint, particularly if\nwe expand our minting operations to meet increased demand, or if supply chain disruptions significantly interfered with our sources of\ncoin and bullion for resale. If significant supply chain constraints were to occur, we might be required to cut back on our minting\noperations or we might be unable to timely satisfy customer requirements for coin and bullion products. This could lead to a loss of\nsales and could adversely impact our reputation.\nWe are dependent on our key management personnel and our trading experts.\nOur strategic vision and performance are dependent on Gregory Roberts, our Chief Executive Officer, other members of our senior\nmanagement and certain other key employees. We have an employment agreement with Mr. Roberts which expires in June 2027. We\nalso have employment agreements with Thor Gjerdrum, our President, and Brian Aquilino, our Chief Operating Officer, which expire\nin June 2025, and Robert Pacelli, Chief Executive Officer and President of JMB, which expires in June 2026.\nThese and other employees have expertise in the trading markets, e-commerce operations and digital marketing; have industry-\nwide reputations; and perform critical functions for our business. We cannot offer assurance that we will be able to negotiate acceptable\nterms for the renewal of the employment agreements or otherwise retain our key employees. Also, there is significant competition for\nskilled precious metals traders and other industry professionals. The loss of our current key officers and employees, without the ability\nto replace them, would have a materially adverse effect on our business.\nWe rely extensively on computer systems to execute trades and process transactions, and we could suffer substantial damages if the\noperation of these systems were interrupted.\nWe rely on our computer and communications hardware and software systems to execute a large volume of trading transactions\neach year. Our dependence on computer and communications technology increased with the acquisition of JMB, whose sales are\nconducted exclusively through the internet. It is therefore critical that we maintain uninterrupted operation of these systems, and we\nhave invested considerable resources to protect our systems from physical compromise and security breaches and to maintain backup\nand redundancy. Nevertheless, our systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages, computer and telecommunications\nfailures, computer viruses, security breaches, including breaches of our transaction processing or other systems, catastrophic events such\nas fires, tornadoes and hurricanes, and usage errors by our employees. Breaches, damage or malfunctions affecting our systems may\nrequire significant investment for repair or replacement, and could interrupt our ability to provide quotations or trading services, or to\nconduct our e-commerce business.\n16\nWe are also subject to ransomware attacks, in which malicious actors seek to deprive us of access to our computer systems unless\nwe pay them a fee, which could be substantial. If personal data were compromised, we could be subject to costly litigation or government\nfines. See also “Risk Factors of General Applicability—If our customer data were breached, we could suffer damages and loss of\nreputation;” and “—New rules have recently become effective that will require the Company to provide disclosures regarding\ncybersecurity management and events.”\nThe Company has minority investments in a number of entities engaged in precious metal marketing; as a minority investor\nthe Company is not able to exercise absolute control over these entities.\nWe hold minority interests in entities that are engaged in the business of precious metal and numismatic sales to\nconsumers. Although by virtue of the Company’s investment in these entities, the Company is able to exert influence, and in some cases\nsubstantial influence, on the management of the entities, the Company does not have absolute control of these entities. As a consequence,\ncircumstances may arise in which action may be taken by the management of these entities which we believe is not in our best interest\nand to which we object. The value of our investment in one or more of these entities may therefore decline. Also, because these\ninvestments are illiquid, we may not be able to dispose of our ownership interests in these entities should be choose to do so, at a price\nthat we believe reflects its fair value or at all.\nRisks Related to World Events\nOur business is influenced by political conditions and world events.\nThe precious metals business is especially subject to global political conditions and world events. Precious metals are viewed by\nsome as a secure financial investment in times of political upheaval or unrest, particularly in developing economies, which may drive\nup pricing. The volatility of the commodity prices for precious metals is also likely to increase in politically uncertain times. Conversely,\nduring periods of relative international calm precious metal volatility is likely to decrease, along with demand, and the prices of precious\nmetals may retreat. Because our business is dependent on the volatility and pricing of precious metals, we are likely to be influenced by\nworld events more than businesses in other economic sectors.\nRussia is continuing to engage in its military action against Ukraine. In response, the U.S. and certain other countries imposed\nsignificant sanctions and export controls, and could impose further sanctions and controls, against Russia, Belarus and certain individuals\nand entities connected to Russian or Belarusian political, business, and financial organizations. The conflict has also created uncertainty\nregarding, and potential shortages of, grain and fossil fuel supplies in Europe and elsewhere. It is not possible to predict the broader\nconsequences of this conflict, which could materially adversely affect global trade, currency exchange rates, regional economies and\nthe global economy, and its impact on us. We could benefit from the resulting uncertainty and instability, as it may encourage investors\nto seek perceived safety in the ownership of precious metals. On the other hand, we have a marketing support operation in Austria and\nhave significant business in Germany and other parts of Europe that could be materially and adversely affected by the continuing or\nexpanded military activity in that region. Hamas' attack on Israel and Israel's response have the potential for further disruption of\neconomic markets, particularly as hostilities expand to include other state and non-state actors. The Company has no operations in the\nMiddle East at the current time. However, events there could result in political turmoil in Europe, which could directly affect our\noperations there, and could adversely affect the business that we conduct with customers in the Middle East and other parts of the world.\nAlso, the turmoil in the Middle East could have global economic effects that are the same as or more severe than those of the war in the\nUkraine, with similar consequences for our business. In particular, a depressing effect on the global economy as a consequence of the\nmilitary action in Ukraine and the Middle East could dampen our business activity and reduce the demand for our products and services.\nThe Company experienced outsized growth in its revenues and operating profits during periods of volatility in the financial markets\nover the last several years, and there can be no assurance that this level of performance will be attainable in the future.\nThe unprecedented growth of the business of the Company over the last several years may be attributed to a high degree of\nvolatility in the financial markets, resulting from various geopolitical, macroeconomic, military and global uncertainties and events. In\nthis environment, consumers may have sought perceived financial safety in precious coins and metals. Our stock price responded\nfavorably to these unprecedented circumstances as well.\n17\nOur profits have since retreated from their all-time highs experienced during these times, and there can be no assurance that this\nhistorically unprecedented performance of the precious metals business will be attainable in future periods. Our business in the past has\nbeen subject to cyclical fluctuations, and we are beginning to experience to a degree a return to cyclicality in our more recent operating\nresults. Consumer perceptions with respect to precious coins and metals could shift, and these commodities may no longer be viewed\nas secure investments. Slower precious metals markets with lower volatility and greater supply, as we have experienced more recently,\nhave had and could continue to have the effect of decreasing the volume of products sold and also adversely impact our product\npremiums, which are a key driver of our overall performance. A sustained decline in our revenues and earnings would have adverse\neffects on our operations and would likely cause our stock price to decline. It is not possible to predict with any accuracy future market\ntrends, and in particular whether the extremely favorable environment for our business during these volatile financial markets will return.\nAs a result, we cannot tell, when, if at all, our profitability will once more achieve the unprecedented levels that we experienced during\nthese periods. Moreover, because of the nature of the current business and financial environment, particularly in regards to the precious\nmetal industry, it is difficult to create with any acceptable measure of precision customary financial projections and forecasts for our\nbusiness over the next several years. This could adversely affect our ability to engage in financial and operational planning for the future.\nWe derive significant revenues from business outside the United States.\nWe derive a significant portion of our revenues from business outside the United States, including from customers in developing\ncountries. Business operations outside the U.S. are subject to political, economic and other risks inherent in operating in foreign\ncountries. These include risks of general applicability, such as the need to comply with multiple regulatory regimes; trade protection\nmeasures and import or export licensing requirements and tariffs; and fluctuations in equity, revenues and profits due to changes in\nforeign currency exchange rates. Currently, we do not conduct substantial business with customers in developing countries. However,\nif our business in these areas of the world were to increase, we would also face risks that are particular to developing countries, including\nthe difficulty of enforcing agreements, collecting receivables, protecting inventory and other assets through foreign legal systems,\nlimitations on the repatriation of earnings, currency devaluation and manipulation of exchange rates, and high levels of inflation.\nWe try to manage these risks by monitoring current and anticipated political, economic, legal and regulatory developments in the\ncountries outside the United States in which we operate or have customers and adjusting operations as appropriate, but there can be no\nassurance that the measures we adopt will be successful in protecting the Company’s business interests.\nThe Company’s recent acquisition of LPM, a precious metals business located in Hong Kong, reflects the Company’s efforts to\nincrease its presence in Asia, particularly the Far East. There can be no assurance that the Company’s expansion efforts in the Far East\nwill be successful. Moreover, there are particular regulatory and other challenges to the conduct of business in the Peoples Republic of\nChina, and as a result certain foreign businesses have recently been decreasing their presence there. The Company may encounter similar\nchallenges, which may impede the Company’s expansion efforts in the region.\nThe current inflationary and high interest rate environment may adversely affect our costs and expenses and the demand for our\nproducts.\nThe United States and other world economies are currently experiencing high interest rates and have recently experienced high\nlevels of inflation, although this has eased in recent months. Certain investors, including customers of our Direct-to-Consumer segment,\nmay regard precious metal products as a hedge against inflation and high interest rates, which could positively affect demand for our\ngoods and services. However, inflation may also increase our expenses of operations, which because of the nature of our business we\ncannot generally pass along to our customers. Our Trading Credit Facility bears interest at a variable rate of interest, so that higher\ninterest rates will also increase our cost of borrowing under that facility, and higher interest rates may also increase the costs under our\nproduct financing arrangements. We may be unable to compensate for these increases through higher interest income and other fees and\ncharges received from our counterparties. Also, inflation, together with high interest rates, may reduce discretionary spending among\nconsumers, thereby reducing product demand in the retail sector.\nRisks Related to our Wholesale Sales & Ancillary Services Segment\nThe loss of a government purchaser/distributorship arrangement could materially adversely affect our business.\nA-Mark’s business is heavily dependent on its purchaser/distributorship arrangements with various governmental mints. Our\nability to offer numismatic coins and bars to our customers on a competitive basis is based on the ability to purchase products directly\nfrom a government source. The arrangements with the governmental mints may be discontinued by them at any time. The loss of an\nauthorized purchaser/distributor relationship, including with the U.S. Mint, could have a material adverse effect on our business.\n18\nWe operate in a highly competitive industry.\nThe business of buying and selling precious metals is global and highly competitive. The Company competes with precious metals\nfirms and banks throughout North America, Europe and elsewhere in the world, some of whom have greater financial and other\nresources, and greater name recognition, than the Company. We believe that, as a full-service firm devoted exclusively to precious\nmetals trading, we offer pricing, product availability, execution, financing alternatives and storage options that are attractive to our\ncustomers and allow us to compete effectively. We also believe that our purchaser/distributorship arrangements with various\ngovernmental mints give us a competitive advantage in our coin distribution business. However, given the global reach of the precious\nmetals business, the absence of intellectual property protections and the availability of numerous, evolving platforms for trading in\nprecious metals, we cannot assure you that A-Mark will be able to continue to compete successfully or that future developments in the\nindustry will not create additional competitive challenges.\nThe Company is subject to risks relating to its AMST operations.\nOur AMST subsidiary, which operates our Silver Towne Mint, depends on critical pieces of equipment which may be out of\nservice occasionally for scheduled upgrades or maintenance or as a result of unanticipated failures or business interruptions. AMST’s\nfacilities are subject to equipment failures and the risk of catastrophic loss due to unanticipated events such as fires, earthquakes,\naccidents or violent weather conditions. AMST has insurance to cover certain of the risks associated with equipment damage and\nresulting business interruption, but there are certain events that would not be covered by insurance, and there can be no assurance that\ninsurance will continue to be available on acceptable terms. One such casualty event recently occurred as a result of a tornado, which\nalthough covered by insurance, temporarily interrupted operations at the mint.\nAMST's ability to continue to expand the scope of its services and customer base depends in part on its ability to increase the size\nof its skilled labor force. In the past, the demand for skilled personnel has been high and the supply limited. The inability to employ or\nretain skilled technical personnel could constrain AMST’s operations and its growth opportunities.\nOur business is dependent on a concentrated customer base.\nOne of A-Mark's key assets is the customer base of its Wholesale Sales & Ancillary Services segment. This customer base provides\ndeep distribution of product and makes A-Mark a desirable trading partner for precious metals product manufacturers, including\nsovereign mints seeking to distribute precious metals coinage or large refiners seeking to sell large volumes of physical precious metals.\nIn any given quarter, our sales in this segment may be derived from a small number of significant customers. If our relationships with\nthese customers deteriorated, or if we were to lose these customers, our business could be materially adversely affected.\nWe have in the past engaged, and continue to engage, in transactions with Stack’s Bowers, an affiliate of the Company, which\ncould be perceived as not being made at arms-length.\nStack’s-Bowers Numismatics, LLC (\"Stack's Bowers\"), which is primarily engaged in the business of auctions of high-value and\nrare coins and in coin retailing, is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Spectrum Group International, Inc. (\"SGI\"), our former parent and a\nrelated party. We have engaged in the past, and continue to engage, in transactions with Stack’s Bowers. These transactions include\nsecured lending transactions in which Stack’s Bowers is the borrower, and other transactions involving the purchase and sale of rare\ncoins, including with JMB. SGI and the Company have a common chief executive officer, and the chief executive officer and the general\ncounsel of the Company are board members of SGI. In addition, a majority of the board of directors of the Company have an ownership\ninterest in SGI that in the aggregate represents a controlling interest in SGI. Transactions between the Company and Stack’s Bowers are\napproved by our Audit Committee, as appropriate, and we believe that all such transactions are on terms no less favorable to the Company\nthan would be obtained from an unaffiliated third-party. Nonetheless, these transactions could be perceived as being conflicted.\nThe materials held by A-Mark are subject to loss, damage, theft or restriction on access.\nA-Mark has significant quantities of high-value precious metals at its Logistics facilities, at third-party depositories and in transit.\nThere is a risk that gold and other precious metals held by A-Mark, whether on its own behalf or on behalf of its customers, could be\nlost, damaged or stolen. In addition, access to A-Mark’s precious metals could be restricted by natural events (such as an earthquake) or\nhuman actions (such as a terrorist attack). Although we maintain insurance on terms and conditions that we consider appropriate, we\nmay not have adequate sources of recovery if our precious metals inventory is lost, damaged, stolen or destroyed, and recovery may be\nlimited. Among other things, our insurance policies exclude coverage in the event of loss as a result of terrorist attacks or civil unrest.\nOur Logistics depository is subject to authorization by our lenders.\nOur lenders under our Trading Credit Facility have approved our Logistics facilities as an authorized depository. If that approval\nwere to be withdrawn for any reason, we would no longer be able to keep inventory at that location, which would substantially limit our\nability to conduct business from that facility.\n19\nRisks Related to our Direct-to Consumer Segment\nOur Direct-to-Consumer businesses could be subject to accusations of improper sales practices.\nThrough our Direct-to-Consumer segment (JMB, Goldline, and our investment in SGB), the Company sells precious metals and\nnumismatics directly to the retail investor community. JMB and SGB market their products primarily over the internet. Goldline markets\nits precious metal products on television, radio, and over the internet, and through customer service outreach. Prior to its acquisition by\nthe Company, Goldline had been accused of improper sales practices, and was the subject of a state enforcement action that was\nsubsequently settled. Other retailers of precious metal products have similarly been the subject of accusations regarding their sales\npractices, including claims of misrepresentation, excessive product markups, pressured sales tactics and product switching. The\nCompany believes that the sales practices of its Goldline subsidiary conform to applicable legal and ethical standards, and that there is\nno material basis for claims against Goldline in this regard. Nevertheless, given the nature of the retail precious metals business, the\npossibility that investors in precious metals may lose a substantial portion of their investment as a result of adverse market trends and\nthe vulnerability of certain retail precious metal investors to economic loss, there can be no assurance that claims will not be made\nregarding business practices of Goldline, JMB or SGB, or that, if made, such claims will not attract the attention of governmental and\nprivate sector consumer advocates. Were this to occur, the Company could suffer adverse publicity, be subject to governmental\nenforcement actions or be forced to modify the sales and marketing practices of its direct-to-consumer business.\nOur Direct-to-Consumer businesses operate in a highly competitive environment.\nJMB, Goldline, and SGB face competition from other specialty online precious metal and coin sites, as well as from traditional\nprecious metal retail brokers and coin stores. In addition, certain general online merchandisers such as eBay also offer collectible coins\nand bullion for sale, and other major online retailers, with financial and marketing resources, name recognition and a customer base that\nare far greater than those that are available to us, may in the future enter this market. Competition is based upon the availability of coin\nand bullion product, price, delivery times, convenience and customer service. There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete\neffectively with other retail sources and channels for precious coin and bullion, especially if the demand for these products were to\ncontract from its current record high levels.\nWe intend to continue to pursue selective acquisitions and investments to complement our organic growth, which may not be\nsuccessful.\nAs part of our Direct-to-Consumer operating strategy, we have sought, and in the future may seek, to supplement our organic\ngrowth through strategic acquisitions of and investments in other e-commerce retailers of coins and precious metals. We may not be\nable to identify suitable acquisition or investment candidates in the future. If we are unable to successfully execute on organic growth\nopportunities or complete acquisitions or investments in the future, or if we incur greater than anticipated costs to execute this strategy,\nour growth may be limited. To the extent that we grow through acquisitions or investments, we cannot ensure that we will be able to\nadequately or profitably manage this growth.\nJMB’s search engine optimization strategies have provided it with an important competitive advantage, but this may not continue.\nWe believe that the internally developed search engine optimization (SEO) strategies of JMB provide its business with a\ncompetitive advantage in driving traffic to its sites over other e-commerce precious metal retailers and have been a significant factor in\nthe growth of JMB. The challenges of efficient SEO programming are continually evolving, and other e-commerce retailers in the\nprecious metal space are constantly working to improve their own SEO capabilities. If JMB does not continue to maintain its competitive\nedge in SEO technology, it could lose customers and market share to its competitors.\nJMB and SGB rely upon paid and unpaid internet search engines to rank their product offerings and drive traffic to their websites,\nand their website traffic may suffer if their rankings decline or their relationships with these services deteriorates.\nJMB and SGB rely on paid and unpaid internet search engines to attract consumer interest in their product offerings. Search engine\ncompanies change their natural search engine algorithms periodically, and these changes may adversely affect our Direct-to-Consumer\nproduct offerings in paid and/or unpaid searches. JMB and SGB may also at times be subject to ranking penalties if the operators of\nsearch engines believe it is not in compliance with their guidelines. If our Direct-to-Consumer's search engine rankings decline, and we\nare unable to timely regain our prior rankings, we may have to use more expensive marketing channels to sustain and grow our Direct-\nto-Consumer revenues, resulting in reduced profitability.\nIf JMB, Goldline, and SGB do not respond effectively to technological and market changes, they will cease to be competitive with\nother channels that consumers may have for the purchase of precious coins and bullion.\nTo remain competitive, JMB, Goldline, and SGB must continue to enhance and improve the responsiveness, functionality and\nfeatures of their online operations. The internet and the electronic commerce industry are characterized by rapid technological change,\nchanges in user and customer requirements and preferences, frequent new product and service introductions embodying new\ntechnologies, and the emergence of new industry standards and practices.\n20\nThe evolving nature of the internet could render our Direct-to-Consumer Segment's existing technology and systems obsolete. Its\ncontinuing success will depend, in part, on its ability to:\n• develop, license or acquire leading technologies useful in its business;\n• develop new features and technology that address the increasingly sophisticated preferences of its customers; and\n• respond to technological advances and emerging industry and regulatory standards and practices in a cost-effective and\ntimely manner.\nWith the growth of e-commerce, the pace of change in product offerings and consumer tastes is faster now than in years past. This\naccelerated pace of change increases uncertainty and places a greater burden on management to anticipate and respond to such changes.\nThe increased pace of change also means that the window in which a technologically advanced or sophisticated product or service can\nachieve and maintain partner and consumer interest is shrinking and, to the extent our Direct-to-Consumer Segment fails to timely\nanticipate or respond to changes in their industry, the effects of such missteps may be amplified.\nFuture advances in technology may not be beneficial to, or compatible with, JMB’s, Goldline’s, or SGB's businesses. Furthermore,\nJMB, Goldline and SGB may be unsuccessful in using new technologies effectively or adapting their technology and systems to user\nrequirements or emerging industry standards on a timely basis. Their ability to remain technologically competitive may require\nsubstantial expenditures and lead time. If JMB, Goldline or SGB is unable to adapt in a timely manner and at reasonable cost to changing\nmarket conditions or user requirements, they will cease to be competitive with other channels for the purchase of precious coins and\nbullion.\nIf JMB fails to continuously improve its websites (on all relevant platforms, including mobile), it may not attract or retain customers.\nJMB owns and operates numerous websites targeting specific niches within the precious metals retail market, including\nJMBullion.com, ProvidentMetals.com, Silver.com, CyberMetals.com, GoldPrice.org, SilverPrice.org, BGASC.com, BullionMax.com,\nand Gold.com. JMB must continually update its websites (on all relevant platforms, including mobile) to improve and enhance its\ncontent, accessibility, convenience and ease of use. Failure to do so may create a perception that the websites of JMB’s competitors are\neasier to use and navigate or that they are better able to service customer needs for precious metal coins and bullion. If such a perception\nwere to gain currency, traffic to JMB’s websites and its revenues would suffer.\nCertain of JMB’s websites publish data concerning the precious metal and cryptocurrency markets obtained from third parties,\nwhich could be inaccurate.\nJMB’s GoldPrice.org and SilverPrice.org publish data on precious metal and cryptocurrency pricing which is obtained from third\nparties. While we believe that the sources of the published data are reliable, the data is not independently verified by JMB or us. If the\ndata that JMB receives and publishes were inaccurate, and were relied upon by consumers visiting these websites, JMB could be exposed\nto liability and may suffer damage to its reputation.\nJMB, Goldline, and SGB expect to profit on precious metals acquired from their customers, but that might not be the case.\nThrough the Direct-to-Consumer Purchase Program, JMB and, through PMPP, Goldline and SGB, offer to purchase precious\ncoins and bullion owned by their customers. We believe that this program encourages the purchase of coins and bullion as an investment\nbecause it assures customers that their investment in the products offered by JMB, Goldline, and SGB will be liquid and can be monetized\nif the customers have a need for cash. JMB, Goldline, and SGB offer to purchase coins and bullion from their customers at prices\ndesigned to reflect current market valuations, but also allows JMB, Goldline, and SGB to profit on the resale of the products. There can\nbe no assurance, however, that JMB, Goldline, or SGB will in fact be able to resell product that they purchase at a price that will justify\nthe cost of purchase. In a declining market for precious metal products, JMB, Goldline, and SGB could be burdened with substantial\namounts of purchased inventory that they are unable to resell at an economic price, or at all. The suspension or discontinuance of the\nDirect-to-Consumer Purchase Program because of adverse market conditions could impair the perception among JMB's, Goldline's, and\nSGB's customers that precious coin and bullion is a safe and attractive investment.\n21\nRisks Related to our Secured Lending Segment\nOur lending business depends on the ability of CFC to originate or acquire loans secured principally by bullion and numismatic\ncoins.\nThe performance of our Secured Lending segment depends on having a portfolio of loans of sufficient size and quality to justify\nthe expenses and allocation of financial resources committed to the Company’s loan business. CFC both originates loans to customers\nof our wholesale and trading business and also acquires portfolios of loans originated by other parties. The Company typically stores\nthe bullion and numismatics that serve as collateral for the loans. As CFC does not independently market its lending business, it is\ndependent on the interest of the customers of the Company’s wholesale and trading business in financing their acquisition of bullion\nand numismatics with loans made by CFC. The interest of the Company’s customers in obtaining loans from CFC is dependent on\nnumerous factors, including the availability of other sources of financing, the interest rate environment, other alternatives for the storage\nof their bullion and numismatics, their business relationship with the Company and the level and types of businesses conducted by the\nCompany’s Wholesale Sales & and Ancillary Services segment. The Secured Lending segment is also dependent on CFC’s ability to\nidentify and acquire portfolios of loans secured by bullion and numismatics originated by third parties satisfying the Company’s standard\nfor quality and risk. There can be no assurance the CFC will be successful in continuing to originate and acquire secured loans in\namounts sufficient to justify the conduct of this business.\nThe number of loans and the size of CFC’s loan portfolio can vary significantly from period to period.\nCFC’s loan portfolio can vary considerably from period to period, both as to the number of loans in the portfolio and the total size\nof the portfolio in terms of dollar amount. The variation of CFCs loan portfolio is attributable to a variety of factors, including the\nsuccess of the Company in originating and acquiring loans discussed above, as well as the maturities of the loans in the portfolio and\nthe decisions of borrowers to prepay or extend the terms of their loans. As a consequence, the performance of the Secured Lending\nsegment in a particular financial reporting period may not be indicative of the how the segment will perform in any future period, either\nin the short or the long term.\nThe growth of the Secured Lending segment is likely to require significant resources.\nHistorically, the Company has originated loans almost exclusively to customers of its wholesale and trading business. The\nopportunity to finance purchases of bullion and numismatics with secured loans obtained from CFC is part of a suite of ancillary services\nthat the Company provides to its customers. The business of the Secured Lending segment, with respect to both the origination and\nacquisition of loan portfolios, is constrained by the Company’s borrowing capacity under its Trading Credit Facility, on which it relies\nto finance the much larger business of the Wholesale Sales & Ancillary Services segment. Any significant future growth of the Secured\nLending segment will require the application of significant additional resources to this business, and there can be no assurance that such\nresources will be available or that the Company will not determine that such resources, even if available, should be applied to other\nareas of the Company’s business.\nRisks Relating to Commodities\nA-Mark’s business is heavily influenced by volatility in commodities prices.\nA primary driver of A-Mark’s profitability is volatility in commodities prices, which leads to wider bid and ask spreads. Among\nthe factors that can impact the price of precious metals are supply and demand of precious metals; political, economic, and global\nfinancial events; movement of the U.S. dollar versus other currencies; and the activity of large speculators such as hedge funds. If\ncommodity prices were to stagnate, there would likely be a reduction in trading activity, resulting in less demand for the services A-\nMark provides, and spreads would likely decrease, which could materially adversely affect our profitability.\nThe period to period changes in volatility may cause our revenues to fluctuate, as a consequence of which our results for any one\nperiod may not be indicative of the results to be expected for any future period. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial\nCondition and Results of Operations.”\nOur business is exposed to the risk of changes in commodity prices, and our hedging activity to protect our inventory is subject to\nrisks of default by our counterparties.\nA-Mark’s precious metals inventory is subject to market value changes created by changes in the underlying commodity price, as\nwell as supply and demand of the individual products the Company trades. In addition, open sale and purchase commitments are subject\nto changes in value between the date the purchase or sale is fixed (the trade date) and the date metal is delivered or received (the\nsettlement date). A-Mark seeks to minimize the effect of price changes of the underlying commodity through the use of financial\nderivative instruments, such as forward and futures contracts. A-Mark’s policy is to remain substantially hedged as to its inventory\nposition and its individual sale and purchase commitments. A-Mark’s management monitors its hedged exposure daily. However, there\ncan be no assurance that these hedging activities will be adequate to protect the Company against commodity price risks associated with\nA-Mark’s business activities.\n22\nFurthermore, even if we are fully hedged as to any given position, there is the risk of default by our counterparties to the financial\ninstruments that we use to hedge our inventory. A default by a counterparty on a substantial hedge could have a material adverse effect\non our business.\nIncreased commodity pricing could limit the inventory that we are able to carry.\nWe maintain a large and varied inventory of precious metal products, including bullion and coins, in order to support our trading\nand Direct-to-Consumer activities and provide our customers with superior service. The amount of inventory that we are able to carry\nis constrained by the borrowing limitations and working capital covenants under the Trading Credit Facility. If commodity prices were\nto rise substantially, and we were unable to modify the terms of the Trading Credit Facility to compensate for the increase, the quantity\nof product that we could finance, and hence maintain in our inventory, would fall. This would likely have a material adverse effect on\nour operations.\nWe rely on the efficient functioning of commodity exchanges around the world, and disruptions on these exchanges could adversely\naffect our business.\nThe Company buys and sells precious metals contracts on commodity exchanges around the world, both in support of its customer\noperations and to hedge its inventory and transactional exposure against fluctuations in commodity prices. The Company’s ability to\nengage in these activities would be compromised if the exchanges on which the Company trades or any of their clearinghouses were to\ndiscontinue operations or to experience disruptions in trading, due to computer problems, unsettled markets, sanctions against\ncommodity exporting countries or other factors. For example, if there were to be disruptions in the supply chain for gold, silver, platinum\nor palladium, our ability to buy and sell these metals on the commodity exchanges would be materially and adversely affected.\nThe Company may also experience disruption and risk of loss if futures commission merchants or commodity brokers with whom\nthe Company deals were to become insolvent or bankrupt.\nOur business is subject to the risk of fraud and counterfeiting.\nThe precious metals (particularly bullion) business is exposed to the risk of loss as a result of “materials fraud” in its various\nforms. We seek to minimize our exposure to this type of fraud through a number of means, including third-party authentication and\nverification, reliance on our internal experts and the establishment of procedures designed to detect fraud. However, there can be no\nassurance that we will be successful in preventing or identifying this type of fraud, or in obtaining redress in the event such fraud is\ndetected.\nRisk Related to our Regulatory Environment\nThe CFTC may seek to assert jurisdiction over the Company’s activities.\nThe Company believes that its Direct-to-Consumer operations are generally conducted in a manner that does not implicate the\njurisdiction of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (\"CFTC\"), as it does not sell products to retail customers for future delivery.\nThe Commodity Exchange Act (the “CEA”) and the rules and regulations of the CFTC are drafted broadly, however, and practices that\nthe Company does not regard as futures transactions may be regarded as such by the CFTC.\nDuring the first quarter of fiscal 2023, the Company and Goldline settled an action in which the CFTC alleged, among other\nthings, that certain financing arrangements that were made available to customers constituted off-exchange retail commodity\ntransactions. Although this matter was settled on terms satisfactory to the Company with no material financial impact, and Goldline has\ndiscontinued these particular arrangements and practices, there can be no assurance that the CFTC will not in the future accuse us of\nviolating the CEA or the rules and regulations of the CFTC, or otherwise (along with other federal or state agencies) seek to assert\noversight over aspects of our operations which could adversely affect us.\nRecent legislative and regulatory initiatives will require us to expend time and resources on environmental reporting.\nAlthough our manufacturing activity is limited to the production of silver bullion products at our Silver Towne Mint, recent\nCalifornia legislation and new rules of the SEC will require us to make disclosures regarding environmental matters that could entail\nsignificant time and expense.\nOn October 7, 2023, California Governor Gavin Newsom signed into law Senate Bill (\"SB\") 261, Greenhouse Gases: Climate-\nRelated Financial Risk, and SB 253, the Climate Corporate Data Accountability Act, which significantly expand climate-related\ndisclosure requirements for companies doing business in California. As a company with operations in California, we may fall under the\njurisdiction of these new laws, which impose rigorous reporting obligations regarding our climate-related financial risks and extensive\nrequirements for the disclosure of greenhouse gas emissions.\n23\nSB 253 imposes its greenhouse gas reporting obligations on companies with annual revenues exceeding $1.0 billion. Given our\ncurrent revenue levels, we are subject to the requirements of SB 253. SB 253 requires the reporting of Scope 1 greenhouse gas emissions\n(direct emissions from our operations) and Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions (indirect emissions from our operations) for the prior\nfiscal year beginning in 2026. SB 253 requires reporting of Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions (emission from third parties in our value\nchain) for the prior fiscal year beginning in 2027. Although we will not know the full requirements of this law until the California Air\nResources Board issues implementing rules, the law will likely require us to report emissions from our operations in and outside of\nCalifornia, including our mint operations in Winchester, Indiana, and emissions from our suppliers and customers.\nCommencing on January 1, 2026, and biennially thereafter, SB 261 mandates that we publicly disclose our climate-related\nfinancial risks, which may include risks to our own operations, the operations of our suppliers and customers and the precious metals\nmarkets generally. This includes detailing the strategies we have adopted to mitigate and adapt to these risks. Our compliance reports\nmust be made publicly available on our company's website. Non-compliance with the requirements of SB 261 could expose us to a fine\nof up to $50,000 per reporting year and we may also be required to pay an annual filing fee. The California climate disclosure is the\nsubject of ongoing litigation that could impact whether and when the Company is required to make the disclosures required by the\nregime. The Company will monitor that litigation as it prepares to comply with the rule.\nOn March 6, 2024 the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) issued final rules requiring public companies, such as A-\nMark, to disclose both greenhouse gas emissions and climate risk. The SEC final rules overlap significantly with both the California\nreporting regime discussed above and the European Corporate Sustainability Directive (“CSRD”) discussed below but there are also\nmaterial differences.\nLike the California reporting regime, the SEC final rule would require the Company to measure and disclose both Scope 1 and\nScope 2 greenhouse gas emissions from its facilities including its mint operations in Winchester, Indiana. Unlike the California reporting\nscheme, the final SEC rules would not require the Company to report Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions. The SEC final rule would also\nrequire the Company to obtain attestation reports of its Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions from an independent expert in\ngreenhouse gas emissions measurement.\nLike the California reporting regime, the SEC final rule will also require the Company to track and disclose material climate\nrelated financial risks and how we manage those risks. Unlike the California rule, the SEC final rule will require the Company to track\nand report material capitalized costs, expenditures expensed and charged and losses incurred as a result of severe weather events and\nother natural conditions and any carbon reduction goal we may have along with our use of offsets or Renewable Energy Credits to\nachieve that goal.\nLike the California reporting regime, the SEC final rule is the subject to ongoing litigation that could impact whether and when\nthe Company is required to make the disclosures required by the rule. The Company will monitor that litigation as it prepares to comply\nwith the rule.\nThe European Union adopted new disclosure standards and rules related to environmental, social, and corporate governance\n(\"ESG\") matters in the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) which became effective in 2023 and applies to both EU\nand non-EU entities. Because our operations in Europe surpass the net turnover threshold in the rule and we may be deemed to have an\nEU branch or subsidiary, we may be subject to CSRD reporting requirements. We will know more about the specific disclosure\nrequirements when the EU adopts implementing regulations for the non-EU groups that are covered by the rule.\nThese changing rules and regulations, and the stakeholder expectations related to ESG described in \"Risk Factors of General\nApplicability – Third-party expectations relating to ESG factors may impose additional costs and expose us to new risks,\" have resulted\nin and are likely to continue to result in, increased general and administrative expenses and increased management time and attention\nspent complying with or meeting such regulations and expectations.\n24\nCompliance with new and existing data protection/privacy statutes could increase our costs and expose the Company to possible\nsanctions for violation.\nBy reason of our Direct-to-Consumer business in particular, we collect personal data or personal information, which is broadly\ndefined to include all information that can be related to a consumer or household, including identification information, demographics,\nusage, transactions and inquiries, preferences, and inferences drawn to create a profile about a consumer (“Personal Information”). We\nare subject to numerous data privacy and protection obligations that govern our handling of Personal Information, including: various\nfederal, state, local and foreign laws, regulations, and guidance; industry standards; external and internal privacy notices and policies;\ncontracts; and other obligations that apply to the handling of Personal Information by us and on our behalf. These obligations may\nchange, are subject to differing interpretations, and may be inconsistent among relevant jurisdictions in which we operate or from which\nwe collect Personal Information. The data privacy and protection landscape continues to evolve in jurisdictions worldwide. This\nevolution may create uncertainty in our business; affect us or our collaborators’, service providers’, and others’ ability to operate in\ncertain jurisdictions or to collect, store, transfer, use, share, and otherwise process Personal Information; necessitate the acceptance of\nmore onerous obligations in our contracts; cause us to modify our business operations; result in liabilities; or otherwise impose additional\ncompliance costs on us. Moreover, despite our efforts, we may not be successful in achieving compliance if our personnel or third parties\nupon whom we rely fail to comply with such obligations. For example, any failure by a service provider to comply with applicable data\nprivacy or protection law, regulations, contractual, or other obligations could result in significant consequences against us. These\nconsequences may include: government enforcement actions (e.g., investigations, fines, penalties, audits, inspections and similar\nactivities); litigation (including class-related claims); additional reporting requirements and/or oversight; orders to destroy or not use\nPersonal Information; damage to our reputation; loss of revenue and profits; loss of goodwill; and other adverse business impacts..\nIn 2016, the European Union (\"EU\") adopted a comprehensive overhaul of its data protection regime from a national legislative\napproach to a single European Economic Area Privacy Regulation, the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), which went into\neffect in May 2018. The EU data protection regime expands the scope of the EU data protection law to all foreign companies processing\nPersonal Information of EU residents, imposes a strict data protection compliance regime with severe penalties of up to the greater of\n4% of worldwide turnover or €20 million, and includes new rights such as the “portability” of Personal Information. Although the GDPR\napplies across the EU without a need for local implementing legislation, EU member states have the ability to interpret the GDPR\nopening clauses, which permit region-specific data protection legislation and have the potential to create inconsistencies on a country-\nby-country basis. The United Kingdom passed similar legislation (the “UK GDPR”) which took effect in 2021 and provides severe\npenalties of up to the greater of 4% of worldwide turnover or €17.5 million. We may also be subject to many other foreign privacy laws\nthat are modeled at least in part after the GDPR, including China’s Personal Information Protection Law (PIPL), Canada’s Personal\nInformation Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA) and territorial Canadian privacy laws, and the Privacy Acts of Australia\nand New Zealand.\nOur Direct-to-Consumer business currently has limited international operations which would subject it to these foreign privacy\nlaws. Our Wholesale Sales and Ancillary Services segment maintains an office in Vienna, Austria that provides marketing support\nservices for its international customers. We have evaluated these foreign privacy laws and their requirements, and believe we are\ncurrently in compliance in all material respects. Going forward, however, the expansion of our international operations could require us\nto change our business practices and may increase the costs and complexity of compliance. Also, a violation by the Company of these\nregulations could expose us to penalties and sanctions under the regulations.\nCalifornia passed amendments to the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) that took effect on January 1, 2023. This law\nprovides California consumers with a high level of transparency and broad rights and choices with respect to their Personal Information.\nFor example, CCPA grants consumers privacy rights including the rights of data correction and data portability, the right to limit the\nCompany’s use of a subset of Personal Information called “sensitive Personal Information” that requires heightened protections, and the\nright to appeal the Company’s response to an individual’s exercise of these new or existing privacy rights. Compliance with CCPA\nrequires the implementation of a series of operational measures such as: preparing data maps, inventory, or other records of all Personal\nInformation pertaining to California residents, households and devices, as well as information sources, usage, storage, and sharing;\nmaintaining and updating detailed disclosures in privacy policies; conducting risk assessments for the use of sensitive Personal\nInformation; establishing mechanisms (including, at a minimum, a toll-free telephone number and an online channel) to respond to\nconsumers’ data access, deletion, portability, and opt-out requests; and providing clear and conspicuous links on the home page of the\nbusiness’ website, where applicable, allowing residents to limit or opt-out of certain data processing activities. CCPA prohibits\nbusinesses from discriminating against consumers who have opted out of the sale of their Personal Information, subject to narrow\nexceptions. Failure to comply with CCPA can result in civil penalties up to $7,500 per violation or actual damages suffered by a\nconsumer.\n25\nColorado, Virginia, Utah, and Connecticut also passed comprehensive privacy laws, modeled in part after the CCPA, that took\neffect in 2023. Fifteen other states have passed similar privacy laws that have taken or will take effect between 2024 and 2026, including\nFlorida, Texas, Delaware, Oregon, Tennessee, Iowa, Indiana, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Montana, Kentucky, Maryland, Minnesota,\nNebraska, and Rhode Island. These U.S. privacy laws have some provisions and requirements similar to the CCPA. However, preparing\nto comply with the varying requirements of these laws has already subjected the Company to costs and legal fees and will subject the\nCompany to additional costs and risks as they take effect. For example, these laws may limit the Company’s ability to use Personal\nInformation for advertising purposes, may limit the ways in which the Company may use certain categories of personal information,\nmay require the Company to obtain additional permissions from the consumer, and may require revision of the Company's contracts\nwith service providers with whom the Company shares Personal Information in the course of providing its products and services. These\nlaws may also limit the Company’s ability to process sensitive Personal Information, which includes financial data, account information,\nidentification card numbers, social security numbers, and precise geolocation. The Company will have to update is policies, notices,\nprocedures, and permissions in response to these new privacy laws. The Company may also have to update its advertising practices.\nFailure to comply with these privacy laws can result in civil penalties ranging from $2,500 to $20,000 per violation.\nAll fifty U.S. states and the District of Columbia have enacted data breach notification laws that may require us to notify investors,\nemployees, regulators and others in the event of a security breach (for example, unauthorized access to or disclosure of Personal\nInformation experienced by us or our service providers). These laws may not be consistent, and compliance in the event of a widespread\ndata breach may be difficult and costly. We may also be contractually required or otherwise obligated to notify investors and others of\na security breach. Although we may have contractual protections against our service providers should they experience a security breach,\nany actual or perceived security breach could harm our reputation and brand, expose us to potential liability and require us to expend\nsignificant resources on data security as well as in responding to any such actual or perceived breach. Any contractual protections we\nmay have against relevant counterparties may not be sufficient to protect adequately us from any such liabilities and losses, and we may\nbe unable to enforce any such contractual protections.\nNevada law requires operators of websites and online services to post a notice on their websites regarding their privacy practices.\nThe law also requires operators of internet websites or online services to establish a designated request address through which a consumer\nmay submit a verified request directing such operators not to make any sale of covered information collected about the consumer. The\n“covered information” regulated by the Nevada law is defined to include an enumerated list of items of personally identifiable\ninformation (including names, addresses, email addresses, phone numbers, social security numbers and identifiers that allow a specific\nperson to be contacted).\nWe have evaluated these state privacy laws and their requirements, and believe we are currently in compliance in all material\nrespects with those that are in effect. Going forward, however, the changes introduced by state privacy laws that will soon take effect,\nand other similar regulations enacted by other jurisdictions, will subject the Company to additional costs and complexity of compliance,\nby requiring, among other things, changes to the Company’s security systems, policies, procedures and practices. In addition, a violation\nby the Company of the new regulations could expose us to penalties and sanctions.\nWe are subject to other laws and regulations.\nThere are various federal, state, local and foreign laws, ordinances and regulations that affect our trading business. For example,\nbecause of the nature and value of the products in which deal, we are required to comply with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and a\nvariety of anti-money laundering and know-your-customer rules in response to the USA Patriot Act.\nThe SEC has promulgated rules mandated by the Dodd-Frank Act regarding disclosure, on an annual basis, of the use of tin,\ntantalum, tungsten and gold, known as conflict minerals, in products manufactured by public companies. These rules require due\ndiligence to determine whether such minerals originated from the Democratic Republic of Congo (\"DRC\") or an adjoining country and\nwhether such minerals helped finance the armed conflict in the DRC.\nThe Company has concluded that it is not currently subject to the conflict minerals rules because it is not a manufacturer of conflict\nminerals under the definitions set forth in the rules. Depending on developments in the Company’s business, it could become subject to\nthe rules at some point in the future. In that event, there will be costs associated with complying with these disclosure requirements,\nincluding costs to determine the origin of gold used in our products. In addition, the implementation of these rules could adversely affect\nthe sourcing, supply and pricing of gold used in our products. Also, we may face disqualification as a supplier for customers and\nreputational challenges if the due diligence procedures we implement do not enable us to verify the origins for the gold used in our\nproducts or to determine that the gold is conflict free.\nCFC operates under a California Finance Lenders License issued by the California Department of Financial Protection and\nInnovation. CFC is required to submit a finance lender law annual report to the state which summarizes certain loan portfolio and\nfinancial information regarding CFC. The Department of Financial Protection and Innovation may audit the books and records of CFC\nto determine whether CFC is in compliance with the terms of its lending license.\nThere can be no assurance that the regulation of our trading, Direct-to-Consumer, and lending businesses will not increase or that\ncompliance with the applicable regulations will not become more costly or require us to modify our business practices.\n26\nFor other risks related to government regulation, see below this section and see “Risk Factors of General Applicability — We are\nsubject to other laws and regulations,” below.\nOne or more states or municipalities could assert that the Company is liable for sales and use, commerce, or similar type of taxes,\nwhich could adversely affect our business.\nWe ship product to retail customers throughout the United States. In South Dakota v. Wayfair, Inc. et al (\"Wayfair\"), the U.S.\nSupreme Court ruled that states may charge tax on purchases made from out-of-state sellers, even if the seller does not have a physical\npresence in the taxing state. The effect of Wayfair was to uphold economic nexus principles in determining sales and use tax nexus. As\na result of the decision, most states have adopted laws that require an out-of-state retailer to register and collect sales and use or other\nnon-income type taxes upon meeting certain economic nexus standards regardless of whether the company has physical presence in the\nstate. Although the Company believes it is complying with these requirements, our interpretation and application of the newly enacted\nlegislation may differ from the states, which could result in the states' attempt to impose additional tax liabilities, including potential\npenalties and interest. Furthermore, the requirements by state or local governments on out-of-state sellers to collect sales and use taxes\ncould deter futures sales, which could have an adverse impact on our business.\nFor other risks related to taxation, see “Risk Factors of General Applicability — Changes in tax law could adversely affect our\nbusiness,” below.\nWe use lead providers and marketing affiliates to assist us in obtaining new customers, and if lead providers or marketing affiliates\ndo not comply with an increasing number of applicable laws and regulations, or if our ability to use such lead providers or marketing\naffiliates is otherwise impaired, it could adversely affect our business.\nWe are dependent on third parties, referred to as lead providers (or lead generators) and marketing affiliates, as a source of new\ncustomers for our Direct-to-Consumer segment. Our marketing affiliates place our advertisements on their websites that direct potential\ncustomers to our websites. Generally, lead providers operate, and also work with their own marketing affiliates who operate, separate\nwebsites to attract prospective customers and then sell those “leads” to online traders and lenders. As a result, the success of our Direct-\nto-Consumer business depends materially on the willingness and ability of lead providers or marketing affiliates to provide us customer\nleads at acceptable prices.\nIf regulatory oversight of lead providers or marketing affiliates is increased, through the implementation of new laws or regulations\nor the interpretation of existing laws or regulations, our ability to use lead providers or marketing affiliates could be restricted or\neliminated. For example, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (\"CFPB\") has indicated its intention to examine compliance with\nfederal laws and regulations by lead providers and to scrutinize the flow of non-public, private borrower information between lead\nproviders and lead buyers, such as us. Over the past few years, several states have taken actions that have caused us to discontinue the\nuse of lead providers in those states. While these discontinuations did not have a material adverse effect on us, other states may propose\nor enact similar restrictions on lead providers and potentially on marketing affiliates in the future, and if other states adopt similar\nrestrictions, our ability to use lead providers or marketing affiliates in those states would also be interrupted.\nThe failure by lead providers or marketing affiliates to comply with applicable laws or regulations, or any changes in laws or\nregulations applicable to lead providers or marketing affiliates or changes in the interpretation or implementation of such laws or\nregulations, could have an adverse effect on our business and could increase negative perceptions of our business and industry.\nAdditionally, the use of lead providers and marketing affiliates could subject us to additional regulatory cost and expense. If our ability\nto use lead providers or marketing affiliates were to be impaired, our business could be materially adversely affected.\nJudicial decisions, CFPB rulemaking or amendments to the Federal Arbitration Act could render the arbitration agreements we use\nillegal or unenforceable.\nWe include arbitration provisions in our loan and financing agreements. These provisions are designed to allow us to resolve any\ncustomer disputes through individual arbitration rather than in court and explicitly provide that all arbitrations will be conducted on an\nindividual and not on a class basis. Thus, our arbitration agreements, if enforced, have the effect of shielding us from class action\nliability. Our arbitration agreements do not generally have any impact on regulatory enforcement proceedings. We take the position that\nthe arbitration provisions in loan and financing agreements, including class action waivers, are valid and enforceable; however, the\nenforceability of arbitration provisions is often challenged in court. If those challenges are successful, our arbitration and class action\nwaiver provisions could be unenforceable, which could subject us to additional litigation, including class action litigation.\n27\nIn addition, the U.S. Congress has considered legislation that would generally limit or prohibit mandatory arbitration agreements\nin consumer contracts and has enacted legislation with such a prohibition with respect to certain mortgage loan agreements and also\ncertain consumer loan agreements to members of the military on active duty and their dependents. Further, the Dodd-Frank Act directed\nthe CFPB to study consumer arbitration and authorized the CFPB to adopt rules limiting or prohibiting consumer arbitration, consistent\nwith the results of its study. In July 2017, the CFPB issued a new rule on arbitration, which would have prohibited class action waivers\nin certain consumer financial services contracts. However, in November 2017, a joint resolution passed by Congress was signed\ndisapproving the rule under the Congressional Review Act. Because the rule was disapproved, it cannot be reissued in substantially the\nsame form, and the CFPB cannot issue a substantially similar rule, unless the new rule is specifically authorized by a law enacted after\nthe date of the joint resolution disapproving the original rule.\nAny judicial decisions, legislation or other rules or regulations that impair our ability to enter into and enforce consumer arbitration\nagreements and class action waivers could increase our exposure to class action litigation as well as litigation in plaintiff-friendly\njurisdictions, which would be costly and could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur advertising and marketing materials and disclosures related to our Direct-to-Consumer and Secured Lending segments have\nbeen and continue to be subject to regulatory scrutiny.\nIn the jurisdictions where our Direct-to-Consumer and Secured Lending businesses operate, our advertising and marketing\nactivities and disclosures are subject to regulation under various industry standards, borrower protection laws, and other applicable laws\nand regulations. As a whole, our advertising and marketing materials have come under increased scrutiny.\nThere can be no guarantee that we will be able to continue advertising and marketing our business units in a manner we consider\neffective. Any inability to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nRisks Relating to Our Common Stock\nWe may not continue to pay any dividends in the future.\nA-Mark’s board of directors has adopted a regular quarterly cash dividend policy of $0.20 per common share ($0.80 per share on\nan annual basis). The initial quarterly cash dividend under the policy was paid on October 24, 2022 to stockholders of record as of\nOctober 10, 2022. The most recent cash dividend under the policy was paid on July 31, 2024 to stockholders of record as of July 18,\n2024. The declaration of regular cash dividends in the future is subject to the determination each quarter by the board of directors, based\non a number of factors, including the Company’s financial performance, available cash resources, cash requirements and alternative\nuses of cash and applicable bank covenants.\nThere can be no assurance that the Company will pay dividends in the future on a regular basis or otherwise. If the board of\ndirectors were to determine not to pay dividends in the future, stockholders would not receive any further return on an investment in our\ncapital stock in the form of dividends and may obtain an economic benefit from the common stock only after an increase in its trading\nprice and only by selling the common stock.\nThe Company has paid non-recurring special cash dividends to our stockholders as a consequence in part of the Company's\nfavorable performance during the preceding periods. There is no assurance that any such non-recurring special dividend will be paid in\nthe future, and if made, the timing or amount of any such dividend.\nSee Note 20 to the Company’s consolidated financial statements for more information regarding our dividends.\nYour percentage ownership in the Company could be diluted in the future.\nYour percentage ownership in A-Mark potentially could be diluted in the future because of additional common stock-based equity\nawards that we expect will be granted to our directors, officers and employees, including through our current equity incentive plan. In\naddition, we may issue equity in order to raise capital or in connection with future acquisitions and strategic investments, which could\ndilute your percentage ownership. For example, in the acquisition of JMB, our increased investments in Pinehurst Coin Exchange, Inc.\nand Silver Gold Bull, Inc., and our recent acquisition of LPM, we issued stock to the sellers in partial consideration for the acquired\ninterests. We also issued stock to the public to finance, in part, the acquisition of JMB.\nProvisions in our Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws and of Delaware law may prevent or delay an acquisition of the Company,\nwhich could decrease the trading price of our common stock.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws and Delaware law contain certain anti-\ntakeover provisions that could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third-party to acquire, or of discouraging a third-party\nfrom attempting to acquire, control of the Company without negotiating with our board of directors. Such provisions could limit the\nprice that certain investors might be willing to pay in the future for the Company’s securities. Certain of such provisions allow the\nCompany to issue preferred stock with rights senior to those of the common stock, impose various procedural and other requirements\nwhich could make it more difficult for stockholders to effect certain corporate actions and set forth rules regarding how stockholders\nmay present proposals or nominate directors for election at stockholder meetings.\n28\nWe believe these provisions protect our stockholders from coercive or otherwise unfair takeover tactics by requiring potential\nacquirors to negotiate with our board of directors and by providing our board of directors with more time to assess any acquisition\nproposal. However, these provisions apply even if an acquisition offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders and could\ndelay or prevent an acquisition that our board of directors determines is not in the best interests of our Company and our stockholders.\nAccordingly, in the event that our board determines that a potential business combination transaction is not in the best interests of our\nCompany and our stockholders, but certain stockholders believe that such a transaction would be beneficial to the Company and its\nstockholders, such stockholders may elect to sell their shares in the Company and the trading price of our common stock could decrease.\nOur board and management beneficially own a sizable percentage of our common stock and therefore have the ability to exert\nsubstantial influence as stockholders.\nMembers of our board and management beneficially own approximately 22% of our outstanding common stock. Acting together\nin their capacity as stockholders, the board members and management could exert substantial influence over matters on which a\nstockholder vote is required, such as the approval of business combination transactions. Also because of the size of their beneficial\nownership, the board members and management may be in a position effectively to determine the outcome of the election of directors\nand the vote on stockholder proposals. The concentration of beneficial ownership in the hands of our board and management may\ntherefore limit the ability of our public stockholders to influence the affairs of the Company.\nRisk Factors of General Applicability\nNew rules have recently become effective that will require the Company to provide disclosures regarding cybersecurity management\nand events.\nThe SEC recently changed its disclosure requirements regarding cybersecurity risk management, strategy, governance and\nincident reporting. While the Company believes it has robust cybersecurity risk management procedures for addressing cybersecurity\nevents, the new rules may increase the costs of cybersecurity protection and require disclosure of cybersecurity events that the Company\nmight not otherwise deem to be material. The new rules require companies to investigate all cybersecurity incidents without unreasonable\ndelay, determine their level of materiality, and report specific details about any material cybersecurity incidents in a separate filing\nwithin four business days. The new rules also require additional information in annual disclosures regarding the Company’s\ncybersecurity risk management and reporting processes, as well as the cybersecurity expertise of relevant Company personnel and third-\nparty service providers or auditors.\nThe Company’s failure or inability to protect its intellectual property could harm its competitive position.\nThe Company relies on a combination of patent, trade secret, copyright and trademark laws and contractual restrictions, such as\nconfidentiality agreements and licenses, to protect its business, services, know-how and information. The Company’s patent, trademarks\nor service marks may be challenged or found to be unenforceable, and contractual arrangements to protect our intellectual property may\nbe insufficient to prevent its misappropriation. If that were the case, the Company’s competitive position would suffer.\nThird parties may assert violations of their intellectual property rights against the Company.\nThird parties may currently have, or may be issued, patents upon which the technologies used by the Company infringe. The\nCompany could incur significant costs to defend infringements claims, regardless of their validity, or could be required to develop non-\ninfringing technology at considerable expense or be compelled to enter into expensive royalty or license agreements. For example, JMB\nwas compelled to expend significant resources as a consequence of litigation in which it was accused of infringement prior to its\nacquisition by the Company.\nWe are subject to other laws and regulations.\nIn addition to matters discussed above, we are subject to various laws, and regulations, both domestic and foreign, as well as\nresponsible business, social and environmental practices, which may change from time to time. Failure to comply with applicable laws\nand regulations or to implement responsible business practices could subject us to damage to our reputation, lawsuits, criminal exposure,\nor increased cost of regulatory compliance.\nChanges in tax law could adversely affect our business.\nChanges to tax laws (which changes may have retroactive application) could adversely affect us or holders of our common stock.\nIt cannot be predicted whether, when, in what form, or with what effective dates, new tax laws or regulations may be enacted under\nexisting or new tax laws. This could result in an increase in our tax liability or require changes in our business in order to mitigate any\nadverse effects of changes in tax laws.\n29\nThird-party expectations relating to ESG factors may impose additional costs and expose us to new risks.\nIn recent years, there has been an increasing focus by stakeholders of public companies—including investors, employees,\ncustomers, suppliers, and governmental and non-governmental organizations—on ESG matters. A failure, whether real or perceived, to\naddress ESG could adversely affect our business, including by heightening other risks that we face, such as those related to consumer\nbehavior and consumer perceptions of us. We may also face pressure from stakeholders to provide disclosure and establish commitments,\ntargets or goals, and take actions to meet them, regarding ESG. If we fail to satisfy the expectations of investors and other stakeholders\nor our initiatives are not executed as planned, our reputation, results of our operations and ability to grow our business may be negatively\nimpacted. Additionally, new legislative or regulatory initiatives related to ESG could adversely affect our business.\nITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS\nNone.\nITEM 1C. CYBERSECURITY\nCybersecurity Risk Management and Strategy\nWe recognize the importance of information security practices designed to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability\nof company information and the personal information that we process. Cybersecurity risk management is an integral part of our overall\nenterprise risk management efforts. We manage cybersecurity risks using a framework based on applicable regulations, industry\nstandards and recognized best practices. Through this framework, we devote significant resources to identifying, monitoring, assessing\nand responding to cybersecurity threats and incidents, including those associated with our use of third-party software, applications,\nservices, and cloud infrastructure.\nOur Cybersecurity Program includes multiple policies, procedures, and other components designed to identify, analyze, and\nrespond to cybersecurity risks, including reliance on a layered system of preventative and detective technologies and controls designed\nto detect, mitigate, and contain cybersecurity threats. As part of our Cybersecurity Program, we maintain a Written Information Security\nPlan that outline internal controls and procedures designed to protect our information systems. Our Cybersecurity Program contains a\ncomprehensive suite of cybersecurity policies that are commensurate with companies in our industry of similar size and sophistication,\nand these policies are also informed by the sensitivity of our data processing activities. Our Cybersecurity Program also includes policies\nand procedures designed to ensure adequate business continuity, disaster recovery, and incident response. We also have access through\nour insurer to computer forensics firms and specialized legal counsel in case of a cybersecurity incident. While we maintain cybersecurity\ninsurance to assist in the cost of recovery from a cybersecurity incident, such coverage may not be sufficient to cover all costs resulting\nfrom such incidents.\nWe leverage qualified third-party consultants, advisors, counsel, and other experts to inform, audit, and update our Cybersecurity\nProgram throughout each year. We engage security assessors to identify vulnerabilities through both internal and external penetration\ntests and to perform cybersecurity maturity assessments. We perform risk assessments annually, or more frequently if circumstances\nrequire, using both internal and external resources. We may also be subject to examinations by applicable regulators. We conduct annual\ncybersecurity training for employees to enhance awareness of how to detect and respond to cybersecurity threats, as well as periodic\nphishing training and testing campaigns. We also conduct table-top exercises annually to simulate a response to a cybersecurity incident.\nOur designated IT team members monitor cybersecurity threats in real time for the Company at the enterprise level, with the\nassistance of third-party threat detection and monitoring software. Cybersecurity threats at the subsidiary level are also monitored in\nreal time by experienced IT professionals at those subsidiaries, including our Vice President of Digital and Technology at JM Bullion.\nThese individuals report cybersecurity incidents immediately to our Chief Information Officer (CIO), who in turn follows approved\nreporting protocols, as more fully described below.\nOur Cybersecurity Compliance and Disclosure Committee (CCDC), which is further described below, is chaired by our CIO and\nincludes the General Counsel of A-Mark and other representatives from the Company and our subsidiaries, including top-level\nmanagement, to ensure enterprise-wide implementation and consistent application of the Company’s data security policies and\nprocedures. The CCDC regularly enlists subject matter experts to assist where necessary.\nWe also maintain a formal Vendor Management Program that provides oversight of cybersecurity risks related to our vendor and\nsupplier relationships. During vendor onboarding, we perform risk-based due diligence on these third-parties, with heightened\nrequirements for vendors that have access to confidential or personal information or that require access to our information systems. This\nVendor Management Program includes specific cybersecurity requirements for our vendors, as well as ongoing monitoring, assessment,\nand contract review. Members of the CCDC are involved in and review the Vendor Management Program at least annually.\n30\nTo date, we have not identified any risks from cybersecurity threats, including as a result of any previous cybersecurity incidents,\nthat have materially affected us or are reasonably likely to materially affect us, including our business strategy, results of operations, or\nfinancial condition. However, the sophistication of and risks from cybersecurity threats and incidents continue to increase, and the\npreventative actions that we have taken and continue to take to reduce the risk of cybersecurity threats and incidents may not successfully\nprotect against all cybersecurity threats and incidents. For more information on the risks that we face from cybersecurity threats, see\n“Risk Factors – Risk Factors of General Applicability—New rules have recently become effective that will require the Company to\nprovide disclosures regarding cybersecurity management and events.” in Part 1, Item 1A of this report.\nCybersecurity Governance\nThe Board has overall responsibility for risk oversight and has delegated oversight of our Cybersecurity Program, including\nenterprise-wide risk assessment and management, to the CCDC. The CCDC’s charter requires it to monitor Company efforts to prevent,\ndetect, mitigate, and remediate cybersecurity incidents, and to comply with cybersecurity laws and regulations. The CCDC oversees and\napproves all Company policies and procedures related to cybersecurity. The CCDC also ensures that significant cybersecurity issues or\nconcerns are reported to the Board and A-Mark’s CEO, and disclosed to the public, individuals, or regulators where required by law.\nThe CCDC directly oversees information technology and information security risks through regular meetings, reports from\nmanagement on information technology, cybersecurity, and related risk assessments, and incidents disclosed by third-party service\nproviders as applicable. If a cybersecurity threat is identified, our Vice President of IT or other reporting individuals will immediately\ninform our IT service desk and notify our CIO. Once the threat has been analyzed, our CIO will inform our General Counsel of any\nsecurity incidents. The General Counsel will report on the incident, as appropriate, to the CCDC, our CEO, President and CFO, and to\nthe Board, either at the next scheduled meeting or on a current basis, depending on the severity of the incident.\nThe CCDC reports at least quarterly to the Board and A-Mark’s CEO on the following topics, among possible others: our current\nrisk posture and threat landscape; new material cybersecurity threats and high-risk exposures; risk mitigations and controls; incident\nresponse readiness; and updates to cybersecurity policies and procedures. The CCDC is also authorized and directed to report to the\nBoard and A-Mark’s CEO promptly in the event of a significant cybersecurity incident, as appropriate.\nA-Mark’s Chief Information Officer (CIO) chairs the CCDC. Our CIO brings over 14 years of IT experience to A-Mark. Since\njoining A-Mark in 2019, he has been pivotal in enhancing our data privacy compliance program, significantly strengthening our data\nprotection and privacy measures, particularly ensuring protection of sensitive data. The co-vice chairs of the CCDC are A-Mark’s Vice\nPresident of IT and JM Bullion’s Vice President of Digital and Technology. Our Vice President of IT has over 25 years of experience\nin IT working in various industries including ecommerce, health care, and financial industries focusing on IT operations, cybersecurity\nand compliance. Since joining the company in 2014, he has been instrumental in the creation and growth of our cybersecurity program.\nOur Vice President of Digital and Technology at JM Bullion has comprehensive experience in the cybersecurity field. He successfully\nestablished a 24/7 security operation center (SOC) to continuously detect and respond to security incidents, as well as implemented\nvarious advanced services to proactively detect vulnerabilities on potential attack surfaces with high accuracy spanning across assets,\napplications, data, endpoints and network. He also centralized the workforce identity and access management (IAM) of the various\nsystems for improved administration and control at the subsidiary level. He joined JM Bullion in 2015 and has served in his current role\nas Vice President of Digital and Technology since 2021.\nOther members of the CCDC include top executives and management from the Company and its subsidiaries, including A-Mark’s\nGeneral Counsel, President, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Operating Officer, Senior Director of Financial Reporting, Director of\nInternal Audit, and Director of Enterprise Development and Administration, as well as JM Bullion’s President and Chief Executive\nOfficer and its Chief Financial Officer. Finally, the CCDC is assisted by an external compliance consultant with over twenty years of\nIT experience, and A-Mark’s outside legal counsel for privacy and data security.\n31\nITEM 2.

The Company uses the following two non-GAAP measures:\n \"adjusted net income before provision for income taxes\", and\n \"earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization\", or \"EBITDA\".\n• Liquidity and financial condition. This section provides an analysis of our cash flows, as well as a discussion of our\noutstanding debt as of June 30, 2024, sources of liquidity and the amount of financial capacity available to fund our future\ncommitments and other financing arrangements.\n• Critical accounting policies and estimates. This section discusses critical accounting policies that are considered both\nimportant to our financial condition and results of operations and require management to make significant judgment and\nestimates. All of our significant accounting policies, including the critical accounting policies, are summarized in Note 2 to\nthe Company’s consolidated financial statements.\n• Recent accounting pronouncements. This section discusses new accounting pronouncements, dates of implementation, and\ntheir expected impact on our accompanying consolidated financial statements.\nEXECUTIVE OVERVIEW\nOur Business\nThe Company conducts its operations in three reportable segments: (i) Wholesale Sales & Ancillary Services, (ii) Direct-to-\nConsumer, and (iii) Secured Lending.\nWholesale Sales & Ancillary Services Segment\nThe Company operates its Wholesale Sales & Ancillary Services segment directly and through its consolidated subsidiaries, A-\nMark Trading AG (“AMTAG”), Transcontinental Depository Services, LLC (\"TDS\" or “Storage”), A-M Global Logistics, LLC\n(“AMGL” or \"Logistics\"), AM&ST Associates, LLC (\"AMST\" or the “Silver Towne Mint\"), and AM/LPM Ventures, LLC, which we\nformed in February 2024 to acquire LPM Group Limited (\"LPM\").\nThe Wholesale Sales & Ancillary Services segment operates as a full-service precious metals company. We offer gold, silver,\nplatinum, and palladium in the form of bars, plates, powder, wafers, grain, ingots, and coins. Our Industrial unit services manufacturers\nand fabricators of products utilizing or incorporating precious metals. Our Coin and Bar unit deals in approximately 2,100 coin and bar\nproducts in a variety of weights, shapes, and sizes for distribution to dealers and other qualified purchasers. We have a marketing support\noffice in Vienna, Austria, a numismatics showroom in Hong Kong, and a trading center in El Segundo, California. The trading center,\nfor buying and selling precious metals, is available to receive orders 24 hours every day, even when many major world commodity\nmarkets are closed. In addition to Wholesale Sales activity, A-Mark offers its customers a variety of ancillary services, including\nfinancing, storage, consignment, logistics, and various customized financial programs. As a U.S. Mint-authorized purchaser of gold,\nsilver, platinum, and palladium coins, A-Mark purchases product directly from the U.S. Mint, and it also purchases product from other\nsovereign mints, for sale to its customers.\nThrough its wholly-owned subsidiary AMTAG, the Company promotes its products and services to certain international markets.\nThrough our wholly-owned subsidiary TDS, we offer a variety of managed storage options for precious metals products to financial\ninstitutions, dealers, investors, and collectors around the world.\nThe Company's wholly-owned subsidiary AMGL is based in Las Vegas, Nevada, and provides our customers an array of\ncomplementary services, including receiving, handling, inventorying, processing, packing, and shipping of precious metals and custom\ncoins on a secure basis.\nThrough its wholly-owned subsidiary AMST, the Company designs and produces minted silver products. Our Silver Towne Mint\noperations allow us to provide greater product selection to our customers and greater pricing stability within the supply chain, as well\nas to gain increased access to fabricated silver products during volatile market environments, which have historically created higher\ndemand for precious metals products.\n36\nIn February 2024, the Company acquired LPM, one of Asia's largest precious metals dealers. Headquartered in Hong Kong, LPM\nextends A-Mark's global reach by offering its full-service precious metals products and services in Asia and internationally.\nDirect-to-Consumer\nThe Company operates its Direct-to-Consumer segment through its wholly-owned subsidiaries JM Bullion, Inc. (“JMB”) and\nGoldline, Inc. (“Goldline”), and through its investment in Silver Gold Bull, Inc. (\"SGB\"). JMB currently has six wholly-owned\nsubsidiaries: Buy Gold and Silver Corp. (\"BGASC\"), BX Corporation (\"BullionMax\"), Gold Price Group, Inc. (“GPG”), Silver.com,\nInc. (“Silver.com”), Provident Metals Corp. (“PMC”), and CyberMetals Corp. (\"CyberMetals\"). Goldline owns 100% of AMIP, LLC\n(\"AMIP\"). SGB and Goldline each have a 50% ownership interest in Precious Metals Purchasing Partners, LLC (\"PMPP\"). As the\ncontext requires, references to JMB may include BGASC, BullionMax, GPG, Silver.com, PMC, and CyberMetals and references to\nGoldline may include AMIP and PMPP.\nJMB is a leading e-commerce retailer providing access to a broad array of gold, silver, copper, platinum, and palladium products\nthrough its websites. JMB owns and operates numerous websites targeting specific niches within the precious metals retail market,\nincluding JMBullion.com, ProvidentMetals.com, Silver.com, CyberMetals.com, GoldPrice.org, SilverPrice.org, BGASC.com,\nBullionMax.com, and Gold.com.\nIn April 2022, JMB commercially launched the CyberMetals online platform, where customers can purchase and sell fractional\nshares of digital gold, silver, platinum, and palladium bars in a range of denominations. CyberMetals’ customers have the option to\nconvert their digital holdings to fabricated precious metals products via an integrated redemption flow with JMB. These products may\nbe designated for storage by the Company or shipped directly to the customer.\nThe Company acquired Goldline in August 2017 through an asset purchase transaction with Goldline, LLC, which had been in\noperation since 1960. Goldline is a direct retailer of precious metals to the investor community, and markets its precious metal products\non television, radio, and the internet, as well as through customer service outreach. AMIP manages Goldline’s intellectual property.\nPMPP was formed in fiscal 2019 pursuant to terms of a joint venture agreement between Goldline and SGB, for the purpose of\npurchasing precious metals from the partners' retail customers, and then reselling the acquired products back to affiliates of the partners.\nPMPP commenced operations in fiscal 2020.\nIn 2014, the Company acquired its initial ownership interest in SGB, a leading e-commerce precious metals retailer in Canada,\nincreasing its ownership to 55.4% in June 2024. Our investment in SGB expands our direct-to-consumer footprint in the international\nmarket. SGB's financial results and performance metrics have been included in our consolidated financial results from June 21, 2024,\nthe date we obtained a controlling ownership interest in SGB, and SGB became a consolidated subsidiary of the Company. Through its\nwebsite, SilverGoldBull.com, SGB offers a variety of products from gold, silver, platinum, and palladium bars, coins and rounds, as\nwell as certified coins from mints around the world.\nSecured Lending\nThe Company operates its Secured Lending segment through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Collateral Finance Corporation, LLC,\nincluding its wholly-owned subsidiary, CFC Alternative Investments (“CAI”) (collectively “CFC”).\nCFC is a California licensed finance lender that originates and acquires commercial loans secured primarily by bullion and\nnumismatic coins. CFC's customers include coin and precious metal dealers, investors, and collectors. As of June 30, 2024, CFC had\napproximately $113.1 million in secured loans outstanding, of which approximately 14.6% were acquired from third parties (some of\nwhich may be customers of A-Mark) and approximately 85.4% were originated by CFC.\nCAI is a holding company that has an equity method interest in Collectible Card Partners, LLC (“CCP”). CCP originates\ncommercial loans secured by graded sports cards. CCP commenced operations in fiscal 2022.\nAM Capital Funding, LLC (“AMCF”), previously a wholly-owned subsidiary of CFC, was formed for the purpose of securitizing\neligible secured loans of CFC. AMCF issued and administered Secured Senior Term Notes: Series 2018-1, Class A, with an aggregate\nprincipal amount of $72.0 million and Secured Subordinated Term Notes, Series 2018-1, Class B in the aggregate principal amount of\n$28.0 million (collectively referred to as the \"AMCF Notes\"). The AMCF Notes were repaid in full in December 2023. AMCF was\ndissolved in June 2024. See Note 15 to the Company’s consolidated financial statements for additional information.\n37\nOur Strategy\nThe Company was formed in 1965 and has grown into a significant participant in the bullion and coin markets, with $9.7 billion\nin revenues for fiscal year 2024. We have remained active in seeking investment opportunities to strategically enhance our business,\nand also continue to focus on growth in the volume of our business, our geographic presence, and the scope of complementary products,\nservices, and technological tools that we offer to our customers. In doing so, we seek to leverage off the strengths of our existing\nintegrated operations, which span trading, distribution, logistics, minting, storage, hedging, financing, and consignment products and\nservices, including:\n• our expertise in e-commerce and marketing;\n• the depth of our customer relationships and our ability to acquire and retain new customers;\n• our long-standing relationships with the United States Mint and other sovereign and private mints;\n• our access to market makers and suppliers;\n• our global trading systems;\n• our network of precious metals dealers;\n• our depository relationships around the world;\n• our design and production of minted silver products;\n• our ability to obtain more favorable pricing and financing terms due to our size;\n• our ability to manage exposure to commodity price risk through our experienced traders;\n• our distribution, storage and logistics capabilities;\n• our knowledge of secured lending; and\n• the quality and experience of our management team.\nOur Customers\nOur customers include financial institutions, bullion retailers, industrial manufacturers and fabricators, sovereign mints, refiners,\ncoin and metal dealers, investors, collectors, and e-commerce and other retail customers. The Company makes a two-way market in its\nwholesale operations, which results in many customers also operating as our suppliers in that segment. This diverse base of wholesale\ncustomers purchases a variety of products from the Company in a multitude of grades, primarily in the form of coins and bars. Our\nDirect-to-Consumer segment sells to (and, through JMB and PMPP, buys from) retail customers, with JMB and SGB focusing on e-\ncommerce operations and Goldline marketing through various traditional and e-commerce channels to the investor community. The\nDirect-to-Consumer segment offers these customers a variety of gold, silver, copper, platinum, and palladium products.\nFactors Affecting Revenues, Gross Profit, Interest Income, and Interest Expense\nSet forth below are the key factors affecting the Company’s revenues, gross profit, interest income, and interest expense. These\nfactors may be attributable to both the Company’s ongoing business activities as well as from Company acquisitions.\nRevenues. The Company enters into transactions to sell and deliver gold, silver, platinum, and palladium to industrial and\ncommercial users, coin and bullion dealers, mints, and financial institutions. The metals are investment or industrial grade and are sold\nin a variety of shapes and sizes.\nThe Company also sells and delivers gold, silver, platinum, palladium, and copper products directly to customers and the investor\ncommunity through its Direct-to Consumer segment. Customers may place orders online at one of the Company's websites or over the\nphone.\nThe Company sells precious metals on forward contracts at a fixed price based on current prevailing precious metal spot prices\nwith a certain delivery date in the future (up to six months from inception date of the forward contract). The Company also uses other\nderivative products (primarily futures contracts) or combinations thereof to hedge commodity risks. We enter into these forward and\nfutures contracts as part of our hedging strategy to mitigate our price risk of holding inventory; they are not entered into for speculative\npurposes.\nForward sales contracts by their nature are required to be included in revenues, unlike futures contracts which do not impact the\nCompany’s revenue. The decision to use a forward contract versus another derivative type of product (e.g., a futures contract) for\nhedging purposes is based on the economics of the transaction. Since the volume of hedging can be significant, the movement in and\nout of forwards can substantially impact revenues, either positively or negatively, from period to period. For this reason, the Company\nbelieves ounces sold (excluding ounces sold on forward sales contracts) is a meaningful metric to assess our top line performance.\n38\nIn addition, the Company earns revenue by providing storage solutions for precious metals and numismatic coins for financial\ninstitutions, dealers, investors, and collectors worldwide and by providing storage and order-fulfillment services to our retail customers.\nThe Company also earns revenue from advertisements placed on our Direct-to-Consumer websites. These revenue streams represent\nless than 1% of the Company’s consolidated revenues.\nThe Company operates in a high volume/low margin industry. Revenues are impacted by three primary factors: product volume,\nmarket prices, and market volatility. A material change in any one or more of these factors may result in a significant change in the\nCompany’s revenues. A significant increase or decrease in revenues can occur simply based on changes in the underlying commodity\nprices and may not be reflective of an increase or decrease in the volume of products sold.\nGross Profit. Gross profit is the difference between our revenues and the cost of our products sold. Since we quote prices based\non the current commodity market prices for precious metals, we enter into a combination of forward and futures contracts to effect a\nhedge position equal to the underlying precious metal commodity value, which substantially represents inventory subject to price risk.\nWe enter into these derivative transactions solely for the purpose of hedging our inventory, and not for speculative purposes. Our gross\nprofit includes the gains and losses resulting from these derivative instruments. However, the gains and losses on the derivative\ninstruments are substantially offset by the gains and losses on the corresponding changes in the market value of our precious metals\ninventory. As a result, our results of operations generally are not materially impacted by changes in commodity prices.\nInterest Income. The Company enters into secured loans and secured financing structures with its customers under which it charges\ninterest. CFC originates loans and acquires loan portfolios that are secured by precious metal bullion and numismatic material owned\nby the borrowers and held by the Company for the term of the loan. Also, the Company offers a number of secured financing options to\nits customers to finance their precious metals purchases including consignments and other structured inventory finance products whereby\nthe Company earns a fee based on the underlying value of the precious metal (\"repurchase arrangements with customers\").\nInterest Expense. The Company incurs interest expense associated with its lines of credit, notes payable, product financing\nagreements for the transfer and subsequent re-acquisition of gold, silver, and platinum at a fixed price with a third-party finance company\n(\"product financing arrangements\"), and short-term precious metal borrowing arrangements with our suppliers (\"liabilities on borrowed\nmetals\").\nPerformance Metrics\nIn addition to financial statement indicators, management also utilizes key operational metrics to assess the performance of our\nbusiness. SGB's performance metrics have been included in our consolidated financial results from June 21, 2024, the date we obtained\na controlling ownership interest in SGB, and SGB became a consolidated subsidiary of the Company.\nGold and Silver Ounces Sold and Delivered to Customers. A key performance metric we utilize is the number of ounces of gold\nand silver sold and delivered to our customers (excluding ounces recorded on forward contracts). These metrics reflect our business\nvolume without regard to changes in commodity pricing, which also impacts revenue, but can mask actual business trends.\nThe primary purpose of entering into forward sales transactions is to hedge commodity price risk. Although the revenues realized\nfrom these forward sales transactions are often significant, they generally have negligible impact on gross margins. As a result, the\nCompany excludes the ounces recorded on forward contracts from its performance metrics, as the Company does not enter into forward\nsales transactions for speculative purposes.\nWholesale Sales Ticket Volume. Another measure of our business that is unaffected by changes in commodity pricing is ticket\nvolume (or number of orders processed). Ticket volume for the Wholesale Sales & Ancillary Services segment measures the total\nnumber of wholesale orders processed during the period. In periods of higher volatility, there is generally increased trading in the\ncommodity markets, causing increased demand for our products, resulting in higher business volume. During periods of heightened\ndemand, order size per ticket may increase.\nDirect-to-Consumer Customers. We are focused on attracting new customers and retaining existing customers to drive revenue\ngrowth. We use the following three metrics as revenue growth indicators when assessing our customer base:\n• New Direct-to-Consumer Customers means the number of customers that have registered or set up a new account, made a\npurchase for the first time during the period, or acquired through investment activity.\n• Active Direct-to-Consumer Customers means the number of customers that have made a purchase during any month during\nthe period.\n• Total Direct-to-Consumer Customers means the aggregate number of customers that have registered or set up an account\nor have made a purchase in the past.\nDirect-to-Consumer Ticket Volume. Ticket volume for the Direct-to-Consumer segment measures the number of product orders\nprocessed during the period. In periods of higher volatility, there is generally increased consumer demand for our products, resulting in\nhigher business volume. We use the following three metrics indicators when assessing our ticket volume:\n39\n• Ticket Volume from New Direct-to-Consumer Customers means the number of product orders from new customers (refer to\nthe definition of new customers above) processed by JMB, Goldline, SGB, and PMPP during the period.\n• Ticket Volume from Pre-existing Direct-to-Consumer Customers means the number of product orders from pre-existing\ncustomers, processed by JMB, Goldline, SGB, and PMPP during the period.\n• Total Ticket Volume from Direct-to-Consumer Customers means the aggregate number of product orders processed by JMB,\nGoldline, SGB, and PMPP during the period.\nAverage Order Value. Average order value for the Direct-to-Consumer segment and JMB measures the average dollar value of\nproduct orders (excluding accumulation program orders) delivered to the customer during the period.\nInventory Turnover. Inventory turnover is another performance measure on which we are focused and is calculated as the cost of\nsales divided by the average inventory during the relevant period. Inventory turnover is a measure of how quickly inventory has moved\nduring the period. A higher inventory turnover ratio, which we typically experience during periods of higher volatility when trading is\nmore robust, typically reflects a more efficient use of our capital.\nThe period of time that inventory is held by the Company varies depending upon the nature of our inventory commitments with\ncustomers and suppliers. See Note 6 to the Company’s consolidated financial statements for a description of our classifications of\ninventory by type. When management analyzes inventory turnover on a period over period basis, consideration is given to each inventory\ntype and its corresponding impact on the inventory turnover calculation. For example:\n• The Company enters into various structured borrowing arrangements that commit the Company's inventory (such as product\nfinancing arrangements or liabilities on borrowed metals) for an unspecified period of time. While the Company is able to\nobtain access to this inventory on demand, this type of inventory tends not to turn over as quickly as other types of inventory.\n• The Company enters into repurchase arrangements with customers under which it holds precious metals which are subject\nto repurchase for an unspecified period of time. While the Company has legal title to this inventory, the Company is required\nto hold this inventory (or like-kind inventory) for the customer until the arrangement is terminated or the material is\nrepurchased by the customer. As a result, this type of inventory tends not to turn over as quickly as other types of inventory.\nAdditionally, our inventory turnover ratio can be affected by hedging activity, as the period over period change of the inventory\nturnover ratio may be significantly impacted by a period over period change in hedging volume. For example, if trading activity were\nto remain constant over two periods, but there were significantly higher forward sales in the current period compared to a prior period,\nthe calculated inventory turnover ratio would increase notwithstanding the constancy of the trading volume.\nNumber of Secured Loans. Finally, as a measure of the size of our Secured Lending segment, we utilize the number of outstanding\nsecured loans to customers that are primarily collateralized by precious metals at the end of each quarter.\nThe Company calculates a loan-to-value (\"LTV\") ratio for each loan as the principal amount of the loan divided by the liquidation\nvalue of the collateral, which is based on daily spot market prices of precious metal bullion. When the market price of the pledged\ncollateral decreases and thereby increases the LTV ratio of a loan above a prescribed maximum ratio, usually 85%, the Company has\nthe option to make a margin call on the loan. As a result, a decline of precious metal market prices may cause a decrease in the number\nof loans outstanding in a period.\nNon-GAAP Measures\nIn addition to key operational metrics that are used to assess the performance of our business, management also uses non-GAAP\nfinancial performance and liquidity measures. We believe \"adjusted net income before provision for income taxes” and \"EBITDA\" can\nprovide useful information to evaluate our financial performance and liquidity position. Non-GAAP measures do not have standardized\ndefinitions and should not be a substitute for measures that are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. For a reconciliation of these\nnon-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure reported in our consolidated statements of income and\nconsolidated statements of cash flows and a discussion of certain limitations inherent in such measures, refer to the “Non-GAAP\nMeasures” section below.\nFiscal Year\nOur fiscal year end is June 30 each year.\n40\nMacroeconomic Volatility\nContinued macroeconomic uncertainty and the volatility in the financial markets in recent years have positively affected the\nCompany’s trading revenues and gross profit as the volatility of the price of precious metals and numismatics typically results in an\nincrease in the spread between bid and ask prices on these products. Although conditions may fluctuate from period to period, when\nvolatility is high, we historically experience increased demand for products in each of our coin and bar, industrial, and retail businesses.\nWhile macroeconomic uncertainty continues to impact our business, its effects have been less pronounced in the current fiscal year. The\nCompany cannot predict the periods during which such increased volatility will occur or the level of such increased volatility, the effect\nof such volatility and macroeconomic uncertainty on the Company, or whether other effects on the Company and its businesses will\nmaterialize in the short or long term.\n41\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nOverview of Results of Operations\nConsolidated Results of Operations for the Years Ended June 30, 2024 and 2023\nThe operating results of our business were as follows (in thousands, except per share and performance metrics data):\nYear Ended June 30, 2024 2023 Change\n$ % of revenue $ % of revenue $ %\nRevenues $ 9,699,039 100.000% $ 9,286,561 100.000% $ 412,478 4.4%\nGross profit 173,255 1.786% 294,669 3.173% $ (121,414) (41.2%)\nSelling, general, and administrative expenses (89,800) (0.926%) (85,282) (0.918%) $ 4,518 5.3%\nDepreciation and amortization expense (11,397) (0.118%) (12,525) (0.135%) $ (1,128) (9.0%)\nInterest income 27,168 0.280% 22,231 0.239% $ 4,937 22.2%\nInterest expense (39,531) (0.408%) (31,528) (0.340%) $ 8,003 25.4%\nEarnings from equity method investments 4,044 0.042% 12,576 0.135% $ (8,532) (67.8%)\nOther income, net 2,071 0.021% 2,663 0.029% $ (592) (22.2%)\nRemeasurement gain on pre-existing equity\ninterest 16,669 0.172% — —% $ 16,669 —%\nUnrealized gains on foreign exchange 299 0.003% 366 0.004% $ (67) (18.3%)\nNet income before provision for income taxes 82,778 0.853% 203,170 2.188% $ (120,392) (59.3%)\nIncome tax expense (13,745) (0.142%) (46,401) (0.500%) $ (32,656) (70.4%)\nNet income 69,033 0.712% 156,769 1.688% $ (87,736) (56.0%)\nNet income attributable to\nnoncontrolling interests 487 0.005% 409 0.004% $ 78 19.1%\nNet income attributable to the Company $ 68,546 0.707% $ 156,360 1.684% $ (87,814) (56.2%)\nBasic and diluted net income per share attributable to\nA-Mark Precious Metals, Inc.:\nPer Share Data:\nBasic $ 2.97 $ 6.68 $ (3.71) (55.5%)\nDiluted $ 2.84 $ 6.34 $ (3.50) (55.2%)\nPerformance Metrics:(1)\nGold ounces sold(2) 1,839,000 2,667,000 (828,000) (31.0%)\nSilver ounces sold(3) 108,096,000 156,233,000 (48,137,000) (30.8%)\nInventory turnover ratio(4) 9.2 10.5 (1.3) (12.4%)\nNumber of secured loans at period end(5) 588 882 (294) (33.3%)\n(1) See \"Results of Segments\" for a description of additional metrics not listed above.\n(2) Gold ounces sold represents the ounces of gold product sold and delivered to the customer during the period, excluding ounces of gold recorded on forward\ncontracts.\n(3) Silver ounces sold represents the ounces of silver product sold and delivered to the customer during the period, excluding ounces of silver recorded on forward\ncontracts.\n(4) Inventory turnover ratio is the cost of sales divided by average inventory for the period presented above.

The number of secured loans outstanding decreased\nby 294, or 33.3% to 588 from 882 as of June 30, 2023.\nInterest Expense — Secured Lending\nin thousands\nYear Ended June 30, 2024 2023 Change\n% of interest % of interest\n$ income $ income $ %\nInterest expense $ (8,441) (73.817%) $ (7,770) (80.037%) $ 671 8.6%\nInterest expense for the year ended June 30, 2024 increased $0.7 million, or 8.6%, to $8.4 million from $7.8 million in 2023. The\nincrease in interest expense was primarily due to (i) an increase of $3.4 million associated with our Trading Credit Facility due to an\nincrease in interest rates as well as increased borrowings, partially offset by (ii) a decrease of $2.3 million related to the AMCF Notes\n(including amortization of debt issuance costs) due to the repayment in December 2023 and (iii) a $0.5 million decrease in loan servicing\nfees.\nSelling, General, and Administrative Expenses — Secured Lending\nin thousands\nYear Ended June 30, 2024 2023 Change\n% of interest % of interest\n$ income $ income $ %\nSelling, general, and administrative expenses $ (1,376) (12.033%) $ (2,125) (21.889%) $ (749) (35.2%)\nSelling, general, and administrative expenses for the year ended June 30, 2024 decreased $0.7 million, or 35.2%, to $1.4 million\nfrom $2.1 million in 2023. The change was primarily due to a decrease in consulting and professional fees of $0.3 million and a decrease\nin compensation expense (including performance-based accruals) of $0.2 million.\nOther Income, Net — Secured Lending\nin thousands\nYear Ended June 30, 2024 2023 Change\n% of interest % of interest\n$ income $ income $ %\nOther income, net $ 1,002 8.763% $ 2,360 24.310% $ (1,358) (57.5%)\nOther income, net for the year ended June 30, 2024 decreased $1.4 million, or 57.5%, to $1.0 million from $2.4 million in 2023\nprimarily due to lower royalties earned.\nNON-GAAP MEASURES\nAdjusted net income before provision for income taxes\nOverview\nIn addition to our results determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, we believe the non-GAAP measure of “adjusted net income\nbefore provision for income taxes” is useful in evaluating our operating performance. We use this financial measure to present our pre-\ntax earnings from core business operations. This measure does not have standardized definitions and is not prepared in accordance with\nU.S. GAAP. The items excluded from this financial measure may have a material impact on our financial results. Certain of those items\nare non-recurring, while others are non-cash in nature. Accordingly, this non-GAAP financial performance measure should be\nconsidered in addition to, and not as a substitute for or superior to, the comparable measures prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nReconciliation\nWe calculate this non-GAAP financial performance measure by eliminating from net income before provision for income taxes\nthe impact of items we do not consider indicative of our core operating performance. We eliminate the impact of the following items:\n(i) remeasurement gains or losses related to pre-existing equity interests, (ii) contingent consideration fair value adjustments, (iii)\nacquisition costs, (iv) amortization expenses related to intangible assets acquired, and (v) depreciation expense.\n52\nSee below for the reconciliation of this non-GAAP financial performance measure to its most closely comparable U.S. GAAP\nmeasure on our financial statements (in thousands):\nYear Ended June 30, 2024 2023 Change\n$ $ $ %\nNet income before provision for income taxes $ 82,778 $ 203,170 $ (120,392) (59.3%)\nAdjustments:\nRemeasurement gain on pre-existing equity interest (16,669) — $ 16,669 —%\nContingent consideration fair value adjustment (370) — $ 370 —%\nAcquisition costs 3,126 285 $ 2,841 996.8%\nAmortization of acquired intangibles 8,594 10,343 $ (1,749) (16.9%)\nDepreciation expense 2,803 2,182 $ 621 28.5%\nAdjusted net income before provision for income taxes (non-GAAP) $ 80,262 $ 215,980 $ (135,718) (62.8%)\nAdjustments\nRemeasurement gains or losses. When we acquired a controlling interest in SGB in June 2024, we had previously owned a\nnoncontrolling equity interest. We are required to estimate the fair value of our pre-existing equity investment as well as our option to\nacquire additional equity interests in SGB and record the change in the value as a remeasurement gain or loss in our consolidated\nstatements of income. We exclude these remeasurement gains and losses when we evaluate our on-going operational performance and\nto facilitate comparison of period-to-period operational performance. For additional information, see Note 1 to the Company’s\nconsolidated financial statements.\nContingent consideration fair value adjustments. Upon our acquisition of LPM, we recognized a contingent consideration liability\nrepresenting the amount we expect to pay in connection with the achievement of certain EBITDA targets. We remeasure this liability\neach reporting period, with the resulting changes recorded as other income and expense in the Company’s condensed consolidated\nstatements of income. We exclude these fair value adjustments when we evaluate our core operating performance and to facilitate\ncomparison of period-to-period operating performance. See Note 1 to the Company’s consolidated financial statements for additional\ninformation about our acquisition of LPM.\nAcquisition costs. We incur expenses for professional services rendered in connection with business combinations, which are\nincluded as a component of selling, general, and administrative expenses in the Company’s consolidated statements of income.\nAcquisition expenses are recorded in the periods in which the costs are incurred, and the services are received. We exclude acquisition\nexpenses when we evaluate our core operating performance and to facilitate comparison of period-to-period operating performance.\nAmortization of purchased intangibles. Amortization expense of purchased intangibles varies in amount and frequency and is\nsignificantly impacted by the timing and size of our acquisitions. Due to amortization expense being non-cash in nature, management\nfinds it useful to exclude these charges from our operating expenses to assist in the review of a measure that more closely corresponds\nto cash operating income generated from our business. Amortization of purchased intangible assets will recur in future periods. For\nadditional information about the amortization of our purchased intangibles. See Note 9 to the Company’s consolidated financial\nstatements.\nDepreciation expense. Depreciation expense is calculated using a straight-line method based on the estimated useful lives of the\nrelated assets, ranging from three years to twenty-five years. Due to depreciation expense being non-cash in nature, management finds\nit useful to exclude these charges from our operating expenses to assist in the review of a measure that more closely corresponds to cash\noperating income generated from our business. See Note 8 to the Company’s consolidated financial statements.\nEarnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization\nOverview\nIn addition to the non-GAAP financial performance measure discussed in the section above, we use the non-GAAP liquidity\nmeasure “earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization” or \"EBITDA\" to evaluate our business operations before\ninvesting activities, interest, and income taxes. Management and external users of our consolidated financial statements, such as industry\nanalysts and investors, may use EBITDA to compare business operations with other publicly traded companies.\nReconciliation\nWe calculate EBITDA by eliminating from net income the following five items: (i) interest income, (ii) interest expense, (iii)\namortization expenses related to intangible assets acquired, (iv) depreciation expense, and (v) income tax expense.\n53\nManagement believes the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure is “net cash provided by or used in operating\nactivities” presented in the consolidated statement of cash flows. Below is the reconciliation of net cash provided by or used in operating\nactivities to EBITDA (in thousands):\nYear Ended June 30, 2024 2023 Change\n$ $ $ %\nNet income $ 69,033 $ 156,769 $ (87,736) (56.0%)\nAdjustments:\nInterest income (27,168) (22,231) $ 4,937 22.2%\nInterest expense 39,531 31,528 $ 8,003 25.4%\nAmortization of acquired intangibles 8,594 10,343 $ (1,749) (16.9%)\nDepreciation expense 2,803 2,182 $ 621 28.5%\nIncome tax expense 13,745 46,401 $ (32,656) (70.4%)\n37,505 68,223 $ (30,718) (45.0%)\nEarnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (non-GAAP) $ 106,538 $ 224,992 $ (118,454) (52.6%)\nReconciliation of Operating Cash Flows to EBITDA:\nNet cash provided by (used in) operating activities $ 60,934 $ (30,323) $ 91,257 300.9%\nChanges in operating working capital 939 193,738 $ (192,799) (99.5%)\nInterest expense 39,531 31,528 $ 8,003 25.4%\nInterest income (27,168) (22,231) $ 4,937 22.2%\nIncome tax expense 13,745 46,401 $ (32,656) (70.4%)\nDividends and distributions received from equity method investees (642) (978) $ (336) (34.4%)\nEarnings from equity method investments 4,044 12,576 $ (8,532) (67.8%)\nRemeasurement gain on pre-existing equity interest 16,669 — $ 16,669 —%\nShare-based compensation (1,923) (2,176) $ (253) (11.6%)\nDeferred income taxes 2,690 (1,585) $ 4,275 269.7%\nAmortization of loan cost (2,447) (2,113) $ 334 15.8%\nOther 166 155 $ 11 7.1%\nEarnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (non-GAAP) $ 106,538 $ 224,992 $ (118,454) (52.6%)\nCash Flow Data:\nNet cash provided by (used in) operating activities $ 60,934 $ (30,323) $ 91,257 300.9%\nNet cash (used in) provided by investing activities $ (63,597) $ 6,839 $ (70,436) (1,029.9%)\nNet cash provided by financing activities $ 11,981 $ 25,019 $ (13,038) (52.1%)\nLIQUIDITY AND FINANCIAL CONDITION\nPrimary Sources and Uses of Cash\nOverview\nLiquidity refers to the availability to the Company of amounts of cash to meet all of our cash needs. Our sources of liquidity\nprincipally include cash from operations, Trading Credit Facility (see “Lines of Credit” below), and product financing arrangements.\nA substantial portion of our assets are liquid. As of June 30, 2024, approximately 78.4% of our assets consisted of cash,\nreceivables, derivative assets, secured loans receivables, precious metals held under financing arrangements, and inventories, measured\nat fair value. Cash generated from the sales or financing of our precious metals products is our primary source of operating liquidity.\nAmong other things, these include our product financing arrangements and liabilities on borrowed metals. Typically, the Company\nacquires its inventory by: (i) purchasing inventory from its suppliers by utilizing our own capital and lines of credit; (ii) borrowing\nprecious metals from its suppliers under short-term arrangements which may bear interest at a designated rate, and (iii) repurchasing\ninventory at an agreed-upon price based on the spot price on the specified repurchase date.\nIn addition to selling inventory, the Company generates cash from earning interest income. The Company enters into secured\nloans and secured financing structures with its customers under which it charges interest. The loans are secured by precious metals and\nnumismatic material, and graded sports cards owned by the borrowers and held by the Company as security for the term of the loan.\nThe Company also offers a number of secured financing options to its customers to finance their precious metals purchases including\nconsignments and other structured inventory finance products. Furthermore, our customers may enter into agreements whereby the\ncustomer agrees to repurchase our precious metals at the prevailing spot price for delivery of the product at a specific point in time in\nthe future; interest income is earned from the contract date until the material is delivered and paid for in full.\nWe may also raise funds through the public or private offering of equity or debt securities, although there is no assurance that we\nwill be able to do so at the times and in the amounts required.\n54\nWe continually review our overall credit and capital needs to ensure that our capital base, both stockholders’ equity and available\ncredit facilities, can appropriately support our anticipated financing needs. The Company also continually monitors its current and\nforecasted cash requirements and draws upon and pays down its lines of credit so as to minimize interest expense. See Note 15 to the\nCompany’s consolidated financial statements.\nLines of Credit\nin thousands\nJune 30, 2024 June 30, 2023 Change\nLines of credit - short term $ — $ 235,000 $ (235,000)\nLines of credit - long-term 245,000 — 245,000\n$ 245,000 $ 235,000 $ 10,000\nEffective December 21, 2021, A-Mark entered into a committed borrowing facility (the \"Trading Credit Facility\") with CIBC\nBank USA, as agent and joint lead arranger, and a syndicate of banks. As of June 30, 2024, the Trading Credit Facility provided the\nCompany with access up to $422.5 million and has a maturity date of September 20, 2025. The Trading Credit Facility was reclassified\nto long-term during the three months ended September 30, 2023 due to the elimination of provisions whereby lenders under certain\nconditions could require repayment of all obligations outstanding under the Trading Credit Facility within 10 days on demand. (See\nNote 15.)\nA-Mark routinely uses funds drawn under the Trading Credit Facility to purchase metals from its suppliers and for other operating\ncash flow purposes. Our CFC subsidiary also uses the funds drawn under the Trading Credit Facility to finance certain of its lending\nactivities.\nNotes Payable\nin thousands\nJune 30, 2024 June 30, 2023 Change\nNotes payable — short-term $ 8,367 $ 95,308 $ (86,941)\nNotes payable — long-term 3,994 — 3,994\n$ 12,361 $ 95,308 $ (82,947)\nIn September 2018, AMCF, previously a wholly-owned subsidiary of CFC, completed an issuance of Secured Senior Term Notes,\nSeries 2018-1, Class A in the aggregate principal amount of $72.0 million and Secured Subordinated Term Notes, Series 2018-1, Class\nB in the aggregate principal amount of $28.0 million (collectively, the \"AMCF Notes\".) The AMCF Notes were repaid in full in\nDecember 2023 and AMCF was dissolved in June 2024.\nIn April 2021, CCP entered into a loan agreement (\"CCP Note\") with CFC, which provides CFC with up to $4.0 million to fund\ncommercial loans secured by graded sports cards to its borrowers. All loans to be funded using the proceeds from the CCP Note are\nsubject to CCP’s prior written approval. In March 2024, the expiration date for the CCP Note was amended to expire on April 1, 2026\nand may be extended by mutual agreement. As of June 30, 2024 and June 30, 2023 the outstanding principal balance of the CCP Note\nwas $4.0 million and $0.5 million. See Note 14 to the Company’s consolidated financial statements.\nIn June 2024, SGB declared a $15.9 million dividend to existing shareholders based on certain levels of working capital. The\ndividend was paid on September 9, 2024. The dividend paid to the Company from SGB was $7.5 million which was recorded as a\ndividend receivable to A-Mark from SGB as of June 30, 2024 and has been eliminated upon consolidation. The remaining $8.4 million\ndue to the other shareholders was recorded as a note payable by SGB as of June 30, 2024.\nLiabilities on Borrowed Metals\nin thousands\nJune 30, 2024 June 30, 2023 Change\nLiabilities on borrowed metals $ 31,993 $ 21,642 $ 10,351\nWe borrow precious metals from our suppliers and customers under short-term arrangements using other precious metal from our\ninventory or precious metals held under financing arrangements as collateral. Amounts under these arrangements require repayment\neither in the form of precious metals or cash. Liabilities also arise from unallocated metal positions held by customers in our inventory.\nTypically, these positions are due on demand, in a specified physical form, based on the total ounces of metal held in the position.\n55\nProduct Financing Arrangements\nin thousands\nJune 30, 2024 June 30, 2023 Change\nProduct financing arrangements $ 517,744 $ 335,831 $ 181,913\nThe Company has agreements with financial institutions and other third parties that allow the Company to transfer its gold and\nsilver inventory to the third-party at an agreed-upon price based on the spot price, which provides alternative sources of liquidity. During\nthe term of the agreement both parties intend for inventory to be returned at an agreed-upon price based on the spot price on the\nrepurchase date. The third parties charge monthly interest as a percentage of the market value of the outstanding obligation; such monthly\ncharges are classified as interest expense. These transactions do not qualify as sales and therefore are accounted for as financing\narrangements and reflected in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets as product financing arrangements. The obligation is stated\nat the amount required to repurchase the outstanding inventory. Both the product financing arrangements and the underlying inventory\n(which is entirely restricted) are carried at fair value, with changes in fair value included as a component of cost of sales.\nSecured Loans Receivable\nin thousands\nJune 30, 2024 June 30, 2023 Change\nSecured loans receivable $ 113,067 $ 100,620 $ 12,447\nCFC is a California licensed finance lender that makes and acquires commercial loans secured by bullion and numismatic coins,\nand graded sports cards that affords our customers a convenient means of financing their inventory or collections. See Note 5 to the\nCompany’s consolidated financial statements. Prior to the repayment of the AMCF Notes, AMCF also purchased and held secured loans\nfrom CFC to meet its collateral requirements related to the AMCF Notes. See Note 15 to Company’s consolidated financial statements.\nMost of the Company's secured loans are short-term in nature. The renewal of these secured loans is at the discretion of the Company\nand, as such, provides us with some flexibility in regard to our capital deployment strategies.\nDividends\nThe Company’s board of directors has adopted a regular quarterly cash dividend policy of $0.20 per common share ($0.80 per\nshare on an annual basis). The declaration of regular cash dividends in the future is subject to the determination each quarter by the\nboard of directors. Below is a summary of dividends paid to stockholders in the year ended June 30, 2024.\n• On July 5, 2023, the Company's board of directors declared a regular dividend of $0.20 per share of common stock to\nstockholders of record at the close of business on July 17, 2023. The dividend was paid to stockholders on July 28, 2023\nand totaled $4.7 million.\n• On August 17, 2023, the Company's board of directors declared a non-recurring special dividend of $1.00 per share of\ncommon stock to share to stockholders of record at the close of business on September 12, 2023. The dividend to\nstockholders was paid on September 26, 2023 and totaled $23.4 million. On the same date, the Company's board of directors\ndeclared a regular dividend of $0.20 per share of common stock to stockholders of record at the close of business on October\n10, 2023. The dividend was paid to stockholders on October 24, 2023 and totaled $4.6 million.\n• On January 4, 2024, the Company's board of directors declared a regular dividend of $0.20 per share of common stock to\nstockholders of record at the close of business on January 16, 2024. The dividend was paid to stockholders on January 29,\n2024 and totaled $4.6 million.\n• On April 4, 2024, the Company's board of directors declared a regular dividend of $0.20 per share of common stock to\nstockholders of record at the close of business on April 16, 2024. The dividend was paid on April 29, 2024 and totaled $4.6\nmillion.\nSee Note 20 to the Company's consolidated financial statements for more information regarding our dividends.\nCash Flows\nThe majority of the Company’s trading activities involve two-day value trades under which payment is received in advance of\ndelivery or product is received in advance of payment. The combination of sales volume, inventory turnover, and precious metals price\nvolatility can cause material changes in the sources of cash used in or provided by operating activities on a daily basis. The Company\nmanages these variances through its liquidity forecasts and counterparty limits by maintaining a liquidity reserve to meet the Company’s\ncash needs. The Company uses various short-term financial instruments to manage the cycle of our trading activities from customer\npurchase order to cash collections and product delivery, which can cause material changes in the amount of cash used in or provided by\nfinancing activities on a daily basis.\n56\nThe following summarizes components of our consolidated statements of cash flows (in thousands):\nYear Ended June 30, 2024 June 30, 2023 Change\nNet cash provided by (used in) operating activities $ 60,934 $ (30,323) $ 91,257\nNet cash (used in) provided by investing activities $ (63,597) $ 6,839 $ (70,436)\nNet cash provided by financing activities $ 11,981 $ 25,019 $ (13,038)\nFor the periods presented, our principal capital requirements have been to fund (i) working capital and (ii) financing activity. Our\nworking capital requirements fluctuated with market conditions, the availability of precious metals, and the volatility of precious metals\ncommodity pricing.\nNet Cash Flows From Operating Activities\nOperating activities provided $60.9 million and used $30.3 million in cash for the years ended June 30, 2024 and 2023,\nrespectively, representing a $91.3 million change compared to the year ended June 30, 2023. The period over period change was\nprimarily due to net changes in working capital, which includes inventories, derivative liabilities, deferred revenue and other advances,\nliabilities on borrowed metals, accounts payable and other payables, precious metals held under financing arrangements, and receivables,\nnet, as well as a decrease in net income adjusted for noncash items, which includes a remeasurement gain of $16.7 million related to our\nacquisition of a controlling interest in SGB in June 2024.\nNet Cash Flows From Investing Activities\nInvesting activities used $63.6 million and provided $6.8 million in cash for the years ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively,\nrepresenting a $70.4 million change compared to the year ended June 30, 2023. This period over period change was primarily due to (i)\nhigher outflows of $37.1 million associated with the net originations of secured loans in the current period and (ii) $32.2 million of net\ncash paid to acquire LPM in February 2024 and SGB in June 2024, (iii) an increase in purchases of intangible assets of $3.5 million,\nand (iv) a $2.5 million increase in capital expenditures for property, plant and equipment, partially offset by (v) a decrease in purchases\nof long-term investments of $5.8 million.\nNet Cash Flows From Financing Activities\nFinancing activities provided $12.0 million and provided $25.0 million in cash for the years ended June 30, 2024 and 2023,\nrespectively, representing a $13.0 million change compared to the year ended June 30, 2023. This period over period change was\nprimarily due to (i) the $95.0 million repayment of our AMCF Notes in December 2023, (ii) an increase of $12.5 million cash used to\nrepurchase of our common stock under our share repurchase program, (iii) a decrease in cash provided from our net borrowings and\nrepayments of $10.0 million under our Trading Credit Facility, (iv) an increase in cash paid for dividends of $4.4 million, and (v) an\nincrease in debt issuance costs paid in the current year of $2.8 million primarily related to our Trading Credit Facility. These were\npartially offset by (i) an increase in cash provided of $104.4 million related to our product financing arrangements, (ii) an increase of\n$2.9 million on net borrowings on related party notes, (iii) an increase in cash provided of $1.4 million related to the exercise and taxes\nrelated to share-based awards, and (iv) a $1.0 million decrease in distributions paid to PMPP's noncontrolling interest holder.\nCapital Resources\nWe believe that our current cash availability under the Trading Credit Facility, product financing arrangements, financing derived\nfrom borrowed metals and the cash we anticipate generating from operating activities will provide us with sufficient liquidity to satisfy\nour working capital needs, capital expenditures, investment requirements, and commitments through at least the next twelve months.\nCONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS, CONTINGENT LIABILITIES AND COMMITMENTS\nCounterparty Risk\nWe face counterparty risks in our Wholesale Sales and Ancillary Services segment. We manage these risks by setting credit and\nposition risk limits with our trading counterparties, including gross position limits for counterparties engaged in sales and purchase\ntransactions and inventory consignment transactions with us, as well as collateral limits for different types of sale and purchase\ntransactions that counterparties may engage in from time to time.\nCommodities Risk and Derivatives\nWe use a variety of strategies to manage our risk including fluctuations in commodity prices for precious metals. Our inventory\nconsists of, and our trading activities involve, precious metals and precious metal products, for which prices are linked to the\ncorresponding precious metal commodity prices. The Company's precious metals inventory is subject to fluctuations in market value,\nresulting from changes in the underlying commodity prices. Inventory purchased or borrowed by us is subject to price changes. Inventory\nborrowed is a natural hedge, since changes in value of the metal held are offset by the obligation to return the metal to the supplier or\ndeliver metals to the customer.\n57\nOpen sale and purchase commitments in our trading activities are subject to changes in value between the date the purchase or\nsale price is fixed (the trade date) and the date the metal is received or delivered (the settlement date). We seek to minimize the effect\nof price changes of the underlying commodity through the use of forward and futures contracts. Our open sale and purchase commitments\ngenerally settle within 2 business days, and for those commitments that do not have stated settlement dates, we have the right to settle\nthe positions upon demand.\nOur policy is to substantially hedge our inventory position, net of open sale and purchase commitments that are subject to price\nrisk. We regularly enter into precious metals commodity forward and futures contracts with financial institutions to hedge against this\nrisk. We use futures contracts, which typically settle within 30 days, for our shorter-term hedge positions, and forward contracts, which\nmay remain open for up to six months, for our longer-term hedge positions. We have access to all of the precious metals markets,\nallowing us to place hedges. We also maintain relationships with major market makers in every major precious metals dealing center.\nThe Company enters into these derivative transactions solely for the purpose of hedging our inventory holding risk, and not for\nspeculative market purposes. Due to the nature of our hedging strategy, we are not using hedge accounting as defined under Derivatives\nand Hedging Topic 815 of the ASC (\"ASC 815\"). Unrealized gains or losses resulting from our forward and futures contracts are\nreported as cost of sales with the related amounts due from or to counterparties reflected as derivative assets or liabilities. The Company\nadjusts the derivatives to fair value on a daily basis until the transactions are settled. When these contracts are net settled, the unrealized\ngains and losses are reversed and the realized gains and losses for forward contracts are recorded in revenue and cost of sales and the\nnet realized gains and losses for futures are recorded in cost of sales.\nThe Company’s net gains and losses on derivative instruments totaled gains of $1.7 million and gains of $97.1 million for the\nyears ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. These were substantially offset by the changes in fair market value of the underlying\nprecious metals inventory and open sale and purchase commitments, which is also recorded in cost of sales in the consolidated statements\nof income.\nThe purpose of the Company's hedging policy is to substantially match the change in the value of the derivative financial\ninstrument to the change in the value of the underlying hedged item. The following table summarizes the results of our hedging activities,\nshowing the precious metal commodity inventory position, net of open sale and purchase commitments, which is subject to price risk,\ncompared to change in the value of the derivative instruments (in thousands):\nJune 30, 2024 June 30, 2023\nInventories $ 1,097,144 $ 981,643\nPrecious metals held under financing arrangements 22,066 25,530\n1,119,210 1,007,173\nLess unhedgeable inventories:\nCommemorative coin inventory, held at lower of cost or net realizable value (3,236) (948)\nPremium on metals position (34,175) (29,358)\nPrecious metal value not hedged (37,411) (30,306)\nCommitments at market:\nOpen inventory purchase commitments 817,900 921,108\nOpen inventory sales commitments (388,184) (587,392)\nMargin sale commitments (22,316) (17,682)\nIn-transit inventory no longer subject to market risk (21,715) (5,505)\nUnhedgeable premiums on open commitment positions 10,986 11,224\nBorrowed precious metals (31,993) (21,642)\nProduct financing arrangements (517,744) (335,831)\nAdvances on industrial metals 394 698\n(152,672) (35,022)\nPrecious metal subject to price risk 929,127 941,845\nPrecious metal subject to derivative financial instruments:\nPrecious metals forward contracts at market values 843,439 767,767\nPrecious metals futures contracts at market values 83,214 170,466\nTotal market value of derivative financial instruments 926,653 938,233\nNet precious metals subject to commodity price risk $ 2,474 $ 3,612\nWe are exposed to the risk of default of the counterparties to our derivative contracts. Significant judgment is applied by us when\nevaluating the fair value implications. We regularly review the creditworthiness of our major counterparties and monitor our exposure\nto concentrations. As of June 30, 2024, we believe our risk of counterparty default is mitigated based on our evaluation of the\ncreditworthiness of our major counterparties, the strong financial condition of our counterparties, and the short-term duration of these\narrangements.\n58\nWe had the following outstanding sale and purchase commitments and open forward and futures contracts, which are normal and\nrecurring, in nature (in thousands):\nJune 30, 2024 June 30, 2023\nPurchase commitments $ 817,900 $ 921,108\nSales commitments $ (388,184) $ (587,392)\nMargin sales commitments $ (22,316) $ (17,682)\nOpen forward contracts $ 843,439 $ 767,767\nOpen futures contracts $ 83,214 $ 170,466\nForeign exchange forward contracts $ 4,793 $ 7,101\nThe notional amounts of the commodity forward and futures contracts and the open sales and purchase orders, as shown in the\ntable above, are not reflected at the notional amounts in the consolidated balance sheets. The Company records commodity forward and\nfutures contracts at the fair value, which is the difference between the market price of the underlying metal or contract measured on the\nreporting date and the trade amount measured on the date the contract was transacted. The fair value of the open derivative contracts is\nshown as a component of derivative assets or derivative liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.\nThe Company enters into the derivative forward and future transactions solely for the purpose of hedging its inventory holding\nrisk, and not for speculative market purposes. The Company’s gains and losses on derivative instruments are substantially offset by the\nchanges in fair market value of the underlying precious metals inventory position, including our open sale and purchase commitments.\nThe Company records the derivatives at the trade date, and any corresponding unrealized gains or losses are shown as a component of\ncost of sales in the consolidated statements of income. We adjust the carrying value of the derivatives to fair value on a daily basis until\nthe transactions are physically settled. See Note 12 to the Company’s consolidated financial statements.\nCommitments and Contingencies\nRefer to Note 16 to the Company’s consolidated financial statements for information relating Company's commitments and\ncontingencies.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nThe Company’s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the\nUnited States (“U.S. GAAP”). In connection with the preparation of our financial statements, we are required to make estimates and\nassumptions about future events and apply judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and related\ndisclosures. We base our assumptions, estimates and judgments on historical experience, current trends and other factors that we believe\nto be relevant at the time the Company’s consolidated financial statements are prepared. On a regular basis, we review our accounting\npolicies, assumptions, estimates and judgments to ensure that the Company’s consolidated financial statements are presented fairly and\nin accordance with U.S. GAAP. However, because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty, actual results\ncould materially differ from our estimates.\nOur significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 2 to the Company’s consolidated financial statements. We believe that\nthe following accounting policies are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results, and\nthey require our most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters\nthat are inherently uncertain. We have reviewed these critical accounting estimates and related disclosures with the Audit Committee of\nour board of directors.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company accounts for its metals and sales contracts using settlement date accounting. Pursuant to such accounting, the\nCompany recognizes the sale or purchase of the metals at settlement date. During the period between the trade and settlement dates, the\nCompany enters into forward contracts that meet the definition of a derivative in accordance with the Derivatives and Hedging Topic\n815 of the ASC (“ASC 815”). The Company records the derivative at the trade date with any corresponding unrealized gain (loss),\nshown as component of cost of sales in the consolidated statements of income. The Company adjusts the derivatives to fair value on a\ndaily basis until the transactions are settled. When these contracts are settled, the unrealized gains and losses are reversed, and revenue\nis recognized for contracts that are physically settled. For contracts that are net settled, the realized gains and losses are recorded in cost\nof sales, with the exception of forward contracts, where their associated realized gains and losses are recorded in revenue and cost of\nsales, respectively.\nAlso, the Company recognizes its storage, logistics, licensing, advertising revenue, and other services revenues in accordance with\nASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which follows five basic steps to determine whether revenue can be recognized: (i)\nidentify the contract with a customer; (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (iii) determine the transaction price; (iv)\nallocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract, and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies\na performance obligation.\n59\nInventories\nThe Company's inventory, which primarily consists of bullion and bullion coins, is acquired and initially recorded at cost and then\nmarked to fair market value. The fair market value of the bullion and bullion coins comprises two components: (i) published market\nvalues attributable to the cost of the raw precious metal, and (ii) the market value of the premium, which is attributable to the incremental\nvalue of the product in its finished goods form. The market value attributable solely to such premium is readily determinable by reference\nto multiple sources. The precious metal component of the inventory may be hedged through the use of precious metal commodity\npositions, while the premium component of our inventory is not a commodity that may be hedged.\nThe Company’s inventory, except for certain lower of cost or net realizable value basis products (as described below), is\nsubsequently recorded at their fair market values. The daily changes in the fair market value of our inventory are offset by daily changes\nin the fair market value of hedging derivatives that are taken with respect to our inventory positions; both the change in the fair market\nvalue of the inventory and the change in the fair market value of these derivative instruments are recorded in cost of sales in the\nconsolidated statements of income.\nWhile the premium component included in inventory is marked-to-market, our commemorative coin inventory, including its\npremium component, is held at the lower of cost or net realizable value, because the value of commemorative coins is influenced more\nby supply and demand determinants than on the underlying spot price of the precious metal content of the commemorative coins. Unlike\nour bullion coins, the value of commemorative coins is not subject to the same level of volatility as bullion coins because our\ncommemorative coins typically carry a substantially higher premium over the spot metal price than bullion coins. Additionally, neither\nthe commemorative coin inventory nor the premium component of our inventory is hedged.\nInventory includes amounts borrowed from suppliers and customers arising from various arrangements including unallocated\nmetal positions held by customers in the Company’s inventory, amounts due to suppliers for the use of consigned inventory, metals held\nby suppliers as collateral on advanced pool metals, as well as shortages in unallocated metal positions held by the Company in the\nsupplier’s inventory. Unallocated or pool metal represents an unsegregated inventory position that is due on demand, in a specified\nphysical form, based on the total ounces of metal held in the position. Amounts under these arrangements require delivery either in the\nform of precious metals or cash. The Company mitigates market risk of its physical inventory and open commitments through\ncommodity hedge transactions. See Note 12 to the Company’s consolidated financial statements.\nThe Company enters into product financing agreements for the transfer and subsequent option or obligation to reacquire its gold\nand silver inventory at an agreed-upon price based on the spot price with a third-party finance company. This inventory is restricted and\nis held at a custodial storage facility in exchange for a financing fee, charged by the third-party finance company. During the term of\nthe financing agreement, the third-party company holds the inventory as collateral, and both parties intend for the inventory to be\nreturned to the Company at an agreed-upon price based on the spot price on the repurchase date. The third-party charges a monthly fee\nas a percentage of the market value of the outstanding obligation; such monthly charge is classified as interest expense. These\ntransactions do not qualify as sales and have been accounted for as financing arrangements in accordance with ASC 470-40 Product\nFinancing Arrangements, and are reflected in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets as product financing arrangements. The\nobligation is stated at the amount required to repurchase the outstanding inventory. Both the product financing and the underlying\ninventory (which is restricted) are carried at fair value, with changes in fair value included in cost of sales in the Company’s consolidated\nstatements of income.\nThe Company periodically loans metals to customers on a short-term consignment basis. Such inventory is removed at the time\nthe customer elects to price and purchase the metals, and the Company records a corresponding sale and receivable.\nThe Company enters into financing arrangements with certain customers under which A-Mark purchases precious metals products\nthat are subject to repurchase by the customer at the fair value of the product on the repurchase date. The Company or the counterparty\nmay typically terminate any such arrangement with 14 days' notice. Upon termination the customer’s rights to repurchase any remaining\ninventory is forfeited.\nBusiness Combinations\nThe accounting for a business combination requires tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed to be recorded\nat estimated fair value. We value intangible assets at their estimated fair values at the acquisition date based upon assumptions related\nto the future cash flows and discount rates utilizing the then currently available information, and in some cases, valuation results from\nindependent valuation specialists. The use of a discounted cash flow analysis requires significant judgment to estimate the future cash\nflows derived from the asset and the expected period of time over which those cash flows will occur and to determine an appropriate\ndiscount rate.\n60\nWe make certain judgments and estimates when determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business\ncombination. Those judgments and estimates also include determining the lives assigned to acquired intangibles, the resulting\namortization period, what indicators will trigger an impairment, whether those indicators are other than temporary, what economic or\ncompetitive factors affect valuation, valuation methodology, and key assumptions including discount rates and cash flow estimates. In\ncircumstances where an acquisition involves a contingent consideration arrangement, we recognize a liability equal to the fair value of\nthe expected contingent payments as of the acquisition date. We remeasure this liability each reporting period, with the resulting changes\nrecorded in earnings. The assumptions used in estimating fair value of contingent consideration liabilities require significant judgment;\nthe use of different assumptions and judgments could result in a materially different estimate of fair value which may have a material\nimpact on our results from operations and financial position.\nGoodwill and Other Purchased Intangible Assets\nWe evaluate goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangibles for impairment annually in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year (or\nmore frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist) in accordance with the Intangibles - Goodwill and Other Topic 350 of the\nASC (“ASC 350”). Other finite-lived intangible assets are evaluated for impairment when events or changes in business circumstances\nindicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. We may first qualitatively assess whether relevant events and\ncircumstances make it more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill is less than its carrying value. If, based on\nthis qualitative assessment, we determine that goodwill is more likely than not to be impaired, a quantitative impairment test is\nperformed. This step requires us to determine the fair value of the business and compare the calculated fair value of a reporting unit with\nits carrying amount, including goodwill. If through this quantitative analysis the Company determines the fair value of a reporting unit\nexceeds its carrying amount, the goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not to be impaired. If the Company concludes that the fair\nvalue of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, a goodwill impairment will be recognized for the amount by which the carrying\namount exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value.\nThe Company also performs impairment reviews on its indefinite-lived intangible assets (i.e., trade names, trademarks and domain\nnames). In assessing its indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment, the Company has the option to first perform a qualitative\nassessment to determine whether events or circumstances exist that lead to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair\nvalue of the indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount. If the Company determines that it is not more likely than\nnot that the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount, the Company is not required to perform any\nadditional tests in assessing the asset for impairment. However, if the Company concludes otherwise or elects not to perform the\nqualitative assessment, then it is required to perform a quantitative analysis to determine if the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible\nasset is less than its carrying value. If through a quantitative analysis the Company determines the fair value of an indefinite-lived\nintangible asset exceeds its carrying amount, the indefinite-lived intangible asset is considered not to be impaired. If the Company\nconcludes that the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying value, an impairment will be recognized for\nthe amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the indefinite-lived intangible asset’s fair value.\nIncome Taxes\nAs part of the process of preparing the Company’s consolidated financial statements, the Company is required to estimate its\nprovision for income taxes in each of the tax jurisdictions in which it conducts business, in accordance with Income Taxes Topic 740 of\nthe ASC (\"ASC 740\"). The Company computes its annual tax rate based on the statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities\navailable to it in the various jurisdictions in which it earns income. Significant judgment is required in determining the Company's\nannual tax rate and in evaluating uncertainty in its tax positions. The Company has adopted the provisions of ASC 740-10, which clarifies\nthe accounting for uncertain tax positions. ASC 740-10 requires that the Company recognizes the impact of a tax position in the financial\nstatements if the position is not more likely than not to be sustained upon examination based on the technical merits of the position. The\nCompany recognizes interest and penalties related to certain uncertain tax positions as a component of income tax expense and the\naccrued interest and penalties are included in deferred and income taxes payable in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. See\nNote 13 to the Company’s consolidated financial statements for more information on the Company’s accounting for income taxes.\nIncome taxes are accounted for using an asset and liability approach that requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and\nliabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements. Under this method,\ndeferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and\nliabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect of a change in tax\nrates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance\nis provided when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the net deferred tax assets will not be realized. The factors used to\nassess the likelihood of realization include the Company's forecast of the reversal of temporary differences, future taxable income, and\navailable tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the net deferred tax assets. Failure to achieve forecasted taxable\nincome in applicable tax jurisdictions could affect the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets and could result in an increase in the\nCompany's effective tax rate on future earnings. Based on our assessment, it appears more likely than not that all of the net deferred tax\nassets will be realized through future taxable income.\n61\nRECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\nFor a description of accounting changes and recent accounting standards, including the expected dates of adoption and estimated\neffects, if any, on our financial position or results of operations, see Note 2 to the Company’s consolidated financial statements.\nITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nMarket Risk\nMarket risk is the risk that changes in market conditions may adversely impact the value of assets or liabilities, or otherwise\nnegatively impact earnings. The Company is exposed to market risk related to changes in commodity prices.\nThe Company's precious metals inventory is subject to fluctuations in market value, resulting from changes in the underlying\ncommodity prices. Inventory purchased or borrowed by the Company is subject to price changes. Open sale and purchase commitments\nare subject to changes in value between the date the purchase or sale price is fixed (the trade date) and the date the metal is received or\ndelivered (the settlement date).\nTo manage the volatility related to this exposure, the Company enters into precious metals commodity forward and futures\ncontracts. Our policy is to substantially hedge our inventory position, net of open sale and purchase commitments that are subject to\nprice risk. We similarly seek to minimize the effect of price changes on our open sale and purchase commitments through hedging\nactivity. Inventory borrowed is considered a natural hedge, since changes in value of the metal held are offset by the obligation to return\nthe metal to the supplier.\nWe generally use futures contracts for our shorter-term hedge positions, and forward contracts, which may remain open for up to\nsix months, for our longer-term hedge positions. We have access to all of the precious metals markets, allowing us to place hedges. We\nalso maintain relationships with major market makers in every major precious metals dealing center. We enter into these derivative\ncontracts for the purpose of hedging substantially all of our market exposure to precious metals prices, and not for speculative purposes.\nAs a result of these hedging strategies, we do not believe we have a material exposure to market risk.\nThe Company is exposed to the risk of failure of the counterparties to its derivative contracts. The Company regularly reviews the\ncreditworthiness of its major counterparties and monitors its exposure to concentrations. The Company believes its risk of counterparty\ndefault is mitigated as a result of such evaluation and the short-term duration of these arrangements.\nSee Note 12 to the Company's consolidated financial statements, “Derivative Instruments and Hedging Transactions”.\nForeign Exchange Risk\nForeign exchange risk represents exposures to changes in the values of current holdings and future cash flows denominated in\ncurrencies other than the U.S. dollar. The types of instruments exposed to this risk include foreign currency denominated receivables\nand payables and future cash flows in foreign currencies arising from foreign exchange transactions.\nThe functional currencies of our recent acquisitions LPM and SGB are U.S. dollars and therefore, we do not believe our exposure\nto foreign exchange risk related to these entities is material.\nTo manage the effect of foreign currency exchange fluctuations on its sale and purchase transactions, the Company utilizes foreign\ncurrency forward contracts with maturities of generally less than one week. Because of these hedging policies, we do not believe our\nexposure to foreign exchange risk is material.\nSee Note 12 to the Company’s consolidated financial statements, “Derivative Instruments and Hedging Transactions—Foreign\nCurrency Exchange Rate Management.”\nInterest Rate Risk\nOur exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our product financing arrangements and Trading\nCredit Facility. We are subject to fluctuations in interest rates based on the variable interest terms of these arrangements, and we do not\nutilize derivative contracts to hedge the interest rate fluctuation. See Note 15 to the Company's consolidated financial statements,\n\"Financing Agreements\".\nWe manage the interest rate risks related to our interest income generating activities by increasing our secured loan interest rates\nand finance product pricing in response to rising interest rates.

(a Delaware corporation) and\nsubsidiaries (the “Company”) as of June 30, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of income, stockholders’ equity and\ncash flows for each of the three years in the period ended June 30, 2024, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “financial\nstatements”). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of\nJune 30, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended June 30, 2024,\nin conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)\n(“PCAOB”), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2024, based on criteria established in the 2013\nInternal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission\n(“COSO”), and our report dated September 13, 2024 expressed an unqualified opinion.\nBasis for opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on\nthe Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required\nto be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and\nregulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the\naudit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or\nfraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due\nto error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence\nregarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used\nand significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe\nthat our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical audit matters\nCritical audit matters are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or\nrequired to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial\nstatements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. We determined that there are no critical audit\nmatters.\n/s/ GRANT THORNTON LLP\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2015.\nNewport Beach, California\nSeptember 13, 2024\n64\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nBoard of Directors and Stockholders\nA-Mark Precious Metals, Inc.\nOpinion on internal control over financial reporting\nWe have audited the internal control over financial reporting of A-Mark Precious Metals, Inc. (a Delaware corporation) and\nsubsidiaries (the “Company”) as of June 30, 2024, based on criteria established in the 2013 Internal Control—Integrated Framework\nissued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”). In our opinion, the Company\nmaintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2024, based on criteria established\nin the 2013 Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by COSO.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)\n(“PCAOB”), the consolidated financial statements of the Company as of and for the year ended June 30, 2024, and our report dated\nSeptember 13, 2024 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.\nBasis for opinion\nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its\nassessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report\non Internal Control Over Financial Reporting (“Management’s Report”). Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s\ninternal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required\nto be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and\nregulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the\naudit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material\nrespects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material\nweakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and\nperforming such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable\nbasis for our opinion.\nOur audit of, and opinion on, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting does not include the internal control over\nfinancial reporting of LPM Group Limited, a wholly-owned subsidiary, and Silver Gold Bull, Inc., a majority-owned consolidated\nsubsidiary. LPM Group Limited comprised approximately 3% of total assets and less than 1% of total revenues of the related\nconsolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended June 30, 2024. Silver Gold Bull, Inc. comprised approximately\n10% of total assets and less than 1% of total revenue of the related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended\nJune 30, 2024. As indicated in Management’s Report, LPM Group Limited and Silver Gold Bull, Inc. were both acquired during 2024.\nManagement’s assertion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting excluded internal control over\nfinancial reporting of LPM Group Limited and Silver Gold Bull, Inc.\nDefinition and limitations of internal control over financial reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the\nreliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted\naccounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to\nthe maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the\ncompany; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in\naccordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in\naccordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention\nor timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the\nfinancial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,\nprojections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of\nchanges in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ GRANT THORNTON LLP\nNewport Beach, California\nSeptember 13, 2024\n65\nA-MARK PRECIOUS METALS, INC.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\n(in thousands)\nIn September 2018, AM Capital Funding, LLC (“AMCF”), previously a wholly-owned subsidiary of Collateral Finance\nCorporation (\"CFC”), completed an issuance of Secured Senior Term Notes, Series 2018-1, Class A in the aggregate principal amount\nof $72.0 million and Secured Subordinated Term Notes, Series 2018-1, Class B in the aggregate principal amount of $28.0 million\n(collectively, the \"AMCF Notes\"). In December 2023, the AMCF Notes were repaid in full; AMCF was dissolved in June 2024.\nThe Company consolidates a variable interest entity (\"VIE\") if the Company is considered to be the primary beneficiary. Prior to\ndissolution, AMCF was a VIE because its initial equity investment may have been insufficient to maintain its ongoing collateral\nrequirements without additional financial support from the Company. The Company was the primary beneficiary of this VIE because\nthe Company had the right to determine the type of collateral (i.e., cash, secured loans, or precious metals), had the right to receive (and\nhas received) the proceeds from the securitization transaction, earn ongoing interest income from the secured loans (subject to collateral\nrequirements), and had the obligation to absorb losses should AMCF's interest expense and other costs have exceeded its interest income.\nThe following table presents the assets and liabilities of this VIE, which are included in the consolidated balance sheets above.\nDue to the repayment of the AMCF Notes in December 2023, the VIE did not have assets or liabilities as of June 30, 2024. When\noutstanding, the holders of the AMCF Notes had a first priority security interest in the assets as shown in the table below, which were\nin excess of the AMCF Notes' aggregate principal amount. Additionally, the liabilities of the VIE included intercompany balances,\nwhich were eliminated in consolidation.

We offer gold, silver,\nplatinum, and palladium in the form of bars, plates, powder, wafers, grain, ingots, and coins. Our Industrial unit services manufacturers\nand fabricators of products utilizing or incorporating precious metals. Our Coin and Bar unit deals in approximately 2,100 coin and bar\nproducts in a variety of weights, shapes, and sizes for distribution to dealers and other qualified purchasers. We have a marketing support\noffice in Vienna, Austria, a numismatics showroom in Hong Kong, and a trading center in El Segundo, California. The trading center,\nfor buying and selling precious metals, is available to receive orders 24 hours every day, even when many major world commodity\nmarkets are closed. In addition to Wholesale Sales activity, A-Mark offers its customers a variety of ancillary services, including\nfinancing, storage, consignment, logistics, and various customized financial programs. As a U.S. Mint-authorized purchaser of gold,\nsilver, platinum, and palladium coins, A-Mark purchases product directly from the U.S. Mint, and it also purchases product from other\nsovereign mints, for sale to its customers.\nThrough its wholly-owned subsidiary AMTAG, the Company promotes its products and services to certain international markets.\nThrough our wholly-owned subsidiary TDS, we offer a variety of managed storage options for precious metals products to financial\ninstitutions, dealers, investors, and collectors around the world.\nThe Company's wholly-owned subsidiary AMGL is based in Las Vegas, Nevada, and provides our customers an array of\ncomplementary services, including receiving, handling, inventorying, processing, packing, and shipping of precious metals and custom\ncoins on a secure basis.\nThrough its wholly-owned subsidiary AMST, the Company designs and produces minted silver products. Our Silver Towne Mint\noperations allow us to provide greater product selection to our customers as well as to gain increased access to silver during volatile\nmarket environments, which have historically created higher demand for precious metals products.\nLPM\nOn February 26, 2024 (the \"Acquisition Date\"), through our subsidiary AM/LPM Ventures, LLC, we acquired 100% of the issued\nand outstanding equity interests of LPM, a precious metals dealer with primary operations in Asia, for total upfront consideration of\n$41.4 million, consisting of $37.5 million in cash, 139,455 shares of A-Mark common stock that had a fair value of $3.5 million on the\ndate of transfer, and $0.4 million related to the settlement of pre-existing payables due to A-Mark. On the Acquisition Date, we entered\ninto a number of related agreements, including (i) a consulting agreement with Cerberus Limited to provide consulting services to LPM\nthrough 2028, subject to earlier termination under certain circumstances, and (ii) a lock-up agreement with the selling stockholder of\nLPM that restricts the sale or transfer of the A-Mark common stock for 270 days after the Acquisition Date, subject to customary\nexceptions.\nEffective as of the Acquisition Date, Aquila Holding LLC, a company affiliated with Cerberus Limited, purchased a 5% interest\nin AM/LPM Ventures, LLC for $2.1 million.\nWe incurred $2.8 million of transaction costs related to the acquisition of LPM, which are shown as a component of selling,\ngeneral, and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of income. The financial results of LPM were included in our\nconsolidated financial statements as of the Acquisition Date.\n71\nWe may be required to pay contingent consideration up to $37.5 million in cash in connection with the acquisition of LPM if\ncertain earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (\"EBITDA\") targets are met for 2024, 2025, and 2026. As of the\nAcquisition Date, the fair value of this contingent consideration was $2.8 million. The material factors that may impact the fair value of\nthe contingent consideration, and therefore, this liability, are the probabilities and timing of achieving the related targets, which are\nestimated at each reporting date with changes reflected as selling, general, and administrative expense. As of June 30, 2024, the fair\nvalue of the contingent consideration was $2.4 million, which was classified as other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet.\nAssets acquired and liabilities assumed were recorded based on valuations derived from estimated fair value assessment and\nassumptions used by us. While we believe that our estimates and assumptions underlying the valuations are reasonable, different\nestimates or assumptions could result in different valuations assigned to the individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed, and the\nresulting amount of goodwill. The following table summarizes the purchase price recorded and fair values of assets acquired and\nliabilities assumed through our acquisition of LPM as of the Acquisition Date (in thousands):\nCash $ 37,506\nContingent consideration 2,800\nCommon stock 3,514\nSettlement of pre-existing payables due to A-Mark 398\nTotal purchase price $ 44,218\nCash $ 5,033\nReceivables, net 4,105\nInventories 16,807\nOther current assets 515\nProperty, plant, and equipment, net 1,306\nTrade names 3,500\nExisting customer relationships 6,800\nOther long-term assets 956\nTotal identifiable assets acquired 39,022\nAccounts payable and other payables (526)\nDeferred revenue and other advances (11,361)\nAccrued liabilities (1,729)\nOther liabilities (2,222)\nNet identifiable assets acquired 23,184\nGoodwill 21,034\nTotal purchase price $ 44,218\nBased on the guidance provided in Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\") 805, Business Combinations, we accounted for\nthe acquisition of LPM as a business combination and determined that (i) LPM was a business which combines inputs and processes to\ncreate outputs, and (ii) substantially all of the fair value of gross assets acquired was not concentrated in a single identifiable asset or\ngroup of similar identifiable assets.\nDuring the fourth fiscal quarter of 2024, we recorded adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed from the acquisition\nof LPM that resulted in a change in working capital balances and an increase in goodwill by $1.0 million.\nWe measured the identifiable assets and liabilities assumed at their acquisition date fair values separately from goodwill. Through\nthe acquisition of LPM, we acquired intangible assets representing existing customer relationships and trade names. The existing\ncustomer relationships acquired were determined to have a weighted-average useful life of 7.2 years. The fair value of the customer\nrelationships was estimated using an attrition methodology which considers the estimated future discounted cash flows to be derived\nfrom the existing customers as of the Acquisition Date. The fair value of the trade names was estimated using a relief-from-royalty\napproach.\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired. The\nacquisition of LPM resulted in the recognition of $21.0 million of goodwill, which we believe relates primarily to the resulting synergies\nof utilizing A-Mark's established integrated precious metals platform with LPM's underlying customer base and our ability to expand\noperations within the region. The goodwill created as a result of the acquisition of LPM is deductible for U.S. tax purposes.\nThe following unaudited pro forma consolidated results of operations for the years ended June 30, 2024 and 2023 assumes that\nthe acquisition of LPM occurred as of July 1, 2022 (in thousands):\nYear Ended June 30,\n2024 2023\nRevenues $ 9,788,941 $ 9,674,149\nNet income $ 68,469 $ 158,658\n72\nThe above pro forma supplemental information does not purport to be indicative of what the Company's operations would have\nbeen had these transactions occurred on July 1, 2022, and should not be considered indicative of future operating results. The Company\nbelieves the assumptions used provide a reasonable basis for reflecting the significant pro forma effects directly attributable to the\nacquisition of LPM. The unaudited pro forma information accounts for: (i) the elimination of transactions between the Company and\nLPM, and (ii) adjustments to the amortization expense resulting from the estimated fair value of the acquired finite-lived intangible\nassets, acquisition costs, consulting fees, share-based compensation expense, and the resulting impact to the income tax provision.\nDirect-to-Consumer\nThe Company operates its Direct-to-Consumer segment through its wholly-owned subsidiaries JM Bullion, Inc. (“JMB”) and\nGoldline, Inc. (“Goldline”), and through its investment in Silver Gold Bull, Inc. (\"SGB\"). As of June 30, 2024, JMB had six wholly-\nowned subsidiaries: Buy Gold and Silver Corp. (\"BGASC\"), BX Corporation (\"BullionMax\"), Gold Price Group, Inc. (“GPG”),\nSilver.com, Inc. (“Silver.com”), Provident Metals Corp. (“PMC”), and CyberMetals Corp. (\"CyberMetals\"). Goldline, Inc. owns 100%\nof AMIP, LLC (\"AMIP\"). SGB and Goldline each have a 50% ownership interest in Precious Metals Purchasing Partners, LLC\n(\"PMPP\"). As the context requires, references in these Notes to JMB may include BGASC, BullionMax, GPG, Silver.com, PMC, and\nCyberMetals, and references to Goldline may include AMIP and PMPP.\nJM Bullion, Inc.\nJMB is a leading e-commerce retailer providing access to a broad array of gold, silver, copper, platinum, and palladium products\nthrough its websites. JMB owns and operates numerous websites targeting specific niches within the precious metals retail market,\nincluding JMBullion.com, ProvidentMetals.com, Silver.com, CyberMetals.com, GoldPrice.org, SilverPrice.org, BGASC.com,\nBullionMax.com, and Gold.com. Typically, JMB offers approximately 6,200 different products during a fiscal year, measured by stock\nkeeping units or SKUs, on its websites. This number can vary over time, particularly when demand is high and certain SKUs may be\nout of stock.\nIn April 2022, JMB commercially launched the CyberMetals online platform, where customers can purchase and sell fractional\nshares of digital gold, silver, platinum, and palladium bars in a range of denominations. CyberMetals’ customers have the option to\nconvert their digital holdings to fabricated precious metals products via an integrated redemption flow with JMB. These products may\nbe designated by the customer for storage by the Company or shipped directly to the customer.\nGoldline, Inc.\nThe Company acquired Goldline in August 2017 through an asset purchase transaction with Goldline, LLC, which had been in\noperation since 1960. Goldline is a direct retailer of precious metals to the investor community, and markets its precious metal products\non television, radio, and the internet, as well as through customer service outreach. Goldline’s subsidiary AMIP manages its intellectual\nproperty. PMPP was formed in fiscal 2019 pursuant to terms of a joint venture agreement with SGB, for the purpose of purchasing\nprecious metals from the partners' retail customers, and then reselling the acquired products back to affiliates of the partners. PMPP\ncommenced its operations in fiscal 2020.\nSilver Gold Bull, Inc.\nIn 2014, the Company acquired its initial ownership interest in SGB, a leading e-commerce precious metals retailer in Canada.\nThrough its website, SilverGoldBull.com, SGB offers a variety of products from gold, silver, platinum, and palladium bars, coins and\nrounds, as well as certified coins from mints around the world. In 2018 and 2022, the Company made incremental investments to increase\nits ownership interest in SGB to 47.4% as of June 2022. Also in June 2022, the Company acquired an option to purchase an additional\n27.6% of the outstanding equity of SGB to bring the Company's ownership interest up to 75%. On June 21, 2024, the Company exercised\npart of its option and acquired an additional 8% ownership interest in SGB for $9.6 million, increasing its ownership interest to 55.4%,\nat which point SGB became a consolidated subsidiary of the Company. The increased investment in SGB allows the Company to\ncontinue its strategy to further expand internationally, particularly in Canada.\nIn connection with the exercise of its option in June 2024, the Company modified certain terms and conditions of its option to\nacquire additional ownership interest in SGB, including extending the term of the remaining unexercised option to September 2025 as\nwell as reducing the option to increase its ownership from 75% to 70%. The Company recorded a $3.0 million adjustment to reduce the\nfair value of the option to purchase additional ownership in SGB to $2.3 million immediately before modification and partial exercise.\nThis was recorded to remeasurement gain on pre-existing equity interest in our consolidated statements of income. In accordance with\nASC 480, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity, the resulting modified option was not determined to be separately exercisable from\nthe remaining shares of SGB, and therefore the value is embedded within the noncontrolling interest of SGB.\n73\nIn June 2024, SGB declared a $15.9 million dividend to existing shareholders based on certain levels of working capital. The\ndividend was paid on September 9, 2024. The dividend paid to the Company from SGB was $7.5 million which was recorded as a\ndividend receivable to A-Mark from SGB as of June 30, 2024 and has been eliminated upon consolidation. The dividend receivable of\n$7.5 million is included in the settlement of pre-existing payables in the table below; the remaining $8.4 million due to the other\nshareholders was recorded as a note payable by SGB.\nWe also entered into employment agreements with and granted equity awards to key SGB management.\nThe acquisition of the controlling interest in SGB was accounted for as a business combination achieved in stages. As a result of\nthe change in control, the Company was required to remeasure its pre-existing equity investment in SGB at fair value prior to\nconsolidation. We estimated the fair value of our 47.4% pre-existing ownership interest in SGB to be approximately $56.8 million and\nthe fair value of the noncontrolling interest to be $50.7 million. The remeasurement resulted in a net pretax gain of $16.7 million, which\nis presented in the Company's consolidated statements of income as remeasurement gain on pre-existing equity interest. The net\nremeasurement gain also reflects the $1.3 million derecognition of accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax, related to the\ncurrency translation adjustment of SGB upon gaining a controlling ownership interest.\nThe value of the pre-existing equity and noncontrolling interests as of the acquisition date were based on valuations derived from\nestimated fair value assessments and assumptions made by us. These fair value assessments were determined using a market approach.\nWe incurred $0.2 million of transaction costs related to the acquisition of a controlling interest in SGB, which are shown as a\ncomponent of selling, general, and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of income. The financial results of SGB after\nobtaining a controlling interest were included in our consolidated financial statements as of the acquisition date.\nAssets acquired and liabilities assumed were recorded based on valuations derived from estimated fair value assessments and\nassumptions used by us. While we believe that our estimates and assumptions underlying the valuations are reasonable, different\nestimates or assumptions could result in different valuations assigned to the individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed, and the\nresulting amount of goodwill. The following table summarizes the purchase price recorded and fair values of assets acquired and\nliabilities assumed through our acquisition of a controlling interest in SGB as of the acquisition date (in thousands):\nCash $ 9,600\nPre-existing equity method investment 56,848\nOption to acquire additional equity interest 2,300\nNoncontrolling interests 50,652\nSettlement of pre-existing payables due to A-Mark 9,418\nTotal purchase price $ 128,818\nCash $ 10,203\nReceivables, net 10,968\nInventories 45,936\nOther current assets 2,246\nProperty, plant, and equipment, net 2,071\nTrade names 6,512\nExisting customer relationships 13,000\nDeveloped technology 9,300\nOther long-term assets 5,809\nTotal identifiable assets acquired 106,045\nProduct financing arrangements (24,372)\nAccounts payable and other payables (7,205)\nDeferred revenue and other advances (5,085)\nAccrued liabilities (1,231)\nNotes payable (8,367)\nDeferred tax liability (6,624)\nOther liabilities (2,303)\nNet identifiable assets acquired 50,858\nGoodwill 77,960\nTotal purchase price $ 128,818\nBased on the guidance provided in ASC 805, Business Combinations, we accounted for the acquisition of a controlling interest in\nSGB as a business combination achieved in stages and determined that (i) SGB was a business which combines inputs and processes to\ncreate outputs, and (ii) substantially all of the fair value of gross assets acquired was not concentrated in a single identifiable asset or\ngroup of similar identifiable assets.\nOur purchase price allocation is preliminary and subject to revision as additional information about fair value of assets and\nliabilities becomes available, primarily related to information pertaining to working capital and tax balances. Additional information\nthat existed as of the acquisition date but at the time was unknown to us may become known to us during the remainder of the\nremeasurement period, a period not to exceed 12 months from the acquisition date.\n74\nWe measured the identifiable assets and liabilities assumed at their acquisition date fair values separately from goodwill. Through\nthe acquisition of a controlling interest in SGB, we acquired intangible assets representing existing customer relationships, developed\ntechnology, and trade names. The existing customer relationships and developed technology acquired were determined to have a useful\nlife of 4.0 years. The fair value of the customer relationships was estimated using an attrition methodology which considers the estimated\nfuture discounted cash flows to be derived from the existing customers as of the acquisition date. The fair value of the developed\ntechnology was estimated using the cost to recreate method. The fair value of the trade names was estimated using a relief-from-royalty\napproach.\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired. The\nacquisition of a controlling interest in SGB resulted in the recognition of $78.0 million of goodwill, which we believe relates primarily\nto the resulting synergies of utilizing A-Mark's established integrated precious metals platform with SGB's underlying customer base.\nThe goodwill created as a result of the acquisition of a controlling interest in SGB is not deductible for tax purposes.\nThe following unaudited pro forma consolidated results of operations for the years ended June 30, 2024 and 2023 assumes that\nthe acquisition of a controlling interest in SGB occurred as of July 1, 2022 (in thousands):\nYear Ended June 30,\n2024 2023\nRevenues $ 9,765,669 $ 9,417,104\nNet income $ 46,052 $ 181,458\nThe above pro forma supplemental information does not purport to be indicative of what the Company's operations would have\nbeen had the transaction occurred on July 1, 2022, and should not be considered indicative of future operating results. The Company\nbelieves the assumptions used provide a reasonable basis for reflecting the significant pro forma effects directly attributable to the\nacquisition of a controlling interest in SGB. The unaudited pro forma information accounts for: (i) the elimination of transactions\nbetween the Company and SGB and (ii) adjustments to the amortization expense resulting from the estimated fair value of the acquired\nfinite-lived intangible assets, acquisition costs, cash and share-based compensation expense, remeasurement gains, and the resulting\nimpact to the income tax provision.\nSecured Lending\nThe Company operates its Secured Lending segment through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Collateral Finance Corporation, LLC,\nincluding its wholly-owned subsidiary, CFC Alternative Investments (“CAI”) (collectively “CFC”).\nCFC is a California licensed finance lender that originates and acquires commercial loans secured primarily by bullion and\nnumismatic coins. CFC's customers include coin and precious metal dealers, investors, and collectors.\nCAI is a holding company that has a 50%-ownership stake in Collectible Card Partners, LLC (\"CCP\"). CCP provides capital to\nfund commercial loans secured by graded sports cards. (See Note 14.)\nAM Capital Funding, LLC (“AMCF”), previously a wholly-owned subsidiary of CFC, was formed for the purpose of securitizing\neligible secured loans of CFC. AMCF issued and administered the AMCF Notes; the AMCF Notes were repaid in full in December\n2023. AMCF was dissolved in June 2024. (See Note 15.)\n2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements reflect the financial condition, results of operations, statements of stockholders’ equity, and\ncash flows of the Company, and were prepared using accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“U.S. GAAP”). The\nCompany consolidates its subsidiaries that are wholly-owned, and majority owned, and entities that are variable interest entities where\nthe Company is determined to be the primary beneficiary. In addition to A-Mark, our consolidated financial statements include the\naccounts of: AMTAG, TDS, AMGL, AMST, AM/LPM Ventures, JMB, Goldline, SGB, and CFC. Intercompany accounts and\ntransactions are eliminated.\nComprehensive Income\nOur other comprehensive income and losses are comprised of unrealized gains and losses associated with the translation of foreign-\nbased equity method investments which are shown in our consolidated statements of stockholders' equity.\n75\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and\nassumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the\nconsolidated financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. These estimates\ninclude, among others, determination of fair value (primarily, with respect to precious metal inventory, derivatives, assets and liabilities\nacquired in business combinations, certain financial instruments, and certain investments); impairment assessments of property, plant\nand equipment, long-term investments, and intangible assets; valuation allowance determination on deferred tax assets; determining the\nincremental borrowing rate for calculating right of use assets and lease liabilities; and revenue recognition judgments. Actual results\ncould materially differ from these estimates.\nStock Split in the Form of a Dividend\nOn April 28, 2022, the Company’s board of directors declared a two-for-one split of A-Mark’s common stock in the form of a\nstock dividend. Each stockholder of record at the close of business on May 23, 2022 received a dividend of one additional share of\ncommon stock for every share held on the record date, which was distributed on June 6, 2022. All share and per share amounts (except\npar value) have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the stock split in the form of a stock dividend for all periods presented.\nDividends are recorded if and when they are declared by the board of directors. (See Note 17.)\nFair Value Measurement\nThe Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures Topic 820 of the ASC (\"ASC 820\") creates a single definition of fair value for\nfinancial reporting. The rules associated with ASC 820 state that valuation techniques consistent with the market approach, income\napproach, and/or cost approach should be used to estimate fair value. Selection of a valuation technique, or multiple valuation techniques,\ndepends on the nature of the asset or liability being valued, as well as the availability of data. (See Note 3.)\nConcentration of Credit Risk\nCash is maintained at financial institutions, and, at times, balances exceed federally insured limits. The Company has not\nexperienced any losses related to these balances.\nAssets that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of receivables, loans of inventory\nto customers, and inventory hedging transactions. Based on an assessment of credit risk, the Company typically grants collateralized\ncredit to its customers. Credit risk with respect to loans of inventory to customers is minimal. The Company enters into inventory\nhedging transactions, principally utilizing metals commodity futures contracts traded on national futures exchanges or forward contracts\nwith credit worthy financial institutions. All of our commodity derivative contracts are under master netting arrangements and include\nboth asset and liability positions. Substantially all of these transactions are secured by the underlying metals positions.\nForeign Currency\nThe functional currency of the Company is the United States dollar (\"USD\"). All transactions in foreign currencies are recorded\nin USD at the then-current exchange rate(s). Upon settlement of the underlying transaction, all amounts are remeasured to USD at the\ncurrent exchange rate on date of settlement. All unsettled foreign currency transactions that remain in accounts receivable and trade\naccount payables are remeasured to USD at the period end exchange rates. All foreign currency remeasurement gains and losses are\nrecorded in the current period net income.\nThe Company has three foreign subsidiaries that generate foreign currency remeasurement gains and losses: AMTAG, LPM and\nSGB. Because these entities have a functional currency of USD, foreign currency remeasurement gains and losses from these foreign\nsubsidiaries are recorded in net income.\nFor the Company’s foreign-based equity method investments, the proportionate share of the investee’s income is translated into\nUSD at the average exchange rate for the period and the investment is translated using the exchange rate as of the end of the reporting\nperiod. The unrealized gains and losses associated with the translation of the investment are deferred in accumulated other\ncomprehensive income on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets.\nTo manage the effect of foreign currency exchange fluctuations, the Company utilizes foreign currency forward contracts. These\nderivatives generate gains and losses when settled and/or marked-to-market.\n76\nBusiness Combinations\nThe Company accounts for business combinations by applying the acquisition method in accordance with Business Combinations\nTopic 805 of the ASC (“ASC 805”). The Company evaluates each purchase transaction to determine whether the acquired assets meet\nthe definition of a business. Transaction costs related to the acquisition of a business are expensed as incurred and excluded from the\nfair value of consideration transferred. The identifiable assets acquired, liabilities assumed and noncontrolling interests, if any, in an\nacquired entity are recognized and measured at their estimated fair values. The excess of the fair value of consideration transferred over\nthe fair values of identifiable assets acquired, liabilities assumed and noncontrolling interests, if any, in an acquired entity is recorded\nas goodwill. Such valuations require management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible\nassets and liabilities. Net cash paid to acquire a business is classified as investing activities on the accompanying consolidated statements\nof cash flows.\nIn circumstances where an acquisition involves a contingent consideration arrangement that meets the definition of a liability\nunder ASC Topic 480, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity, we recognize a liability equal to the fair value of the expected contingent\npayments as of the acquisition date. We remeasure this liability each reporting period, with the resulting changes recorded as selling,\ngeneral, and administrative expenses. The assumptions used in estimating fair value of contingent consideration liabilities require\nsignificant judgment; the use of different assumptions and judgments could result in a materially different estimate of fair value which\nmay have a material impact on our results from operations and financial position.\nVariable Interest Entity\nA variable interest entity (\"VIE\") is a legal entity that has either (i) a total equity investment that is insufficient to finance its\nactivities without additional subordinated financial support or (ii) whose equity investors as a group lack the ability to control the entity’s\nactivities or lack the ability to receive expected benefits or absorb obligations in a manner that is consistent with their investment in the\nentity.\nA VIE is consolidated for accounting purposes by its primary beneficiary, which is the party that has both the power to direct the\nactivities that most significantly impact the VIE's economic performance, and the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive\nbenefits of the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. The Company consolidates VIEs when it is deemed to be the primary\nbeneficiary. Management regularly reviews and re-evaluates its previous determinations regarding whether it holds a variable interest\nin potential VIEs, the status of an entity as a VIE, and whether the Company is required to consolidate such VIEs in its consolidated\nfinancial statements.\nAMCF, previously a wholly-owned subsidiary of CFC, was a special purpose entity (\"SPE\") formed as part of a securitization\ntransaction in order to isolate certain assets and distribute the cash flows from those assets to investors. AMCF was structured to insulate\ninvestors from claims on AMCF’s assets by creditors of other entities. Prior to the repayment of the AMCF Notes in December 2023,\nthe Company had various forms of involvement with AMCF, which included (i) holding senior or subordinated interests in AMCF; (ii)\nacting as loan servicer for a portfolio of loans held by AMCF; and (iii) providing administrative services to AMCF. AMCF was required\nto maintain separate books and records. The assets and liabilities of this VIE as of June 30, 2024 and June 30, 2023 are indicated on the\ntable that follows the consolidated balance sheets. AMCF was dissolved in June 2024.\nAMCF was a VIE because its initial equity investment may have been insufficient to maintain its ongoing collateral requirements\nwithout additional financial support from the Company. The Company was the primary beneficiary of this VIE because the Company\nhad the right to determine the type of collateral (i.e., cash, secured loans, or precious metals), had the right to receive (and has received)\nthe proceeds from the securitization transaction, earn ongoing interest income from the secured loans (subject to collateral requirements),\nand had the obligation to absorb losses should AMCF's interest expense and other costs exceed its interest income. (See Note 15.)\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nThe Company considers all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less, when purchased, to be cash\nequivalents. The Company did not have any cash equivalents as of June 30, 2024 and June 30, 2023.\nAllowance for Credit Losses\nOn July 1, 2022, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses Topic\n326: Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments (\"ASC 326\"), which introduced a new credit reserving methodology known\nas the Current Expected Credit Loss (\"CECL\") model. The CECL model applies to financial assets measured at amortized cost, including\naccounts receivable, contract assets and held-to-maturity loan receivables. Under the CECL model, we identify allowances for credit\nlosses based on future expected losses when accounts receivable, contract assets or held-to-maturity loan receivables are created rather\nthan when losses are probable.\n77\nThe Company sets credit and position risk limits based on management's judgments of the customer's creditworthiness and\nregularly monitors its credit arrangements. These limits include gross position limits for counterparties engaged in sales and purchase\ntransactions with the Company. They also include collateral limits for different types of sale and purchase transactions that counterparties\nmay engage in from time to time.\nASC 326 provides a practical expedient for assets secured by collateral when repayment is expected to be provided substantially\nthrough the sale of the collateral in the event of the borrower's financial difficulty. In these arrangements, a reporting entity may estimate\nthe expected credit losses by comparing the fair value of the collateral as of the balance sheet date to the asset’s amortized cost basis. In\nsituations when the fair value of the collateral is equal to or greater than the amortized cost, a reporting entity may determine that there\nare no expected credit losses. The Company applies the practical expedient based on collateral maintenance provisions in estimating an\nallowance for credit losses for its secured loan receivables activity. The Company has not historically experienced credit losses related\nto its lending activity, and since it does not expect any future losses, no allowance has been recorded for this asset class. We expect\ntrends and business practices to continue in a manner consistent with historical activity.\nThe Company has not historically experienced credit losses related to its other receivables activity; including (i) customer trade\nreceivables, (ii) wholesale trade advances, and (iii) due from brokers, and, accordingly, no allowance has been recorded for these asset\nclasses.\nPrecious Metals Held Under Financing Arrangements\nThe Company enters into arrangements with certain customers under which it purchases precious metals from the customers which\nare subject to repurchase by the customer at the spot value of the product on the repurchase date. The precious metals purchased under\nthese arrangements consist of rare and unique items, and therefore the Company accounts for these transactions as precious metals held\nunder financing arrangements, which generate financing income rather than revenue earned from precious metals inventory sales. In\nthese repurchase arrangements, the Company holds legal title to the metals and earns financing income for the duration of the agreement.\nThese arrangements are typically terminable by either party upon 14 days' notice. Upon termination, the customer’s right to\nrepurchase any remaining precious metal is forfeited, and the related precious metals are reclassified as inventory held for sale. The\nCompany’s precious metals held under financing arrangements are marked-to-market.\nInventories\nThe Company's inventory, which consists primarily of bullion and bullion coins, is acquired and initially recorded at cost and then\nmarked to fair market value. The fair market value of the bullion and bullion coins comprises two components: (i) published market\nvalues attributable to the cost of the raw precious metal, and (ii) the market value of the premium, which is attributable to the incremental\nvalue of the product in its finished goods form. The market value attributable solely to such premium is readily determinable by reference\nto multiple sources.\nThe Company’s inventory, except for certain lower of cost or net realizable value basis products (as discussed below), are\nsubsequently recorded at their fair market values, that is, \"marked-to-market.\" The daily changes in the fair market value of our inventory\nare offset by daily changes in the fair market value of hedging derivatives that are taken with respect to our inventory positions; both\nthe change in the fair market value of the inventory and the change in the fair market value of these derivative instruments are recorded\nin cost of sales in the consolidated statements of income.\nWhile the premium component of our bullion coins included in inventory is marked-to-market, our commemorative coin\ninventory, including its premium component, is held at the lower of cost or net realizable value, because the value of commemorative\ncoins is influenced more by supply and demand determinants than on the underlying spot price of the precious metal content of the\ncommemorative coins. Unlike our bullion coins, the value of commemorative coins is not subject to the same level of volatility as\nbullion coins because our commemorative coins typically carry a substantially higher premium over the spot metal price than bullion\ncoins. Neither the commemorative coin inventory nor the premium component of our inventory is hedged. (See Note 6.)\nLeased Right of Use Assets\nWe lease warehouse space, office facilities, and equipment. Our operating leases with terms longer than twelve months are\nrecorded at the sum of the present value of the lease's fixed minimum payments as operating lease right of use assets (\"ROU assets\") in\nthe Company’s consolidated balance sheets. Lease terms include all periods covered by renewal and termination options where the\nCompany is reasonably certain to exercise the renewal options or not to exercise the termination options. Our lease agreements do not\ncontain any significant residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants. Our finance leases are another type of ROU asset,\nbut are classified in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets as a component of property, plant, and equipment at the present value\nof the lease payments. Finance leases were not material during any period presented.\n78\nThe ROU asset amounts include any initial direct costs incurred and lease payments made at or before the commencement date\nand are reduced by lease incentives. We use our incremental borrowing rate as the discount rate to determine the present value of the\nlease payments for leases, as our leases do not have readily determinable implicit discount rates. Our incremental borrowing rate is the\nrate of interest that we would incur to borrow on a collateralized basis over a similar term and amount in a similar economic environment.\nOperating lease cost is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The depreciable life of ROU assets is limited by the\nexpected lease term, unless there is a transfer of title or purchase option reasonably certain of exercise. (See Note 7.)\nFor a lease modification, an evaluation is performed to determine if it should be treated as either a separate lease or a change in\nthe accounting of an existing lease. Any amounts related to a modified lease are reflected as an operating lease ROU asset or related\noperating lease liability in our consolidated balance sheet.\nProperty, Plant, and Equipment\nProperty, plant, and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization\nare calculated using a straight-line method based on the estimated useful lives of the related assets, ranging from three years to twenty-\nfive years. Depreciation and amortization commence when the related assets are placed into service. Internal-use software development\ncosts are capitalized during the application development stage. Internal-use software costs incurred during the preliminary project stage\nare expensed as incurred. Land is recorded at historical cost and is not depreciated. Repair and maintenance costs are expensed as\nincurred. We have no major planned maintenance activities related to our plant assets associated with our minting operations.\nThe Company reviews the carrying value of these assets for impairment whenever events and circumstances indicate that the\ncarrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. In evaluating for impairment, the carrying value of each asset or group of assets is\ncompared to the undiscounted estimated future cash flows expected to result from its use and eventual disposition. An impairment loss\nis recognized for the difference when the carrying value exceeds the discounted estimated future cash flows. The factors considered by\nthe Company in performing this assessment include current and projected operating results, trends and prospects, the manner in which\nthese assets are used, and the effects of obsolescence, demand and competition, as well as other economic factors.\nFinite-lived Intangible Assets\nFinite-lived intangible assets consist primarily of customer relationships, developed technology, and non-compete agreements.\nCertain existing customer relationships intangible assets are amortized in a non-linear manner which best reflects our estimate of the\npattern in which the economic benefits of the assets are consumed. All other intangible assets subject to amortization are amortized\nusing the straight-line method over their useful lives, which are estimated to be one year to fifteen years. We review our finite-lived\nintangible assets for impairment under the same policy described above for property, plant, and equipment; that is, whenever events or\nchanges in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.\nGoodwill and Indefinite-lived Intangible Assets\nGoodwill is recorded when the purchase price paid for an acquisition exceeds the estimated fair value of the net identified tangible\nand intangible assets acquired. Goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangibles (such as trade names, trademarks, and domain names)\nare not subject to amortization, but are evaluated for impairment at least annually. For tax purposes, goodwill acquired in connection\nwith a taxable asset acquisition is generally deductible.\nThe Company evaluates its goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangibles for impairment in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year\n(or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist) in accordance with ASC 350. Goodwill is reviewed for impairment at a\nreporting unit level, which for the Company, corresponds to the Company’s operating segments.\nEvaluation of goodwill for impairment\nThe Company has the option to first qualitatively assess whether relevant events and circumstances make it more likely than not\nthat the fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill is less than its carrying value. A qualitative assessment includes analyzing current\neconomic indicators associated with a particular reporting unit such as changes in economic, market and industry conditions, business\nstrategy, cost factors, and financial performance, among others, to determine if there would be a significant decline to the fair value of\na particular reporting unit. If the qualitative assessment indicates it is not more likely than not that goodwill is impaired, no further\ntesting is required.\n79\nIf, based on this qualitative assessment, management concludes that goodwill is more likely than not to be impaired, or elects not\nto perform the qualitative assessment, then it is required to perform a quantitative analysis to determine the fair value of the business,\nand compare the calculated fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. If through this quantitative\nanalysis the Company determines the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, the goodwill of the reporting unit is\nconsidered not to be impaired. If the Company concludes that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, a goodwill\nimpairment loss will be recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value. (See Note 9.)\nEvaluation of indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment\nThe Company evaluates its indefinite-lived intangible assets (i.e., trade names, trademarks, and domain names) for impairment.\nIn assessing its indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment, the Company has the option to first perform a qualitative assessment\nto determine whether events or circumstances exist that lead to a determination that it is unlikely that the fair value of the indefinite-\nlived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount. If the Company determines that it is unlikely that the fair value of an indefinite-\nlived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount, the Company is not required to perform any additional tests in assessing the asset\nfor impairment. However, if the Company concludes otherwise or elects not to perform the qualitative assessment, then it is required to\nperform a quantitative analysis to determine if the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying value. If\nthrough this quantitative analysis the Company determines the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its carrying\namount, the indefinite-lived intangible asset is considered not to be impaired. If the Company concludes that the fair value of an\nindefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying value, an impairment loss will be recognized for the amount by which the\ncarrying amount exceeds the indefinite-lived intangible asset’s fair value.\nThe methods used to estimate the fair value measurements of the Company’s reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets\ninclude those based on the income approach (including the discounted cash flow and relief-from-royalty methods) and those based on\nthe market approach (primarily the guideline transaction and guideline public company methods). (See Note 9.)\nLong-Term Investments\nInvestments in privately-held entities are accounted for using the equity method when the Company has significant influence, but\nnot control, over the investee. Significant influence is generally deemed to exist if the Company’s ownership interest in the voting stock\nof the investee ranges between 20% and 50%, although other factors are considered in determining whether the equity method of\naccounting is appropriate. Under the equity method, the carrying values of these investments are adjusted to reflect our proportionate\nshare of the investee's net income or loss, any unrealized gain or loss resulting from the translation of foreign-denominated financial\nstatements into U.S. dollars, and dividends received. We use the cumulative earnings approach for classifying dividends received in the\nstatements of cash flows. Under the cumulative earnings approach, we compare the distributions received to cumulative equity method\nearnings since inception. Any distributions received up to the amount of cumulative equity earnings are considered a return on\ninvestment and classified in operating activities. Any excess distributions are considered a return of capital and classified in investing\nactivities. The basis difference between the carrying value and our proportionate share of the equity method investment's book value is\nprimarily related to consideration paid in excess of the stepped-up basis of assets and liabilities on the date of purchase.\nInvestments in privately-held entities for which the Company has little or no influence over the investee are initially recorded at\ncost. Because the investments do not have a readily determinable fair value, the Company has elected to measure the investments at cost\nminus impairments, if any, with changes recognized in net income. If the Company identifies observable price changes in orderly\ntransactions for an identical or a similar investment, the Company’s investment will be measured at fair value as of the date the\nobservable transaction occurs.\nWe evaluate our long-term investments for impairment quarterly or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that a\ndecline in the fair value of these assets is determined to be other-than-temporary. Additionally, the Company performs an ongoing\nevaluation of the investments with which the Company has variable interests to determine if any of these entities are VIEs that are\nrequired to be consolidated. None of the Company’s long-term investments were VIEs as of June 30, 2024 and June 30, 2023.\nOther Long-Term Assets\nOn June 27, 2022, the Company acquired an additional 40% interest in SGB. Also included in this acquisition was an option,\nwhich was exercisable between December 2023 and September 2024, to purchase an additional 27.6% of the outstanding equity of SGB\nto bring the Company's ownership interest up to 75.0%. In June 2024, the Company exercised a portion of its option and acquired an\nadditional 8% ownership interest in SGB (see Note 1). At the same time, the Company modified certain terms and conditions of its\noption to acquire additional ownership interest in SGB, including extending the term of the remaining unexercised option to September\n2025 as well as reducing the available option to increase the Company's ownership from 75% to 70%. In accordance with ASC 480,\nDistinguishing Liabilities from Equity, the resulting modified option was not determined to be separately exercisable from the remaining\nshares of SGB, and therefore the value is embedded within the noncontrolling interest of SGB. As of June 30, 2023, the fair value of the\nunexercised options was $5.3 million.\n80\nAccumulated Other Comprehensive Income\nFor the Company’s foreign-based equity method investments, the proportionate share of the investee’s income is translated into\nU.S. dollars at the average exchange rate for the period and the investment is translated using the exchange rate as of the end of the\nreporting period. Foreign currency translation gains and losses associated with this activity are deferred and included as a component of\naccumulated other comprehensive income in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.\nTreasury Stock\nThe Company periodically purchases its own common stock that is traded on public markets as part of announced stock repurchase\nprograms. The repurchased common stock is classified as treasury stock on the consolidated balance sheets and held at cost. The direct\ncosts incurred to acquire treasury stock are treated like stock issue costs and added to the cost of the treasury stock, which includes\napplicable fees and taxes. Other than the shares issued to acquire LPM in February 2024 (see Note 1), there have been no reissuances\nof treasury stock.\nNoncontrolling Interests\nThe Company’s consolidated financial statements include entities in which the Company has a controlling financial interest.\nNoncontrolling interest is the portion of equity (net assets) in an entity in which the Company has a controlling financial interest that is\nnot attributable, directly or indirectly, to the Company. Such noncontrolling interest is reported on the consolidated balance sheets within\nequity, separately from the Company’s equity. On the consolidated statements of income, revenues, expenses and net income or loss\nfrom the less-than-wholly owned subsidiary are reported at their consolidated amounts, including both the amounts attributable to the\nCompany and the noncontrolling interest. Income or loss is allocated to the noncontrolling interest based on its weighted-average\nownership percentage for the applicable period. The consolidated statements of equity include beginning balances, activity for the period\nand ending balances for each component of stockholders’ equity, noncontrolling interest and total equity.\nThe table below presents the reconciliation of changes in noncontrolling interests (in thousands):\nBalance as of June 30, 2021 $ 1,319\nNet income attributable to noncontrolling interest 543\nBalance as of June 30, 2022 1,862 (1)\nNet income attributable to noncontrolling interest 409\nDistributions paid to noncontrolling interest (1,001)\nBalance as of June 30, 2023 1,270 (1)\nNet income attributable to noncontrolling interests 487\nNoncontrolling ownership interest contribution - AM/LPM Ventures, LLC 2,051 (2)\nNoncontrolling ownership interests - SGB 50,652 (3)\nChange in ownership of consolidated subsidiary (237)\nBalance as of June 30, 2024 $ 54,223 (4)\n________________________________\n(1) Balance represents the noncontrolling interests associated with the PMPP joint venture.\n(2) In February 2024, Aquila Holding LLC purchased a 5% interest in AM/LPM Ventures, LLC for $2.1 million.\n(3) In June 2024, the Company obtained a controlling interest in SGB (see Note 1).\n(4) Balance represents the noncontrolling interests of PMPP, AM/LPM Ventures, LLC, and SGB.\nRevenue Recognition\nSettlement Date Accounting\nSubstantially all of the Company’s sales of precious metals are conducted using sales contracts that meet the definition of\nderivative instruments in accordance with Derivatives and Hedging Topic 815 of the ASC (\"ASC 815\"). The contract underlying the\nCompany's commitment to deliver precious metals is referred to as a “fixed-price forward commodity contract” because the price of the\ncommodity is fixed at the time the order is placed. Revenue is recognized on the settlement date, which is defined as the date on which:\n(i) the quantity, price, and specific items being purchased have been established, (ii) metals have been delivered to the customer, and\n(iii) payment has been received or is covered by the customer’s established credit limit with the Company.\nAll derivative instruments are marked-to-market during the interval between the order date and the settlement date, with the\nchanges in the fair value charged to cost of sales. The Company’s hedging strategy to mitigate the market risk associated with its sales\ncommitments is described separately below under the caption “Hedging Activities.”\n81\nTypes of Orders that are Physically Delivered\nThe Company’s contracts to sell precious metals to customers are usually settled with the physical delivery of metals to the\ncustomer, although net settlement (i.e., settlement at an amount equal to the difference between the contract value and the market price\nof the metal on the settlement date) is permitted. Below is a summary of the Company’s major order types and the key factors that\ndetermine when settlement occurs and when revenue is recognized for each type:\n• Traditional physical orders — The quantity, specific product, and price are determined on the order date. Payment or\nsufficient credit is verified prior to delivery of the metals on the settlement date.\n• Consignment orders — The Company delivers the items requested by the customer prior to establishing a firm order with\na price. Settlement occurs and revenue is recognized once the customer confirms its order (quantity, specific product, and\nprice) and remits full payment for the sale.\n• Provisional orders — The quantity and type of metal is established at the order date, but the price is not set. The customer\ncommits to purchasing the metals within a specified time period, usually within one year, at the then-current market price.\nThe Company delivers the metal to the customer after receiving the customer’s deposit, which is typically based on 110%\nof the prevailing current spot price. The unpriced metal is subject to a margin call if the deposit falls below 105% of the\nvalue of the unpriced metal. The purchase price is established, and revenue is recognized at the time the customer notifies\nthe Company that it desires to purchase the metal.\n• Margin orders — The quantity, specific product, and price are determined at the order date; however, the customer is\nallowed to finance the transaction through the Company and to defer delivery by committing to remit a partial payment\n(approximately 20%) of the total order price. With the remittance of the partial payment, the customer locks in the purchase\nprice for a specified time period (usually up to two years from the order date). Revenue on margin orders is recognized\nwhen the order is paid in full and delivered to the customer.\n• Borrowed precious metals orders for unallocated positions — Customers may purchase unallocated metal positions in the\nCompany's inventory, which includes precious metals held for CyberMetals' customers. The quantity and type of metal is\nestablished at the order date, but the specific product is not yet determined. Revenue is not recognized until the customer\nselects the specific precious metal product it wishes to purchase, full payment is received, and the product is delivered to\nthe customer.\nIn general, unshipped orders for which a customer advance has been received by the Company are classified as advances from\ncustomers. Orders that have been paid for and shipped, but not yet delivered to the customer are classified as deferred revenue. Both\ncustomer advances and deferred revenue are shown, in the aggregate, as deferred revenue and other advances in the consolidated\nfinancial statements. (See Note 11.)\nHedging Activities\nThe value of our inventory and our purchase and sale commitments are linked to the prevailing price of the underlying precious\nmetal commodity. The Company seeks to minimize the effect of price changes of the underlying commodity and enters into inventory\nhedging transactions, principally utilizing metals commodity forward contracts with credit worthy financial institutions or futures\ncontracts traded on national futures exchanges. The Company hedges by each commodity type (gold, silver, platinum, and palladium).\nAll of our commodity derivative contracts are under master netting arrangements and include both asset and liability positions.\nCommodity forward and futures contracts entered into for hedging purposes are recorded at fair value on the trade date and are\nmarked-to-market each period. The difference between the original contract values and the market values of these contracts are reflected\nas derivative assets or derivative liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets at fair value, with the corresponding unrealized gains or\nlosses included as a component of cost of sales. When these contracts are net settled, the unrealized gains and losses are reversed and\nthe realized gains and losses for forward contracts are recorded in revenue and cost of sales, and the net realized gains and losses for\nfutures are recorded in cost of sales.\nThe Company enters into forward and futures contracts solely for the purpose of hedging our inventory holding risk, and not for\nspeculative market purposes. The Company’s gains and losses on derivative instruments are substantially offset by the changes in the\nfair market value of the underlying precious metals inventory, which is also recorded in cost of sales in the consolidated statements of\nincome. (See Note 12.)\nOther Sources of Revenue\nThe Company recognizes its storage, logistics, licensing, and other services revenues in accordance with ASC 606, Revenue from\nContracts with Customers, which follows five basic steps to determine whether revenue can be recognized: (i) identify the contract with\na customer; (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (iii) determine the transaction price; (iv) allocate the transaction\nprice to the performance obligations in the contract, and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation.\n82\nThe Company recognizes revenue when (or as) it satisfies its obligation by transferring control of the good or service to the\ncustomer. This is either satisfied over time or at a point in time. A performance obligation is satisfied over time if one of the following\ncriteria are met: (i) the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits as the Company performs, (ii) the Company's\nperformance creates or enhances an asset that the customer controls as the asset is created or enhanced, or (iii) the Company's\nperformance does not create an asset with an alternative use to the Company, and the Company has an enforceable right for payment of\nperformance completed-to-date. When none of those is met, a performance obligation is satisfied at a point-in-time.\nThe Company recognizes storage revenue as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the storage services (e.g., fixed\nstorage fees based on the passage of time). The Company recognizes logistics (i.e., fulfillment) revenue when the customer receives the\nbenefit of the services. The Company recognizes advertising and consulting revenues when the service is performed, and the benefit of\nthe service is received by the customer. In aggregate, these types of service revenues account for less than 1% of the Company's\nconsolidated revenues.\nInterest Income\nIn accordance with Interest Topic 835 of the ASC (\"ASC 835\"), the following are interest income generating activities of the\nCompany:\n• Secured Loans — The Company uses the effective interest method to recognize interest income on its secured loans\ntransactions. The Company maintains a security interest in the precious metals and records interest income over the terms\nof the secured loan receivable. Recognition of interest income is suspended, and the loan is placed on non-accrual status\nwhen management determines that collection of future interest income is not probable. The interest income accrual is\nresumed, and previously suspended interest income is recognized, when the loan becomes contractually current and/or\ncollection doubts are resolved. Cash receipts on impaired loans are recorded first against the principal and then to any\nunrecognized interest income. (See Note 5.)\n• Margin accounts — The Company earns a fee (interest income) under financing arrangements related to margin orders\nover the period during which customers have opted to defer making full payment on the purchase of metals.\n• Repurchase agreements — Repurchase agreements represent a form of secured financing whereby the Company sets aside\nspecific metals for a customer and charges a fee on the outstanding value of these metals. The customer is granted the option\n(but not the obligation) to repurchase these metals at any time during the open reacquisition period. This fee is earned over\nthe duration of the open reacquisition period and is classified as interest income.\n• Spot deferred orders — Spot deferred orders are a special type of forward delivery order that enable customers to purchase\nor sell certain precious metals from/to the Company at an agreed upon price but, are allowed to delay remitting or taking\ndelivery up to a maximum of two years from the date of order. Even though the contract allows for physical delivery, it\nrarely occurs for this type of order. As a result, revenue is not recorded from these transactions. Spot deferred orders are\nconsidered a type of financing transaction, where the Company earns a fee (interest income) under spot deferred\narrangements over the period in which the order is open.\nInterest Expense\nThe Company accounts for interest expense on the following arrangements in accordance with ASC 835:\n• Borrowings — The Company incurs interest expense from its lines of credit, its debt obligations, and notes payable using\nthe effective interest method. (See Note 15.) Additionally, the Company amortizes capitalized loan costs to interest expense\nover the period of the loan agreement.\n• Loan servicing fees — When the Company purchases loan portfolios, the Company may have the seller service the loans\nthat were purchased. The Company incurs a fee based on total interest charged to borrowers over the period the loans are\noutstanding. The servicing fee incurred by the Company is charged to interest expense.\n• Product financing arrangements — The Company incurs financing fees (classified as interest expense) from its product\nfinancing arrangements (also referred to as reverse-repurchase arrangements) with third-party finance companies for the\ntransfer and subsequent option to reacquire its precious metal inventory at a later date. These arrangements are accounted\nfor as secured borrowings. During the term of this type of agreement, the third-party charges a monthly fee as a percentage\nof the market value of the designated inventory, which the Company intends to reacquire in the future. No revenue is\ngenerated from these arrangements. The Company enters this type of transaction for additional liquidity.\n83\n• Borrowed and leased metals fees — The Company may incur financing costs from its borrowed metal arrangements. The\nCompany borrows precious metals (usually in the form of pool metals) from its suppliers and customers under short-term\narrangements using other precious metals as collateral. Typically, during the term of these arrangements, the third-party\ncharges a monthly fee as a percentage of the market value of the metals borrowed (determined at the spot price) plus certain\nprocessing and other fees.\nLeased metal transactions are a similar type of transaction, except the Company is not required to pledge other precious\nmetal as collateral for the precious metal received. The fees charged by the third-party are based on the spot value of the\npool metal received.\nBoth borrowed and leased metal transactions provide an additional source of liquidity, as the Company usually monetizes\nthe metals received under such arrangements. Repayment is usually in the same form as the metals advanced, but may be\nsettled in cash.\nAmortization of Debt Issuance Costs\nDebt issuance costs incurred in connection with the issuance of the AMCF Notes have been included as a component of the\ncarrying amount of the debt, and Trading Credit Facility debt issuance costs are included in prepaid expenses and other assets in the\nCompany's consolidated balance sheets. Debt issuance costs are amortized to interest expense over the contractual term of the debt. Debt\nissuance costs of the Trading Credit Facility are amortized on a straight-line basis, while all other debt issuance costs are amortized\nusing the effective interest method. Amortization of debt issuance costs included in interest expense was $2.4 million, $2.1 million, and\n$2.7 million for the years ended June 30, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.\nEarnings from Equity Method Investments\nThe Company's proportional interest in the reported earnings from equity method investments is shown on the consolidated\nstatements of income as earnings from equity method investments.\nOther Income, Net\nThe Company's other income, net is comprised of royalty and consulting income, which is recognized when earned, gains on other\ninvestments, and fair value adjustments to our acquisition-related contingent consideration liability.\nAdvertising\nAdvertising and marketing costs consist primarily of internet advertising, online marketing, direct mail, print media, and television\ncommercials and are expensed when incurred. Advertising costs totaled $15.3 million, $15.9 million, and $12.2 million for the years\nended June 30, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively. Costs associated with the marketing and promotion of the Company's products are\nincluded within selling, general, and administrative expenses. Advertising costs associated with the operation of our SilverPrice.org and\nGoldPrice.org websites, which provide price information on silver, gold, and cryptocurrencies, are not included within selling, general,\nand administrative expenses, but are included in cost of sales in the consolidated statements of income.\nShipping and Handling Costs\nShipping and handling costs represent costs associated with shipping product to customers and receiving product from vendors\nand are included in cost of sales in the consolidated statements of income. Shipping and handling costs totaled $21.9 million, $28.4\nmillion, and $25.6 million for the years ended June 30, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.\nShare-Based Compensation\nEquity-based awards\nThe Company accounts for equity awards under the provisions of Compensation - Stock Compensation Topic 718 of the ASC\n(\"ASC 718\"), which establishes fair value-based accounting requirements for share-based compensation to employees. ASC 718 requires\nthe Company to recognize the grant-date fair value of stock options and other equity-based compensation issued to employees as expense\nover the service period in the Company's consolidated financial statements. The expense is adjusted (excluding awards settleable in\ncash) for actual forfeitures of unvested awards as they occur. For equity awards that contain a performance condition other than market\ncondition, when the outcome of the performance condition is determined to be not probable, no compensation expense is recognized,\nand any previously recognized compensation expense is reversed. (See Note 17.)\n84\nLiability-based awards\nThe Company has granted a cash-incentive award based on the total shareholder return of the Company's common stock\ndetermined at the end of the award's performance period. Because the award will be settled in cash, the Company accounts for it as a\nliability-based award and, as such, expense relating to this award is required to be measured at fair value at each reporting date until the\ndate of settlement. (See Note 17.)\nIncome Taxes\nAs part of the process of preparing its consolidated financial statements, the Company is required to estimate its provision for\nincome taxes in each of the tax jurisdictions in which it conducts business, in accordance with Income Taxes Topic 740 of the ASC\n(\"ASC 740\"). The Company computes its annual tax rate based on the statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to it\nin the various jurisdictions in which it earns income. Significant judgment is required in determining the Company's annual tax rate and\nin evaluating uncertainty in its tax positions. The Company has adopted the provisions of ASC 740-10, which clarifies the accounting\nfor uncertain tax positions. ASC 740-10 requires that the Company recognizes the impact of a tax position in the financial statements if\nthe position is not more likely than not to be sustained upon examination based on the technical merits of the position. The Company\nrecognizes interest and penalties related to certain uncertain tax positions as a component of income tax expense and the accrued interest\nand penalties are included in deferred and income taxes payable in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. See Note 13 for more\ninformation on the Company’s accounting for income taxes.\nIncome taxes are accounted for using an asset and liability approach that requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and\nliabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements. Under this method,\ndeferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and\nliabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect of a change in tax\nrates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance\nis provided when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the net deferred tax assets will not be realized. The factors used to\nassess the likelihood of realization include the Company's forecast of the reversal of temporary differences, future taxable income, and\navailable tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the net deferred tax assets. Failure to achieve forecasted taxable\nincome in applicable tax jurisdictions could affect the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets and could result in an increase in the\nCompany's effective tax rate on future earnings. Based on our assessment, it appears more likely than not that all of the net deferred tax\nassets will be realized through future taxable income.\nEarnings per Share (\"EPS\")\nThe Company calculates basic EPS by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during\nthe year. Diluted EPS is calculated by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the\nyear, adjusted for the potentially dilutive effect of stock options, restricted stock units (“RSUs\"), and deferred stock units (“DSUs\")\nusing the treasury stock method.\nThe Company considers participating securities in its calculation of EPS. Under the two-class method of calculating EPS, earnings\nare allocated to both common shares and participating securities. The Company’s participating securities include vested RSU and DSU\nawards. Unvested RSU and DSU awards are not considered participating securities as they are forfeitable until the vesting date.\nA reconciliation of shares used in calculating basic and diluted earnings per common share is presented below (in thousands):\nYear Ended June 30,\n2024 2023 2022\nBasic weighted-average shares of common stock outstanding 23,092 23,400 22,806\nEffect of common stock equivalents 1,029 1,249 1,524\nDiluted weighted-average shares outstanding 24,121 24,649 24,330\nThe anti-dilutive shares excluded from the table above were 23,000, 29,000, and 43,000 for the years ended June 30, 2024, 2023,\nand 2022, respectively. Actual common shares outstanding totaled 22,953,391, 23,336,387, and 23,379,888 as of June 30, 2024, 2023,\nand 2022, respectively.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nFrom time to time, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") or other standards setting bodies issue new accounting\npronouncements. Updates to the FASB ASC are communicated through issuance of an Accounting Standards Update (\"ASU\").\n85\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment\nDisclosures, which updates the guidance on segment disclosures to require entities to disclose significant segment expenses and other\nsegment items, as well as the title and position of its chief operating decision maker. This update will be applied retrospectively and is\neffective for the Company for its fiscal year beginning on July 1, 2024; early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the\nimpact of the adoption of this standard on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures,\nwhich updates the guidance on income tax disclosures to require entities to disclose specific categories within the rate reconciliation,\nprovide additional information for reconciling items that meet certain quantitative thresholds, and provide additional information\nabout income taxes paid. This update is effective for the Company for its fiscal year beginning on July 1, 2025; early adoption is\npermitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this standard on our consolidated financial statements.\nManagement does not believe that any other recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting pronouncement if currently adopted\nwould have a material effect on the Company's consolidated financial statements.\n3. ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, AT FAIR VALUE\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nA financial instrument is defined as cash, evidence of an ownership interest in an entity, or a contract that creates a contractual\nobligation or right to deliver or receive cash or another financial instrument from a second entity. The fair value of financial instruments\nrepresents amounts that would be received upon the sale of those assets or that would be paid to transfer those liabilities in an orderly\ntransaction between market participants at that date. Those fair value measurements maximize the use of observable inputs. However,\nin situations where there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability at the measurement date, the fair value measurement\nreflects the Company’s own judgments about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. Those\njudgments are developed by the Company based on the best information available in the circumstances, including expected cash flows\nand appropriately risk adjusted discount rates, and available observable and unobservable inputs.\nFor most of the Company's financial instruments, the carrying amount approximates fair value. The carrying amounts of cash,\nreceivables, secured loans receivable, accounts payable and other current liabilities, accrued liabilities, and income taxes payable\napproximate fair value due to their short-term nature. The carrying amounts of derivative assets and derivative liabilities, liabilities on\nborrowed metals and product financing arrangements are marked-to-market on a daily basis to fair value. The carrying amounts of lines\nof credit approximate fair value based on the borrowing rates currently available to the Company for bank loans with similar terms and\naverage maturities.\nValuation Hierarchy\nIn determining the fair value of its financial instruments, the Company employs a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs\nfor the valuation techniques used to measure fair value. ASC 820 established a three-level valuation hierarchy for disclosure of fair\nvalue measurements. The valuation hierarchy is based upon the transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability as of the\nmeasurement date. The three levels are defined as follows:\n• Level 1 — inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active\nmarkets.\n• Level 2 — inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, and\ninputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial\ninstrument.\n• Level 3 — inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement.\nAssets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis\nThe significant assumptions used to determine the carrying value and the related fair value of the assets and liabilities measured\nat fair value on a recurring basis are described below:\nInventories. The Company's inventory, which consists primarily of bullion and bullion coins, is acquired and initially recorded at\ncost and then marked to fair market value. The fair market value of the bullion and bullion coins comprises two components: (i) published\nmarket values attributable to the cost of the raw precious metal, and (ii) the market value of the premium, which is attributable to the\nincremental value of the product in its finished goods form. The market value attributable solely to such premium is readily determinable\nby reference to multiple sources. Except for commemorative coin inventory, which are included in inventory at the lower of cost or net\nrealizable value, the Company’s inventory is subsequently recorded at their fair market values on a daily basis. The fair value for\ncommodities inventory (i.e., inventory excluding commemorative coins) is determined using pricing data derived from the markets on\nwhich the underlying commodities are traded. Precious metals commodities inventory is classified in Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy.\n86\nPrecious Metals Held Under Financing Arrangements. The Company enters into arrangements with certain customers under\nwhich A-Mark purchases precious metals from the customers which are subject to repurchase by the customer at the spot value of the\nproduct on the repurchase date. The precious metals purchased under these arrangements consist of rare and unique items, and therefore\nthe Company accounts for these transactions as precious metals held under financing arrangements, which generate financing income\nrather than revenue earned from precious metals inventory sales. In these repurchase arrangements, the Company holds legal title to the\nmetals and earns financing income for the duration of the agreement. The fair value for precious metals held under financing\narrangements (a commodity, like inventory above) is determined using pricing data derived from the markets on which the underlying\ncommodities are traded. Precious metals held under financing arrangements are classified in Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy.\nDerivatives. Futures contracts, forward contracts, and open sale and purchase commitments are valued at their fair values, based\non the difference between the quoted market price and the contractual price (i.e., intrinsic value) and are included within Level 1 of the\nvaluation hierarchy.\nMargin and Borrowed Metals Liabilities. Margin and borrowed metals liabilities consist of the Company's commodity obligations\nto margin customers and suppliers, respectively. Margin liabilities and borrowed metals liabilities are carried at fair value, which is\ndetermined using quoted market pricing and data derived from the markets on which the underlying commodities are traded. Margin\nand borrowed metals liabilities are classified in Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy.\nProduct Financing Arrangements. Product financing arrangements consist of financing agreements for the transfer and subsequent\nre-acquisition of the sale of gold and silver at an agreed-upon price based on the spot price with a third-party. Such transactions allow\nthe Company to repurchase this inventory upon demand. The third-party charges monthly interest as a percentage of the market value\nof the outstanding obligation, which is carried at fair value. The obligation is stated at the amount required to repurchase the outstanding\ninventory. Fair value is determined using quoted market pricing and data derived from the markets on which the underlying commodities\nare traded. Product financing arrangements are classified in Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy.\nOption to Purchase Interests in a Long-term Investment. The fair value of the option to purchase additional ownership interest in\nSGB was determined by an independent third-party valuation firm and was recorded as a component of other long-term assets on the\nconsolidated balance sheets.\nThe value of the option as of June 30, 2023 was determined using a Monte Carlo Simulation model (\"MCS model\"). The MCS\nmodel includes inputs based on significant assumptions related to management’s forecasts of the investee’s earnings before interest,\ntaxes, depreciation, and amortization (\"EBITDA\") and corresponding future total equity simulations, where an early exercise multiple\nis calibrated to maximize the fair value of the option during the exercise period. For each simulation path, option payoffs are calculated\nbased on the contractual terms, and then discounted at the term-matched risk-free rate, where the value of the option is calculated as the\naverage present value over all simulated paths. We used the historical volatility of comparable companies to make certain assumptions\nin the MCS model, which resulted in an expected EBITDA volatility of 70.0% and an equity volatility of 70.0%, with these two inputs\nhaving a correlation factor of 70.0%. A 4.1% risk-free interest rate was used, which was based on U.S. treasury yields for a time period\ncorresponding to the remaining contractual life of the option. Lastly, the MCS model assumed an EBITDA risk premium of 12.4%. As\nof June 30, 2023, this option was classified in Level 3 of the valuation hierarchy. As of June 30, 2024, the value is embedded within the\nnoncontrolling interest of SGB. During the year ended June 30, 2024, the Company recorded a $3.0 million adjustment to reduce the\nfair value of the option to purchase additional ownership in SGB to $2.3 million immediately before modification and partial exercise.\nThis was recorded to remeasurement gain on pre-existing equity interest in our consolidated statements of income. The remaining $2.3\nmillion option was recorded as purchase consideration to obtain a controlling interest in SGB during June 2024. See more details in\nNote 1.\nAcquisition-related Contingent Consideration. The contingent consideration liability related to our acquisition of LPM is\nmeasured at fair value at each reporting period using a MCS model with Level 3 unobservable inputs including estimated future cash\nflows generated by LPM, discount rates, and earnings volatility. Key assumptions used in the MCS model as of June 30, 2024 were an\nEBITDA risk premium of 10.7%, an EBITDA volatility of 65.0%, and a risk-free rate based on the USD yield curve between 4.6% and\n5.3%. During the year ended June 30, 2024, we recorded a $0.4 million reduction to our contingent consideration reflected in selling,\ngeneral, and administrative expenses. See Note 1 for more further information regarding our contingent consideration.\n87\nThe following tables present information about the Company's assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis,\naggregated by each fair value hierarchy level (in thousands):\nJune 30, 2024\nQuoted Price in Significant\nActive Markets Other Significant\nfor Identical Observable Unobservable\nInstruments Inputs Inputs\n(Level 1) (Level 2) (Level 3) Total\nAssets:\nInventories(1) $ 1,093,908 $ — $ — $ 1,093,908\nPrecious metals held under financing arrangements 22,066 — — 22,066\nDerivative assets — open sale and purchase commitments, net 98,012 — — 98,012\nDerivative assets — futures contracts 1,557 — — 1,557\nDerivative assets — forward contracts 15,151 — — 15,151\nTotal assets, valued at fair value $ 1,230,694 $ — $ — $ 1,230,694\nLiabilities:\nLiabilities on borrowed metals $ 31,993 $ — $ — $ 31,993\nProduct financing arrangements 517,744 — — 517,744\nDerivative liabilities — open sale and purchase commitments, net 7,690 — — 7,690\nDerivative liabilities — margin accounts 4,766 — — 4,766\nDerivative liabilities — futures contracts 39 — — 39\nDerivative liabilities — forward contracts 14,256 — — 14,256\nAcquisition-related contingent consideration — — 2,430 2,430\nTotal liabilities, valued at fair value $ 576,488 $ — $ 2,430 $ 578,918\n(1) Commemorative coin inventory totaling $3.2 million was held at lower of cost or realizable value, and thus is excluded from the inventories balance shown in this\ntable.\nJune 30, 2023\nQuoted Price in Significant\nActive Markets Other Significant\nfor Identical Observable Unobservable\nInstruments Inputs Inputs\n(Level 1) (Level 2) (Level 3) Total\nAssets:\nInventories(1) $ 980,695 $ — $ — $ 980,695\nPrecious metals held under financing arrangements 25,530 — — 25,530\nDerivative assets — open sale and purchase commitments, net 37,957 — — 37,957\nDerivative assets — futures contracts 832 — — 832\nDerivative assets — forward contracts 39,092 — — 39,092\nOption to purchase interest in a long-term investment — — 5,300 5,300\nTotal assets, valued at fair value $ 1,084,106 $ — $ 5,300 $ 1,089,406\nLiabilities:\nLiabilities on borrowed metals $ 21,642 $ — $ — $ 21,642\nProduct financing arrangements 335,831 — — 335,831\nDerivative liabilities — open sale and purchase commitments, net 853 — — 853\nDerivative liabilities — margin accounts 4,441 — — 4,441\nDerivative liabilities — futures contracts 1,161 — — 1,161\nDerivative liabilities — forward contracts 1,621 — — 1,621\nTotal liabilities, valued at fair value $ 365,549 $ — $ — $ 365,549\n(1) Commemorative coin inventory totaling $0.9 million was held at lower of cost or net realizable value, and thus is excluded from the inventories balance shown in\nthis table.\nThere were no transfers in or out of Level 2 or 3 from other levels within the fair value hierarchy during the reported periods.\nAssets Measured at Fair Value on a Non-Recurring Basis\nCertain assets are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. These assets are not measured at fair value on an ongoing basis,\nbut are subject to fair value adjustments only under certain circumstances. These include (i) investments in private companies when\nthere are identifiable events or changes in circumstances that may have a significant adverse impact on the fair value of these assets, (ii)\nequity method investments that are remeasured to the acquisition-date fair value upon the Company obtaining a controlling interest in\nthe investee during a step acquisition, (iii) property, plant, and equipment and definite-lived intangibles, (iv) goodwill, and (v) indefinite-\nlived intangibles, all of which are written down to fair value when they are held for sale or determined to be impaired.\n88\nOur non-recurring valuations use significant unobservable inputs and significant judgments and therefore fall under Level 3 of\nthe fair value hierarchy. The valuation inputs include assumptions on the appropriate discount rates, long-term growth rates, relevant\ncomparable company earnings multiples, and the amount and timing of expected future cash flows. The cash flows employed in the\nanalyses are based on the Company’s estimated outlook and various growth rates. Discount rate assumptions are based on an assessment\nof the risk inherent in the future cash flows of the respective equity method investment, asset group, or reporting unit. In assessing the\nreasonableness of its determined fair values, the Company evaluates its results against other value indicators, such as comparable\ntransactions and comparable public company trading values.\n4. RECEIVABLES, NET\nReceivables, net consisted of the following (in thousands):\nJune 30, 2024 June 30, 2023\nCustomer trade receivables $ 12,373 $ 5,031\nWholesale trade advances 11,033 13,679\nDue from brokers and other 13,190 16,533\n$ 36,596 $ 35,243\nCustomer Trade Receivables. Customer trade receivables represent short-term, non-interest bearing amounts due from precious\nmetal sales, advances related to financing products, and other secured interests in assets of the customer.\nWholesale Trade Advances. Wholesale trade advances represent advances of various bullion products and cash advances for\npurchase commitments of precious metal inventory. Typically, these advances are unsecured, short-term, and non-interest bearing, and\nare made to wholesale metals dealers and government mints.\nDue from Brokers and Other. Due from brokers and other consists of the margin requirements held at brokers related to open\nfutures contracts (see Note 12) and other receivables.\n5. SECURED LOANS RECEIVABLE\nBelow is a summary of the carrying value of our secured loans (in thousands):\nJune 30, 2024 June 30, 2023\nSecured loans originated $ 96,573 $ 68,630\nSecured loans originated - with a related party 15 —\n96,588 68,630\nSecured loans acquired 16,479 31,990\n$ 113,067 $ 100,620\nSecured Loans - Originated: Secured loans include short-term loans, which include a combination of on-demand lines and short-\nterm facilities. These loans are fully secured by the customer's assets, which predominantly include bullion, numismatic, and semi-\nnumismatic material, and are typically held in safekeeping by the Company. See Note 14 for further information regarding our secured\nloans made to related parties.\nSecured Loans - Acquired: Secured loans also include short-term loans, which include a combination of on-demand lines and\nshort-term facilities that are purchased from our customers. The Company acquires a portfolio of their loan receivables at a price that\napproximates the outstanding balance of each loan in the portfolio, as determined on the effective transaction date. Each loan in the\nportfolio is fully secured by the borrower's assets, which could include bullion, numismatic or semi-numismatic material, and are\ntypically held in safekeeping by the Company. The seller of the loan portfolio generally retains the responsibility for the servicing and\nadministration of the loans.\nAs of June 30, 2024 and June 30, 2023, our secured loans carried weighted-average effective interest rates of 10.5% and 10.4%,\nrespectively, and mature in periods ranging typically from on-demand to one year.\nThe secured loans that the Company generates with its active customers are reflected as an operating activity on the consolidated\nstatements of cash flows. The secured loans that the Company generates with borrowers that are not active customers are reflected as\nan investing activity on the consolidated statements of cash flows as secured loans receivables, net. For the secured loans that (i) are\nreflected as an investing activity and have terms that allow the borrowers to increase their loan balance (at the discretion of the Company)\nbased on the excess value of their collateral compared to their aggregate principal balance of loan, and (ii) are repayable on demand or\nin the short-term, the borrowings and repayments are netted on the consolidated statements of cash flows.\n89\nCredit Quality of Secured Loans Receivables and Allowance for Credit Losses\nGeneral\nThe Company's secured loan receivables portfolio comprises loans with similar credit risk profiles, which enables the Company\nto apply a standard methodology to determine the credit quality for each loan and the allowance for credit losses, if any.\nThe credit quality of each loan is generally determined by the collateral value assessment, loan-to-value (“LTV”) ratio (that is,\nthe principal amount of the loan divided by the estimated value of the collateral) and the type (or class) of secured material. All loans\nare fully secured by precious metal bullion, numismatic and semi-numismatic collateral, or graded sports cards, which remains in the\nphysical custody of the Company for the duration of the loan. The term of the loans is generally 180 days, however loans are typically\nrenewed prior to maturity and therefore remain outstanding for a longer period of time. Interest earned on a loan is billed monthly and\nis typically due and payable within 20 days and, if not paid after all applicable grace periods, is added to the outstanding principal\nbalance, and late fees and default interest rates are assessed.\nWhen an account is in default or if a margin call has not been met on a timely basis, the loan is considered non-performing and\nthe Company has the right to liquidate the borrower's collateral in order to satisfy the unpaid balance of the outstanding loans, including\naccrued and unpaid interest.\nClass and Credit Quality of Loans\nThe three classes of secured loan receivables are defined by collateral type: (i) bullion, (ii) numismatic and semi-numismatic and\n(iii) graded sports cards. The Company required LTV ratios vary with the class of loans. Typically, the Company requires an LTV ratio\nof approximately 75% for bullion, 65% for numismatic and semi-numismatic collateral, and 50% for graded sports cards. The LTV ratio\nfor loans collateralized by numismatic and semi-numismatic collateral is typically lower on a percentage basis than bullion collateralized\nloans because a higher value of the numismatic and semi-numismatic collateral relates to its premium value, rather than its underlying\ncommodity value. The LTV ratio for loans collateralized by graded sports cards is lower because the underlying collateral is not as\nliquid as bullion and numismatic and semi-numismatic collateral.\nThe Company's secured loans by portfolio class, which align with internal management reporting, were as follows (in thousands):\nJune 30, 2024 June 30, 2023\nBullion $ 64,764 57.3% $ 52,165 51.8%\nNumismatic and semi-numismatic 42,588 37.7% 47,856 47.6%\nGraded sports cards 5,715 5.0% 599 0.6%\n$ 113,067 100.0% $ 100,620 100.0%\nDue to the nature of market fluctuations of precious metal commodity prices, the Company monitors the bullion collateral value\nof each loan on a daily basis, based on spot price of precious metals. Numismatic and graded sports cards collateral values are updated\nby numismatic and graded sports cards specialists typically within every 90 days and when loan terms are renewed.\nGenerally, we initiate the margin call process when the outstanding loan balance is in excess of 85% of the current value of the\nunderlying collateral. In the event that a borrower fails to meet a margin call to reestablish the required LTV ratio, the loan is considered\nin default. The collateral material (either bullion, numismatic or graded sports cards) underlying such loans is then sold by the Company\nto satisfy all amounts due under the loan.\nLoans with LTV ratios of less than 75% are generally considered to be higher quality loans. Below is summary of aggregate\noutstanding secured loan balances bifurcated into (i) loans with an LTV ratio of less than 75% and (ii) loans with an LTV ratio of 75%\nor more (in thousands):\nJune 30, 2024 June 30, 2023\nLoan-to-value of less than 75% $ 101,197 89.5% $ 90,378 89.8%\nLoan-to-value of 75% or more 11,870 10.5% 10,242 10.2%\n$ 113,067 100.0% $ 100,620 100.0%\nThe Company had no loans with an LTV ratio in excess of 100% as of June 30, 2024 and June 30, 2023.\nNon-Performing Loans/Impaired Loans\nHistorically, the Company has not established an allowance for any credit losses because the Company maintains sufficient\ncollateral to satisfy amounts due.\n90\nNon-performing loans have the highest probability for credit loss. If needed, an allowance for secured loan credit losses\nattributable to non-performing loans is recorded based on the most probable source of repayment, which is normally the liquidation of\ncollateral. Due to the accelerated liquidation terms of the Company's loan portfolio, past due loans are generally liquidated within 90\ndays of default. In the event a loan were to become non-performing and the collateral is not sufficient to satisfy amounts due, the\nCompany would determine a reserve to reduce the carrying balance to its estimated net realizable value. As of June 30, 2024 and June 30,\n2023, the Company had no allowance for secured loan losses or loans classified as non-performing.\nA loan is considered impaired if it is probable, based on current information and events, that the Company will be unable to collect\nall amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan. Customer loans are reviewed for impairment and include loans that are\nnon-performing, or if the customer is in bankruptcy. In the event of an impairment, recognition of interest income would be suspended,\nand the loan would be placed on non-accrual status at the time. Accrual would be resumed, and previously suspended interest income\nwould be recognized, when the loan becomes contractually current and/or collection doubts are removed. Cash receipts on impaired\nloans are recorded first against the principal and then to any unrecognized interest income. For the years ended June 30, 2024, 2023,\nand 2022, the Company incurred no loan impairment costs and no loans were placed on a non-accrual status.\n6. INVENTORIES\nOur inventory consists of the precious metals that the Company has physically received, and inventory held by third-parties,\nwhich, at the Company's option, it may or may not receive. The following table summarizes the components of our inventory (in\nthousands):\nJune 30, 2024 June 30, 2023\nInventory held for sale $ 342,196 $ 437,670\nRepurchase arrangements with customers 199,559 181,751\nConsignment arrangements with customers 2,416 3,801\nCommemorative coins, held at lower of cost or net realizable value 3,236 948\nBorrowed precious metals 31,993 21,642\nProduct financing arrangements 517,744 335,831\n$ 1,097,144 $ 981,643\nInventory Held for Sale. Inventory held for sale represents precious metals, excluding commemorative coin inventory, that have\nbeen received by the Company and are not subject to repurchase by or consignment arrangements with third parties, borrowed precious\nmetals, or product financing arrangements. As of June 30, 2024 and June 30, 2023, inventory held for sale totaled $342.2 million and\n$437.7 million, respectively.\nRepurchase Arrangements with Customers. The Company enters into arrangements with certain customers under which A-Mark\nsells and then purchases precious metals from the customer which are subject to repurchase by the customer at the fair value of the\nproduct on the repurchase date. These initial transactions with the customer do not qualify as sales and are excluded from revenue.\nUnder these arrangements, the Company, which holds legal title to the metals, earns financing income until the time the arrangement is\nterminated, or the material is repurchased by the customer. In the event of a repurchase by the customer, the Company records a sale.\nThese arrangements are typically terminable by either party upon 14 days' notice. Upon termination, the customer’s rights to\nrepurchase any remaining inventory is forfeited. As of June 30, 2024 and June 30, 2023, included within inventories is $199.6 million\nand $181.8 million, respectively, of precious metals products subject to repurchase arrangements with customers.\nConsignment Arrangements with Customers. The Company periodically loans metals to customers on a short-term consignment\nbasis. Inventory loaned under consignment arrangements to customers as of June 30, 2024 and June 30, 2023 totaled $2.4 million and\n$3.8 million, respectively. Such transactions are recorded as sales and are removed from the Company's inventory at the time the\ncustomer elects to price and purchase the precious metals.\nCommemorative Coins. Our commemorative coin inventory, including its premium component, is held at the lower of cost or net\nrealizable value, because the value of commemorative coins is influenced more by supply and demand determinants than on the\nunderlying spot price of the precious metal content of the commemorative coins. The value of commemorative coins is not subject to\nthe same level of volatility as bullion coins because our commemorative coins typically carry a substantially higher premium over the\nspot metal price than bullion coins. Our commemorative coins are not hedged and totaled $3.2 million and $0.9 million as of June 30,\n2024 and June 30, 2023, respectively.\n91\nBorrowed Precious Metals. Borrowed precious metals inventory include: (i) metals held by suppliers as collateral on advanced\npool metals, (ii) metals due to suppliers for the use of their consigned inventory, (iii) unallocated metal positions held by customers in\nthe Company’s inventory, and (iv) shortages in unallocated metal positions held by the Company in the supplier’s inventory. Unallocated\nor pool metal represents an unsegregated inventory position that is due on demand, in a specified physical form, based on the total\nounces of metal held in the position. Amounts due under these arrangements require delivery either in the form of precious metals or\ncash. The Company's inventory included borrowed precious metals with market values totaling $32.0 million and $21.6 million as of\nJune 30, 2024 and June 30, 2023, respectively, with a corresponding offsetting obligation reflected as liabilities on borrowed metals on\nthe consolidated balance sheets.\nProduct Financing Arrangements. This inventory represents amounts held as security by lenders for obligations under product\nfinancing arrangements. The Company enters into a product financing agreement for the transfer and subsequent re-acquisition of gold\nand silver at an agreed-upon price based on the spot price with a third-party finance company. This inventory is restricted and is held at\na custodial storage facility in exchange for a financing fee, paid to the third-party finance company. During the term of the financing,\nthe third-party finance company holds the inventory as collateral, and both parties intend for the inventory to be returned to the Company\nat an agreed-upon price based on the spot price on the finance arrangement repurchase date. These transactions do not qualify as sales\nand have been accounted for as financing arrangements in accordance with ASC 470-40 Product Financing Arrangements. The\nobligation is stated at the amount required to repurchase the outstanding inventory. Both the product financing arrangements and the\nunderlying inventory are carried at fair value, with changes in fair value included in cost of sales in the consolidated statements of\nincome. Such obligations totaled $517.7 million and $335.8 million as of June 30, 2024 and June 30, 2023, respectively.\nThe Company mitigates market risk of its physical inventory and open commitments through commodity hedge transactions. (See\nNote 12.)

GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS\nGoodwill is an intangible asset that arises when a company acquires an existing business or assets (net of assumed liabilities)\nwhich comprise a business. In general, the amount of goodwill recorded in an acquisition is calculated as the purchase price of the\nbusiness minus the fair market value of the tangible assets and the identifiable intangible assets, net of the assumed liabilities. Goodwill\nand intangibles can also be established by push-down accounting. Below is a summary of the significant transactions that generated our\ngoodwill and intangible assets:\n• In connection with the Company's formation of AMST in August 2016, the Company recorded $2.5 million and $4.3 million\nof identifiable intangible assets and goodwill, respectively; these values were based upon an independent appraisal and\nrepresent their fair values at the acquisition date.\n• In connection with the Company's acquisition of Goldline in August 2017, the Company recorded $5.0 million and $1.4\nmillion of additional identifiable intangible assets and goodwill, respectively; these values were based upon an independent\nappraisal and represent their fair values at the acquisition date.\n• In March 2021, the Company acquired 100% ownership of JMB, in which we previously held a 20.5% equity interest. At\nthe acquisition date we measured the value of identifiable intangible assets and goodwill at $98.0 million and $92.1 million,\nrespectively. These values represent their fair values at the acquisition date.\n• In October 2022, JMB acquired $4.5 million of intangible assets that included: BGASC’s website, domain name,\ntrademarks, logos, customer list, and all intellectual property.\n93\n• In connection with the Company's acquisition of LPM in February 2024, we recorded $10.3 million and $21.0 million of\nidentifiable intangible assets and goodwill, respectively. These values represent their fair values at the acquisition date.\n• In March 2024, JMB acquired $8.5 million of intangible assets that included Gold.com's domain name.\n• In June 2024, we obtained a controlling interest in SGB, at which point SGB became a consolidated subsidiary of the\ncompany. We measured the value of identifiable intangible assets and goodwill at $28.8 million and $78.0 million,\nrespectively. These values represent their fair values as of the acquisition date.\nCarrying Value\nThe carrying value of goodwill and other purchased intangibles are described below (dollar amounts in thousands):\nJune 30, 2024 June 30, 2023\nRemaining\nWeighted-\nAverage\nEstimated Amortization Gross Gross\nUseful Lives Period Carrying Accumulated Accumulated Net Book Carrying Accumulated Accumulated Net Book\n(Years) (Years) Amount Amortization Impairment Value Amount Amortization Impairment Value\nIdentifiable intangible assets:\nExisting customer\nrelationships 4 - 15 4.4 $ 75,568 $ (52,203) $ — $ 23,365 $ 55,768 $ (46,465) $ — $ 9,303\nDeveloped technology 4 3.4 20,336 (8,933) — 11,403 11,036 (6,077) — 4,959\nNon-compete and other 3 - 5 3.3 2,310 (2,300) — 10 2,310 (2,300) — 10\nEmployment agreement 1 - 3 0.0 295 (295) — — 295 (295) — —\nIntangibles subject to amortization 98,509 (63,731) — 34,778 69,409 (55,137) — 14,272\nTrade names and\ntrademarks Indefinite Indefinite 59,660 — (1,290) 58,370 49,648 — (1,290) 48,358\nDomain name Indefinite Indefinite 8,515 — — 8,515 — — — —\nIdentifiable intangible assets $ 166,684 $ (63,731) $ (1,290) $101,663 $ 119,057 $ (55,137) $ (1,290) $ 62,630\nGoodwill Indefinite Indefinite $ 201,301 $ — $ (1,364) $199,937 $ 102,307 $ — $ (1,364) $ 100,943\nThe Company's intangible assets are subject to amortization except for trade names, trademarks, and domain names, which have\nindefinite lives. Amortization expense related to the Company's intangible assets was $8.6 million, $10.3 million, and $25.7 million for\nthe years ended June 30, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively. For the presented periods, amortization expense allocable to cost of sales\nwas not significant.\nThe changes in the carrying amounts of goodwill were as follows (in thousands):\nBalance as of June 30, 2023 $ 100,943\nGoodwill acquired - LPM 21,034\nGoodwill acquired - SGB 77,960\nBalance as of June 30, 2024 $ 199,937\nImpairment\nWe recorded a non-recurring impairment charge of $2.7 million (goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets) in fiscal 2018\nrelated to Goldline. Other than the impairment charge related to Goldline, we have not recorded any impairment of goodwill or\nindefinite-lived intangible assets.\nEstimated Amortization\nEstimated annual amortization expense related to definite-lived intangible assets for the succeeding five years is as follows (in\nthousands):\nFiscal Year Ending June 30, Amount\n2025 13,458\n2026 7,798\n2027 6,059\n2028 4,866\n2029 734\nThereafter 1,863\n$ 34,778\n94\n10.

Pinehurst Coin Exchange, Inc. and Stack's Bowers\nNumismatics, LLC also each own a one-third equity interest in APS Investment, LLC.\nWe consider all of our equity method investees to be related parties. See Note 14 for a summary of the Company's aggregate\nbalances and activity with these related party entities. All of the Company's investees are accounted for using the equity method, with\nthe exception of Company A, which is accounted for using the cost method and is not considered a related party.\nFor equity method investments with greater than 20% ownership, the carrying value at June 30, 2024 exceeded our share of the\ninvestees' book value by $10.4 million which is primarily attributable to goodwill and intangible assets.\n11. ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND OTHER CURRENT LIABILITIES\nAccounts payable and other current liabilities consisted of the following (in thousands):\nJune 30, 2024 June 30, 2023\nTrade payables to customers $ 12,005 $ 20,512\nOther accounts payable 6,826 4,953\nAccounts payable and other payables $ 18,831 $ 25,465\nDeferred revenue $ 22,354 $ 7,419\nAdvances from customers 240,932 173,944\nDeferred revenue and other advances $ 263,286 $ 181,363\nAs of June 30, 2024 and June 30, 2023, advances from customers included $99.6 million and $79.8 million, respectively, of\nadvances related to precious metals leases.\n12. DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING TRANSACTIONS\nThe Company is exposed to market risk, such as changes in commodity prices and foreign exchange rates. To manage the volatility\nrelated to these exposures, the Company enters into various derivative products, such as forward and futures contracts. By policy, the\nCompany historically has entered into derivative financial instruments for the purpose of hedging substantially all of Company's market\nexposure to precious metals prices, and not for speculative purposes. The Company’s gains (losses) on derivative instruments are\nsubstantially offset by the changes in the fair market value of the underlying precious metals inventory, both of which are recorded in\ncost of sales in the consolidated statements of income.\nCommodity Price Management\nThe Company manages the value of certain assets and liabilities of its trading business, including trading inventory, by employing\na variety of hedging strategies. These strategies include the management of exposure to changes in the market values of the Company's\ntrading inventory through the purchase and sale of a variety of derivative instruments, such as forward and futures contracts.\n95\nThe Company enters into derivative transactions solely for the purpose of hedging its inventory subject to price risk, and not for\nspeculative market purposes. Due to the nature of the Company's global hedging strategy, the Company is not using hedge accounting\nas defined under ASC 815, whereby the gains or losses would be deferred and included as a component of other comprehensive income.\nInstead, gains or losses resulting from the Company's forward and futures contracts and open sale and purchase commitments are\nreported in the consolidated statements of income as unrealized gains or losses on commodity contracts (a component of cost of sales),\nwith the related unrealized amounts due from or to counterparties reflected as derivative assets or liabilities on the consolidated balance\nsheets.\nThe Company's trading inventory and purchase and sale transactions consist primarily of precious metal products. The value of\nthese assets and liabilities are marked-to-market daily to the prevailing closing price of the underlying precious metals. The Company's\nprecious metals inventory is subject to fluctuations in market value, resulting from changes in the underlying commodity prices.\nInventory purchased or borrowed by the Company is subject to price changes. Inventory borrowed is considered a natural hedge, since\nchanges in value of the metal held are offset by the obligation to return the metal to the supplier.\nOpen sale and purchase commitments are subject to changes in value between the date the purchase or sale price is fixed (the trade\ndate) and the date the metal is received or delivered (the settlement date). The Company seeks to minimize the effect of price changes\nof the underlying commodity through the use of forward and futures contracts. The Company’s open sale and purchase commitments\ntypically settle within 2 business days, and for those commitments that do not have stated settlement dates, the Company has the right\nto settle the positions upon demand.\nThe Company's policy is to substantially hedge its inventory position, net of open sale and purchase commitments that are subject\nto price risk, and regularly enters into precious metals commodity forward and futures contracts with financial institutions to hedge\nagainst this risk. The Company uses futures contracts, which typically settle within 30 days, for its shorter-term hedge positions, and\nforward contracts, which may remain open for up to 6 months, for its longer-term hedge positions. The Company has access to all of\nthe precious metals markets, allowing it to place hedges. The Company also maintains relationships with major market makers in every\nmajor precious metal dealing center.\nThe Company’s management sets credit and position risk limits. These limits include gross position limits for counterparties\nengaged in sales and purchase transactions with the Company. They also include collateral limits for different types of sale and purchase\ntransactions that counterparties may engage in from time to time.\nDerivative Assets and Liabilities\nThe Company's derivative assets and liabilities represent the net fair value of the difference (or intrinsic value) between market\nvalues and trade values at the trade date for open precious metals sale and purchase contracts, as adjusted on a daily basis for changes\nin market values of the underlying metals, until settled. The Company's derivative assets and liabilities also include the net fair value of\nopen precious metals forward and futures contracts. The precious metals forward and futures contracts are settled at the contract\nsettlement date.\nAll of our commodity derivative contracts are under master netting arrangements and include both asset and liability positions\n(i.e., offsetting derivative instruments). As such, for the Company's derivative contracts with the same counterparty, the receivables and\npayables have been netted on the consolidated balance sheets. Such derivative contracts include open sale and purchase commitments,\nfutures, forward and margin accounts. The aggregate gross and net derivative receivables and payables balances by contract type and\ntype of hedge, were as follows (in thousands):\nJune 30, 2024 June 30, 2023\nCash Cash\nGross Amounts Collateral Net Gross Amounts Collateral Net\nDerivative Netted Pledge Derivative Derivative Netted Pledge Derivative\nNettable derivative assets:\nOpen sale and purchase commitments $ 102,091 $ (4,079) $ — $ 98,012 $ 53,924 $ (15,967) $ — $ 37,957\nFutures contracts 1,557 — — 1,557 832 — — 832\nForward contracts 15,151 — — 15,151 39,092 — — 39,092\n$ 118,799 $ (4,079) $ — $ 114,720 $ 93,848 $ (15,967) $ — $ 77,881\nNettable derivative liabilities:\nOpen sale and purchase commitments $ 8,724 $ (1,034) $ — $ 7,690 $ 2,271 $ (1,418) $ — $ 853\nMargin accounts 22,316 — (17,550) 4,766 17,681 — (13,240) 4,441\nFutures contracts 39 — — 39 1,161 — — 1,161\nForward contracts 14,256 — — 14,256 1,621 — — 1,621\n$ 45,335 $ (1,034) $ (17,550) $ 26,751 $ 22,734 $ (1,418) $ (13,240) $ 8,076\n96\nGains or Losses on Derivative Instruments\nThe Company records the derivative at the trade date with corresponding unrealized gains or losses shown as a component of cost\nof sales in the consolidated statements of income. The Company adjusts the derivatives to fair value on a daily basis until the transactions\nare settled. When these contracts are net settled, the unrealized gains and losses are reversed, and the realized gains and losses for\nforward contracts are recorded in revenue and cost of sales, and the net realized gains and losses for futures contracts are recorded in\ncost of sales.\nBelow is a summary of the net gains (losses) on derivative instruments (in thousands):\nYear Ended June 30,\n2024 2023 2022\nGains (losses) on derivative instruments:\nUnrealized gains (losses) on open futures commodity and forward contracts and open sale and\npurchase commitments, net $ 18,225 $ 53,453 $ (18,799)\nRealized (losses) gains on futures commodity contracts, net (16,563) 43,630 66,624\n$ 1,662 $ 97,083 $ 47,825\nThe Company’s net gains (losses) on derivative instruments, as shown in the table above, were substantially offset by the changes\nin the fair market value of the underlying precious metals inventory, which were also recorded in cost of sales in the consolidated\nstatements of income.\nSummary of Hedging Positions\nIn a hedging relationship, the change in the value of the derivative financial instrument is offset to a great extent by the change in\nthe value of the underlying hedged item. The following table summarizes the results of our hedging activities, which shows the precious\nmetal commodity inventory position, net of open sale and purchase commitments, that was subject to price risk (in thousands):\nJune 30, 2024 June 30, 2023\nInventories $ 1,097,144 $ 981,643\nPrecious metals held under financing arrangements 22,066 25,530\n1,119,210 1,007,173\nLess unhedgeable inventories:\nCommemorative coin inventory, held at lower of cost or net realizable value (3,236) (948)\nPremium on metals position (34,175) (29,358)\nPrecious metal value not hedged (37,411) (30,306)\nCommitments at market:\nOpen inventory purchase commitments 817,900 921,108\nOpen inventory sales commitments (388,184) (587,392)\nMargin sale commitments (22,316) (17,682)\nIn-transit inventory no longer subject to market risk (21,715) (5,505)\nUnhedgeable premiums on open commitment positions 10,986 11,224\nBorrowed precious metals (31,993) (21,642)\nProduct financing arrangements (517,744) (335,831)\nAdvances on industrial metals 394 698\n(152,672) (35,022)\nPrecious metal subject to price risk 929,127 941,845\nPrecious metal subject to derivative financial instruments:\nPrecious metals forward contracts at market values 843,439 767,767\nPrecious metals futures contracts at market values 83,214 170,466\nTotal market value of derivative financial instruments 926,653 938,233\nNet precious metals subject to commodity price risk $ 2,474 $ 3,612\n97\nNotional Balances of Derivatives\nThe notional balances of the Company's derivative instruments, consisting of contractual metal quantities, are expressed at current\nspot prices of the underlying precious metal commodity. As of June 30, 2024 and June 30, 2023, the Company had the following\noutstanding commitments and open forward and futures contracts (in thousands):\nJune 30, 2024 June 30, 2023\nPurchase commitments $ 817,900 $ 921,108\nSales commitments $ (388,184) $ (587,392)\nMargin sales commitments $ (22,316) $ (17,682)\nOpen forward contracts $ 843,439 $ 767,767\nOpen futures contracts $ 83,214 $ 170,466\nThe contract amounts (i.e., notional balances) of the Company's forward and futures contracts and the open sales and purchase\ncommitments are not reflected in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The Company records the difference between the\nmarket price of the underlying metal or contract and the trade amount at fair value.\nThe Company is exposed to the risk of failure of the counterparties to its derivative contracts. Significant judgment is applied by\nthe Company when evaluating the fair value implications. The Company regularly reviews the creditworthiness of its major\ncounterparties and monitors its exposure to concentrations. As of June 30, 2024, the Company believes its risk of counterparty default\nis mitigated as a result of such evaluation and the short-term duration of these arrangements.\nForeign Currency Exchange Rate Management\nThe Company utilizes foreign currency forward contracts to manage the effect of foreign currency exchange fluctuations on its\nsale and purchase transactions. These contracts generally have maturities of less than one week. The market values (fair values) of the\nCompany’s foreign exchange forward contracts and the net open sale and purchase commitment transactions, denominated in foreign\ncurrencies, outstanding were as follows (in thousands):\nJune 30, 2024 June 30, 2023\nForeign exchange forward contracts $ 4,793 $ 7,101\nOpen sale and purchase commitment transactions, net $ 4,705 $ 5,611\n13.

In addition, for the year ended June 30, 2024, our effective tax rate\ndiffered from the federal statutory rate due to a one-time adjustment related to our acquisition of a controlling interest in SGB.\nA reconciliation of the income tax provision to the amounts computed by applying the statutory federal income tax rate to income\nbefore tax are set forth below (in thousands):\nYear Ended June 30,\n2024 2023 2022\nFederal income tax provision at statutory rate $ 17,383 $ 42,666 $ 34,947\nState and local tax, net of federal benefit 1,188 5,083 3,236\nAdjustment related to acquisition of a controlling interest in SGB (4,544) — —\nForeign derived intangible income (93) (791) (1,476)\nStock-based compensation (1,095) (1,171) (3,075)\nState rate change (231) 202 (171)\nPermanent adjustments 509 311 (252)\nForeign rate differential 66 30 217\nForeign withholding taxes 377 — —\nOther 185 71 (88)\n$ 13,745 $ 46,401 $ 33,338\nIncome Taxes Receivable and Payable\nAs of June 30, 2024 and June 30, 2023, we had an income tax receivable of $1.6 million and payable of $1.0 million, respectively.\nDeferred Tax Assets and Liabilities\nIn assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or\nall of the deferred tax assets will be realized by evaluating both positive and negative evidence. The ultimate realization of deferred tax\nassets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become\ndeductible. As of June 30, 2024 and June 30, 2023, management concluded that it was more likely than not that the Company would be\nable to realize the benefit of the U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets. We based this conclusion on historical and projected operating\nperformance, as well as our expectation that our operations will generate sufficient taxable income in future periods to realize the tax\nbenefits associated with the deferred tax assets. A tax valuation allowance was considered unnecessary, as management concluded that\nit was more likely than not that the Company would be able to realize the benefit of the U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets.\nAs of June 30, 2024, the consolidated balance sheet reflects the deferred tax items for each tax-paying component (i.e., federal,\nstate and foreign), resulting in a federal deferred tax liability of $12.5 million, a state deferred tax liability of $1.7 million, and a foreign\ndeferred tax liability of $8.1 million. As of June 30, 2023, the consolidated balance sheet reflects the deferred tax items for each tax-\npaying component (i.e., federal and state), resulting in a federal deferred tax liability of $14.4 million and a state deferred tax liability\nof $2.3 million.\nAs a result of the acquisition of LPM and a controlling interest in SGB in fiscal year 2024, the Company recorded $8.1 million of\nnet deferred tax liabilities primarily on the excess of book basis over the tax basis of the acquired intangible assets.

FINANCING AGREEMENTS\nLines of Credit - Trading Credit Facility\nOn December 21, 2021, the Company entered into a three-year committed facility provided by a syndicate of financial institutions\n(the “Trading Credit Facility”), with a total revolving commitment of up to $350.0 million and with a termination date of December 21,\n2024. In September 2023, this Trading Credit Facility was amended to add a new lender, a new subsidiary loan party and guarantor and\nmodify certain terms and conditions of the Trading Credit Facility, including increasing the incremental facility feature to $190 million,\neliminating provisions whereby lenders under certain conditions could require repayment of all obligations outstanding under the\nTrading Credit Facility within 10 days on demand, and updating the maturity date to September 20, 2025. As a result, the Trading Credit\nFacility was reclassified to long-term during the three months ended September 30, 2023. In June 2024, we amended the Trading Credit\nFacility to increase the total facility feature to $422.5 million as well as other terms and conditions.\n102\nThe Trading Credit Facility is secured by substantially all of the Company’s assets on a first priority basis and is guaranteed by\nall of the Company's subsidiaries. The Trading Credit Facility currently bears interest at the daily SOFR rate plus an applicable margin\nof 236 basis points. As of June 30, 2024, the interest rate on our Trading Credit Facility was approximately 7.7% and the daily SOFR\nrate was approximately 5.3%.\nThe Trading Credit Facility provides the Company with the liquidity to buy and sell billions of dollars of precious metals annually.\nWe routinely use funds drawn under the Trading Credit Facility to purchase metals from our suppliers and for operating cash flow\npurposes.

The amounts available\nunder the respective lines of credit are determined at the end of each week and at each month end following a specified borrowing base\nformula. The Company is able to access additional credit as needed to finance operations, subject to the overall limits of the borrowing\nfacilities and lender approval of the borrowing base calculation. Based on the month end borrowing bases in effect, the availability under\nthe Trading Credit Facility, after taking into account current borrowings, totaled $145.5 million and $115.0 million as determined on\nJune 30, 2024 and June 30, 2023, respectively. As of June 30, 2024 and June 30, 2023, the remaining unamortized balance of loan costs\nwas approximately $3.4 million and $2.4 million, respectively.\nThe Trading Credit Facility contains various covenants, all of which the Company was in compliance with as of June 30, 2024.\nInterest expense related to the Company’s Trading Credit Facility totaled $24.3 million, $15.9 million, and $8.5 million, which\nrepresents 61.4%, 50.3%, and 38.6% of the total interest expense recognized for the years ended June 30, 2024, 2023, and 2022,\nrespectively. The Trading Credit Facility carried a daily weighted-average effective interest rate of 8.50%, 7.15%, and 4.47% for the\nyears ended June 30, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.\nNotes Payable - AMCF Notes\nIn September 2018, AM Capital Funding, LLC (“AMCF”), previously a wholly-owned subsidiary of CFC, completed an issuance\nof Secured Senior Term Notes (collectively, the \"AMCF Notes\"): Series 2018-1, Class A (the “Class A Notes”) in the aggregate principal\namount of $72.0 million and Secured Subordinated Term Notes, Series 2018-1, Class B (the “Class B Notes”) in the aggregate principal\namount of $28.0 million.

The\nAMCF Notes were repaid in full in December 2023; AMCF was dissolved in June 2024.\nFor the years ended June 30, 2024, 2023, and 2022, interest expense related to the AMCF Notes (including loan amortization\ncosts) totaled $2.5 million, $5.7 million, and $5.8 million which represents 6.3%, 17.9%, and 26.3% of the total interest expense\nrecognized by the Company, respectively. For the years ended June 30, 2024, 2023, and 2022, the AMCF Notes' weighted-average\neffective interest rate was 5.88%, 5.88%, and 5.88%, respectively.\nNotes Payable — Related Party\nSee Note 14.\nLiabilities on Borrowed Metals\nThe Company recorded liabilities on borrowed metals with market values totaling $32.0 million and $21.6 million as of June 30,\n2024 and June 30, 2023, respectively, which was included in inventories on the consolidated balance sheet.\nFor the years ended June 30, 2024, 2023, and 2022, the interest expense related to liabilities on borrowed metals totaled $2.0\nmillion, $1.9 million, and $1.3 million which represents 5.0%, 5.9%, and 6.0% of the total interest expense recognized by the Company,\nrespectively.\nAdvanced Pool Metals\nThe Company borrows precious metals from its suppliers and customers under short-term agreements using other precious metals\nfrom its inventory as collateral. The Company has the ability to sell the metals advanced. These arrangements can be settled by repayment\nin similar metals or in cash. Once the obligation is settled, the metals held as collateral are released back to the Company.\nLiabilities on Borrowed Metals — Other\nLiabilities may also arise from: (i) unallocated metal positions held by customers in the Company’s inventory, (ii) amounts due\nto suppliers for the use of their consigned inventory, and (iii) shortages in unallocated metal positions held by the Company in the\nsupplier’s inventory. Unallocated or pool metal represents an unsegregated inventory position that is due on demand, in a specified\nphysical form, based on the total ounces of metal held in the position. Amounts due under these arrangements require delivery either in\nthe form of precious metals or in cash.\n103\nProduct Financing Arrangements\nThe Company has agreements with third-party financial institutions which allow the Company to transfer its gold and silver\ninventory at an agreed-upon price, which is based on the spot price. Such agreements allow the Company to repurchase this inventory\nupon demand at an agreed-upon price based on the spot price on the repurchase date. The third-party charges a monthly fee as a\npercentage of the market value of the outstanding obligation; such monthly charges are classified in interest expense. These transactions\ndo not qualify as sales, and therefore have been accounted for as financing arrangements and are reflected in the consolidated balance\nsheet as product financing arrangements. The obligation is stated at the amount required to repurchase the outstanding inventory. Both\nthe product financing obligation and the underlying inventory (which is entirely restricted) are carried at fair value, with changes in fair\nvalue recorded as a component of cost of sales in the consolidated statements of income. Such obligations totaled $517.7 million and\n$335.8 million as of June 30, 2024 and June 30, 2023, respectively.\nFor the years ended June 30, 2024, 2023, and 2022, the interest expense related to product financing arrangements totaled $9.9\nmillion, $6.9 million, and $4.3 million, which represents 25.0%, 21.7%, and 19.4% of the total interest expense recognized by the\nCompany, respectively.\n16. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\nLegal Matters\nThe Company is from time-to-time party to various lawsuits, claims and other proceedings, that arise in the ordinary course of\nits business.\nAlthough the ultimate outcome of any legal matter cannot be predicted with certainty, based on current information, including our\nassessment of the merits of the particular claim, we do not expect that these legal proceedings or claims will have any material adverse\nimpact on our future consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.\nIn accordance with U.S. GAAP, we review the need to accrue for any loss contingency and establish a liability when, in the\nopinion of management, it is probable that a matter would result in a liability and the amount of loss, if any, can be reasonably estimated.\nWe do not believe that the resolution of any currently pending lawsuits, claims and proceedings, either individually or in the aggregate,\nwill have a material adverse effect on financial position, results of operations or liquidity. However, the outcomes of any currently\npending lawsuits, claims and proceedings cannot be predicted, and therefore, there can be no assurance that this will be the case.\nAdditionally, we record receivables for insurance recoveries relating to litigation-related losses and expenses if and when such\namounts are covered by insurance and recovery of such losses or expenses are due.\nEmployment and Non-Compete Agreements\nAs of June 30, 2024, the Company was a party to various employment agreements and non-compete and/or non-solicitation\nagreements with its employees, including employment agreements with (a) Greg Roberts, our Chief Executive Officer, which expires\nin June 2027, and (b) Thor Gjerdrum, our President, and (c) Brian Aquilino, our Chief Operating Officer, which expire in June 2025.\nThe Company's employment agreement with Michael Wittmeyer, formerly Chief Executive Officer of JMB, was terminated as of June\n30, 2023, at which time the Company and Mr. Wittmeyer entered into a consulting agreement, which expires in June 2025. The\nemployment agreements provide for minimum salary levels, incentive compensation and severance benefits, among other items, and the\nemployment agreements and the consulting agreement contain various non-compete and non-solicitation provisions.\nEmployee Benefit Plan\nThe Company maintains an employee retirement savings plan for United States employees under the Internal Revenue Code\nsection 401(k). There is an automatic default contribution for newly eligible employees in which 3% will be deducted pre-tax from the\nemployee’s pay and invested in their default fund unless directed otherwise. Employees are eligible to participate in the plan after three\ncomplete calendar months of service by the next plan entry date and are 21 years of age. All contributions are immediately vested.\nEmployees' contributions are discretionary to a maximum of 90% of compensation.

As of June 30,\n2024, 848,509 shares remain authorized for repurchase under the program.\nDuring the year ended June 30, 2024, we repurchased 815,756 shares under the program for $22.4 million. From inception of the\nprogram through June 30, 2024, we repurchased a total of 1,151,491 shares for $32.2 million.\nUnder the share repurchase program, we may repurchase shares of our common stock from time to time at prevailing market\nprices, depending on market conditions, through open market or privately negotiated transactions. Subject to applicable corporate\nsecurities laws, repurchases may be made at such times and prices and in amounts as management deems appropriate. We are not\nobligated to repurchase any shares under the program, and repurchases under the program may be discontinued if management\ndetermines that additional repurchases are not warranted.\n2014 Stock Award and Incentive Plan\nThe Company's amended and restated 2014 Stock Award and Incentive Plan (the \"2014 Plan\") was approved most recently on\nOctober 27, 2022 by the Company's stockholders. As of June 30, 2024, 1,692,891 shares were available for issuance of new awards\nunder the 2014 Plan.\nUnder the 2014 Plan, the Company may grant options and other equity awards as a means of attracting and retaining officers,\nemployees, non-employee directors and consultants, to provide incentives to such persons, and to align the interests of such persons\nwith the interests of stockholders by providing compensation based on the value of the Company's stock. Awards under the 2014 Plan\nmay be granted in the form of incentive or non-qualified stock options, stock appreciation rights (\"SARs\"), restricted stock, RSUs,\ndividend equivalent rights, other stock-based awards (which may include outright grants of shares) and cash incentive awards. The 2014\nPlan also authorizes grants of awards with performance-based conditions and market-based conditions. The 2014 Plan is administered\nby the Compensation Committee of the board of directors, which, in its discretion, may select officers and other employees, directors\n(including non-employee directors) and consultants to the Company and its subsidiaries to receive grants of awards. The board of\ndirectors itself may perform any of the functions of the Compensation Committee under the 2014 Plan.\n105\nUnder the 2014 Plan, the exercise price of options and base price of SARs, as set by the Compensation Committee, generally may\nnot be less than the fair market value of the shares on the date of grant, and the maximum term of stock options and SARs is ten years.\nThe 2014 Plan limits the number of share-denominated awards that may be granted to any one eligible person in any fiscal year to\n500,000 shares plus the participant's unused annual limit at the close of the previous year. Also, in the case of non-employee directors,\nthe 2014 Plan limits the maximum grant-date fair value at $300,000 of stock-denominated awards granted to a director in a given fiscal\nyear, except for a non-employee Chairman of the Board whose grant-date fair value maximum is $600,000 per fiscal year. The 2014\nPlan will terminate when no shares remain available for issuance and no awards remain outstanding; however, the authority to grant\nnew awards will terminate on October 27, 2032.\nStock Options\nThe Company measures the compensation cost of stock options using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, which uses various\ninputs such as the market price per share of common stock and estimates that include the risk-free interest rate, volatility, expected life\nand dividend yield. The weighted-averages for key assumptions used in determining the fair value of options granted were as follows:\nYear Ended June 30,\n2024 2023 2022\nAverage volatility n/a (1) 47.96% n/a (1)\nRisk-free interest rate n/a (1) 3.76% n/a (1)\nWeighted-average expected life in years n/a (1) 6.0 n/a (1)\nDividend yield rate annual n/a (1) 2.10% n/a (1)\n(1) Not applicable; no employee stock options were issued.\nThe Company incurred compensation expense related to stock options of $0.7 million, $1.2 million and $1.4 million during the\nyears ended June 30, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively. As of June 30, 2024, there was total remaining compensation expense of $0.1\nmillion related to employee stock options, which will be recorded over a weighted-average vesting period of approximately 1.0 years.\nThe following table summarizes stock option activity:\nWeighted-\nWeighted- Aggregate Average Grant\nAverage Exercise Intrinsic Value Date Fair Value\nOptions Price Per Share (in thousands) Per Award\nFiscal 2022\nOutstanding at June 30, 2021 2,318,056 $ 8.01 $ 35,343 $ 3.44\nExercises (538,596) $ 4.32 $ 15,874 $ 3.22\nOutstanding at June 30, 2022 1,779,460 $ 7.84 $ 43,433 $ 3.51\nExercisable at June 30, 2022 1,147,972 $ 6.28 $ 29,811 $ 2.65\nFiscal 2023\nOutstanding at June 30, 2022 1,779,460 $ 7.84 $ 43,433 $ 3.51\nGranted 10,000 $ 39.69 $ — (1) $ 16.56\nExercised (343,200) $ 6.68 $ 8,562 $ 3.57\nOutstanding at June 30, 2023 1,446,260 $ 7.11 $ 43,882 $ 3.58\nExercisable at June 30, 2023 1,175,591 $ 5.02 $ 38,505 $ 2.53\nFiscal 2024\nOutstanding at June 30, 2023 1,446,260 $ 7.11 $ 43,882 $ 3.58\nExercises (287,730) $ 7.17 $ 7,720 $ 3.82\nOutstanding at June 30, 2024 1,158,530 $ 7.10 $ 29,354 $ 3.53\nExercisable at June 30, 2024 1,116,866 $ 6.60 $ 28,822 $ 3.32\n(1) The Company issued the options with an exercise price per share not less than the closing market price of common stock on the grant date.\nThe following table summarizes information about stock options as of June 30, 2024:\nExercise Price Ranges Options Outstanding Options Exercisable\nWeighted-Average Weighted-Average\nNumber of Remaining Contractual Weighted- Number of Remaining Weighted-\nUnderlying Life Average Underlying Contractual Life Average\nFrom To Shares (Years) Exercise Price Shares (Years) Exercise Price\n$ — $ 5.00 584,862 5.16 $ 2.00 584,862 5.16 $ 2.00\n$ 5.01 $ 7.50 15,000 2.28 $ 6.33 15,000 2.28 $ 6.33\n$ 7.51 $ 12.50 350,000 1.64 $ 8.89 350,000 1.64 $ 8.89\n$ 12.51 $ 30.00 198,668 6.68 $ 17.26 162,004 6.67 $ 17.37\n$ 30.01 $ 50.00 10,000 8.60 $ 39.69 5,000 8.60 $ 39.69\n1,158,530 4.35 $ 7.10 1,116,866 4.25 $ 6.60\n106\nThe following table summarizes nonvested stock option activity:\nWeighted-Average\nGrant Date Fair Value\nOptions Per Award\nNonvested outstanding at June 30, 2023 270,669 $ 8.14\nVested (229,005) $ 7.94\nNonvested outstanding at June 30, 2024 41,664 $ 9.23\nRestricted Stock Units\nRSUs granted by the Company are not transferable and automatically convert to shares of common stock on a one-for-one basis\nas the awards vest or at a specified date after vesting.

The\naward is generally equivalent to stock appreciation rights on 466,728 shares with a base price of $36.32, including dividend equivalents\nbut subject to adjustment for the specified compensation offsets.\nThe fair value of this liability award is estimated with a Black-Scholes valuation model that uses certain assumptions, such as\nexpected volatility, risk-free interest rate, life of the award, dividend rate and strike price. The Company also estimates the most probable\naggregate total of the performance bonus to be paid over the performance period in determining the strike price of the award. The grant\ndate fair value of this liability award was $5.7 million. The fair value of this liability award was $3.2 million as of June 30, 2024 resulting\nfrom the following assumptions: a performance bonus estimate of $4.0 million to be paid over the four-year term, a risk-free rate of\n4.5%, and an equity volatility of 50.0%.\nCompensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the performance period, with the amount recognized fluctuating\ndue to remeasurement of fair value at the end of each reporting period because the award is classified as a liability. During the year\nended June 30, 2024, the Company recognized $0.8 million of compensation expense related to this cash incentive bonus award.\nCertain Anti-Takeover Provisions\nThe Company’s certificate of incorporation and by-laws contain certain anti-takeover provisions that could have the effect of\nmaking it more difficult for a third-party to acquire, or of discouraging a third-party from attempting to acquire, control of the Company\nwithout negotiating with its board of directors. Such provisions could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future\nfor the Company’s securities. Certain of such provisions allow the Company to issue preferred stock with rights senior to those of the\ncommon stock or impose various procedural and other requirements which could make it more difficult for stockholders to effect certain\ncorporate actions.\n18.

CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL\nDISCLOSURE\nNone.\nITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nDisclosure Controls and Procedures\nUnder the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial\nOfficer (our \"Certifying Officers\"), we carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure\ncontrols and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”).\nBased on the foregoing, our Certifying Officers concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of\nthe period covered by this Annual Report.\nDisclosure controls and procedures are controls and other procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed\nin our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods\nspecified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed\nto ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is accumulated and\ncommunicated to management, including our Certifying Officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate, to allow\ntimely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nManagement’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThe financial statements were prepared by management, which is responsible for their integrity and objectivity and for establishing\nand maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting.\n112\nThe Company’s internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of\nfinancial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting\nprinciples. The Company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:\ni. pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect\nthe transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company;\nii. provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial\nstatements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of\nthe Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the\nCompany; and\niii. provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or\ndisposition of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nThere are inherent limitations in the effectiveness of any internal control, including the possibility of human error and the\ncircumvention or overriding of controls. Accordingly, even effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurances with\nrespect to financial statement preparation. Further, because of changes in conditions, the effectiveness of internal controls may vary over\ntime.\nManagement assessed the design and effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2024.\nIn making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway\nCommission (“COSO”) in Internal Control—Integrated Framework (\"2013 framework\").

(NASDAQ: AMRK)** , a leading fully integrated precious metals platform, reported results for the fiscal first quarter ended September 30, 2024.\n\n**Management Commentary**\n\n“Our first quarter results reflect the continued strength of our fully-integrated platform,” said A-Mark CEO Greg Roberts. “Despite slower market conditions marked by elevated precious metals prices and subdued demand, we delivered $0.37 per diluted share and generated $17.8 million in non-GAAP EBITDA.\n\n\"We also took significant steps this quarter to continue to position the business for long-term success. We amended our $422.5 million Trading Credit Facility, extending its maturity date to September 30, 2026, providing the company with stable, long term access to capital for the business. We also made significant progress on our A-Mark Global Logistics (AMGL) facility expansion and logistics automation initiatives. The expected completion in the coming months is anticipated to increase operational capacity and produce efficiencies and long term cost savings. We are also advancing our reach in Asia and have made substantial progress towards establishing a trading office and DTC presence in Singapore and broadening our reach into the surrounding region.\n\n“As noted in our recent press release, during October, Silver Towne Mint acquired all of the assets of Regency Mint Manufacturing, LLC, including its minting equipment and its customer list, further enhancing our minting capacity and expanding our customer base. We are pleased with our recent accomplishments and remain optimistic that our proven integrated business model will allow us to sustain profitability. We remain committed to exploring opportunities that enhance our market reach and deliver value to our shareholders over the long term.”\n\n**Three Months Ended September 30,**  \n---  \n**2024** |  **2023**  \n(in thousands, except Earnings per Share)  \n**Selected Key Financial Statement Metrics:**  \nRevenues | $ | 2,715,096 | $ | 2,484,618  \nGross profit | $ | 43,443 | $ | 49,405  \nDepreciation and amortization expense | $ | (4,709 | ) | $ | (2,792 | )  \nNet income attributable to the Company | $ | 8,984 | $ | 18,827  \n**Earnings per Share:**  \nBasic | $ | 0.39 | $ | 0.81  \nDiluted | $ | 0.37 | $ | 0.77  \n**Non-GAAP Measures(1):**  \nAdjusted net income before provision for income taxes | $ | 14,784 | $ | 26,779  \nEBITDA | $ | 17,782 | $ | 30,448  \n(1) See Reconciliation of U.S. GAAP to Non-GAAP Measures below and on pages 17-18  \nA reconciliation of net income before provision for income taxes to adjusted net income before provision for income taxes for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 follows (in thousands):  \n---  \n**Three Months Ended September 30,**  \n**2024** | **2023**  \nNet income before provision for income taxes | $ | 10,173 | $ | 23,935  \nAdjustments:  \nContingent consideration fair value adjustments | (150 | ) | —  \nAcquisition costs | 52 | 52  \nAmortization of acquired intangibles | 3,864 | 2,165  \nDepreciation expense | 845 | 627  \nAdjusted net income before provision for income taxes (non-GAAP) | $ | 14,784 | $ | 26,779  \n**Three Months Ended**  \n---  \n**September 30, 2024** |  **June 30,****2024**  \n(in thousands, except Earnings per Share)  \n**Selected Key Financial Statement Metrics:**  \nRevenues | $ | 2,715,096 | $ | 2,524,955  \nGross profit | $ | 43,443 | $ | 42,971  \nDepreciation and amortization expense | $ | (4,709 | ) | $ | (2,845 | )  \nNet income attributable to the Company | $ | 8,984 | $ | 30,940  \n**Earnings per Share:**  \nBasic | $ | 0.39 | $ | 1.35  \nDiluted | $ | 0.37 | $ | 1.29  \n**Non-GAAP Measures(1):**  \nAdjusted net income before provision for income taxes | $ | 14,784 | $ | 20,144  \nEBITDA | $ | 17,782 | $ | 38,380  \n(1) See Reconciliation of U.S. GAAP to Non-GAAP Measures below and on pages 17-18  \nA reconciliation of net income before provision for income taxes to adjusted net income before provision for income taxes for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024 follows (in thousands):  \n---  \n**Three Months Ended**  \n**September 30, 2024** |  **June 30,****2024**  \nNet income before provision for income taxes | $ | 10,173 | $ | 33,975  \nAdjustments:  \nRemeasurement gain on pre-existing equity interest | — | (16,669 | )  \nContingent consideration fair value adjustments | (150 | ) | (370 | )  \nAcquisition costs | 52 | 363  \nAmortization of acquired intangibles | 3,864 | 2,066  \nDepreciation expense | 845 | 779  \nAdjusted net income before provision for income taxes (non-GAAP) | $ | 14,784 | $ | 20,144  \n  \n**Fiscal First Quarter 2025 Financial Highlights**\n\n  * Revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased 9% to $2.72 billion from $2.48 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and increased 8% from $2.52 billion for the three months ended June 30, 2024.

For the three months ended June 30, 2024, approximately 92% of the new customers were attributable to the acquisition of a controlling interest in SGB\n  * Direct-to-Consumer active customers for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased 22% to 129,900 from 106,400 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, and increased 13% from 114,600 for the three months ended June 30, 2024. The increase in the number of active customers was primarily due to the Company acquiring a controlling interest in SGB in June 2024\n  * Direct-to-Consumer average order value for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased $527, or 22% to $2,967 from $2,440 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, and increased $77, or 3% from $2,890 for the three months ended June 30, 2024\n  * JM Bullion’s average order value for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased $41, or 2% to $2,198 from $2,239 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, and decreased $441, or 17% from $2,639 for the three months ended June 30, 2024. The decrease in the average order value is partially driven by a higher mix of silver vs. gold orders during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared with the previous periods noted\n\n\n\n**Fiscal First Quarter 2025 Financial Summary**\n\nRevenues increased 9% to $2.72 billion from $2.48 billion in the same year-ago quarter. Excluding an increase of $217.4 million of forward sales, our revenues increased $13.1 million, or 0.9%, which was due to higher average selling prices of gold and silver, partially offset by a decrease in gold and silver ounces sold.\n\nThe Direct-to-Consumer segment contributed 18% and 13% of the consolidated revenue in the fiscal first quarters of 2025 and 2024, respectively. JMB’s revenue represented 11% of the consolidated revenues for the fiscal first quarter of 2025 compared with 12% for the prior year fiscal first quarter.\n\nGross profit decreased 12% to $43.4 million (1.60% of revenue) from $49.4 million (1.99% of revenue) in the same year-ago quarter. The decrease in gross profit was due to lower gross profits earned from the Wholesale Sales & Ancillary Services segment, partially offset by an increase in gross profits earned by the Direct-to-Consumer segment. The Direct-to-Consumer segment contributed 54% and 43% of the consolidated gross profit in the fiscal first quarters of 2025 and 2024, respectively. Gross profit contributed by JMB represented 37% of the consolidated gross profit in the fiscal first quarter of 2025 and 36% of the consolidated gross profit for the prior year fiscal first quarter.\n\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased 22% to $26.6 million from $21.8 million in the same year-ago quarter. The change was primarily due to an increase in compensation expense (including performance-based accruals) of $2.6 million, higher advertising costs of $0.7 million, an increase in consulting and professional fees of $0.2 million, an increase in information technology costs of $0.2 million, and an increase in insurance costs of $0.2 million. SG&A expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 include $5.3 million of expenses incurred by LPM and SGB, our recently consolidated subsidiaries which were not included in our prior year Q1 results.\n\nDepreciation and amortization expense increased 69% to $4.7 million from $2.8 million in the same year-ago quarter. The change was primarily due to an increase in amortization expense of $2.2 million relating to intangible assets acquired through our acquisition of LPM and acquisition of a controlling interest in SGB, partially offset by a decrease in JMB intangible asset amortization of $0.5 million.\n\nInterest income increased 16% to $7.1 million from $6.1 million in the same year-ago quarter. The increase in interest income was primarily due to an increase in other finance product income of $0.6 million and an increase in interest income earned by our Secured Lending segment of $0.3 million.\n\nInterest expense increased 2% to $10.0 million from $9.8 million in the same year-ago quarter. The increase in interest expense was primarily due to an increase of $0.7 million associated with our Trading Credit Facility due to increased borrowings as well as an increase in interest rates and an increase of $0.7 million related to product financing arrangements, partially offset by a decrease of $1.4 million related to the AMCF Notes (including amortization of debt issuance costs) due to their repayment in December 2023.\n\nEarnings from equity method investments decreased 79% to $0.6 million from $2.7 million in the same year-ago quarter. The decrease was due to decreased earnings of our equity method investees.\n\nNet income attributable to the Company totaled $9.0 million or $0.37 per diluted share, compared to net income of $18.8 million or $0.77 per diluted share in the same year-ago quarter.\n\nAdjusted net income before provision for income taxes for the three months ended September 30, 2024 totaled $14.8 million, a decrease of $12.0 million or 45% compared to $26.8 million in the same year-ago quarter. The decrease was principally due to lower net income before provision for income taxes.\n\nEBITDA for the three months ended September 30, 2024 totaled $17.8 million, a decrease of $12.6 million or 41% compared to $30.4 million in the same year-ago quarter. The net decrease was principally due to lower net income of $10.6 million.\n\n**Quarterly Cash Dividend Policy**\n\nA-Mark’s Board of Directors has re-affirmed its previously announced regular quarterly cash dividend policy of $0.20 per common share ($0.80 per share on an annual basis). The Company paid a $0.20 quarterly cash dividend on October 22, 2024 to stockholders of record as of October 8, 2024. It is expected that the next quarterly dividend will be paid in January 2025. The declaration of regular cash dividends in the future is subject to the determination each quarter by the Board of Directors, based on a number of factors, including the Company’s financial performance, available cash resources, cash requirements, alternative uses of cash and applicable bank covenants.\n\n**Conference Call**\n\nA-Mark will hold a conference call today (November 6, 2024) to discuss these financial results.

This includes press releases and other information about financial performance, reports filed or furnished with the SEC, information on corporate governance, and investor presentations.\n\n**Important Cautions Regarding Forward-Looking Statements** Statements in this press release that relate to future plans, objectives, expectations, performance, events and the like are \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These include statements regarding expectations with respect to future profitability and growth, international expansion, operational enhancements, and the amount or timing of any future dividends. Future events, risks and uncertainties, individually or in the aggregate, could cause actual results or circumstances to differ materially from those expressed or implied in these statements. Factors that could cause actual results to differ include the following: the failure to execute the Company’s growth strategy, including the inability to identify suitable or available acquisition or investment opportunities; greater than anticipated costs incurred to execute this strategy; government regulations that might impede growth, particularly in Asia; the inability to successfully integrate recently acquired businesses; changes in the current international political climate, which historically has favorably contributed to demand and volatility in the precious metals markets but also has posed certain risks and uncertainties for the Company, particularly in recent periods; potential adverse effects of the current problems in the national and global supply chains; increased competition for the Company’s higher margin services, which could depress pricing; the failure of the Company’s business model to respond to changes in the market environment as anticipated; changes in consumer demand and preferences for precious metal products generally; potential negative effects that inflationary pressure may have on our business; the inability of the Company to expand capacity at Silver Towne Mint; the failure of our investee companies to maintain, or address the preferences of, their customer bases; general risks of doing business in the commodity markets; and the strategic, business, economic, financial, political and governmental risks and other Risk Factors described in in the Company’s public filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nThe Company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements.\n\n**Use and Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures** In addition to presenting the Company’s financial results determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, management believes the following non-GAAP measures are useful in evaluating the Company’s operating performance: “adjusted net income before provision for income taxes” and “earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization” (“EBITDA”). Management believes the “adjusted net income before provision for income taxes” non-GAAP financial performance measure assists investors and analysts by facilitating comparison of period-to-period operational performance on a consistent basis by excluding items that management does not believe are indicative of the Company’s core operating performance. The items excluded from this financial measure may have a material impact on the Company’s financial results. Certain of those items are non-recurring, while others are non-cash in nature. Management believes the EBITDA non-GAAP liquidity measure assists investors and analysts by facilitating comparison of our business operations before investing activities, interest, and income taxes with other publicly traded companies. Non-GAAP measures do not have standardized definitions and should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for or superior to, the comparable measures prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and should be read in conjunction with the financial statements included in the Company’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q to be filed with the SEC. Management encourages investors and others to review the Company’s financial information in its entirety and not to rely on any single financial or liquidity measure.\n\nIn the Company’s reconciliation from its reported U.S. GAAP “net income before provision for income taxes” to its non-GAAP “adjusted net income before provision for income taxes”, the Company eliminates the impact of the following five amounts: acquisition expenses; amortization expenses related to intangible assets acquired; depreciation expense; remeasurement gains or losses; and contingent consideration fair value adjustments. The Company’s reconciliations from its reported U.S. GAAP “net income before provision for income taxes” to its non-GAAP “adjusted net income before provision for income taxes”, and “net income” and “net cash provided by (used in) operating activities” to its non-GAAP “EBITDA” are provided below and are also included in the Company’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q to be filed with the SEC for the quarterly period ended September 30, 2024.\n\n**Company Contact:** Steve Reiner, Executive Vice President, Capital Markets & Investor RelationsA-Mark Precious Metals, Inc.1-310-587-1410[sreiner@amark.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=g1JxuSH_6s3uKX4NXmZWswu8l2EUR3BN3JC3zl1tiUspCeMKm7GcY0ek6t4NNx9b5duJ_MTHKsbaraMn3Zd_D1pDbzmfSi8Y8wXnVY2G3mY=)\n\n**Investor Relations Contact:** Matt Glover or Greg BradburyGateway Group, Inc.1-949-574-3860[AMRK@gateway-grp.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=jJG35zzZQ0_2VPN4mqOiDOpBb4MViY6dVeJGakn1lEd6-u7YMlRSkbdAWtJRKCSfPq0lMNUAApfhJoLTzx5PSnozaIQhePKy25n9Oox4gLE=)\n\n**A-MARK PRECIOUS METALS, INC.

(NASDAQ: AMRK)** , a leading fully integrated precious metals platform, reported results for the fiscal first quarter ended September 30, 2024.\n\n**Management Commentary**\n\n“Our first quarter results reflect the continued strength of our fully-integrated platform,” said A-Mark CEO Greg Roberts. “Despite slower market conditions marked by elevated precious metals prices and subdued demand, we delivered $0.37 per diluted share and generated $17.8 million in non-GAAP EBITDA.\n\n\"We also took significant steps this quarter to continue to position the business for long-term success. We amended our $422.5 million Trading Credit Facility, extending its maturity date to September 30, 2026, providing the company with stable, long term access to capital for the business. We also made significant progress on our A-Mark Global Logistics (AMGL) facility expansion and logistics automation initiatives. The expected completion in the coming months is anticipated to increase operational capacity and produce efficiencies and long term cost savings.

For the three months ended June 30, 2024, approximately 92% of the new customers were attributable to the acquisition of a controlling interest in SGB\n  * Direct-to-Consumer active customers for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased 22% to 129,900 from 106,400 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, and increased 13% from 114,600 for the three months ended June 30, 2024. The increase in the number of active customers was primarily due to the Company acquiring a controlling interest in SGB in June 2024\n  * Direct-to-Consumer average order value for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased $527, or 22% to $2,967 from $2,440 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, and increased $77, or 3% from $2,890 for the three months ended June 30, 2024\n  * JM Bullion’s average order value for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased $41, or 2% to $2,198 from $2,239 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, and decreased $441, or 17% from $2,639 for the three months ended June 30, 2024. The decrease in the average order value is partially driven by a higher mix of silver vs. gold orders during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared with the previous periods noted\n\n\n\n**Fiscal First Quarter 2025 Financial Summary**\n\nRevenues increased 9% to $2.72 billion from $2.48 billion in the same year-ago quarter. Excluding an increase of $217.4 million of forward sales, our revenues increased $13.1 million, or 0.9%, which was due to higher average selling prices of gold and silver, partially offset by a decrease in gold and silver ounces sold.\n\nThe Direct-to-Consumer segment contributed 18% and 13% of the consolidated revenue in the fiscal first quarters of 2025 and 2024, respectively. JMB’s revenue represented 11% of the consolidated revenues for the fiscal first quarter of 2025 compared with 12% for the prior year fiscal first quarter.\n\nGross profit decreased 12% to $43.4 million (1.60% of revenue) from $49.4 million (1.99% of revenue) in the same year-ago quarter. The decrease in gross profit was due to lower gross profits earned from the Wholesale Sales & Ancillary Services segment, partially offset by an increase in gross profits earned by the Direct-to-Consumer segment. The Direct-to-Consumer segment contributed 54% and 43% of the consolidated gross profit in the fiscal first quarters of 2025 and 2024, respectively. Gross profit contributed by JMB represented 37% of the consolidated gross profit in the fiscal first quarter of 2025 and 36% of the consolidated gross profit for the prior year fiscal first quarter.\n\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased 22% to $26.6 million from $21.8 million in the same year-ago quarter. The change was primarily due to an increase in compensation expense (including performance-based accruals) of $2.6 million, higher advertising costs of $0.7 million, an increase in consulting and professional fees of $0.2 million, an increase in information technology costs of $0.2 million, and an increase in insurance costs of $0.2 million. SG&A expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 include $5.3 million of expenses incurred by LPM and SGB, our recently consolidated subsidiaries which were not included in our prior year Q1 results.\n\nDepreciation and amortization expense increased 69% to $4.7 million from $2.8 million in the same year-ago quarter. The change was primarily due to an increase in amortization expense of $2.2 million relating to intangible assets acquired through our acquisition of LPM and acquisition of a controlling interest in SGB, partially offset by a decrease in JMB intangible asset amortization of $0.5 million.\n\nInterest income increased 16% to $7.1 million from $6.1 million in the same year-ago quarter. The increase in interest income was primarily due to an increase in other finance product income of $0.6 million and an increase in interest income earned by our Secured Lending segment of $0.3 million.\n\nInterest expense increased 2% to $10.0 million from $9.8 million in the same year-ago quarter. The increase in interest expense was primarily due to an increase of $0.7 million associated with our Trading Credit Facility due to increased borrowings as well as an increase in interest rates and an increase of $0.7 million related to product financing arrangements, partially offset by a decrease of $1.4 million related to the AMCF Notes (including amortization of debt issuance costs) due to their repayment in December 2023.\n\nEarnings from equity method investments decreased 79% to $0.6 million from $2.7 million in the same year-ago quarter. The decrease was due to decreased earnings of our equity method investees.\n\nNet income attributable to the Company totaled $9.0 million or $0.37 per diluted share, compared to net income of $18.8 million or $0.77 per diluted share in the same year-ago quarter.\n\nAdjusted net income before provision for income taxes for the three months ended September 30, 2024 totaled $14.8 million, a decrease of $12.0 million or 45% compared to $26.8 million in the same year-ago quarter. The decrease was principally due to lower net income before provision for income taxes.\n\nEBITDA for the three months ended September 30, 2024 totaled $17.8 million, a decrease of $12.6 million or 41% compared to $30.4 million in the same year-ago quarter. The net decrease was principally due to lower net income of $10.6 million.\n\n**Quarterly Cash Dividend Policy**\n\nA-Mark’s Board of Directors has re-affirmed its previously announced regular quarterly cash dividend policy of $0.20 per common share ($0.80 per share on an annual basis). The Company paid a $0.20 quarterly cash dividend on October 22, 2024 to stockholders of record as of October 8, 2024. It is expected that the next quarterly dividend will be paid in January 2025. The declaration of regular cash dividends in the future is subject to the determination each quarter by the Board of Directors, based on a number of factors, including the Company’s financial performance, available cash resources, cash requirements, alternative uses of cash and applicable bank covenants.\n\n**Conference Call**\n\nA-Mark will hold a conference call today (November 6, 2024) to discuss these financial results.

This includes press releases and other information about financial performance, reports filed or furnished with the SEC, information on corporate governance, and investor presentations.\n\n**Important Cautions Regarding Forward-Looking Statements** Statements in this press release that relate to future plans, objectives, expectations, performance, events and the like are \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These include statements regarding expectations with respect to future profitability and growth, international expansion, operational enhancements, and the amount or timing of any future dividends. Future events, risks and uncertainties, individually or in the aggregate, could cause actual results or circumstances to differ materially from those expressed or implied in these statements. Factors that could cause actual results to differ include the following: the failure to execute the Company’s growth strategy, including the inability to identify suitable or available acquisition or investment opportunities; greater than anticipated costs incurred to execute this strategy; government regulations that might impede growth, particularly in Asia; the inability to successfully integrate recently acquired businesses; changes in the current international political climate, which historically has favorably contributed to demand and volatility in the precious metals markets but also has posed certain risks and uncertainties for the Company, particularly in recent periods; potential adverse effects of the current problems in the national and global supply chains; increased competition for the Company’s higher margin services, which could depress pricing; the failure of the Company’s business model to respond to changes in the market environment as anticipated; changes in consumer demand and preferences for precious metal products generally; potential negative effects that inflationary pressure may have on our business; the inability of the Company to expand capacity at Silver Towne Mint; the failure of our investee companies to maintain, or address the preferences of, their customer bases; general risks of doing business in the commodity markets; and the strategic, business, economic, financial, political and governmental risks and other Risk Factors described in in the Company’s public filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nThe Company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements.\n\n**Use and Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures** In addition to presenting the Company’s financial results determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, management believes the following non-GAAP measures are useful in evaluating the Company’s operating performance: “adjusted net income before provision for income taxes” and “earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization” (“EBITDA”). Management believes the “adjusted net income before provision for income taxes” non-GAAP financial performance measure assists investors and analysts by facilitating comparison of period-to-period operational performance on a consistent basis by excluding items that management does not believe are indicative of the Company’s core operating performance. The items excluded from this financial measure may have a material impact on the Company’s financial results. Certain of those items are non-recurring, while others are non-cash in nature. Management believes the EBITDA non-GAAP liquidity measure assists investors and analysts by facilitating comparison of our business operations before investing activities, interest, and income taxes with other publicly traded companies. Non-GAAP measures do not have standardized definitions and should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for or superior to, the comparable measures prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and should be read in conjunction with the financial statements included in the Company’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q to be filed with the SEC. Management encourages investors and others to review the Company’s financial information in its entirety and not to rely on any single financial or liquidity measure.\n\nIn the Company’s reconciliation from its reported U.S. GAAP “net income before provision for income taxes” to its non-GAAP “adjusted net income before provision for income taxes”, the Company eliminates the impact of the following five amounts: acquisition expenses; amortization expenses related to intangible assets acquired; depreciation expense; remeasurement gains or losses; and contingent consideration fair value adjustments. The Company’s reconciliations from its reported U.S. GAAP “net income before provision for income taxes” to its non-GAAP “adjusted net income before provision for income taxes”, and “net income” and “net cash provided by (used in) operating activities” to its non-GAAP “EBITDA” are provided below and are also included in the Company’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q to be filed with the SEC for the quarterly period ended September 30, 2024.\n\n**Company Contact:** Steve Reiner, Executive Vice President, Capital Markets & Investor RelationsA-Mark Precious Metals, Inc.1-310-587-1410[sreiner@amark.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=g1JxuSH_6s3uKX4NXmZWswu8l2EUR3BN3JC3zl1tiUspCeMKm7GcY0ek6t4NNx9b5duJ_MTHKsbaraMn3Zd_D1pDbzmfSi8Y8wXnVY2G3mY=)\n\n**Investor Relations Contact:** Matt Glover or Greg BradburyGateway Group, Inc.1-949-574-3860[AMRK@gateway-grp.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=jJG35zzZQ0_2VPN4mqOiDOpBb4MViY6dVeJGakn1lEd6-u7YMlRSkbdAWtJRKCSfPq0lMNUAApfhJoLTzx5PSnozaIQhePKy25n9Oox4gLE=)\n\n**A-MARK PRECIOUS METALS, INC.

Regency Mint, a 25-year old family-owned and operated business located in Orem, Utah, is an ISO 9001:2015 certified mint that sells primarily to distributors and retailers of precious metals.\n\nWith the acquisition, Silver Towne Mint acquired all of Regency Mint’s minting equipment, which is expected to be moved shortly to the Silver Towne Mint’s facility in Winchester, Indiana, as well as its entire customer list. Among the immediate benefits of the acquisition to Silver Towne Mint include additional capacity for proof-quality coins and rounds and breakable rounds, along with new extrusion equipment that will enable faster and more efficient production of fractional products.\n\nThe equipment from Regency Mint is expected to eventually increase Silver Towne Mint’s capacity of struck products from 30 million to more than 50 million ounces per year. Combined with large-format bars, the total minting capacity in the long term should exceed 100 million ounces per year. Some of the acquired equipment will be placed in storage until more facility space is created to fully utilize the new machinery.\n\n“This acquisition marks another significant step forward, enhancing our minting capacity and expanding our customer base,” said A-Mark CEO Greg Roberts. “Regency Mint’s state-of-the-art equipment will not only improve our production processes but also substantially increase our output capabilities. We’re excited to welcome Regency Mint’s customers and serve them through our newly enhanced operations, offering an even broader range of services and products.”\n\nRegency Mint CEO Josh Tanner added: “After 25 years of producing bullion and custom rounds as a family-owned and operated business, we are confident in our decision to entrust our long-standing relationships with over 2,000 customers into the care of A-Mark and Silver Towne Mint, who we believe demonstrate Regency Mint’s same core values of integrity, exceptional customer service and product excellence. Our customers should benefit greatly from the expanded services and products available through A-Mark’s vertically integrated business.”\n\n**About A-Mark Precious Metals** Founded in 1965, A-Mark Precious Metals, Inc. is a leading fully integrated precious metals platform that offers an array of gold, silver, platinum, palladium, and copper bullion, numismatic coins, and related products to wholesale and retail customers via a portfolio of channels.
