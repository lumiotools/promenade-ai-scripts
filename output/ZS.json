ThreatLabz found that the Zscaler cloud blocked 45% more IoT malware transactions than last year–indicating botnets continue to proliferate across IoT devices.\n\n\n\n**Change in Non-GAAP Measures Presentation**\n\nEffective August 1, 2024, the beginning of our fiscal year ending July 31, 2025, we are using a long-term projected non-GAAP tax rate of 23% for the purpose of determining our non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per share to provide better consistency across interim reporting periods in fiscal 2025 and beyond. Given the significant growth of our business and non-GAAP operating income, we believe this change is necessary to better reflect the performance of our business. We will continue to assess the appropriate non-GAAP tax rate on a regular basis, which could be subject to changes for a variety of reasons, including the rapidly evolving global tax environment, significant changes in our geographic earnings mix, or other changes to our strategy or business operations. Prior period amounts have been recast to reflect this change.\n\n**Financial Outlook**\n\nFor the second quarter of fiscal 2025, we expect:\n\n  * Revenue of $633 million to $635 million\n  * Non-GAAP income from operations of $126 million to $128 million\n  * Non-GAAP net income per share of approximately $0.68 to $0.69, assuming approximately 163 million fully diluted shares outstanding and a non-GAAP tax rate of 23%\n\n\n\nFor the full year of fiscal 2025, we expect:\n\n  * Revenue of approximately $2.623 billion to $2.643 billion\n  * Calculated billings of $3.124 billion to $3.149 billion\n  * Non-GAAP income from operations of $549 million to $559 million\n  * Non-GAAP net income per share of $2.94 to $2.99, assuming approximately 164 million fully diluted shares outstanding and a non-GAAP tax rate of 23%\n\n\n\nThese statements are forward-looking and actual results may differ materially. Refer to the Forward-Looking Statements safe harbor below for information on the factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements.\n\nGuidance for non-GAAP income from operations excludes stock-based compensation expense and related employer payroll taxes, amortization of debt issuance costs, and amortization expense of acquired intangible assets. We have not reconciled our expectations of non-GAAP income from operations and non-GAAP net income per share to their most directly comparable GAAP measures because certain items are out of our control or cannot be reasonably predicted. For those reasons, we are also unable to address the probable significance of the unavailable information, the variability of which may have a significant impact on future results. Accordingly, a reconciliation for the guidance for non-GAAP income from operations and non-GAAP net income per share is not available without unreasonable effort.\n\nFor further information regarding why we believe that these non-GAAP measures provide useful information to investors, the specific manner in which management uses these measures, and some of the limitations associated with the use of these measures, please refer to the \"Explanation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" section of this press release.\n\n**Conference Call and Webcast Information**\n\nZscaler will host a conference call for analysts and investors to discuss its first quarter of fiscal 2025 and outlook for its second quarter of fiscal 2025 and full year fiscal 2025 today at 1:30 p.m. Pacific time (4:30 p.m. Eastern time).\n\n**Date:**|  Monday, December 2, 2024  \n---|---  \n**Time:**|  1:30 p.m. PT  \n**Webcast:**| <https://ir.zscaler.com>  \n**Dial-in:**|  To join by phone, register at the following link: (https://register.vevent.com/register/BIe2c2c82d1e694dd3a00b3debc6f30548).

of determining our non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per share to provide better consistency across interim reporting periods in fiscal 2025 and beyond. Given the significant growth of our business and non-GAAP operating income, we believe this change is necessary to better reflect the performance of our business. We will continue to assess the appropriate non-GAAP tax rate on a regular basis, which could be subject to changes for a variety of reasons, including the rapidly evolving global tax environment, significant changes in our geographic earnings mix, or other changes to our strategy or business operations. Prior period amounts have been recast to reflect this change.\n\n(2) Adjustment related to the difference between the GAAP provision for income taxes and Non-GAAP provision for income taxes.\n\n(3) The sum of the fully diluted earnings per share impact of individual reconciling items may not total to fully diluted non-GAAP net income per share due to the weighted-average shares used in computing the GAAP net loss per share differs from the weighted-average shares used in computing the non-GAAP net income per share, and due to rounding of the individual reconciling items. The GAAP net loss per share calculation uses a lower share count as it excludes potentially dilutive shares, which are included in calculating the non-GAAP net income per share.\n\n(4) We exclude the in-the-money portion of the convertible senior notes for non-GAAP weighted-average diluted shares as they are covered by our capped call transactions. Our outstanding capped call transactions are antidilutive under GAAP but are expected to mitigate the dilutive effect of the convertible senior notes, and therefore are included in the calculation of non-GAAP diluted shares outstanding. The capped calls have an antidilutive impact when the average stock price of our common stock in a given period is higher than their exercise price.\n\n**ZSCALER, INC.**  \n---  \n**Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures**  \n _(in thousands, except percentages)_  \n_(unaudited)_  \n**Three Months Ended**  \n**October 31,**  \n**2024**| **2023**  \nCalculated Billings  \nRevenue| $| 627,955| $| 496,703  \nAdd: Total deferred revenue, end of period| 1,783,720| 1,399,544  \nLess: Total deferred revenue, beginning of period| (1,894,974| )| (1,439,676| )  \nCalculated billings| $| 516,701| $| 456,571  \nFree Cash Flow  \nNet cash provided by operating activities| $| 331,335| $| 260,806  \nLess: Purchases of property, equipment and other assets| (17,025| )| (28,659| )  \nLess: Capitalized internal-use software| (22,429| )| (7,429| )  \nFree cash flow| $| 291,881| $| 224,718  \nFree Cash Flow Margin  \nNet cash provided by operating activities, as a percentage of revenue| 53| %| 53| %  \nLess: Purchases of property, equipment and other assets, as a percentage of revenue| (3| )%| (6| )%  \nLess: Capitalized internal-use software, as a percentage of revenue| (4| )%| (2| )%  \nFree cash flow margin| 46| %| 45| %  \n  \n**ZSCALER, INC.****Explanation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures**\n\nIn addition to our results determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (\"GAAP\"), we believe the following non-GAAP measures are useful in evaluating our operating performance. We use the following non-GAAP financial information to evaluate our ongoing operations and for internal planning and forecasting purposes. We believe that non-GAAP financial information, when taken collectively, may be helpful to investors because it provides consistency and comparability with past financial performance. However, non-GAAP financial information is presented for supplemental informational purposes only, as it has limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial information presented in accordance with GAAP. In particular, free cash flow is not a substitute for cash provided by operating activities. Additionally, the utility of free cash flow as a measure of our liquidity is further limited as it does not represent the total increase or decrease in our cash balance for a given period. In addition, other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate similarly titled non-GAAP measures differently or may use other measures to evaluate their performance, all of which could reduce the usefulness of our non-GAAP financial measures as tools for comparison. A reconciliation of our historical non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable financial measures stated in accordance with GAAP has been included in this press release. Investors are cautioned that there are a number of limitations associated with the use of non-GAAP financial measures and key metrics as analytical tools. Investors are encouraged to review these reconciliations, and not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business.\n\n**Expenses Excluded from Non-GAAP Measures**\n\nStock-based compensation expense is excluded primarily because it is a non-cash expense that management believes is not reflective of our ongoing operational performance. Employer payroll taxes related to stock-based compensation, which is a cash expense, are excluded because these are tied to the timing and size of the exercise or vesting of the underlying equity incentive awards and the price of our common stock at the time of vesting or exercise, which may vary from period to period independent of the operating performance of our business. Amortization expense of acquired intangible assets and amortization of debt issuance costs from the convertible senior notes are excluded because these are non-cash expenses and are not reflective of our ongoing operational performance.\n\nEffective August 1, 2024, the beginning of our fiscal year ending July 31, 2025, we are using a long-term projected non-GAAP tax rate of 23% for the purpose of determining our non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per share to provide better consistency across interim reporting periods. Given the significant growth of our business and non-GAAP operating income, we believe this change is necessary to better reflect the performance of our business. We will continue to assess the appropriate non-GAAP tax rate on a regular basis, which could be subject to changes for a variety of reasons, including the rapidly evolving global tax environment, significant changes in our geographic earnings mix, or other changes to our strategy or business operations. Prior period amounts have been recast to reflect this change.\n\n**Non-GAAP Financial Measures**\n\n**_Non-GAAP Gross Profit and Non-GAAP Gross Margin_**. We define non-GAAP gross profit as GAAP gross profit excluding stock-based compensation expense and related employer payroll taxes and amortization expense of acquired intangible assets. We define non-GAAP gross margin as non-GAAP gross profit as a percentage of revenue.\n\n**_Non-GAAP Income from Operations and Non-GAAP Operating Margin_**. We define non-GAAP income from operations as GAAP loss from operations excluding stock-based compensation expense and related employer payroll taxes and amortization expense of acquired intangible assets. We define non-GAAP operating margin as non-GAAP income from operations as a percentage of revenue.\n\n**_Non-GAAP Net Income per Share, Diluted_**. We define non-GAAP net income as GAAP net loss excluding stock-based compensation expense and related employer payroll taxes, amortization expense of acquired intangible assets, amortization of debt issuance costs, and the non-GAAP provision for income taxes adjustment. We define non-GAAP net income per share, diluted, as non-GAAP net income plus the non-GAAP interest expense related to the convertible senior notes divided by the weighted-average diluted shares outstanding, which includes the effect of potentially diluted common stock equivalents outstanding during the period and the anti-dilutive impact of the capped call transactions entered into in connection with the convertible senior notes.\n\n**_Calculated Billings_**. We define calculated billings as revenue plus the change in deferred revenue in a period. Calculated billings in any particular period aims to reflect amounts invoiced for subscriptions to access our cloud platform, together with related support services for our new and existing customers. We typically invoice our customers annually in advance, and to a lesser extent quarterly in advance, monthly in advance or multi-year in advance.\n\n**_Free Cash Flow and Free Cash Flow Margin_**. We define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property, equipment and other assets and capitalized internal-use software. We define free cash flow margin as free cash flow divided by revenue. We believe that free cash flow and free cash flow margin are useful indicators of liquidity that provide information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated from our operations that, after the investments in property, equipment and other assets and capitalized internal-use software, can be used for strategic initiatives.\n\n![](https://ml.globenewswire.com/media/Y2Y2YzBkNjQtYmY4MC00OTExLWJiM2YtYzVkZDhlMDRhYjQzLTExMDUzNTI=/tiny/Zscaler-Inc-.png)\n\n![Zscaler, Inc.

Although firewalls are used to do segmentation on networks, they add complexity, increase costs, and fail to provide adequate security. Zero Trust Segmentation for branch and cloud is an innovative solution that prevents ransomware attacks, turns branches into simplified café-like environments and in the process eliminates the need for firewalls, network access control (NAC), SD-WAN and site-to-site VPNs.\n\nWith a Zero Trust architecture, organizations are no longer required to extend the corporate network from the data center to distributed locations and public clouds. Each branch, factory and public cloud becomes a virtual island that communicates directly with the Zscaler cloud security platform over any broadband connection. The Zscaler Zero Trust Exchange™ platform then applies business policies to securely connect users, workloads and devices. As a result, Zscaler minimizes the attack surface associated with public IPs, prevents ransomware from spreading between locations, and eliminates firewalls, SD-WAN and the reliance on Direct Connect and ExpressRoute.\n\n“Traditional network and security architectures enable the spread of ransomware,\" said Dhawal Sharma, EVP of Product Management at Zscaler. \"Using firewalls to segment business networks is extremely complex, turning into a never-ending initiative for many organizations. Integrating advanced technology from the recent AirGap acquisition, Zscaler Zero Trust Segmentation now offers the most advanced, robust protection against ransomware attacks, which can be implemented in days. Additionally, it delivers up to 50% cost savings by eliminating the need for legacy firewalls and complex infrastructures.”\n\n**Zero Trust Segmentation for Branches and Factories** With the increasing prevalence of IoT devices and operational technology (OT) systems in today's branch offices and factories, security leaders are urgently working to protect their environments from sophisticated attacks. A recent Zscaler ThreatLabz report revealed that over 50% of OT devices rely on legacy, end-of-life operating systems with known vulnerabilities, leaving them highly susceptible to attacks. Zscaler's solution securely segments every device—including legacy OT— within hours, without north-south firewalls.\n\n“As OT devices are becoming increasingly common in our environment, ensuring their security is a top priority,” said Brian Morris, Vice President, Chief Information Security Officer, Gray Television. “Zscaler Zero Trust Branch has been nothing short of transformative. It has not only helped us reduce network costs, but has significantly reduced cyber risk and helped accelerate M&A integration.”\n\n**Zero Trust Segmentation for Data Center and Public Clouds** Relying on firewalls to secure workload communications in hybrid and multi-cloud environments increases business risk and complexity. Each internet-facing firewall presents a discoverable attack surface and can lead to inconsistent cyber threat and data protection, as each public cloud service provider operates differently. Zscaler Zero Trust Segmentation standardizes multi-cloud workload security for internet-bound traffic, communication between clouds and data centers, between Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs), and between workloads and processes. This scalable approach eliminates the need for firewalls, site-to-site VPNs, Direct Connect, or ExpressRoute, simplifying and strengthening security across diverse cloud environments.\n\n“Cloud is a critical component of our infrastructure, and we depend on Zscaler’s Zero Trust architecture to secure our cloud workloads,” said Shanker Ramrakhiani, CISO at IIFL. “Zscaler’s Zero Trust Cloud has empowered us to enforce consistent security across our data centers and multiple clouds, simplifying operations and significantly reducing the risk of lateral threat movement.”\n\nZero Trust Segmentation currently supports AWS and Azure, with GCP support slated for February 2025.\n\nTo learn more about Zero Trust Segmentation, please visit [_http://zscaler.com/ztsegmentation_](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=0qGCLzbjZzkyTkeeF1ebtC_UishdzBu8-gpNogl1yG6dh3KWaxmnxGq5qJtOd6unpYnA8Jv_vKkOM9gXk9DW5ANUZ457PoTWrl2MDP2Wk_XLeATiEjOZoQYDgT1tG7no).\n\n**About Zscaler** Zscaler (NASDAQ: ZS) accelerates digital transformation so customers can be more agile, efficient, resilient, and secure.

By delivering end-to-end, context-aware security, Okta and Zscaler are helping customers reduce risk, improve the user experience, and enable cross-domain response through shared telemetry and threat intelligence.\n\n“The integrations announced today significantly deepen our collaboration with Okta and our commitment to keeping our customers secure,” said Amit Raikar, Vice President, Technology Alliances and Business Development, Zscaler. “Together, we are focused on helping customers strengthen their zero trust security posture in an increasingly complex risk environment, where rigorously managing user identities and enforcing adaptive access controls is more crucial than ever.”\n\n“In the AI era, the only way to effectively protect customers is by rallying the security ecosystem. Point security solutions address individual areas but don’t integrate with one another, which increases complexity,” said Stephen Lee, vice president of Technical Strategy and Partnerships at Okta. “That’s why Okta and Zscaler have invested in deep integrations that accelerate the zero trust journey and elevate the security posture of our mutual customers worldwide.”\n\nOrganizations continue to navigate the complexities of securing the growing number of remote users, cloud applications, and hybrid IT environments. Both Zscaler and Okta are committed to delivering deep integrations that enhance secure access to cloud and web applications while minimizing user disruptions. Our newest integrations deliver:\n\n  1. **Adaptive Access Policy Enforcement** : The Zscaler Adaptive Access and Okta integration allows organizations to enforce context-based access policies that dynamically adjust based on the changing risk context of the user. These include password expiration, credential compromise, account recovery, or high-risk user behavior. Zscaler’s ingestion of Okta’s user risk telemetry expands upon an earlier integration, where [_Identity Threat Protection with Okta AI_](https://www.okta.com/products/identity-threat-protection/) ingests risk telemetry from Zscaler Deception to respond to credential compromise or insider attacks. With the new integration, risk telemetry is exchanged bidirectionally between Okta and Zscaler, enhancing threat detection and response. \n  2. **Dynamic Step-Up Authentication****:** The Zscaler Adaptive Access can trigger step-up authentication with [_Okta Workforce Identity Cloud_](https://www.okta.com/workforce-identity/) (WIC) to add an extra layer of security when Zscaler detects higher-than-usual risky user behavior. In such scenarios, step-up authentication dynamically requires the user to comply with stronger forms of authentication before access to sensitive resources, such as Salesforce, is granted. \n  3. **Security Data Contextualization and Unified Vulnerability Management:** Zscaler's Data Fabric for Security enriches and aggregates data from Okta logs with concurrent data streams to provide contextualized, real-time insights into vulnerabilities and exposures across the enterprise ecosystem. Easy to set up and configure, this solution provides a dynamic risk assessment of an organization via a simple dashboard to accelerate security remediation.\n  4. **Zero Trust Partner Access:** Zscaler’s Zero Trust Exchange cloud security platform, with natively integrated cloud browser isolation (CBI), enables secure, agentless access to web applications. It allows external third-party users and partners to instantly access corporate resources from their devices, while protecting enterprise applications and preventing data loss. Okta complements this by streamlining identity and access management (IAM) for IT administrators with Okta Universal Directory. This enables them to manage users and policies, automate app assignments, and onboard more securely and quickly.\n\n\n\nFor more information about this integration, please get a copy of the [_solution brief_](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=TKbd7GaHUJSGkivy6raSawNe-as4RBhjnkiIh4RCT9xmDtAN-N0watlAk73MP2kSXSiJ7IuSVGH0qZ7d8FU21b0BrLEZqQ877naiOn-fchu947l1ep5xXfC9EDRu-ZUBDDdJIJHJlBjMVBMEtSOI8Q==).\n\n**About Zscaler** Zscaler (NASDAQ: ZS) accelerates digital transformation so customers can be more agile, efficient, resilient, and secure.

(Nasdaq: ZS), the leader in cloud security, today announced financial results for its first quarter of fiscal year 2025**,** ended October 31, 2024.\n\n“Growing customer engagements and strong sales execution drove a solid Q1 with all metrics exceeding our guidance. The combination of Zero Trust and AI is creating exciting new opportunities, which we are well positioned to capture with our large and expanding platform,” said Jay Chaudhry, Chairman and CEO of Zscaler. “With our customer obsession, the world’s largest cybersecurity cloud, and an upleveled go-to-market machine, we are driving strong growth.”\n\n**First****Quarter Fiscal****2025****Financial Highlights**\n\n  * **Revenue:** $628.0 million, an increase of 26% year-over-year.\n  * **Income (loss) from operations:** GAAP loss from operations was $30.7 million, or 5% of revenue, compared to $46.1 million, or 9% of revenue, in the first quarter of fiscal 2024. Non-GAAP income from operations was $134.1 million, or 21% of revenue, compared to $89.7 million, or 18% of revenue, in the first quarter of fiscal 2024.\n  * **Net income (loss)****:** GAAP net loss was $12.1 million, compared to $33.5 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2024. Non-GAAP net income was $124.3 million, compared to $86.4 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2024.\n  * **Net income (loss) per share, diluted:** GAAP net loss per share was $0.08, compared to $0.23 in the first quarter of fiscal 2024. Non-GAAP net income per share was $0.77, compared to $0.55 in the first quarter of fiscal 2024.\n  * **Cash flows:** Cash provided by operations was $331.3 million, or 53% of revenue, compared to $260.8 million, or 53% of revenue, in the first quarter of fiscal 2024. Free cash flow was $291.9 million, or 46% of revenue, compared to $224.7 million, or 45% of revenue, in the first quarter of fiscal 2024.\n  * **Deferred revenue:** $1,783.7 million as of October 31, 2024, an increase of 27% year-over-year.\n  * **Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments:** $2,707.9 million as of October 31, 2024, an increase of $298.2 million from July 31, 2024.\n\n\n\n**Recent B****usiness Highlights**\n\n  * Zscaler’s cloud security platform reached a new scalability milestone, surpassing half a trillion daily transactions, which is nearly 60 times greater than the total number of Google searches per day. This milestone underscores the unparalleled scalability, resilience, and trust customers have placed in the Zscaler platform, which enables organizations to secure users, applications, and devices, while simplifying operations and consolidating costs.\n  * Appointed Adam Geller as Chief Product Officer to accelerate Zscaler’s next phase of innovation and growth. Geller’s proven security product and engineering experience will be invaluable to the development of Zscaler’s AI-driven security operations platform.\n  * Announced a set of AI and Zero Trust integrations with the CrowdStrike Falcon® cybersecurity platform to advance security operations by providing advanced threat detection, response, and risk management.\n  * Announced four new integrations with Okta designed to accelerate joint customers' Zero Trust transformation by delivering end-to-end, context-aware security. Together, Okta and Zscaler are helping customers reduce risk, improve the user experience, and enable cross-domain response through shared telemetry and threat intelligence.\n  * Published the Zscaler ThreatLabz 2024 Mobile, IoT, and OT Threat Report, which provides detailed insights covering mobile and IoT/OT cyber threat landscape from June 2023 through May 2024. ThreatLabz found that the Zscaler cloud blocked 45% more IoT malware transactions than last year–indicating botnets continue to proliferate across IoT devices.\n\n\n\n**Change in Non-GAAP Measures Presentation**\n\nEffective August 1, 2024, the beginning of our fiscal year ending July 31, 2025, we are using a long-term projected non-GAAP tax rate of 23% for the purpose of determining our non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per share to provide better consistency across interim reporting periods in fiscal 2025 and beyond. Given the significant growth of our business and non-GAAP operating income, we believe this change is necessary to better reflect the performance of our business. We will continue to assess the appropriate non-GAAP tax rate on a regular basis, which could be subject to changes for a variety of reasons, including the rapidly evolving global tax environment, significant changes in our geographic earnings mix, or other changes to our strategy or business operations. Prior period amounts have been recast to reflect this change.\n\n**Financial Outlook**\n\nFor the second quarter of fiscal 2025, we expect:\n\n  * Revenue of $633 million to $635 million\n  * Non-GAAP income from operations of $126 million to $128 million\n  * Non-GAAP net income per share of approximately $0.68 to $0.69, assuming approximately 163 million fully diluted shares outstanding and a non-GAAP tax rate of 23%\n\n\n\nFor the full year of fiscal 2025, we expect:\n\n  * Revenue of approximately $2.623 billion to $2.643 billion\n  * Calculated billings of $3.124 billion to $3.149 billion\n  * Non-GAAP income from operations of $549 million to $559 million\n  * Non-GAAP net income per share of $2.94 to $2.99, assuming approximately 164 million fully diluted shares outstanding and a non-GAAP tax rate of 23%\n\n\n\nThese statements are forward-looking and actual results may differ materially. Refer to the Forward-Looking Statements safe harbor below for information on the factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements.\n\nGuidance for non-GAAP income from operations excludes stock-based compensation expense and related employer payroll taxes, amortization of debt issuance costs, and amortization expense of acquired intangible assets. We have not reconciled our expectations of non-GAAP income from operations and non-GAAP net income per share to their most directly comparable GAAP measures because certain items are out of our control or cannot be reasonably predicted. For those reasons, we are also unable to address the probable significance of the unavailable information, the variability of which may have a significant impact on future results. Accordingly, a reconciliation for the guidance for non-GAAP income from operations and non-GAAP net income per share is not available without unreasonable effort.\n\nFor further information regarding why we believe that these non-GAAP measures provide useful information to investors, the specific manner in which management uses these measures, and some of the limitations associated with the use of these measures, please refer to the \"Explanation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" section of this press release.\n\n**Conference Call and Webcast Information**\n\nZscaler will host a conference call for analysts and investors to discuss its first quarter of fiscal 2025 and outlook for its second quarter of fiscal 2025 and full year fiscal 2025 today at 1:30 p.m. Pacific time (4:30 p.m. Eastern time).\n\n**Date:**|  Monday, December 2, 2024  \n---|---  \n**Time:**|  1:30 p.m. PT  \n**Webcast:**| <https://ir.zscaler.com>  \n**Dial-in:**|  To join by phone, register at the following link: (https://register.vevent.com/register/BIe2c2c82d1e694dd3a00b3debc6f30548).

158,505  \n  \n___________________\n\n(1) Effective August 1, 2024, the beginning of our fiscal year ending July 31, 2025, we are using a long-term projected non-GAAP tax rate of 23% for the purpose of determining our non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per share to provide better consistency across interim reporting periods in fiscal 2025 and beyond. Given the significant growth of our business and non-GAAP operating income, we believe this change is necessary to better reflect the performance of our business. We will continue to assess the appropriate non-GAAP tax rate on a regular basis, which could be subject to changes for a variety of reasons, including the rapidly evolving global tax environment, significant changes in our geographic earnings mix, or other changes to our strategy or business operations. Prior period amounts have been recast to reflect this change.\n\n(2) Adjustment related to the difference between the GAAP provision for income taxes and Non-GAAP provision for income taxes.\n\n(3) The sum of the fully diluted earnings per share impact of individual reconciling items may not total to fully diluted non-GAAP net income per share due to the weighted-average shares used in computing the GAAP net loss per share differs from the weighted-average shares used in computing the non-GAAP net income per share, and due to rounding of the individual reconciling items. The GAAP net loss per share calculation uses a lower share count as it excludes potentially dilutive shares, which are included in calculating the non-GAAP net income per share.\n\n(4) We exclude the in-the-money portion of the convertible senior notes for non-GAAP weighted-average diluted shares as they are covered by our capped call transactions. Our outstanding capped call transactions are antidilutive under GAAP but are expected to mitigate the dilutive effect of the convertible senior notes, and therefore are included in the calculation of non-GAAP diluted shares outstanding. The capped calls have an antidilutive impact when the average stock price of our common stock in a given period is higher than their exercise price.\n\n**ZSCALER, INC.**  \n---  \n**Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures**  \n _(in thousands, except percentages)_  \n_(unaudited)_  \n**Three Months Ended**  \n**October 31,**  \n**2024**| **2023**  \nCalculated Billings  \nRevenue| $| 627,955| $| 496,703  \nAdd: Total deferred revenue, end of period| 1,783,720| 1,399,544  \nLess: Total deferred revenue, beginning of period| (1,894,974| )| (1,439,676| )  \nCalculated billings| $| 516,701| $| 456,571  \nFree Cash Flow  \nNet cash provided by operating activities| $| 331,335| $| 260,806  \nLess: Purchases of property, equipment and other assets| (17,025| )| (28,659| )  \nLess: Capitalized internal-use software| (22,429| )| (7,429| )  \nFree cash flow| $| 291,881| $| 224,718  \nFree Cash Flow Margin  \nNet cash provided by operating activities, as a percentage of revenue| 53| %| 53| %  \nLess: Purchases of property, equipment and other assets, as a percentage of revenue| (3| )%| (6| )%  \nLess: Capitalized internal-use software, as a percentage of revenue| (4| )%| (2| )%  \nFree cash flow margin| 46| %| 45| %  \n  \n**ZSCALER, INC.****Explanation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures**\n\nIn addition to our results determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (\"GAAP\"), we believe the following non-GAAP measures are useful in evaluating our operating performance. We use the following non-GAAP financial information to evaluate our ongoing operations and for internal planning and forecasting purposes. We believe that non-GAAP financial information, when taken collectively, may be helpful to investors because it provides consistency and comparability with past financial performance. However, non-GAAP financial information is presented for supplemental informational purposes only, as it has limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial information presented in accordance with GAAP. In particular, free cash flow is not a substitute for cash provided by operating activities. Additionally, the utility of free cash flow as a measure of our liquidity is further limited as it does not represent the total increase or decrease in our cash balance for a given period. In addition, other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate similarly titled non-GAAP measures differently or may use other measures to evaluate their performance, all of which could reduce the usefulness of our non-GAAP financial measures as tools for comparison. A reconciliation of our historical non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable financial measures stated in accordance with GAAP has been included in this press release. Investors are cautioned that there are a number of limitations associated with the use of non-GAAP financial measures and key metrics as analytical tools. Investors are encouraged to review these reconciliations, and not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business.\n\n**Expenses Excluded from Non-GAAP Measures**\n\nStock-based compensation expense is excluded primarily because it is a non-cash expense that management believes is not reflective of our ongoing operational performance. Employer payroll taxes related to stock-based compensation, which is a cash expense, are excluded because these are tied to the timing and size of the exercise or vesting of the underlying equity incentive awards and the price of our common stock at the time of vesting or exercise, which may vary from period to period independent of the operating performance of our business. Amortization expense of acquired intangible assets and amortization of debt issuance costs from the convertible senior notes are excluded because these are non-cash expenses and are not reflective of our ongoing operational performance.\n\nEffective August 1, 2024, the beginning of our fiscal year ending July 31, 2025, we are using a long-term projected non-GAAP tax rate of 23% for the purpose of determining our non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per share to provide better consistency across interim reporting periods. Given the significant growth of our business and non-GAAP operating income, we believe this change is necessary to better reflect the performance of our business. We will continue to assess the appropriate non-GAAP tax rate on a regular basis, which could be subject to changes for a variety of reasons, including the rapidly evolving global tax environment, significant changes in our geographic earnings mix, or other changes to our strategy or business operations. Prior period amounts have been recast to reflect this change.\n\n**Non-GAAP Financial Measures**\n\n**_Non-GAAP Gross Profit and Non-GAAP Gross Margin_**. We define non-GAAP gross profit as GAAP gross profit excluding stock-based compensation expense and related employer payroll taxes and amortization expense of acquired intangible assets. We define non-GAAP gross margin as non-GAAP gross profit as a percentage of revenue.\n\n**_Non-GAAP Income from Operations and Non-GAAP Operating Margin_**. We define non-GAAP income from operations as GAAP loss from operations excluding stock-based compensation expense and related employer payroll taxes and amortization expense of acquired intangible assets. We define non-GAAP operating margin as non-GAAP income from operations as a percentage of revenue.\n\n**_Non-GAAP Net Income per Share, Diluted_**. We define non-GAAP net income as GAAP net loss excluding stock-based compensation expense and related employer payroll taxes, amortization expense of acquired intangible assets, amortization of debt issuance costs, and the non-GAAP provision for income taxes adjustment. We define non-GAAP net income per share, diluted, as non-GAAP net income plus the non-GAAP interest expense related to the convertible senior notes divided by the weighted-average diluted shares outstanding, which includes the effect of potentially diluted common stock equivalents outstanding during the period and the anti-dilutive impact of the capped call transactions entered into in connection with the convertible senior notes.\n\n**_Calculated Billings_**. We define calculated billings as revenue plus the change in deferred revenue in a period. Calculated billings in any particular period aims to reflect amounts invoiced for subscriptions to access our cloud platform, together with related support services for our new and existing customers. We typically invoice our customers annually in advance, and to a lesser extent quarterly in advance, monthly in advance or multi-year in advance.\n\n**_Free Cash Flow and Free Cash Flow Margin_**. We define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property, equipment and other assets and capitalized internal-use software. We define free cash flow margin as free cash flow divided by revenue. We believe that free cash flow and free cash flow margin are useful indicators of liquidity that provide information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated from our operations that, after the investments in property, equipment and other assets and capitalized internal-use software, can be used for strategic initiatives.\n\n![](https://ml.globenewswire.com/media/Y2Y2YzBkNjQtYmY4MC00OTExLWJiM2YtYzVkZDhlMDRhYjQzLTExMDUzNTI=/tiny/Zscaler-Inc-.png)\n\n![Zscaler, Inc.
