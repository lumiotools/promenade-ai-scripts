(“PMW”) and CSF Holdings, LLC (“Central Steel”) as well as increases in revenue in the Retail-Flooring segment and Flooring Manufacturing segment,” commented David Verret, Chief Financial Officer of Live Ventures.\n\n“We are pleased to see continued revenue growth in the third quarter,” stated Jon Isaac, President and Chief Executive Officer of Live Ventures. “Despite elevated interest rates contributing to industry-specific headwinds, we are unwavering in our commitment to adapting our businesses to navigate these challenges. We are confident in our business prospects and our long-term 'buy-build-hold' strategy, which highlights our dedication to creating sustainable growth and long-term value for our shareholders.”\n\n**Third Quarter FY 2024 Financial Summary (in thousands except per share amounts)**\n\n**During the three months ended June 30,**  \n---  \n**2024** | **2023** | **% Change**  \nRevenue | $ | 123,878 | $ | 91,516 | 35.4 | %  \nOperating income | $ | 1,131 | $ | 5,561 | -79.7 | %  \nNet income (loss) | $ | (2,855 | ) | $ | 1,060 | -369.3 | %  \nDiluted earnings (loss) per share | $ | (0.91 | ) | $ | 0.33 | -375.8 | %  \nAdjusted EBITDA¹ | $ | 6,123 | $ | 9,575 | -36.1 | %  \n  \nRevenue increased approximately $32.4 million, or 35.4%, to approximately $123.9 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, compared to revenue of approximately $91.5 million in the prior year period. The increase is primarily attributable to the acquisitions of PMW, which was acquired during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2023, and Central Steel, which was acquired in May 2024, which collectively added approximately $21.1 million, an increase of approximately $9.5 million in the Retail-Flooring segment, as well as an increase of approximately $3.8 million in the Flooring Manufacturing segment. The increase was partially offset by decreased revenue of approximately $2.2 million in the Company’s other businesses due to general economic conditions.\n\nOperating income was approximately $1.1 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, compared with operating income of approximately $5.6 million in the prior year period. The decrease in operating income is primarily attributable to the Retail-Flooring segment’s temporary inefficiencies associated with the acquisition of Carpet Remnant Outlet, Inc. (“CRO”) and Johnson Floor & Home (“Johnson”) by Flooring Liquidators, Inc. (“Flooring Liquidators”), which were acquired during the first quarter of fiscal year 2024. The decrease was also attributable to the Steel Manufacturing segment’s decrease in gross margin primarily due to reduced production efficiencies as a result of lower demand.\n\nFor the quarter ended June 30, 2024 net loss was approximately $2.9 million, and diluted loss per share was $0.91, compared with net income of approximately $1.1 million and diluted EPS of $0.33 in the prior year period. The change in net loss is attributable to lower operating income and higher interest expense, net of income taxes.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA¹ for the quarter ended June 30, 2024 was approximately $6.1 million, a decrease of approximately $3.5 million, or 36.1%, compared to the prior year period. The decrease is primarily due to decreases in operating income.\n\nAs of June 30, 2024 the Company had total cash availability of $34.4 million, consisting of cash on hand of $4.7 million and availability under its various lines of credit of $29.7 million.\n\n**Third Quarter FY 2024 Segment Results (in thousands)**\n\n**During the three months ended June 30,**  \n---  \n**2024** | **2023** | **% Change**  \n**Revenue**  \nRetail - Entertainment | $ | 16,503 | $ | 18,009 | -8.4 | %  \nRetail - Flooring | 36,981 | 27,449 | 34.7 | %  \nFlooring Manufacturing | 31,264 | 27,424 | 14.0 | %  \nSteel Manufacturing | 39,047 | 18,409 | 112.1 | %  \nCorporate & other | 83 | 225 | -63.1 | %  \nTotal Revenue | $ | 123,878 | $ | 91,516 | 35.4 | %  \n**During the three months ended June 30,**  \n**2024** | **2023** | **% Change**  \n**Operating Income (loss)**  \nRetail - Entertainment | $ | 1,332 | $ | 1,548 | -14.0 | %  \nRetail - Flooring | (1,498 | ) | 1,049 | -242.8 | %  \nFlooring Manufacturing | 1,856 | 2,022 | -8.2 | %  \nSteel Manufacturing | 1,370 | 2,703 | -49.3 | %  \nCorporate & other | (1,929 | ) | (1,761 | ) | -9.5 | %  \nTotal Operating Income | $ | 1,131 | $ | 5,561 | -79.7 | %  \n**During the three months ended June 30,**  \n**2024** | **2023** | **% Change**  \n**Adjusted EBITDA****¹**  \nRetail - Entertainment | $ | 1,575 | $ | 1,864 | -15.5 | %  \nRetail - Flooring | (258 | ) | $ | 2,083 | -112.4 | %  \nFlooring Manufacturing | 2,797 | 2,935 | -4.7 | %  \nSteel Manufacturing | 3,102 | 3,534 | -12.2 | %  \nCorporate & other | (1,093 | ) | (841 | ) | -30.0 | %  \nTotal Adjusted EBITDA¹ | $ | 6,123 | $ | 9,575 | -36.1 | %  \n**Adjusted EBITDA****¹****as a percentage of revenue**  \nRetail - Entertainment | 9.5 | % | 10.3 | %  \nRetail - Flooring | -0.7 | % | 7.6 | %  \nFlooring Manufacturing | 8.9 | % | 10.7 | %  \nSteel Manufacturing | 7.9 | % | 19.2 | %  \nCorporate & other | N/A | N/A  \nTotal Adjusted EBITDA¹ | 4.9 | % | 10.5 | %  \nas a percentage of revenue  \n  \n**Retail – Entertainment**\n\nRetail-Entertainment segment revenue for the quarter ended June 30, 2024 was approximately $16.5 million, a decrease of approximately $1.5 million, or 8.4%, compared to prior year period revenue of approximately $18.0 million in the prior year period. Revenue decreased primarily due to reduced consumer demand and a shift in sales mix toward used products, which generally have lower ticket sales with higher margins. The shift in sales mix also contributed to the increase in gross margin to 57.9% for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, compared to 54.7% for the prior year period. Operating income for the quarter ended June 30, 2024 was approximately $1.3 million, compared to operating income of approximately $1.5 million for the prior year period.\n\n**Retail – Flooring**\n\nThe Retail-Flooring segment revenue for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, was approximately $37.0 million, an increase of approximately $9.5 million, or 34.7%, compared to prior year period revenue of approximately $27.4 million. The increase is primarily due to increased revenue in Flooring Liquidator's builder design and installation segment, Elite Builder Services, and the acquisitions of CRO and Johnson by Flooring Liquidators during the first quarter of fiscal year 2024. The gross margin for the quarter ended June 30, 2024 was 36.6%, compared to 37.8% for the prior year period. Operating loss for the quarter ended June 30, 2024 was approximately $1.5 million, compared to operating income of approximately $1.0 million for the prior year period. The increase in operating loss was primarily due to temporary inefficiencies associated with the acquisitions of CRO and Johnson in the current period.\n\n**Flooring Manufacturing**\n\nRevenue for the quarter ended June 30, 2024 was approximately $31.3 million, an increase of approximately $3.8 million, or 14.0%, compared to prior year period revenue of approximately $27.4 million. The gross margin was 24.7% for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, compared to 23.3% for the prior year period. The revenue and gross margin increases are primarily due to increased sales associated with the acquisition of the Harris Flooring Group® brands in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2023. Operating income for the quarter ended June 30, 2024 was approximately $1.9 million, compared to operating income of approximately $2.0 million for the prior year. The decrease in operating income in the current year period was due to increased selling and marketing expense associated with the acquisition of the Harris Flooring Group® brands.\n\n**Steel Manufacturing**\n\nRevenue for the quarter ended June 30, 2024 was approximately $39.0 million, an increase of approximately $20.6 million or 112.1%, compared to the prior year period revenue of approximately $18.4 million. The increase is primarily due to increased revenue of approximately $19.2 million at PMW and approximately $1.9 million at Central Steel, partially offset by a $0.5 million decrease in the Company’s other Steel Manufacturing businesses. The gross margin was 15.8% for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, compared to 29.2% for the prior year period. The decrease in gross margin is primarily due to the acquisition of PMW, which has historically generated lower margins, as well as an overall decrease in margins in the Steel Manufacturing segment due to reduced production efficiencies as a result of lower demand. Operating income for the quarter ended June 30, 2024 was approximately $1.4 million, compared to operating income of approximately $2.7 million in the prior year period.\n\n**Corporate and Other**\n\nRevenue for the quarter ended June 30, 2024 was approximately $0.1 million, a decrease of approximately $0.1 million, or 63.1%, compared to the prior year period revenue of approximately $0.2 million. Operating loss for the quarter ended June 30, 2024 was approximately $1.9 million, compared to an operating loss of approximately $1.8 million in the prior year period.\n\n**Nine Months FY 2024 Financial Summary (in thousands except per share amounts)**\n\n2024 | 2023 | % Change  \n---|---|---  \nRevenue | $ | 360,097 | $ | 251,624 | 43.1%  \nOperating Income | $ | 3,834 | $ | 15,080 | -74.6%  \nNet income (loss) | $ | (6,818 | ) | $ | 4,462 | -252.8%  \nDiluted earnings (loss) per share | $ | (2.16 | ) | $ | 1.42 | -252.1%  \nAdjusted EBITDA¹ | $ | 19,275 | $ | 26,300 | -26.7%  \n  \nRevenue increased approximately $108.5 million, or 43.1%, to $360.1 million for the nine months ended June 30, 2024, as compared to revenue of $251.6 million in the prior year period. The increase is primarily attributable to the acquisitions of PMW and Flooring Liquidators, which collectively added $110.2 million, as well as an increase of approximately $10.5 million in the Flooring Manufacturing segment. The increase was partially offset by decreased revenue of approximately $12.2 million in the Company’s other businesses due to general economic conditions.\n\nOperating income decreased to $3.8 million for the nine months ended June 30, 2024, compared to $15.1 million in the prior year period. The decrease in operating income is primarily attributable to the Retail-Flooring segment’s temporary inefficiencies associated with the acquisitions of CRO and Johnson by Flooring Liquidators, which were acquired during the first quarter of fiscal year 2024. The decrease was also attributable to the Steel Manufacturing segment’s decrease in gross margin primarily as a result of the acquisition of PMW, which has historically generated lower margins, as well as an overall decrease in margins in the Steel Manufacturing segment due to reduced production efficiencies as a result of lower demand.\n\nFor the nine months ended June 30, 2024 net loss was $6.8 million and diluted loss per share was $2.16, compared with net income of $4.5 million and diluted EPS of $1.42 in the prior year period. The increase in net loss is attributable to lower operating income and higher interest expense related to the acquisitions of Flooring Liquidators and PMW, net of income taxes.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA for the nine months ended June 30, 2024 was $19.3 million, a decrease of approximately $7.0 million, or 26.7%, compared to the prior year period. The decrease is primarily due to the decrease in operating income.\n\n**Nine Months FY 2024 Segment Results (in thousands)**\n\n**During the nine months ended June 30,**  \n---  \n**2024** | **2023** | **% Change**  \n**Revenue**  \nRetail - Entertainment | $ | 53,930 | $ | 60,388 | -10.7 | %  \nRetail - Flooring | 103,332 | 48,218 | 114.3 | %  \nFlooring Manufacturing | 94,689 | 84,195 | 12.5 | %  \nSteel Manufacturing | 107,889 | 56,306 | 91.6 | %  \nCorporate & other | 257 | 2,517 | -89.8 | %  \nTotal Revenue | $ | 360,097 | $ | 251,624 | 43.1 | %  \n**During the nine months ended June 30,**  \n**2024** | **2023** | **% Change**  \n**Operating Income (loss)**  \nRetail - Entertainment | $ | 6,305 | $ | 7,542 | -16.4 | %  \nRetail - Flooring | (4,433 | ) | 833 | -632.2 | %  \nFlooring Manufacturing | 4,779 | 5,179 | -7.7 | %  \nSteel Manufacturing | 3,225 | 6,972 | -53.7 | %  \nCorporate & other | (6,042 | ) | (5,446 | ) | -10.9 | %  \nTotal Operating Income | $ | 3,834 | $ | 15,080 | -74.6 | %  \n**During the nine months ended June 30,**  \n**2024** | **2023** | **% Change**  \n**Adjusted EBITDA¹**  \nRetail - Entertainment | $ | 7,441 | $ | 8,519 | -12.7 | %  \nRetail - Flooring | (803 | ) | 3,194 | -125.1 | %  \nFlooring Manufacturing | 7,571 | 8,082 | -6.3 | %  \nSteel Manufacturing | 8,235 | 9,729 | -15.4 | %  \nCorporate & other | (3,169 | ) | (3,224 | ) | 1.7 | %  \nTotal Adjusted EBITDA¹ | $ | 19,275 | $ | 26,300 | -26.7 | %  \n**Adjusted EBITDA****¹****as a percentage of revenue**  \nRetail - Entertainment | 13.8 | % | 14.1 | %  \nRetail - Flooring | -0.8 | % | 6.6 | %  \nFlooring Manufacturing | 8.0 | % | 9.6 | %  \nSteel Manufacturing | 7.6 | % | 17.3 | %  \nCorporate & other | N/A | N/A  \nTotal Adjusted EBITDA¹ | 5.4 | % | 10.5 | %  \nas a percentage of revenue  \n  \n**Retail - Entertainment**\n\nRetail-Entertainment segment revenue for the nine months ended June 30, 2024 was approximately $53.9 million, a decrease of approximately $6.5 million, or 10.7%, compared to the prior year period revenue of approximately $60.4 million. The decrease in revenue is primarily due to reduced consumer demand and a shift in sales mix toward used products, which generally have lower ticket sales with higher margins. The shift in sales mix also contributed to the increase in gross margin to 57.3% for the nine months ended June 30, 2024, compared to 54.0% for the prior year period. Operating income for the nine months ended June 30, 2024 was approximately $6.3 million, compared to operating income of approximately $7.5 million for the prior year period.\n\n**Retail - Flooring**\n\nThe Retail-Flooring segment consists of Flooring Liquidators, which was acquired in January 2023. Revenue for the nine months ended June 30, 2024 was approximately $103.3 million, an increase of approximately $55.1 million, or 114.3%, compared to the prior year period revenue of $48.2 million. The increase is due to the acquisition of Flooring Liquidators in the second quarter of fiscal year 2023 and the acquisitions of CRO and Johnson by Flooring Liquidators during the first quarter of fiscal year 2024. The gross margin for the nine months ended June 30, 2024 was 37.0%, compared to 37.6% for the prior year period. Operating loss for the nine months ended June 30, 2024 was approximately $4.4 million, compared to operating income of approximately $0.8 million for the prior year period. The increase in operating loss was primarily due to temporary inefficiencies associated with the acquisitions of CRO and Johnson in the current period.\n\n**Flooring Manufacturing**\n\nRevenue for the nine months ended June 30, 2024 was approximately $94.7 million, an increase of approximately $10.5 million, or 12.5%, compared to the prior year period revenue of approximately $84.2 million. The gross margin was 24.2% for the nine months ended June 30, 2024, compared to 21.8% for the prior year period. The increase in revenue and gross margin are primarily due to increased sales associated with the acquisition of the Harris Flooring Group® brands in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2023. Operating income for the nine months ended June 30, 2024 was approximately $4.8 million, compared to operating income of approximately $5.2 million for the prior year period. The decrease in operating income was primarily due to increased selling and marketing expense associated with the acquisition of the Harris Flooring Group® brands.\n\n**Steel Manufacturing**\n\nRevenue for the nine months ended June 30, 2024 increased approximately $51.6 million or 91.6% to approximately $107.9 million, as compared to the prior year period revenue of $56.3 million. The increase is primarily due to increased revenue of approximately $55.1 million at PMW, which was acquired in the fourth quarter of 2023, and $1.9 million at Central Steel, which was acquired during May 2024, partially offset by a $5.4 million decrease in the Company’s other Steel Manufacturing businesses. The gross margin was 15.3% for the nine months ended June 30, 2024, compared to 27.4% for the prior year period. The decrease in gross margin is primarily due to the acquisition of PMW, which has historically generated lower margins, as well as overall decreased margins in the Steel Manufacturing segment due to reduced production. Operating income for the nine months ended June 30, 2024 was approximately $3.2 million, compared to operating income of approximately $7.0 in the prior year period.\n\n**Corporate and Other**\n\nRevenue for the nine months ended June 30, 2024 decreased by approximately $2.3 million to approximately $0.3 million. The decrease was primarily due to the closure of SW Financial in May 2023. Operating loss for the nine months ended June 30, 2024 was approximately $6.0 million, compared to an operating loss of approximately $5.4 million in the prior year period.\n\n**Non-GAAP Financial Information**\n\n**Adjusted EBITDA**\n\nWe evaluate the performance of our operations based on financial measures, such as “Adjusted EBITDA,” which is a non-GAAP financial measure. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) before interest expense, interest income, income taxes, depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation, and other non-cash or nonrecurring charges. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA is an important indicator of the operational strength and performance of the business, including the business’s ability to fund acquisitions and other capital expenditures and to service its debt. Additionally, this measure is used by management to evaluate operating results and perform analytical comparisons and identify strategies to improve performance. Adjusted EBITDA is also a measure that is customarily used by financial analysts to evaluate a company’s financial performance, subject to certain adjustments. Adjusted EBITDA does not represent cash flows from operations, as defined by generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), should not be construed as an alternative to net income or loss, and is indicative neither of our results of operations, nor of cash flow available to fund our cash needs. It is, however, a measurement that the Company believes is useful to investors in analyzing its operating performance. Accordingly, Adjusted EBITDA should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, net income, cash flow provided by operating activities, and other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. As companies often define non-GAAP financial measures differently, Adjusted EBITDA, as calculated by Live Ventures Incorporated, should not be compared to any similarly titled measures reported by other companies.\n\n**Forward-Looking and Cautionary Statements**\n\nThe use of the word “Company” refers to Live Ventures and its wholly owned subsidiaries. Certain statements in this press release contain or may suggest “forward-looking” information within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, each as amended, that are intended to be covered by the “safe harbor” created by those sections.

(“PMW”) and CSF\nHoldings, LLC (“Central Steel”) as well as increases in revenue in the Retail-Flooring\nsegment and Flooring Manufacturing segment,” commented David Verret, Chief Financial\nOfficer of Live Ventures.\n“We are pleased to see continued revenue growth in the third quarter,” stated Jon Isaac,\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer of Live Ventures. “Despite elevated interest rates\ncontributing to industry-specific headwinds, we are unwavering in our commitment to\nadapting our businesses to navigate these challenges. We are confident in our business\nprospects and our long-term 'buy-build-hold' strategy, which highlights our dedication to\ncreating sustainable growth and long-term value for our shareholders.”\nThird Quarter FY 2024 Financial Summary (in thousands except per share amounts)\nDuring the three months ended June 30,\n2024 2023 % Change\nRevenue $ 123,878 $ 91,516 35.4%\nOperating income $ 1,131 $ 5,561 -79.7%\nNet income (loss) $ (2,855) $ 1,060 -369.3%\nDiluted earnings (loss) per share $ (0.91) $ 0.33 -375.8%\nAdjusted EBITDA¹ $ 6,123 $ 9,575 -36.1%\nRevenue increased approximately $32.4 million, or 35.4%, to approximately $123.9 million\nfor the quarter ended June 30, 2024, compared to revenue of approximately $91.5 million in\nthe prior year period. The increase is primarily attributable to the acquisitions of PMW, which\nwas acquired during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2023, and Central Steel, which was\nacquired in May 2024, which collectively added approximately $21.1 million, an increase of\napproximately $9.5 million in the Retail-Flooring segment, as well as an increase of\napproximately $3.8 million in the Flooring Manufacturing segment. The increase was\npartially offset by decreased revenue of approximately $2.2 million in the Company’s other\nbusinesses due to general economic conditions.\nOperating income was approximately $1.1 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2024,\ncompared with operating income of approximately $5.6 million in the prior year period. The\ndecrease in operating income is primarily attributable to the Retail-Flooring segment’s\ntemporary inefficiencies associated with the acquisition of Carpet Remnant Outlet, Inc.\n(“CRO”) and Johnson Floor & Home (“Johnson”) by Flooring Liquidators, Inc. (“Flooring\nLiquidators”), which were acquired during the first quarter of fiscal year 2024. The decrease\nwas also attributable to the Steel Manufacturing segment’s decrease in gross margin\nprimarily due to reduced production efficiencies as a result of lower demand.\nFor the quarter ended June 30, 2024 net loss was approximately $2.9 million, and diluted\nloss per share was $0.91, compared with net income of approximately $1.1 million and\ndiluted EPS of $0.33 in the prior year period. The change in net loss is attributable to lower\noperating income and higher interest expense, net of income taxes.\nAdjusted EBITDA¹ for the quarter ended June 30, 2024 was approximately $6.1 million, a\ndecrease of approximately $3.5 million, or 36.1%, compared to the prior year period. The\ndecrease is primarily due to decreases in operating income.\nAs of June 30, 2024 the Company had total cash availability of $34.4 million, consisting of\ncash on hand of $4.7 million and availability under its various lines of credit of $29.7 million.\nThird Quarter FY 2024 Segment Results (in thousands)\nDuring the three months ended June 30,\n2024 2023 % Change\nRevenue\nRetail - Entertainment $ 16,503 $ 18,009 -8.4%\nRetail - Flooring 36,981 27,449 34.7%\nFlooring Manufacturing 31,264 27,424 14.0%\nSteel Manufacturing 39,047 18,409 112.1%\nCorporate & other 83 225 -63.1%\nTotal Revenue $ 123,878 $ 91,516 35.4%\nDuring the three months ended June 30,\n2024 2023 % Change\nOperating Income (loss)\nRetail - Entertainment $ 1,332 $ 1,548 -14.0%\nRetail - Flooring (1,498) 1,049 -242.8%\nFlooring Manufacturing 1,856 2,022 -8.2%\nSteel Manufacturing 1,370 2,703 -49.3%\nCorporate & other (1,929) (1,761) -9.5%\nTotal Operating Income $ 1,131 $ 5,561 -79.7%\nDuring the three months ended June 30,\n2024 2023 % Change\nAdjusted EBITDA¹\nRetail - Entertainment $ 1,575 $ 1,864 -15.5%\nRetail - Flooring (258) $ 2,083 -112.4%\nFlooring Manufacturing 2,797 2,935 -4.7%\nSteel Manufacturing 3,102 3,534 -12.2%\nCorporate & other (1,093) (841) -30.0%\nTotal Adjusted EBITDA¹ $ 6,123 $ 9,575 -36.1%\nAdjusted EBITDA¹ as a percentage of revenue\nRetail - Entertainment 9.5% 10.3%\nRetail - Flooring -0.7% 7.6%\nFlooring Manufacturing 8.9% 10.7%\nSteel Manufacturing 7.9% 19.2%\nCorporate & other N/A N/A\nTotal Adjusted EBITDA¹ 4.9% 10.5%\nas a percentage of revenue\nRetail – Entertainment\nRetail-Entertainment segment revenue for the quarter ended June 30, 2024 was\napproximately $16.5 million, a decrease of approximately $1.5 million, or 8.4%, compared to\nprior year period revenue of approximately $18.0 million in the prior year period. Revenue\ndecreased primarily due to reduced consumer demand and a shift in sales mix toward used\nproducts, which generally have lower ticket sales with higher margins. The shift in sales mix\nalso contributed to the increase in gross margin to 57.9% for the quarter ended June 30,\n2024, compared to 54.7% for the prior year period. Operating income for the quarter ended\nJune 30, 2024 was approximately $1.3 million, compared to operating income of\napproximately $1.5 million for the prior year period.\nRetail – Flooring\nThe Retail-Flooring segment revenue for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, was\napproximately $37.0 million, an increase of approximately $9.5 million, or 34.7%, compared\nto prior year period revenue of approximately $27.4 million. The increase is primarily due to\nincreased revenue in Flooring Liquidator's builder design and installation segment, Elite\nBuilder Services, and the acquisitions of CRO and Johnson by Flooring Liquidators during\nthe first quarter of fiscal year 2024. The gross margin for the quarter ended June 30, 2024\nwas 36.6%, compared to 37.8% for the prior year period. Operating loss for the quarter\nended June 30, 2024 was approximately $1.5 million, compared to operating income of\napproximately $1.0 million for the prior year period. The increase in operating loss was\nprimarily due to temporary inefficiencies associated with the acquisitions of CRO and\nJohnson in the current period.\nFlooring Manufacturing\nRevenue for the quarter ended June 30, 2024 was approximately $31.3 million, an increase\nof approximately $3.8 million, or 14.0%, compared to prior year period revenue of\napproximately $27.4 million. The gross margin was 24.7% for the quarter ended June 30,\n2024, compared to 23.3% for the prior year period. The revenue and gross margin increases\nare primarily due to increased sales associated with the acquisition of the Harris Flooring\nGroup® brands in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2023. Operating income for the quarter\nended June 30, 2024 was approximately $1.9 million, compared to operating income of\napproximately $2.0 million for the prior year. The decrease in operating income in the current\nyear period was due to increased selling and marketing expense associated with the\nacquisition of the Harris Flooring Group® brands.\nSteel Manufacturing\nRevenue for the quarter ended June 30, 2024 was approximately $39.0 million, an increase\nof approximately $20.6 million or 112.1%, compared to the prior year period revenue of\napproximately $18.4 million. The increase is primarily due to increased revenue of\napproximately $19.2 million at PMW and approximately $1.9 million at Central Steel, partially\noffset by a $0.5 million decrease in the Company’s other Steel Manufacturing businesses.\nThe gross margin was 15.8% for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, compared to 29.2% for\nthe prior year period. The decrease in gross margin is primarily due to the acquisition of\nPMW, which has historically generated lower margins, as well as an overall decrease in\nmargins in the Steel Manufacturing segment due to reduced production efficiencies as a\nresult of lower demand. Operating income for the quarter ended June 30, 2024 was\napproximately $1.4 million, compared to operating income of approximately $2.7 million in\nthe prior year period.\nCorporate and Other\nRevenue for the quarter ended June 30, 2024 was approximately $0.1 million, a decrease of\napproximately $0.1 million, or 63.1%, compared to the prior year period revenue of\napproximately $0.2 million. Operating loss for the quarter ended June 30, 2024 was\napproximately $1.9 million, compared to an operating loss of approximately $1.8 million in\nthe prior year period.\nNine Months FY 2024 Financial Summary (in thousands except per share amounts)\n%\n2024 2023 Change\nRevenue $ 360,097 $ 251,624 43.1%\nOperating Income $ 3,834 $ 15,080 -74.6%\nNet income (loss) $ (6,818) $ 4,462 -252.8%\nDiluted earnings (loss) per share $ (2.16) $ 1.42 -252.1%\nAdjusted EBITDA¹ $ 19,275 $ 26,300 -26.7%\nRevenue increased approximately $108.5 million, or 43.1%, to $360.1 million for the nine\nmonths ended June 30, 2024, as compared to revenue of $251.6 million in the prior year\nperiod. The increase is primarily attributable to the acquisitions of PMW and Flooring\nLiquidators, which collectively added $110.2 million, as well as an increase of approximately\n$10.5 million in the Flooring Manufacturing segment. The increase was partially offset by\ndecreased revenue of approximately $12.2 million in the Company’s other businesses due to\ngeneral economic conditions.\nOperating income decreased to $3.8 million for the nine months ended June 30, 2024,\ncompared to $15.1 million in the prior year period. The decrease in operating income is\nprimarily attributable to the Retail-Flooring segment’s temporary inefficiencies associated\nwith the acquisitions of CRO and Johnson by Flooring Liquidators, which were acquired\nduring the first quarter of fiscal year 2024. The decrease was also attributable to the Steel\nManufacturing segment’s decrease in gross margin primarily as a result of the acquisition of\nPMW, which has historically generated lower margins, as well as an overall decrease in\nmargins in the Steel Manufacturing segment due to reduced production efficiencies as a\nresult of lower demand.\nFor the nine months ended June 30, 2024 net loss was $6.8 million and diluted loss per\nshare was $2.16, compared with net income of $4.5 million and diluted EPS of $1.42 in the\nprior year period. The increase in net loss is attributable to lower operating income and\nhigher interest expense related to the acquisitions of Flooring Liquidators and PMW, net of\nincome taxes.\nAdjusted EBITDA for the nine months ended June 30, 2024 was $19.3 million, a decrease of\napproximately $7.0 million, or 26.7%, compared to the prior year period. The decrease is\nprimarily due to the decrease in operating income.\nNine Months FY 2024 Segment Results (in thousands)\nDuring the nine months ended June 30,\n2024 2023 % Change\nRevenue\nRetail - Entertainment $ 53,930 $ 60,388 -10.7%\nRetail - Flooring 103,332 48,218 114.3%\nFlooring Manufacturing 94,689 84,195 12.5%\nSteel Manufacturing 107,889 56,306 91.6%\nCorporate & other 257 2,517 -89.8%\nTotal Revenue $ 360,097 $ 251,624 43.1%\nDuring the nine months ended June 30,\n2024 2023 % Change\nOperating Income (loss)\nRetail - Entertainment $ 6,305 $ 7,542 -16.4%\nRetail - Flooring (4,433) 833 -632.2%\nFlooring Manufacturing 4,779 5,179 -7.7%\nSteel Manufacturing 3,225 6,972 -53.7%\nCorporate & other (6,042) (5,446) -10.9%\nTotal Operating Income $ 3,834 $ 15,080 -74.6%\nDuring the nine months ended June 30,\n2024 2023 % Change\nAdjusted EBITDA¹\nRetail - Entertainment $ 7,441 $ 8,519 -12.7%\nRetail - Flooring (803) 3,194 -125.1%\nFlooring Manufacturing 7,571 8,082 -6.3%\nSteel Manufacturing 8,235 9,729 -15.4%\nCorporate & other (3,169) (3,224) 1.7%\nTotal Adjusted EBITDA¹ $ 19,275 $ 26,300 -26.7%\nAdjusted EBITDA¹ as a percentage of revenue\nRetail - Entertainment 13.8% 14.1%\nRetail - Flooring -0.8% 6.6%\nFlooring Manufacturing 8.0% 9.6%\nSteel Manufacturing 7.6% 17.3%\nCorporate & other N/A N/A\nTotal Adjusted EBITDA¹ 5.4% 10.5%\nas a percentage of revenue\nRetail - Entertainment\nRetail-Entertainment segment revenue for the nine months ended June 30, 2024 was\napproximately $53.9 million, a decrease of approximately $6.5 million, or 10.7%, compared\nto the prior year period revenue of approximately $60.4 million. The decrease in revenue is\nprimarily due to reduced consumer demand and a shift in sales mix toward used products,\nwhich generally have lower ticket sales with higher margins. The shift in sales mix also\ncontributed to the increase in gross margin to 57.3% for the nine months ended June 30,\n2024, compared to 54.0% for the prior year period. Operating income for the nine months\nended June 30, 2024 was approximately $6.3 million, compared to operating income of\napproximately $7.5 million for the prior year period.\nRetail - Flooring\nThe Retail-Flooring segment consists of Flooring Liquidators, which was acquired in January\n2023. Revenue for the nine months ended June 30, 2024 was approximately $103.3 million,\nan increase of approximately $55.1 million, or 114.3%, compared to the prior year period\nrevenue of $48.2 million. The increase is due to the acquisition of Flooring Liquidators in the\nsecond quarter of fiscal year 2023 and the acquisitions of CRO and Johnson by Flooring\nLiquidators during the first quarter of fiscal year 2024. The gross margin for the nine months\nended June 30, 2024 was 37.0%, compared to 37.6% for the prior year period. Operating\nloss for the nine months ended June 30, 2024 was approximately $4.4 million, compared to\noperating income of approximately $0.8 million for the prior year period. The increase in\noperating loss was primarily due to temporary inefficiencies associated with the acquisitions\nof CRO and Johnson in the current period.\nFlooring Manufacturing\nRevenue for the nine months ended June 30, 2024 was approximately $94.7 million, an\nincrease of approximately $10.5 million, or 12.5%, compared to the prior year period\nrevenue of approximately $84.2 million. The gross margin was 24.2% for the nine months\nended June 30, 2024, compared to 21.8% for the prior year period. The increase in revenue\nand gross margin are primarily due to increased sales associated with the acquisition of the\nHarris Flooring Group® brands in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2023. Operating income for\nthe nine months ended June 30, 2024 was approximately $4.8 million, compared to\noperating income of approximately $5.2 million for the prior year period. The decrease in\noperating income was primarily due to increased selling and marketing expense associated\nwith the acquisition of the Harris Flooring Group® brands.\nSteel Manufacturing\nRevenue for the nine months ended June 30, 2024 increased approximately $51.6 million or\n91.6% to approximately $107.9 million, as compared to the prior year period revenue of\n$56.3 million. The increase is primarily due to increased revenue of approximately $55.1\nmillion at PMW, which was acquired in the fourth quarter of 2023, and $1.9 million at Central\nSteel, which was acquired during May 2024, partially offset by a $5.4 million decrease in the\nCompany’s other Steel Manufacturing businesses. The gross margin was 15.3% for the nine\nmonths ended June 30, 2024, compared to 27.4% for the prior year period. The decrease in\ngross margin is primarily due to the acquisition of PMW, which has historically generated\nlower margins, as well as overall decreased margins in the Steel Manufacturing segment\ndue to reduced production. Operating income for the nine months ended June 30, 2024 was\napproximately $3.2 million, compared to operating income of approximately $7.0 in the prior\nyear period.\nCorporate and Other\nRevenue for the nine months ended June 30, 2024 decreased by approximately $2.3 million\nto approximately $0.3 million. The decrease was primarily due to the closure of SW Financial\nin May 2023. Operating loss for the nine months ended June 30, 2024 was approximately\n$6.0 million, compared to an operating loss of approximately $5.4 million in the prior year\nperiod.\nNon-GAAP Financial Information\nAdjusted EBITDA\nWe evaluate the performance of our operations based on financial measures, such as\n“Adjusted EBITDA,” which is a non-GAAP financial measure. We define Adjusted EBITDA as\nnet income (loss) before interest expense, interest income, income taxes, depreciation,\namortization, stock-based compensation, and other non-cash or nonrecurring charges. We\nbelieve that Adjusted EBITDA is an important indicator of the operational strength and\nperformance of the business, including the business’s ability to fund acquisitions and other\ncapital expenditures and to service its debt. Additionally, this measure is used by\nmanagement to evaluate operating results and perform analytical comparisons and identify\nstrategies to improve performance. Adjusted EBITDA is also a measure that is customarily\nused by financial analysts to evaluate a company’s financial performance, subject to certain\nadjustments. Adjusted EBITDA does not represent cash flows from operations, as defined by\ngenerally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), should not be construed as an\nalternative to net income or loss, and is indicative neither of our results of operations, nor of\ncash flow available to fund our cash needs. It is, however, a measurement that the Company\nbelieves is useful to investors in analyzing its operating performance. Accordingly, Adjusted\nEBITDA should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, net income, cash\nflow provided by operating activities, and other measures of financial performance prepared\nin accordance with GAAP. As companies often define non-GAAP financial measures\ndifferently, Adjusted EBITDA, as calculated by Live Ventures Incorporated, should not be\ncompared to any similarly titled measures reported by other companies.\nForward-Looking and Cautionary Statements\nThe use of the word “Company” refers to Live Ventures and its wholly owned subsidiaries.\nCertain statements in this press release contain or may suggest “forward-looking”\ninformation within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act and Section 21E of the\nSecurities Exchange Act of 1934, each as amended, that are intended to be covered by the\n“safe harbor” created by those sections. Words such as “will,” “expects,” “anticipates,”\n“future,” “intends,” “plans,” “believes,” “estimates,” and similar statements are intended to\nidentify forward-looking statements. Live Ventures may also make forward-looking\nstatements in its periodic reports to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Forms\n10-K and 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, in its annual report to stockholders, in press\nreleases and other written materials, and in oral statements made by its officers, directors or\nemployees to third parties. There can be no assurance that such statements will prove to be\naccurate and there are a number of important factors that could cause actual results to differ\nmaterially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements made by the Company,\nincluding, but not limited to, plans and objectives of management for future operations or\nproducts, the market acceptance or future success of our products, and our future financial\nperformance. The Company cautions that these forward-looking statements are further\nqualified by other factors including, but not limited to, those set forth in the Company’s\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023. Additionally,\nnew risk factors emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict all such risk\nfactors, or to assess the impact such risk factors might have on our business. Live Ventures\nundertakes no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements whether as a\nresult of new information, future events or otherwise.\nAbout Live Ventures Incorporated\nLive Ventures is a diversified holding company with a strategic focus on value-oriented\nacquisitions of domestic middle-market companies.
