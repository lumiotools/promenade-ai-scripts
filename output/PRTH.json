We believe these non-GAAP measures help to illustrate the underlying financial and business trends relating to our results of operations and comparability between current and prior periods. We also use these non-GAAP measures to establish and monitor operational goals. However, these non-GAAP measures are not superior to or a substitute for prominent measurements calculated in accordance with GAAP. Rather, the non-GAAP measures are meant to be a complement to understanding measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.\n\n**_Adjusted Gross Profit and Adjusted Gross Profit Margin_**\n\nThe Company’s adjusted gross profit metric represents revenues less cost of revenue (excluding depreciation and amortization). Adjusted gross profit margin is adjusted gross profit divided by revenues. We review these non-GAAP measures to evaluate our underlying profit trends. The reconciliation of adjusted gross profit to its most comparable GAAP measure is provided below:\n\n_(in thousands)_| **Three Months Ended September 30,**  \n---|---  \n**2024**| **2023**  \nRevenues|  $|  227,049|  $|  189,015  \nCost of revenue (excluding depreciation and amortization)|  (141,070|  )|  (116,682|  )  \nAdjusted gross profit| **$**| **85,979**| **$**| **72,333**  \nAdjusted gross profit margin|  37.9|  %|  38.3|  %  \nDepreciation and amortization of revenue generating assets|  (4,207|  )|  (3,000|  )  \nGross profit| **$**| **81,772**| **$**| **69,333**  \nGross profit margin|  36.0|  %|  36.7|  %  \n  \n**_EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA_**\n\nEBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are performance measures. EBITDA is earnings before interest, income tax, and depreciation and amortization expenses (“EBITDA”). Adjusted EBITDA begins with EBITDA but further excludes certain non-cash costs, such as stock-based compensation and the write-off of the carrying value of investments or other assets, as well as debt extinguishment and modification expenses and other expenses and income items considered non-recurring, such as acquisition integration expenses, certain professional fees, and litigation settlements. We review the non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA measure to evaluate our business and trends, measure our performance, prepare financial projections, allocate resources, and make strategic decisions.\n\nThe reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA to its most comparable GAAP measure is provided below:\n\n_(in thousands)_| **Three Months Ended September 30,**  \n---|---  \n**2024**| **2023**  \nNet income (loss)|  $|  10,608|  $|  (87|  )  \nInterest expense|  23,246|  19,997  \nIncome tax expense|  4,899|  4,328  \nDepreciation and amortization|  13,733|  17,275  \nEBITDA|  52,486|  41,513  \nDebt extinguishment and modification|  43|  —  \nNon-recurring gain|  —|  (166|  )  \nSelling, general and administrative (non-recurring)|  696|  2,114  \nNon-cash stock-based compensation|  1,416|  1,501  \n**Adjusted EBITDA**| **$**| **54,641**| **$**| **44,962**  \n  \nFurther detail of certain of these adjustments, and where these items are recorded in our consolidated statements of operations, is provided below:\n\n_(in thousands)_| **Three Months Ended September 30,**  \n---|---  \n**2024**| **2023**  \n**Selling, general and administrative expenses (non-recurring):**  \nCertain legal fees|  552|  656  \nProfessional, accounting and consulting fees|  128|  1,364  \nOther expenses, net|  16|  94  \n**$**| **696**| **$**| **2,114**  \n  \nPriority does not provide a reconciliation of forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures to their comparable GAAP financial measures because it could not do so without unreasonable effort due to the unavailability of the information needed to calculate reconciling items and due to the variability, complexity and limited visibility of the adjusting items that would be excluded from the non-GAAP financial measures in future periods. When planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods, the Company does so primarily on a non-GAAP basis without preparing a GAAP analysis as that would require estimates for various cash and non-cash reconciling items that would be difficult to predict with reasonable accuracy. For example, stock-based compensation expense would be difficult to estimate because it depends on the Company’s future hiring and retention needs, as well as the future fair market value of the Company’s common stock, all of which are difficult to predict and subject to constant change. As a result, the Company does not believe that a GAAP reconciliation would provide meaningful supplemental information about the Company’s outlook.\n\n**About Priority Technology Holdings, Inc.**\n\nPriority is a solution provider in Payments and Banking as a Service operating at scale with over 1.1 million active customers across its SMB, B2B and Enterprise channels processing approximately $127 billion in annual transaction volume and providing administration for over $1.1 billion in account balances.

          "content": "CODE OF ETHICS\nOF\nPRIORITY TECHNOLOGY HOLDINGS, INC.\nAdopted as of July 25, 2018\nI.INTRODUCTION\nThe Board of Directors (the \"Board\") of Priority Technology Holdings, Inc. (the \"Company\")\nhas adopted this written code of ethics (this \"Code\"), as amended from time to time by the Board and\nwhich is applicable to all of the Company's directors, officers and employees to:\n promote honest and ethical conduct, including the ethical handling of actual or apparent conflicts\nof interest between personal and professional relationships;\n promote the full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in reports and documents\nthat the Company files with, or submits to, the Securities and Exchange Commission (the\n\"SEC\"), as well as in other public communications made by or on behalf of the Company;\n promote compliance with applicable governmental laws, rules and regulations;\n deter wrongdoing; and\n require prompt internal reporting of breaches of, and accountability for adherence to, this Code.\nThis Code may be amended and modified by the Board. In this Code, references to the\n\"Company\" means Priority Technology Holdings, Inc. and, in appropriate context, the Company's\nsubsidiaries, if any.\nThe Company shall publicly disclose this Code on Form 8-K or by any other means approved by\nthe SEC, including making a copy of this Code publicly available on its website.\nII.HONEST, ETHICAL AND FAIR CONDUCT\nEach person owes a duty to the Company to act with integrity. Integrity requires, among other\nthings, being honest, fair and candid. Deceit, dishonesty and subordination of principle are inconsistent\nwith integrity. Service to the Company should never be subordinated to personal gain and advantage.\nEach person must:\n Act with integrity, including being honest and candid while still maintaining the confidentiality of\nthe Company's information where required or when in the Company's interests;\n Observe all applicable governmental laws, rules and regulations;\n Comply with the requirements of applicable accounting and auditing standards, as well as\nCompany policies, in order to maintain a high standard of accuracy and completeness in the\nCompany's financial records and other business-related information and data;\nDOC ID - 27996711.7\n Adhere to a high standard of business ethics and not seek competitive advantage through\nunlawful or unethical business practices;\n Deal fairly with the Company's customers, suppliers, competitors and employees;\n Refrain from taking advantage of anyone through manipulation, concealment, abuse of privileged\ninformation, misrepresentation of material facts or any other unfair-dealing practice;\n Protect the assets of the Company and ensure their proper use;\n Until such time as such person ceases to be an officer or director of the Company, to first present\nto the Company for its consideration, prior to presentation to any other entity, any business\nopportunity suitable for the Company, subject to any pre-existing fiduciary or contractual\nobligations such officer may have or as otherwise may be permitted pursuant to the Company's\namended and restated certificate of incorporation, as presently in effect (the \"Certificate of\nIncorporation\")'; and\n Avoid conflicts of interest, wherever possible, except as may be allowed pursuant to the\nCertificate of Incorporation or under guidelines or resolutions approved by the Board (or the\nappropriate committee of the Board)'. Anything that would be a conflict for a person subject to\nthis Code also will be a conflict for a member of his or her immediate family or any other close\nrelative. Examples of conflict of interest situations include, but are not limited to, the following:\n any significant ownership interest in any supplier or customer;\n any consulting or employment relationship with any supplier or customer;\n the receipt of any money, non-nominal gifts or excessive entertainment from any entity\nwith which the Company has current or prospective business dealings;\n selling anything to the Company or buying anything from the Company, except on the\nsame terms and conditions as comparable officers or directors are permitted to so\npurchase or sell;\n any other financial transaction, arrangement or relationship (including any indebtedness\nor guarantee of indebtedness) involving the Company;\n when an individual subject to the Code receives improper personal benefits as a result of\nhis or her position with the Company;\n when an individual subject to the Code has other duties, responsibilities or obligations\nthat run counter to his or her duty to the Company; and\n any other circumstance, event, relationship or situation in which the personal interest of a\nperson subject to this Code interferes — or even appears to interfere — with the interests\nof the Company as a whole.\nIII.DISCLOSURE\nThe disclosures the Company makes to the SEC are the essential source of information about the\nCompany for regulators and investors—there can be no questions about the duty to make them fairly,\nDOC ID - 27996711.7 2\naccurately and timely. Accordingly, the Company strives to ensure that the contents of and the disclosures\nin the reports and documents that the Company files with the SEC and other public communications shall\nbe full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable in accordance with applicable disclosure standards,\nincluding standards of materiality, where appropriate. Each person must:\n not knowingly misrepresent, or cause others to misrepresent, facts about the Company to others,\nwhether within or outside the Company, including to the Company's independent registered\npublic accountants, governmental regulators, self-regulating organizations and other\ngovernmental officials, as appropriate; and\n in relation to his or her area of responsibility, properly review and critically analyze proposed\ndisclosure for accuracy and completeness.\nIn addition to the foregoing, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of the\nCompany and each subsidiary of the Company (or persons performing similar functions), and each other\nperson that typically is involved in the financial reporting of the Company must familiarize himself or\nherself with the disclosure requirements applicable to the Company as well as the business and financial\noperations of the Company.\nEach person must promptly bring to the attention of the Chairman of the Board any information\nhe or she may have concerning (a) significant deficiencies in the design or operation of internal and/or\ndisclosure controls that could adversely affect the Company's ability to record, process, summarize and\nreport financial data or (b) any fraud that involves management or other employees who have a significant\nrole in the Company's financial reporting, disclosures or internal controls.\nIV.COMPLIANCE\nIt is the Company's obligation and policy to comply with all applicable governmental laws, rules\nand regulations. All directors, officers and employees of the Company are expected to understand,\nrespect and comply with all of the laws, regulations, policies and procedures that apply to them in their\npositions with the Company. Employees are responsible for talking to their supervisors to determine\nwhich laws, regulations and Company policies apply to their position and what training is necessary to\nunderstand and comply with them.\nDirectors, officers and employees are directed to specify policies and procedures available to\npersons they supervise.\nV.INSIDER INFORMATION AND SECURITIES TRADING\nThe Company's directors, officers or employees who have access to material, non-public\ninformation are not permitted to use that information for share trading purposes or for any purpose\nunrelated to the Company's business. It is also against the law to trade or to \"tip\" others who might make\nan investment decision based on inside company information.
