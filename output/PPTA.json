(Nasdaq: PPTA / TSX: PPTA) (“Perpetua Resources” or “Perpetua” or the “Company”) announced today that its unaudited condensed consolidated financial results for the period ended September 30, 2024 were filed. For details, please see the Company’s filings available on EDGAR and SEDAR.\n\nPerpetua Resources’ vision is to provide the U.S. with a domestic source of the critical mineral antimony, develop one of the largest and highest-grade open pit gold mines in the country and restore an abandoned brownfield site. Perpetua Resources is focused on advancing the permitting for the Stibnite Gold Project (“Stibnite Gold Project” or “Project”) through the National Environmental Policy Act (“NEPA”) process and construction readiness for the Project. \n\n**Third Quarter 2024 and Recent Highlights:**\n\n  * Zero lost time incidents or reportable environmental spills.\n\n  * United States Forest Service (“USFS”) published the Final Environmental Impact Statement (“FEIS”) and issued a Draft Record of Decision (“DROD”) for the Stibnite Gold Project.\n\n  * The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service issued its Final Biological Opinion on September 6, 2024 and the National Marine Fisheries Service issued its Final Biological Opinion on October 7, 2024.\n\n  * Engaged RBC Capital Markets and Endeavour Financial to assist with the evaluation of potential strategic and financing opportunities and to support the Company’s application process in connection with the Export-Import Bank of the United States (“U.S. EXIM”) $1.8 billion Letter of Interest received in April 2024. \n\n\n\n\n“Perpetua Resources continued to gain momentum in the third quarter of 2024 and reached another major milestone with the U.S. Forest Service publishing a Draft Record of Decision and Final Environmental Impact Statement for the Stibnite Gold Project,” said Jon Cherry, President and CEO of Perpetua Resources. “We were excited to see the Draft Record of Decision outline the decision to authorize the project plan and look forward to delivering a win-win-win for Idaho, the environment, and America’s national security.”\n\n**Permitting and Construction Readiness Activities Update:**\n\nOn September 6, 2024, the USFS published the FEIS and a DROD with respect to the Project. The publication of the DROD commenced a 45-day pre-decisional objection period, which expired on October 21, 2024. The objection period will be followed by another 45-day resolution period prior to the publication of the final Record of Decision (“ROD”). The resolution period is expected to expire on or about December 5, 2024, which may be extended by the USFS in its sole discretion. Based on the USFS schedule published in October 2024, the ROD is anticipated to be published by the end of 2024. Perpetua also continued to advance work on several ancillary permits which are being progressed in parallel with the NEPA process. Construction Readiness activities during the third quarter focused on basic, value and detailed engineering for the Project.\n\nFor further information about Perpetua Resources Corp., please contact: \n\n**Chris Fogg**\n\nInvestor Relations Manager \n\nchris.fogg@perpetuacorp.us \n\nInfo@perpetuacorp.us \n\n**Mckinsey Lyon**\n\nVice President External Affairs \n\nmedia@perpetua.us \n\nWebsite: www.perpetuaresources.com \n\n**About Perpetua Resources and the Stibnite Gold Project**\n\nPerpetua Resources Corp., through its wholly owned subsidiaries, is focused on the exploration, site restoration and redevelopment of gold-antimony-silver deposits in the Stibnite-Yellow Pine district of central Idaho that are encompassed by the Stibnite Gold Project.

Antimony trisulfide from Stibnite is the only known domestic source of antimony that can meet U.S. defense needs for many small arms, munitions, and missile types. In addition to the company’s commitments to transparency, accountability, environmental stewardship, safety and community engagement, Perpetua Resources adopted formal ESG commitments which can be found [here](https://www.investors.perpetuaresources.com/esg?_ga=2.59546285.1234279038.1645199008-1808769047.1613477518). \n\n**Forward-Looking Information and Cautionary Note**\n\n _Investors should be aware that the publication by the USFS of the FEIS and the draft ROD, and the publication of the USFS permitting schedule, does not indicate any commitments on the part of the USFS with regard to the content or timing of a final ROD. The draft ROD is subject to a 45-day objection period, followed by a 45-day resolution period, which may be extended by the USFS in its sole discretion. Furthermore, the USFS is not bound by the permitting schedule and anticipated milestones may be delayed materially or not be satisfied. In addition, investors should be aware that the U.S. EXIM Letter of Interest is non-binding and conditional, and does not represent a financing commitment. A funding commitment is conditional upon completing the application, due diligence and underwriting process and receiving all required Project approvals. Additionally, funding under the DPA TIA is available only for the specified costs related to permitting, environmental baseline data monitoring, environmental and technical studies, and advancing construction readiness and is not available to fund the Company’s costs under its Administrative Settlement and Order on Consent obligations and certain corporate expenses._\n\n_Statements contained in this news release that are not historical facts are \"forward-looking information\" or \"forward-looking statements\" (collectively, \"Forward-Looking Information\") within the meaning of applicable Canadian securities legislation and the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-Looking Information includes, but is not limited to, disclosure regarding the content and timing of final ROD and other actions to be taken by the Department of Defense, USFS, the State of Idaho and other government agencies and regulatory bodies; the timing and resolution of any objection to the FEIS or draft ROD; our plans to submit a financing application to U.S. EXIM; the prospects of successfully securing financing from U.S. EXIM or from other sources on acceptable terms, or at all; the expected timing of, and benefits to the Stibnite Gold Project of, securing such financing from U.S. EXIM; anticipated approval of reimbursement requests under the definitized agreement; environmental clean up actions by us and our contractors; that the Stibnite Gold Project results in the outcomes we expected, including our reserves and resources and anticipated production and costs; our ability to comply with and obtain permits related to the Stibnite Gold Project; our ability to successfully implement and fund the Project and the occurrence of the expected benefits from the Project, including creation of jobs and environmental benefits; and our and Ambri Inc.'s ability to perform under the supply agreement. In certain cases, Forward-Looking Information can be identified by the use of words and phrases or variations of such words and phrases or statements such as \"anticipate\", \"expect\" \"plan\", \"likely\", \"believe\", \"intend\", \"forecast\", \"project\", \"estimate\", \"potential\", \"could\", \"may\", \"will\", \"would\" or \"should\". In preparing the Forward-Looking Information in this news release, Perpetua Resources has applied several material assumptions, including, but not limited to, assumptions that the public review process of the final ROD will proceed in a timely manner and as expected, and that the final ROD will be published based on the USFS schedule; that we will be able to successfully complete the U.S. EXIM application process and secure financing, through U.S. EXIM or other sources to finance permitting, pre-construction and construction of the Project; that the current exploration, development, environmental and other objectives concerning the Stibnite Gold Project can be achieved and that its other corporate activities will proceed as expected;_ _that the formal review process under the NEPA (including any joint review process involving the USFS, the State of Idaho and other agencies and regulatory bodies) will proceed in a timely manner and as expected; that general business and economic conditions will not change in a materially adverse manner and that permitting and operations costs will not materially increase; and that we will be able to discharge our liabilities as they become due and continue as a going concern. Forward-Looking Information are based on certain material assumptions and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors which may cause the actual results, performance or achievements of Perpetua Resources to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by the Forward-Looking Information. Such risks and other factors include, among other things, risks related to unforeseen delays in the review and permitting process; risks related to opposition to the Project; risks related to increased or unexpected costs in operations or the permitting process; risks that necessary financing will be unavailable when needed on acceptable terms, or at all; risks related to the outcome of litigation and potential for delay of the Project, as well as those factors discussed in Perpetua Resources' public filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\") and its Canadian disclosure record. Although Perpetua Resources has attempted to identify important factors that could affect Perpetua Resources and may cause actual actions, events or results to differ materially from those described in Forward-Looking Information, there may be other factors that cause actions, events or results not to be as anticipated, estimated or intended. There can be no assurance that Forward-Looking Information will prove to be accurate, as actual results and future events could differ materially from those anticipated in such statements. Accordingly, readers should not place undue reliance on Forward-Looking Information.

Statements concerning mineral resource and mineral reserve estimates may also constitute Forward-Looking Information to the extent that they involve estimates of the mineralization that may be\nencountered if the Project is developed. In preparing the Forward-Looking Information herein, the Company has applied several material assumptions, including, but not limited to, assumptions that the full amount of the\nDefense Production Act award will be funded on the expected timeline; that the review process under the NEPA (including any joint review process involving the USFS, the State of Idaho and other agencies and regulatory\nbodies) as well as the FEIS will proceed in a timely manner and as expected; that we will be able to obtain sufficient funding to finance permitting, pre-construction and construction of the Project and that all requisite\ninformation will be available in a timely manner; the exchange rates for the U.S. and Canadian currencies will be consistent with the Company’s expectations; that the current exploration, development, environmental and other\nobjectives concerning the Project can be achieved and that its other corporate activities will proceed as expected; that the current price and demand for gold and antimony will be sustained or will improve; that general\nbusiness and economic conditions will not change in a materially adverse manner and that all necessary governmental approvals for planned activities on the Project will be obtained in a timely manner and on acceptable\nterms; that permitting and operations costs will not materially increase; the continuity of the price of gold and other metals, economic and political conditions and operations; and the assumptions set out in the FS. Forward-\nLooking Information involves known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors which may cause the actual results, performance or achievements of the Company to be materially different from any future results,\nperformance or achievements expressed or implied by the Forward-Looking Information. Such risks and other factors include, among others, the industry-wide risks and project-specific risks identified in the FS; operations and\ncontractual obligations; changes in exploration programs based upon results of exploration; changes in estimated mineral reserves or mineral resources; future prices of metals and minerals; availability of personnel and\nequipment; equipment failure; accidents, effects of weather and other natural phenomena and other risks associated with the mineral exploration industry; environmental risks, including environmental matters under US federal\nand Idaho rules and regulations; impact of environmental remediation requirements and the terms of existing and potential consent decrees on the Company’s planned exploration and development activities on the Project;\ncertainty of mineral title; community relations; delays in obtaining governmental approvals or financing; the Company’s dependence on one mineral project; the nature of mineral exploration and mining and the uncertain\ncommercial viability; the Company’s lack of operating revenues; governmental regulations and the ability to obtain necessary licenses and permits; risks related to prior unregistered agreements, transfers or claims and other\ndefects in title to mineral projects; currency fluctuations; changes in environmental laws and regulations and changes in the application of standards pursuant to existing laws and regulations; risks related to dependence on key\npersonnel; risks to employee health and safety and a slowdown or temporary suspension of operations in geographic locations impacted by an outbreak of disease; estimates used in budgeting and financial statements\nproving to be incorrect; risks related to unforeseen delays in the review process including availability of personnel from the USFS, State of Idaho and other stated, federal and local agencies and regulatory bodies (including, but\nnot limited to, future US government shutdowns); risks related to opposition to the Project; risks related to increased or unexpected costs in operations or the permitting process; risks that necessary financing will be unavailable\nwhen needed on acceptable terms, or at all; risks related to the outcome of litigation and potential for delay of the Project, as well as those factors discussed in the Company’s public disclosure record. Although the Company\nhas attempted to identify important factors that could affect the Company and may cause actual actions, events or results to differ materially from those described in Forward-Looking Information, there may be other factors that\ncause actions, events or results not to be as anticipated, estimated or intended. There can be no assurance that Forward-Looking Information will prove to be accurate, as actual results and future events could differ materially\nfrom those anticipated in such statements. Because it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors, this list cannot be considered a complete set of all potential risks or uncertainties. Accordingly, readers should not place\nundue reliance on Forward-Looking Information. For further information on these and other risks and uncertainties that may affect the Company’s business and liquidity, see the “Risk Factors” and “Management’s Discussion and\nAnalysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” sections of the Company’s filings with the SEC, are available at www.sec.gov and with the Canadian securities regulators, which are available at www.sedar.com. Except\nas required by law, the Company expressly disclaims any obligation to update the Forward-Looking Information herein. 2\nCAUTIONARY NOTE & TECHNICAL DISCLOSURE\nThe presentation has been prepared by Perpetua Resources management and does not represent a recommendation to buy or sell these securities. Investors should always consult their investment advisors prior to\nmaking any investment decisions. All references to “dollars” or “$” shall mean United States dollars unless otherwise specified.\nThe material scientific and technical information in respect of the Stibnite Gold Project in this presentation, unless otherwise indicated, is based upon information contained in the technical report titled “Stibnite\nGold Project, Feasibility Study Technical Report, Valley County, Idaho” dated effective December 22, 2020 and issued January 27, 2021 (the “FS” or “2020 Feasibility Study”). The 2020 Feasibility Study was\nprepared in accordance with National Instrument 43-101 – Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects (“NI 43-101”). NI 43-101 is a rule developed by the Canadian Securities Administrators that establishes\nstandards for all public disclosure an issuer makes of scientific and technical information concerning mineral projects. These standards differ from the mining property disclosure rules specified in Subpart 1300 of\nRegulation S-K under the United States Securities Act of 1933 (“Subpart 1300”) promulgated by the SEC. Accordingly, information concerning mineral deposits from the 2020 Feasibility Study set forth herein may\nnot be comparable with information made public by companies that report in accordance with U.S. standards.\nThe Company has issued its inaugural Technical Report Summary (the “TRS”), dated as of December 31, 2021, and amended as of June 6, 2022, developed for the Stibnite Gold Project in accordance with the\nmining property disclosure rules specified in Subpart 1300 promulgated by the SEC. The TRS summarizes, in accordance with the mining property disclosure rules specified in Subpart 1300, the FS, which was\ncompleted under NI 43-101, with the following notable differences between the FS and the TRS:\n• The TRS Mineral Resource estimates were developed based on a gold price of $1,500/oz versus the $1,250/oz gold price assumed for the FS. The change in gold price results from higher trailing average gold\nprices at the date of preparation for the respective reports.\n• The Measured Mineral Resources in the FS were reclassified to Indicated Mineral Resources in the TRS due to differences in Subpart 1300 versus NI 43-101 Mineral Resources classification guidelines.\n• The Proven Mineral Reserves from the FS were reclassified as Probable Mineral Reserves for the TRS resulting from the reclassification of the Measured Mineral Resources to Indicated Mineral Resources due to\ndifferences in Subpart 1300 versus NI 43-101 Mineral Resources classification guidelines.\n• The TRS is classified as a Preliminary Feasibility level study whereas the FS was classified as a Feasibility level study. This change was driven by the Subpart 1300 requirement that a compliant Feasibility level TRS\ninclude a capital cost contingency allowance no greater than 10%, whereas the initial capital cost estimate for the FS included a more conservative allowance at approximately 15%.\nAll other technical analyses, design information, capital and operating cost information, economic analyses, permitting and legal assumptions, conclusions and recommendations are consistent between the TRS\nand the FS. Readers are encouraged to read the TRS and the Company’s Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on January 3, 2021, as amended by the Company’s Current Report on Form 8-K/A filed with\nthe SEC on June 8, 2022, which are available under the Company’s profile on EDGAR. Readers are also encouraged to read the FS, which is available on the Company’s website and under the Company’s profile on\nSEDAR, for detailed information concerning the Project. See also “Regulatory Information” at the end of this presentation.\nThis presentation contains certain mineral reserve, production, costs, valuation, capitalization, trading data and similar information regarding certain other mineral projects and peer companies. Such data was\nderived from publicly available reports by such companies and other trade and industry sources. While the company believes such sources to be reliable, the company has not independently verified such\ninformation. Furthermore, information regarding mineral reserves, production and similar mineral project information for each company is based on estimates, assumptions and reporting standards applied to\navailable data by each company and their reserve engineers in their respective reports, which may differ materially from the estimates, assumptions and reporting standards applied by us, and therefore may not be\ncomparable among the companies presented. As a result, comparisons of such data made in this presentation, while considered reasonable at the time they are made, are subject to a variety of risks and\nuncertainties which could cause actual events or results of each company to differ materially from those reflected and there can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve similar results at similar stages of\ndevelopment.\nInvestors should be aware that the publication of the SDEIS and the permitting schedule, and the identification by the USFS of the Modified Mine Plan as the Preferred Alternative in the SDEIS, does not indicate any\ncommitments on the part of the USFS with regard to the content or timing of a final decision. In developing the FEIS, the next phase of the NEPA planning process, the USFS may select various actions based on the\nModified Mine Plan or each of the alternatives analyzed in the SDEIS. Furthermore, the USFS is not bound by the permitting schedule and anticipated milestones may be delayed materially or not be satisfied.\nInvestors should be aware that the Letter of Interest from US EXIM is non-binding and conditional, and does not represent a financing commitment. A funding commitment is conditional upon completing the\napplication, due diligence and underwriting process and receiving all required Project approvals. Additionally, full funding under the modified DPA TIA is subject to negotiation of the additional in-scope work and\nfinal availability of funds. Until the agreement is amended, the additional $34.6 million in funding will be unavailable. While Perpetua expects to enter into the modification in the second quarter of 2024, there is no\nassurance that we will be able to finalize the amendment on the expected timeline or at all. Further, funding under the DPA TIA is available only for the specified costs related to permitting, environmental baseline\ndata monitoring, environmental and technical studies, and advancing construction readiness and is not available to fund the Company’s costs under its Administrative Settlement and Order on Consent obligations\n3\nand certain corporate expenses.\nWHY PERPETUA RESOURCES?\n✓ Redeveloping one of largest, highest grade and\nlowest cost gold projects in the U.S.*\n✓ Superior project economics with ~15 year\nreserve life and <3 year payback period *\n✓ Establishing a national strategic asset with a\ncritical mineral essential for national defense and\nthe clean energy transition\n✓ Located in stable mining jurisdiction with Idaho\ncommunity and political support\n✓ Sustainable approach to restoring the\nenvironment, improving a legacy, and creating\nvalue for all stakeholders\n✓ Attractive valuation with significant near-term\ncatalysts\n*Based on the 2020 Feasibility Study (“FS”) which is intended to be read as a whole and sections should not be read or relied upon out of context.

Readers are encouraged to read the TRS and the Company’s Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on January 3, 2021, as amended by the Company’s Current Report on Form 8-\nK/A filed with the SEC on June 8, 2022, which are available under the Company’s profile on EDGAR. Readers also are encouraged to read the FS, which is available under the Company’s profile on SEDAR and\non the Company’s website, for detailed information concerning the Project. All disclosure contained in this presentation regarding the mineral reserves and mineral resource estimates and economic analysis on\nthe property is fully qualified by the full disclosure contained in the FS and the TRS.\nInformation of a scientific or technical nature in this presentation has been approved by Christopher Dail, AIPG CPG #10596, Exploration Manager for Perpetua Resources Idaho, Inc. and a qualified person (as\ndefined in NI 43-101 and as defined in Subpart 1300).\nAll mineral resources have been estimated in accordance with CIM definitions, with notable differences to Subpart 1300 identified. Mineral resources are reported in relation to a conceptual pit shell to\ndemonstrate potential for economic viability, as required under NI 43-101; mineralization lying outside of these pit shells is not reported as a mineral resource. Mineral resources are not mineral reserves and do\nnot have demonstrated economic viability. Mineral resource estimates include inferred mineral resources that are considered too speculative geologically to have economic considerations applied to them that\nwould enable them to be categorized as mineral reserves. It is reasonably expected that the majority of inferred mineral resources could be upgraded to indicated mineral resources.\nThe mineral resources and mineral reserves at the Stibnite Gold Project are contained within areas that have seen historic disturbance resulting from prior mining activities. In order for the Company to advance\nits interests at the Stibnite Gold Project, the Project will be subject to a number of federal, state and local laws and regulations and will require permits to conduct its activities.\nSee also “Cautionary Note” at the beginning of this presentation.\nOTHER\nCertain monetary amounts, percentages and other figures included in this presentation have been subject to rounding adjustments. Certain other amounts that appear in this presentation may not sum due to\nrounding.\n36\nNON-GAAP MEASURES\nNON-GAAP MEASURES\nTo provide investors with additional information in connection with our results as determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”), we disclose certain\nprojected non-GAAP financial measures. The projected non-GAAP financial measures include Cash Costs, EBITDA, All-in Sustaining Costs and After-Tax Free Cash Flow estimates and related calculations as\npublished in the Company’s 2020 Feasibility Study.\n1. Cash Costs and All-in Sustaining Costs (AISC)\nCash Costs is a non-GAAP metric defined as the sum of cash operating costs (mining, processing, G&A), by-product credits, refining and transportation costs and royalties and is used to evaluate the\nCompany’s future operating performance and provide visibility into the economics of our future mining operations.\nAll-in Sustaining Costs (AISC) is a non-GAAP metric defined as the sum of cash costs (from above), sustaining capital costs and non-revenue-based taxes (i.e. property tax) and is used to evaluate the\nCompany’s future operating performance and the ability to generate cash flow from operations.\n2. EBITDA\nEarnings before interest, taxes and depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) is a non-GAAP metric is generated from adding back taxes, interest, depreciation to net income and is used to evaluate the\nCompany’s future operating performance.\n3. After-Tax Free Cash Flow (FCF)\nAfter-Tax Free Cash Flow (FCF) is a non-GAAP metric and is defined as net cash provided from operating activities less capital expenditures and less taxes and is used to evaluate the Company’s future\noperating performance and ability to generate excess cash flow but it does not entirely represent cash available for discretionary expenditures due to the fact that the measure does not deduct the payments\nrequired for debt service and other items.\nWe believe the projected non-GAAP financial measures included in this presentation provide readers with additional meaningful comparisons between the Company’s 2020 Feasibility Study and its peer\ncompanies. These projected non-GAAP financial measures are not historical measures of financial performance and are not presented in accordance with GAAP. They may exclude items that will be significant in\nunderstanding and assessing our financial results. Therefore, these measures should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative or superior to GAAP measures. You should be aware that our presentation of\nthese measures may not be comparable to similarly-titled measures used by other companies. The projected non-GAAP measures included in this presentation cannot be reconciled to comparable GAAP\nmeasures without unreasonable effort.\nThe non-GAAP financial measures included in this presentation are projections based on the 2020 Feasibility Study. They are forward-looking statements and remain subject to the risks and uncertainties set forth\nin the section titled “Forward-Looking Statements” at the beginning of this presentation.\nSee the 2020 Feasibility Study for additional information regarding the non-GAAP financial measures included in this presentation. The economic model described in the 2020 Feasibility Study is not a true cash\nflow model as defined by financial accounting standards but rather a representation of Project economics at a level of detail appropriate for a feasibility study level of engineering and design.\n37"

Forward-\nLooking Information involves known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors which may cause the actual results, performance or achievements of the Company to be materially different from any future results,\nperformance or achievements expressed or implied by the Forward-Looking Information. Such risks and other factors include, among others, the industry-wide risks and project-specific risks identified in the FS; operations and\ncontractual obligations; changes in exploration programs based upon results of exploration; changes in estimated mineral reserves or mineral resources; future prices of metals and minerals; availability of personnel and\nequipment; equipment failure; accidents, effects of weather and other natural phenomena and other risks associated with the mineral exploration industry; environmental risks, including environmental matters under US federal\nand Idaho rules and regulations; impact of environmental remediation requirements and the terms of existing and potential consent decrees on the Company’s planned exploration and development activities on the Project;\ncertainty of mineral title; community relations; delays in obtaining governmental approvals or financing; the Company’s dependence on one mineral project; the nature of mineral exploration and mining and the uncertain\ncommercial viability; the Company’s lack of operating revenues; governmental regulations and the ability to obtain necessary licenses and permits; risks related to prior unregistered agreements, transfers or claims and other\ndefects in title to mineral projects; currency fluctuations; changes in environmental laws and regulations and changes in the application of standards pursuant to existing laws and regulations; risks related to dependence on key\npersonnel; risks to employee health and safety and a slowdown or temporary suspension of operations in geographic locations impacted by an outbreak of disease; estimates used in budgeting and financial statements\nproving to be incorrect; risks related to unforeseen delays in the review process including availability of personnel from the USFS, State of Idaho and other stated, federal and local agencies and regulatory bodies (including, but\nnot limited to, future US government shutdowns); risks related to opposition to the Project; risks related to increased or unexpected costs in operations or the permitting process; risks that necessary financing will be unavailable\nwhen needed on acceptable terms, or at all; risks related to the outcome of litigation and potential for delay of the Project, as well as those factors discussed in the Company’s public disclosure record. Although the Company\nhas attempted to identify important factors that could affect the Company and may cause actual actions, events or results to differ materially from those described in Forward-Looking Information, there may be other factors that\ncause actions, events or results not to be as anticipated, estimated or intended. There can be no assurance that Forward-Looking Information will prove to be accurate, as actual results and future events could differ materially\nfrom those anticipated in such statements. Because it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors, this list cannot be considered a complete set of all potential risks or uncertainties. Accordingly, readers should not place\nundue reliance on Forward-Looking Information. For further information on these and other risks and uncertainties that may affect the Company’s business and liquidity, see the “Risk Factors” and “Management’s Discussion and\nAnalysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” sections of the Company’s filings with the SEC, are available at www.sec.gov and with the Canadian securities regulators, which are available at www.sedar.com. Except\nas required by law, the Company expressly disclaims any obligation to update the Forward-Looking Information herein. 2\nCAUTIONARY NOTE & TECHNICAL DISCLOSURE\nThe presentation has been prepared by Perpetua Resources management and does not represent a recommendation to buy or sell these securities. Investors should always consult their investment advisors prior to\nmaking any investment decisions. All references to “dollars” or “$” shall mean United States dollars unless otherwise specified.\nThe material scientific and technical information in respect of the Stibnite Gold Project in this presentation, unless otherwise indicated, is based upon information contained in the technical report titled “Stibnite\nGold Project, Feasibility Study Technical Report, Valley County, Idaho” dated effective December 22, 2020 and issued January 27, 2021 (the “FS” or “2020 Feasibility Study”). The 2020 Feasibility Study was\nprepared in accordance with National Instrument 43-101 – Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects (“NI 43-101”). NI 43-101 is a rule developed by the Canadian Securities Administrators that establishes\nstandards for all public disclosure an issuer makes of scientific and technical information concerning mineral projects. These standards differ from the mining property disclosure rules specified in Subpart 1300 of\nRegulation S-K under the United States Securities Act of 1933 (“Subpart 1300”) promulgated by the SEC. Accordingly, information concerning mineral deposits from the 2020 Feasibility Study set forth herein may\nnot be comparable with information made public by companies that report in accordance with U.S. standards.\nThe Company has issued its inaugural Technical Report Summary (the “TRS”), dated as of December 31, 2021, and amended as of June 6, 2022, developed for the Stibnite Gold Project in accordance with the\nmining property disclosure rules specified in Subpart 1300 promulgated by the SEC. The TRS summarizes, in accordance with the mining property disclosure rules specified in Subpart 1300, the FS, which was\ncompleted under NI 43-101, with the following notable differences between the FS and the TRS:\n• The TRS Mineral Resource estimates were developed based on a gold price of $1,500/oz versus the $1,250/oz gold price assumed for the FS. The change in gold price results from higher trailing average gold\nprices at the date of preparation for the respective reports.\n• The Measured Mineral Resources in the FS were reclassified to Indicated Mineral Resources in the TRS due to differences in Subpart 1300 versus NI 43-101 Mineral Resources classification guidelines.\n• The Proven Mineral Reserves from the FS were reclassified as Probable Mineral Reserves for the TRS resulting from the reclassification of the Measured Mineral Resources to Indicated Mineral Resources due to\ndifferences in Subpart 1300 versus NI 43-101 Mineral Resources classification guidelines.\n• The TRS is classified as a Preliminary Feasibility level study whereas the FS was classified as a Feasibility level study. This change was driven by the Subpart 1300 requirement that a compliant Feasibility level TRS\ninclude a capital cost contingency allowance no greater than 10%, whereas the initial capital cost estimate for the FS included a more conservative allowance at approximately 15%.\nAll other technical analyses, design information, capital and operating cost information, economic analyses, permitting and legal assumptions, conclusions and recommendations are consistent between the TRS\nand the FS. Readers are encouraged to read the TRS and the Company’s Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on January 3, 2021, as amended by the Company’s Current Report on Form 8-K/A filed with\nthe SEC on June 8, 2022, which are available under the Company’s profile on EDGAR. Readers are also encouraged to read the FS, which is available on the Company’s website and under the Company’s profile on\nSEDAR, for detailed information concerning the Project. See also “Regulatory Information” at the end of this presentation.\nThis presentation contains certain mineral reserve, production, costs, valuation, capitalization, trading data and similar information regarding certain other mineral projects and peer companies. Such data was\nderived from publicly available reports by such companies and other trade and industry sources. While the company believes such sources to be reliable, the company has not independently verified such\ninformation. Furthermore, information regarding mineral reserves, production and similar mineral project information for each company is based on estimates, assumptions and reporting standards applied to\navailable data by each company and their reserve engineers in their respective reports, which may differ materially from the estimates, assumptions and reporting standards applied by us, and therefore may not be\ncomparable among the companies presented. As a result, comparisons of such data made in this presentation, while considered reasonable at the time they are made, are subject to a variety of risks and\nuncertainties which could cause actual events or results of each company to differ materially from those reflected and there can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve similar results at similar stages of\ndevelopment.\nInvestors should be aware that the publication of the SDEIS and the permitting schedule, and the identification by the USFS of the Modified Mine Plan as the Preferred Alternative in the SDEIS, does not indicate any\ncommitments on the part of the USFS with regard to the content or timing of a final decision. In developing the FEIS, the next phase of the NEPA planning process, the USFS may select various actions based on the\nModified Mine Plan or each of the alternatives analyzed in the SDEIS. Furthermore, the USFS is not bound by the permitting schedule and anticipated milestones may be delayed materially or not be satisfied.\nInvestors should be aware that the Letter of Interest from US EXIM is non-binding and conditional, and does not represent a financing commitment. A funding commitment is conditional upon completing the\napplication, due diligence and underwriting process and receiving all required Project approvals. Additionally, full funding under the modified DPA TIA is subject to negotiation of the additional in-scope work and\nfinal availability of funds. Until the agreement is amended, the additional $34.6 million in funding will be unavailable. While Perpetua expects to enter into the modification in the second quarter of 2024, there is no\nassurance that we will be able to finalize the amendment on the expected timeline or at all. Further, funding under the DPA TIA is available only for the specified costs related to permitting, environmental baseline\ndata monitoring, environmental and technical studies, and advancing construction readiness and is not available to fund the Company’s costs under its Administrative Settlement and Order on Consent obligations\n3\nand certain corporate expenses.\nWHY PERPETUA RESOURCES?\n✓ Redeveloping one of largest, highest grade and\n*\nlowest cost gold projects in the U.S.\n✓ Superior project economics with ~15 year\nreserve life and <3 year payback period *\n✓ Establishing a national strategic asset with a\ncritical mineral essential for national defense and\nthe clean energy transition\n✓ Located in stable mining jurisdiction with Idaho\ncommunity and political support\n✓ Sustainable approach to restoring the\nenvironment, improving a legacy, and creating\nvalue for all stakeholders\n✓ Attractive valuation with significant near-term\ncatalysts\n*Based on the 2020 Feasibility Study (“FS”) which is intended to be read as a whole and sections should not be read or relied upon out of context.

The Mineral Reserves\nare contained within the Mineral Resources.\n2 Mineral Reserves were calculated using an Au price of $1600/oz and Sb price of $3.50/lb and variable cut off grade of 0.39-0.49 g/t Au. The Proven Mineral Reserves from the 2020 FS were reclassified as Probable Mineral Reserves for the TRS.\n3 Mineral Resources were calculated using a $1250/oz Au price and sulfide cut off grade of 0.45 g/t Au and oxide COG of 0.4 g/t Au based on the 2020 Feasibility Study.Based on a gold price of $1,500/oz in the TRS, Mineral Resources\nincreased to 6.3Mozs @1.33 g/t using a sulfide cut off grade of 0.40 g/t Au and oxide cut off grade of 0.35 g/tAu. The Measured Mineral Resources from the 2020 FS were reclassified to Indicated Mineral Resources in the TRS due to differences 24\nin the S-K 1300 versus NI 43-101 Mineral Resources classification guidelines.\nEXPLORATION UPSIDE*\nEXPANSIVE LAND PACKAGE\nEXISTING DEPOSITS:\n• Northeast of Yellow Pine Deposit\n• Below Hangar Flats pit & Old Defense\nMinerals Exploration Act (DMEA) working area\n• West End along strike and at depth\nPRIORITY EXPLORATION TARGETS:\n• High grade targets (Garnet, Scout, Upper\nMidnight)\n• Bulk tonnage targets (Cinnamid-Ridgetop,\nSaddle-Fern, Rabbit)\n• Undefined airborne targets (Mule, Salt &\nPepper, Blow-out)\nPIPELINE OF ANTIMONY-RICH TARGETS\n* Some of the prospects are conceptual in nature, there has been insufficient exploration to define a\nmineral resource and it is uncertain if further exploration will result in the target being delineated as a\nmineral resource.

(tailings storage facility and closure) with Tierra Group International, Ltd.\nThe TRS was compiled by M3 in compliance with Subpart 1300 promulgated by the SEC under the direction of Independent Qualified Persons (as defined in Subpart 1300) (“QPs”). QPs for the TRS include:\nRichard Zimmerman, SME-RM (onsite and offsite infrastructure, cost estimating, mineral processing, financial modeling) with M3; Garth Kirkham, P.Geo.

(hydrometallurgy) with Hydromet WA (Pty) Ltd.; Scott Rosenthal P.E. (mine planning and mineral reserves) with\nValue Consulting, Inc.; and Peter Kowalewski, P.E. (tailings storage facility and closure) with Tierra Group International, Ltd.\nThe material scientific and technical information in respect of the Project in this presentation, unless otherwise indicated, is based upon information contained in the FS, with notable differences between the FS\nand the TRS identified. Readers are encouraged to read the TRS and the Company’s Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on January 3, 2021, as amended by the Company’s Current Report on Form 8-\nK/A filed with the SEC on June 8, 2022, which are available under the Company’s profile on EDGAR. Readers also are encouraged to read the FS, which is available under the Company’s profile on SEDAR and\non the Company’s website, for detailed information concerning the Project. All disclosure contained in this presentation regarding the mineral reserves and mineral resource estimates and economic analysis on\nthe property is fully qualified by the full disclosure contained in the FS and the TRS.\nInformation of a scientific or technical nature in this presentation has been approved by Christopher Dail, AIPG CPG #10596, Exploration Manager for Perpetua Resources Idaho, Inc. and a qualified person (as\ndefined in NI 43-101 and as defined in Subpart 1300).\nAll mineral resources have been estimated in accordance with CIM definitions, with notable differences to Subpart 1300 identified. Mineral resources are reported in relation to a conceptual pit shell to\ndemonstrate potential for economic viability, as required under NI 43-101; mineralization lying outside of these pit shells is not reported as a mineral resource. Mineral resources are not mineral reserves and do\nnot have demonstrated economic viability. Mineral resource estimates include inferred mineral resources that are considered too speculative geologically to have economic considerations applied to them that\nwould enable them to be categorized as mineral reserves. It is reasonably expected that the majority of inferred mineral resources could be upgraded to indicated mineral resources.\nThe mineral resources and mineral reserves at the Stibnite Gold Project are contained within areas that have seen historic disturbance resulting from prior mining activities. In order for the Company to advance\nits interests at the Stibnite Gold Project, the Project will be subject to a number of federal, state and local laws and regulations and will require permits to conduct its activities.\nSee also “Cautionary Note” at the beginning of this presentation.\nOTHER\nCertain monetary amounts, percentages and other figures included in this presentation have been subject to rounding adjustments. Certain other amounts that appear in this presentation may not sum due to\nrounding.\n32\nNON-GAAP MEASURES\nNON-GAAP MEASURES\nTo provide investors with additional information in connection with our results as determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”), we disclose certain\nprojected non-GAAP financial measures. The projected non-GAAP financial measures include Cash Costs, EBITDA, All-in Sustaining Costs and After-Tax Free Cash Flow estimates and related calculations as\npublished in the Company’s 2020 Feasibility Study.\n1. Cash Costs and All-in Sustaining Costs (AISC)\nCash Costs is a non-GAAP metric defined as the sum of cash operating costs (mining, processing, G&A), by-product credits, refining and transportation costs and royalties and is used to evaluate the\nCompany’s future operating performance and provide visibility into the economics of our future mining operations.\nAll-in Sustaining Costs (AISC) is a non-GAAP metric defined as the sum of cash costs (from above), sustaining capital costs and non-revenue-based taxes (i.e. property tax) and is used to evaluate the\nCompany’s future operating performance and the ability to generate cash flow from operations.\n2. EBITDA\nEarnings before interest, taxes and depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) is a non-GAAP metric is generated from adding back taxes, interest, depreciation to net income and is used to evaluate the\nCompany’s future operating performance.\n3. After-Tax Free Cash Flow (FCF)\nAfter-Tax Free Cash Flow (FCF) is a non-GAAP metric and is defined as net cash provided from operating activities less capital expenditures and less taxes and is used to evaluate the Company’s future\noperating performance and ability to generate excess cash flow but it does not entirely represent cash available for discretionary expenditures due to the fact that the measure does not deduct the payments\nrequired for debt service and other items.\nWe believe the projected non-GAAP financial measures included in this presentation provide readers with additional meaningful comparisons between the Company’s 2020 Feasibility Study and its peer\ncompanies. These projected non-GAAP financial measures are not historical measures of financial performance and are not presented in accordance with GAAP. They may exclude items that will be significant in\nunderstanding and assessing our financial results. Therefore, these measures should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative or superior to GAAP measures. You should be aware that our presentation of\nthese measures may not be comparable to similarly-titled measures used by other companies. The projected non-GAAP measures included in this presentation cannot be reconciled to comparable GAAP\nmeasures without unreasonable effort.\nThe non-GAAP financial measures included in this presentation are projections based on the 2020 Feasibility Study. They are forward-looking statements and remain subject to the risks and uncertainties set forth\nin the section titled “Forward-Looking Statements” at the beginning of this presentation.\nSee the 2020 Feasibility Study for additional information regarding the non-GAAP financial measures included in this presentation. The economic model described in the 2020 Feasibility Study is not a true cash\nflow model as defined by financial accounting standards but rather a representation of Project economics at a level of detail appropriate for a feasibility study level of engineering and design.\n33"

Statements concerning mineral resource and mineral reserve estimates may also\nconstitute Forward-Looking Information to the extent that they involve estimates of the mineralization that may be encountered if the Project is developed. In preparing the Forward-Looking Information herein, the Company has\napplied several material assumptions, including, but not limited to, assumptions that we will successfully negotiate a definitized agreement and that the full amount of the Defense Production Act award will be funded on the\nexpected timeline; that the review process under the NEPA (including any joint review process involving the USFS, the State of Idaho and other agencies and regulatory bodies) as well as the FEIS will proceed in a timely\nmanner and as expected; that we will be able to obtain sufficient funding to finance permitting, pre-construction and construction of the Project and that all requisite information will be available in a timely manner; the\nexchange rates for the U.S. and Canadian currencies will be consistent with the Company’s expectations; that the current exploration, development, environmental and other objectives concerning the Project can be achieved\nand that its other corporate activities will proceed as expected; that the current price and demand for gold and antimony will be sustained or will improve; that general business and economic conditions will not change in a\nmaterially adverse manner and that all necessary governmental approvals for planned activities on the Project will be obtained in a timely manner and on acceptable terms; that permitting and operations costs will not materially\nincrease; the continuity of the price of gold and other metals, economic and political conditions and operations; and the assumptions set out in the FS. Forward-Looking Information involves known and unknown risks,\nuncertainties and other factors which may cause the actual results, performance or achievements of the Company to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by the\nForward-Looking Information. Such risks and other factors include, among others, the industry-wide risks and project-specific risks identified in the FS; operations and contractual obligations; changes in exploration programs\nbased upon results of exploration; changes in estimated mineral reserves or mineral resources; future prices of metals and minerals; availability of personnel and equipment; equipment failure; accidents, effects of weather and\nother natural phenomena and other risks associated with the mineral exploration industry; environmental risks, including environmental matters under US federal and Idaho rules and regulations; impact of environmental\nremediation requirements and the terms of existing and potential consent decrees on the Company’s planned exploration and development activities on the Project; certainty of mineral title; community relations; delays in\nobtaining governmental approvals or financing; the Company’s dependence on one mineral project; the nature of mineral exploration and mining and the uncertain commercial viability; the Company’s lack of operating\nrevenues; governmental regulations and the ability to obtain necessary licenses and permits; risks related to prior unregistered agreements, transfers or claims and other defects in title to mineral projects; currency fluctuations;\nchanges in environmental laws and regulations and changes in the application of standards pursuant to existing laws and regulations; risks related to dependence on key personnel; COVID-19 risks to employee health and\nsafety and a slowdown or temporary suspension of operations in geographic locations impacted by an outbreak; estimates used in budgeting and financial statements proving to be incorrect; risks related to unforeseen delays\nin the review process including availability of personnel from the USFS, State of Idaho and other stated, federal and local agencies and regulatory bodies (including, but not limited to, future US government shutdowns); risks\nrelated to opposition to the Project; risks related to increased or unexpected costs in operations or the permitting process; risks that necessary financing will be unavailable when needed on acceptable terms, or at all; risks\nrelated to the outcome of litigation and potential for delay of the Project, as well as those factors discussed in the Company’s public disclosure record. Although the Company has attempted to identify important factors that\ncould affect the Company and may cause actual actions, events or results to differ materially from those described in Forward-Looking Information, there may be other factors that cause actions, events or results not to be as\nanticipated, estimated or intended. There can be no assurance that Forward-Looking Information will prove to be accurate, as actual results and future events could differ materially from those anticipated in such statements.\nBecause it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors, this list cannot be considered a complete set of all potential risks or uncertainties. Accordingly, readers should not place undue reliance on Forward-Looking\nInformation. For further information on these and other risks and uncertainties that may affect the Company’s business and liquidity, see the “Risk Factors” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and\nResults of Operations” sections of the Company’s filings with the SEC, are available at www.sec.gov and with the Canadian securities regulators, which are available at www.sedar.com. Except as required by law, the Company\nexpressly disclaims any obligation to update the Forward-Looking Information herein.\n2\nCAUTIONARY NOTE & TECHNICAL DISCLOSURE\nThe presentation has been prepared by Perpetua Resources management and does not represent a recommendation to buy or sell these securities. Investors should always consult their investment advisors prior\nto making any investment decisions. All references to “dollars” or “$” shall mean United States dollars unless otherwise specified.\nThe material scientific and technical information in respect of the Stibnite Gold Project in this presentation, unless otherwise indicated, is based upon information contained in the technical report titled “Stibnite\nGold Project, Feasibility Study Technical Report, Valley County, Idaho” dated effective December 22, 2020 and issued January 27, 2021 (the “FS” or “2020 Feasibility Study”). The 2020 Feasibility Study was\nprepared in accordance with National Instrument 43-101 – Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects (“NI 43-101”). NI 43-101 is a rule developed by the Canadian Securities Administrators that establishes\nstandards for all public disclosure an issuer makes of scientific and technical information concerning mineral projects. These standards differ from the mining property disclosure rules specified in Subpart 1300 of\nRegulation S-K under the United States Securities Act of 1933 (“Subpart 1300”) promulgated by the SEC. Accordingly, information concerning mineral deposits from the 2020 Feasibility Study set forth herein\nmay not be comparable with information made public by companies that report in accordance with U.S. standards.\nThe Company has issued its inaugural Technical Report Summary (the “TRS”), dated as of December 31, 2021, and amended as of June 6, 2022, developed for the Stibnite Gold Project in accordance with the\nmining property disclosure rules specified in Subpart 1300 promulgated by the SEC. The TRS summarizes, in accordance with the mining property disclosure rules specified in Subpart 1300, the FS, which was\ncompleted under NI 43-101, with the following notable differences between the FS and the TRS:\n• The TRS Mineral Resource estimates were developed based on a gold price of $1,500/oz versus the $1,250/oz gold price assumed for the FS. The change in gold price results from higher trailing average\ngold prices at the date of preparation for the respective reports.\n• The Measured Mineral Resources in the FS were reclassified to Indicated Mineral Resources in the TRS due to differences in Subpart 1300 versus NI 43-101 Mineral Resources classification guidelines.\n• The Proven Mineral Reserves from the FS were reclassified as Probable Mineral Reserves for the TRS resulting from the reclassification of the Measured Mineral Resources to Indicated Mineral Resources due\nto differences in Subpart 1300 versus NI 43-101 Mineral Resources classification guidelines.\n• The TRS is classified as a Preliminary Feasibility level study whereas the FS was classified as a Feasibility level study. This change was driven by the Subpart 1300 requirement that a compliant Feasibility level\nTRS include a capital cost contingency allowance no greater than 10%, whereas the initial capital cost estimate for the FS included a more conservative allowance at approximately 15%.\nAll other technical analyses, design information, capital and operating cost information, economic analyses, permitting and legal assumptions, conclusions and recommendations are consistent between the TRS\nand the FS. Readers are encouraged to read the TRS and the Company’s Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on January 3, 2021, as amended by the Company’s Current Report on Form 8-K/A filed\nwith the SEC on June 8, 2022, which are available under the Company’s profile on EDGAR. Readers are also encouraged to read the FS, which is available on the Company’s website and under the Company’s\nprofile on SEDAR, for detailed information concerning the Project. See also “Regulatory Information” at the end of this presentation.\nThis presentation contains certain mineral reserve, production, costs, valuation, capitalization, trading data and similar information regarding certain other mineral projects and peer companies. Such data was\nderived from publicly available reports by such companies and other trade and industry sources. While the company believes such sources to be reliable, the company has not independently verified such\ninformation. Furthermore, information regarding mineral reserves, production and similar mineral project information for each company is based on estimates, assumptions and reporting standards applied to\navailable data by each company and their reserve engineers in their respective reports, which may differ materially from the estimates, assumptions and reporting standards applied by us, and therefore may not\nbe comparable among the companies presented. As a result, comparisons of such data made in this presentation, while considered reasonable at the time they are made, are subject to a variety of risks and\nuncertainties which could cause actual events or results of each company to differ materially from those reflected and there can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve similar results at similar stages of\ndevelopment.\nInvestors should be aware that the publication of the SDEIS and the permitting schedule, and the identification by the USFS of the Modified Mine Plan as the Preferred Alternative in the SDEIS, does not indicate\nany commitments on the part of the USFS with regard to the content or timing of a final decision. In developing the FEIS, the next phase of the NEPA planning process, the USFS may select various actions based\non the Modified Mine Plan or each of the alternatives analyzed in the SDEIS. Furthermore, the USFS is not bound by the permitting schedule and anticipated milestones may be delayed materially or not be\nsatisfied.\n3\nWHY PERPETUA RESOURCES?\n✓ Redeveloping one of largest, highest grade and\nlowest cost gold projects in the U.S.*\n✓ Superior project economics with ~15 year\nreserve life and <3 year payback period *\n✓ Establishing a national strategic asset with a\ncritical mineral essential for national defense and\nthe clean energy transition\n✓ Located in stable mining jurisdiction with Idaho\ncommunity and political support\n✓ Sustainable approach to restoring the\nenvironment, improving a legacy, and creating\nvalue for all stakeholders\n✓ Attractive valuation with significant near-term\ncatalysts\n*Based on the 2020 Feasibility Study (“FS”) which is intended to be read as a whole and sections should not be read or relied upon out of context.

(tailings storage facility and closure) with Tierra Group International, Ltd.\nThe TRS was compiled by M3 in compliance with Subpart 1300 promulgated by the SEC under the direction of Independent Qualified Persons (as defined in Subpart 1300) (“QPs”). QPs for the TRS include:\nRichard Zimmerman, SME-RM (onsite and offsite infrastructure, cost estimating, mineral processing, financial modeling) with M3; Garth Kirkham, P.Geo.

(tailings storage facility and closure) with Tierra Group International, Ltd.\nThe material scientific and technical information in respect of the Project in this presentation, unless otherwise indicated, is based upon information contained in the FS, with notable differences between the FS\nand the TRS identified. Readers are encouraged to read the TRS and the Company’s Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on January 3, 2021, as amended by the Company’s Current Report on Form 8-\nK/A filed with the SEC on June 8, 2022, which are available under the Company’s profile on EDGAR. Readers also are encouraged to read the FS, which is available under the Company’s profile on SEDAR and\non the Company’s website, for detailed information concerning the Project. All disclosure contained in this presentation regarding the mineral reserves and mineral resource estimates and economic analysis on\nthe property is fully qualified by the full disclosure contained in the FS and the TRS.\nInformation of a scientific or technical nature in this presentation has been approved by Christopher Dail, AIPG CPG #10596, Exploration Manager for Perpetua Resources Idaho, Inc. and a qualified person (as\ndefined in NI 43-101 and as defined in Subpart 1300).\nAll mineral resources have been estimated in accordance with CIM definitions, with notable differences to Subpart 1300 identified. Mineral resources are reported in relation to a conceptual pit shell to\ndemonstrate potential for economic viability, as required under NI 43-101; mineralization lying outside of these pit shells is not reported as a mineral resource. Mineral resources are not mineral reserves and do\nnot have demonstrated economic viability. Mineral resource estimates include inferred mineral resources that are considered too speculative geologically to have economic considerations applied to them that\nwould enable them to be categorized as mineral reserves. It is reasonably expected that the majority of inferred mineral resources could be upgraded to indicated mineral resources.\nThe mineral resources and mineral reserves at the Stibnite Gold Project are contained within areas that have seen historic disturbance resulting from prior mining activities. In order for the Company to advance\nits interests at the Stibnite Gold Project, the Project will be subject to a number of federal, state and local laws and regulations and will require permits to conduct its activities.\nSee also “Cautionary Note” at the beginning of this presentation.\nOTHER\nCertain monetary amounts, percentages and other figures included in this presentation have been subject to rounding adjustments. Certain other amounts that appear in this presentation may not sum due to\nrounding.\n04\n38\nNON-GAAP MEASURES\nNON-GAAP MEASURES\nTo provide investors with additional information in connection with our results as determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”), we disclose certain\nprojected non-GAAP financial measures. The projected non-GAAP financial measures include Cash Costs, EBITDA, All-in Sustaining Costs and After-Tax Free Cash Flow estimates and related calculations as\npublished in the Company’s 2020 Feasibility Study.\n1. Cash Costs and All-in Sustaining Costs (AISC)\nCash Costs is a non-GAAP metric defined as the sum of cash operating costs (mining, processing, G&A), by-product credits, refining and transportation costs and royalties and is used to evaluate the\nCompany’s future operating performance and provide visibility into the economics of our future mining operations.\nAll-in Sustaining Costs (AISC) is a non-GAAP metric defined as the sum of cash costs (from above), sustaining capital costs and non-revenue-based taxes (i.e. property tax) and is used to evaluate the\nCompany’s future operating performance and the ability to generate cash flow from operations.\n2. EBITDA\nEarnings before interest, taxes and depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) is a non-GAAP metric is generated from adding back taxes, interest, depreciation to net income and is used to evaluate the\nCompany’s future operating performance.\n3. After-Tax Free Cash Flow (FCF)\nAfter-Tax Free Cash Flow (FCF) is a non-GAAP metric and is defined as net cash provided from operating activities less capital expenditures and less taxes and is used to evaluate the Company’s future\noperating performance and ability to generate excess cash flow but it does not entirely represent cash available for discretionary expenditures due to the fact that the measure does not deduct the payments\nrequired for debt service and other items.\nWe believe the projected non-GAAP financial measures included in this presentation provide readers with additional meaningful comparisons between the Company’s 2020 Feasibility Study and its peer\ncompanies. These projected non-GAAP financial measures are not historical measures of financial performance and are not presented in accordance with GAAP. They may exclude items that will be significant in\nunderstanding and assessing our financial results. Therefore, these measures should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative or superior to GAAP measures. You should be aware that our presentation of\nthese measures may not be comparable to similarly-titled measures used by other companies. The projected non-GAAP measures included in this presentation cannot be reconciled to comparable GAAP\nmeasures without unreasonable effort.\nThe non-GAAP financial measures included in this presentation are projections based on the 2020 Feasibility Study. They are forward-looking statements and remain subject to the risks and uncertainties set forth\nin the section titled “Forward-Looking Statements” at the beginning of this presentation.\nSee the 2020 Feasibility Study for additional information regarding the non-GAAP financial measures included in this presentation. The economic model described in the 2020 Feasibility Study is not a true cash\nflow model as defined by financial accounting standards but rather a representation of Project economics at a level of detail appropriate for a feasibility study level of engineering and design.\n39"
