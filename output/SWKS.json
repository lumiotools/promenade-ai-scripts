Year FY24 Results\n\n  * _Delivers Revenue of $1.025 Billion_\n  *  _Posts GAAP Diluted EPS of $0.37 and Non-GAAP Diluted EPS of $1.55_\n  *  _Generates Annual Operating Cash Flow of $1.825 Billion (44% Operating Cash Flow Margin) and Free Cash Flow of $1.668 Billion (40% Free Cash Flow Margin)_\n\n\n\nIRVINE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Nov. 12, 2024-- Skyworks Solutions, Inc. (Nasdaq: SWKS), a leading developer, manufacturer and provider of analog and mixed-signal semiconductors and solutions for numerous applications, today reported fourth fiscal quarter and fiscal year-end results for the period ended Sept. 27, 2024.\n\nRevenue for the fourth fiscal quarter of 2024 was $1.025 billion. On a GAAP basis, operating income for the fourth fiscal quarter was $59 million with diluted earnings per share of $0.37. On a non-GAAP basis, operating income was $273 million with non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.55.\n\nâSkyworksâ fourth fiscal quarter revenue grew 13% sequentially, above the midpoint of our guidance,â said Liam K. Griffin, chairman, chief executive officer and president of Skyworks. âFor the second year in a row, we generated over $1.6 billion of free cash flow and ended fiscal 2024 with a record 40% free cash flow margin. Looking ahead, we believe AI is poised to ignite a transformative smartphone upgrade cycle, propelling the demand for higher levels of RF complexity. We are in the early stages of this multi-year trend and Skyworks is well-positioned to capitalize on it.â\n\n**Fourth Fiscal Quarter Business Highlights**\n\n  * Secured 5G content for premium Android smartphones including Google Pixel 9, Samsung Galaxy, Oppo OnePlus, and several others\n  * Expanded our Wi-Fi 7 design wins with Linksys, Charter, NETGEAR, CommScope, and TP-Link\n  * Powered advanced audio solutions for wireless gaming and clinical-grade hearing aids\n  * Increased design win momentum in automotive including 5G front-end modules, infotainment, and digital isolators, across the leading OEMs\n\n\n\n**First Fiscal Quarter 2025 Outlook**\n\n _We provide earnings guidance on a non-GAAP basis because certain information necessary to reconcile such guidance to GAAP is difficult to estimate and dependent on future events outside of our control. Please refer to the attached Discussion Regarding the Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures in this earnings release for a further discussion of our use of non-GAAP measures, including quantification of known expected adjustment items._\n\nâFor the December quarter, we expect revenue to be $1.05 billion to $1.08 billion with non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.57 at the mid-point of the revenue range,â said Kris Sennesael, senior vice president and chief financial officer of Skyworks. âWe expect our mobile business to be up mid-single digits sequentially, driven by seasonal product ramps. In broad markets, despite excess inventory in select segments, we anticipate further modest sequential growth, and a return to year-over-year growth.â\n\n**Dividend Payment**\n\nSkyworksâ board of directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.70 per share of the Companyâs common stock. The dividend is payable on Dec. 24, 2024, to stockholders of record at the close of business on Dec. 3, 2024.\n\n**Skyworksâ Fourth Quarter 2024 Conference Call**\n\nSkyworks will host a conference call with analysts to discuss its fourth quarter fiscal 2024 results and business outlook on Nov. 12, 2024, at 4:30 p.m. ET.\n\nTo listen to the conference call, please visit the investor relations section of Skyworksâ website at [https://investors.skyworksinc.com/events-presentations](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Finvestors.skyworksinc.com%2Fevents-presentations&esheet=54150693&newsitemid=20241111423741&lan=en-US&anchor=https%3A%2F%2Finvestors.skyworksinc.com%2Fevents-presentations&index=1&md5=c7b0cf65770a3570b7abe7ca84a0b648).
