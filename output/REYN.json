(the “Company” or “RCP”) (Nasdaq: REYN) today reported financial results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2024. \n\n**Second Quarter 2024 Highlights**\n\n  * **Net Revenues** of $930 million vs. $940 million in Q2 2023 \n    * Retail Net Revenues increased 1% to $892 million, exceeding Company expectations \n    * Non-retail Net Revenues, which consist of sales to food service customers, classified as related party net revenues, and industrial customers, decreased $16 million to $39 million\n  * **Net Income** and **Adjusted Net Income** of $97 million vs. $66 million in Q2 2023 \n  * **Adjusted EBITDA** of $172 million vs. $150 million in Q2 2023 \n  * **Earnings Per Share** and **Adjusted Earnings Per Share** of $0.46 vs. $0.32 in Q2 2023 \n  * **Operating Cash Flow** of $183 million in first six months of 2024 \n\n\n\nRetail volume outperformed Company expectations and was unchanged versus the second quarter of 2023 including a headwind of over 1% from product portfolio optimization. The Company continued to outperform its categories with several categories performing better than expected, resulting in improved performance versus the first quarter. \n\nNet Income increased $31 million and Adjusted EBITDA increased $22 million driven by manufacturing volume output and lower operational costs, partially offset by higher personnel costs and increased investment in advertising. Net Income benefited from these same factors as well as lower interest and income tax expense. \n\nThe Company further reduced Net Debt to Trailing Twelve Months Adjusted EBITDA1 from 2.7x on December 31, 2023 to 2.4x on June 30, 2024. \n\n“Strong retail revenue performance in each of our business units resulted in RCP outperforming our categories during the quarter,” said Lance Mitchell, CEO and President of Reynolds Consumer Products. “As a result, we delivered another quarter of strong financial results demonstrating our marketplace leadership as well as our effectiveness in driving operational excellence. We are commercializing and expanding our strong innovation pipeline, unlocking Reyvolution programs to reduce operational costs and investing in strategic opportunities to drive long term growth.” \n\n1Net Debt is defined as current portion of long-term debt plus long-term debt less cash and cash equivalents. Net Debt Leverage is defined as Net Debt divided by Trailing Twelve Months Adjusted EBITDA. See “Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for additional information.   \n---  \n  \n_Reynolds Cooking & Baking_\n\n  * Net revenues decreased $17 million to $304 million driven by non-retail revenues, which consist of sales to food service customers, classified as related party net revenues, and industrial customers \n  * Adjusted EBITDA increased $16 million to $56 million\n\n\n\nAdjusted EBITDA increased $16 million driven by increased production and lower operational costs. \n\nVolume decreased 5% and was driven by an expected 5-point impact from low margin non-retail sales. Retail volume was unchanged and reflected additional share gains in household foil and continued growth in parchment paper, particularly behind Reynolds Kitchens® Stay Flat Parchment with SmartGrid® and Reynolds Kitchens® Air Fryer liners. \n\nThe Company launched a new grilling campaign consisting of multi-product advertising and digital executions which are performing well versus expectations. As part of that campaign, Reynolds Wrap® has partnered with ButcherBox, the leading direct-to-consumer meat brand, to create limited edition BBQterie kits to participate in the charcuterie trend popular with younger consumers. \n\n_Hefty Waste & Storage_\n\n  * Net revenues increased $9 million to $238 million\n  * Adjusted EBITDA increased $7 million to $69 million\n\n\n\nAdjusted EBITDA increased $7 million driven by lower operational costs and higher revenue, partially offset by increased investments in advertising. \n\nVolume increased 2%, consistent with category trends which were better than expected. \n\nHefty Waste Bags had a successful second quarter expanding Hefty® Ultra Strong with Coastal Plastic and Fabuloso Citrus & Fruits and launching additional innovation including new Hefty® Compostable Press-To-Close Food Bags. \n\nThe Company continues to shift to a broader sustainable portfolio by expanding Hefty® Waste Bags with Post Consumer Recycled Materials and shipping slider bags made without PFAS. In addition, the Hefty® ReNew™ Program continued to expand, launching in Columbus, Dayton and Tucson during the second quarter. \n\n_Hefty Tableware_\n\n  * Net revenues decreased $6 million to $245 million\n  * Adjusted EBITDA decreased $6 million to $39 million\n\n\n\nAdjusted EBITDA performed in line with Company expectations, reflecting the implementation of price pack architecture initiatives and increased advertising and promotional investments. \n\nVolume performance improved to down 1% in the quarter from down 6% in the first quarter and down 8% in the second half of 2023, in each case as compared to the same prior year period. \n\nThe Hefty Tableware portfolio outperformed its categories driven by multiple products including party cups and plates. Hefty® ZooPals® also continued to perform well, gaining additional retail distribution. \n\n_Presto Products_\n\n  * Net revenues increased $5 million to $150 million\n  * Adjusted EBITDA increased $9 million to $37 million\n\n\n\nAdjusted EBITDA increased $9 million to a second quarter record $37 million driven by volume growth and lower operational costs. \n\nVolume increased 2% driven by continued growth in the food bag category. \n\nProduct innovations including 25% plant-based compostable press to close food bags, bio-based sandwich bags made with 20% plant & ocean materials and half gallon storage and freezer bags contributed to strong retail performance. Presto plans a record number of product launches in 2024. \n\n**Year to Date 2024 Highlights**\n\n  * **Net Revenues** of $1,764 million vs. $1,814 million in the comparable prior year period \n    * Retail Net Revenues decreased 1%, exceeding Company expectations \n    * Non-retail Net Revenues decreased to $77 million\n  * **Net Income** and **Adjusted Net Income** of $145 million vs. $83 million in the comparable prior year period \n  * **Adjusted EBITDA** of $294 million vs. $232 million in the comparable prior year period \n  * **Earnings Per Share** and **Adjusted Earnings Per Share** of $0.69 vs. $0.40 in the comparable prior year period \n\n\n\nRetail volume outperformed Company expectations, decreasing 1% and included a headwind of over 1% from product portfolio optimization. The Company continued to lead its categories with several performing better than expected year to date. \n\nNet Income and Adjusted EBITDA each increased $62 million driven by manufacturing volume output and lower operational costs, partially offset by higher personnel costs and increased investment in advertising. Net Income increased by the same amount as Adjusted EBITDA as lower interest expense was offset by higher income tax expense. \n\n**Balance Sheet and Cash Flow Highlights**\n\nCash and cash equivalents were $101 million at June 30, 2024, and debt was $1,784 million resulting in Net Debt of $1,683 million, $34 million lower than at December 31, 2023. The Company further reduced Net Debt to Trailing Twelve Months Adjusted EBITDA1 from 2.7x on December 31, 2023 to 2.4x on June 30, 2024. \n\nOperating cash flow of $183 million in the six months ended June 30, 2024 was driven by strong profitability and disciplined working capital management. \n\nSubsequent to quarter end, the Company made a voluntary principal payment of $50 million on its term loan facility. \n\n**Fiscal Year and Third Quarter Outlook**\n\nThe Company updates its earnings outlook for the full year as follows: \n\n**Prior Full Year 2024 Outlook** |  **Current Full Year 2024 Outlook**  \n---|---  \nNet Revenues  |  $3,530 to $3,640 million |  $3,590 to $3,670 million  \nNet Income and Adj Net Income  |  $341 to $357 million |  $346 to $358 million  \nAdjusted EBITDA  |  $660 to $680 million |  $670 to $685 million  \nEarnings Per Share and Adj Earnings Per Share  |  $1.62 to $1.70 |  $1.65 to $1.71  \nNet Debt at December 31, 2024 |  $1.5 to $1.6 billion |  $1.5 to $1.6 billion  \n  \nThe Company guides full-year 2024 Net Revenues to be approximately $3,590 million to $3,670 million versus prior year Net Revenues of $3,756 million consisting of the following assumptions: \n\n1% reduction from pricing 1% reduction to 1% increase from retail volume, at or better than category forecasts 2.5% reduction from lower non-retail volume and optimization of the retail product portfolio \n\nThe following table sets forth the estimated impact of these factors on our prior 2024 outlook and our current 2024 outlook, as well as the difference in estimated impact between those outlooks. \n\n**Net Revenue Full-Year 2024 Guide**  \n---  \n**Prior 2024 Outlook** |  **Current 2024 Outlook** |  **Difference between Prior & Current 2024 Outlook**  \n**Low** |  **Mid** |  **High** |  **Low** |  **Mid** |  **High** |  **Low** |  **Mid** |  **High**  \nPricing  |  (1.0)%  |  (1.0)%  |  (1.0)%  |  (1.0)%  |  (1.0)%  |  (1.0)%  |  —%  |  —%  |  —%   \nRetail Volume  |  (2.0)%  |  (0.5)%  |  1.0%  |  (1.0)%  |  —%  |  1.0%  |  1.0%  |  0.5%  |  —%   \nNon-Retail Volume & Product Portfolio Optimization  |  (3.0)%  |  (3.0)%  |  (3.0)%  |  (2.5)%  |  (2.5)%  |  (2.5)%  |  0.5%  |  0.5%  |  0.5%   \n  \nCommodity rates are expected to remain more stable than in recent years. \n\nThe Company forecasts Adjusted EBITDA growth driven by retail volume at or above category forecasts, improvements in product mix, the Reynolds Cooking & Baking business’s recovery of historical earnings and delivery of additional Reyvolution cost savings. \n\nNet income growth is forecasted to be driven by the same factors driving Adjusted EBITDA, in addition to an approximately $20 million expected reduction in interest expense compared to 2023 net interest expense of $119 million. \n\nThe Company continues to expect the relative contribution of each quarter’s Adjusted EBITDA to the full year’s Adjusted EBITDA returning to historical averages. \n\nThe Company introduces its third quarter 2024 outlook as follows: \n\n**Q3 2024 Outlook**  \n---  \nNet Revenues  |  $885 to $915 million  \nNet Income and Adj Net Income  |  $82 to $90 million  \nAdjusted EBITDA  |  $165 to $175 million  \nEarnings Per Share and Adjusted Earnings Per Share  |  $0.39 to $0.43  \n  \nThe Company guides third quarter 2024 Net Revenues to be approximately $885 million to $915 million versus prior year Net Revenues of $935 million consisting of the following assumptions: \n\n1% reduction from pricing 2.5% reduction to 0.5% increase from retail volume, including the reversal of a benefit from estimated retailer order timing moving from the third quarter into the second quarter 2% reduction from lower non-retail volume and optimization of the retail product portfolio \n\n“RCP is performing well against the commercial and financial objectives established at the start of the year and we are increasing our guide as a result,” said Scott Huckins, Chief Financial Officer. “We are operating with discipline in a dynamic consumer environment and plan to continue driving our categories while expanding margins, driving cash flow and increasing financial flexibility.” \n\n**Quarterly Dividend**\n\nThe Company’s Board of Directors has approved a quarterly dividend of $0.23 per common share. The Company expects to pay this dividend on August 30, 2024, to shareholders of record as of August 16, 2024. \n\n**Earnings Webcast**\n\nThe Company will host a live webcast this morning at 7:00 a.m. CT (8:00 a.m. ET).

We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income calculated in accordance with GAAP, plus the sum of income tax expense, net interest expense, depreciation and amortization and further adjusted to exclude certain non-recurring items, if applicable. We define Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Earnings Per Share (“Adjusted EPS”) as Net Income and Earnings Per Share (“EPS”) calculated in accordance with GAAP, plus the sum of certain non-recurring items, if applicable. We define Net Debt as the current portion of long-term debt plus long-term debt less cash and cash equivalents. We define Net Debt to Trailing Twelve Months Adjusted EBITDA as Net Debt (as defined above) as of the end of the period to Adjusted EBITDA (as defined above) for the period. \n\nWe present Adjusted EBITDA because it is a key measure used by our management team to evaluate our operating performance, generate future operating plans and make strategic decisions. In addition, our chief operating decision maker uses Adjusted EBITDA of each reportable segment to evaluate the operating performance of such segments. We use Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Earnings Per Share as supplemental measures to evaluate our business’ performance in a way that also considers our ability to generate profit without the impact of certain items. We use Net Debt as we believe it is a more representative measure of our liquidity. We use Net Debt to Trailing Twelve Months Adjusted EBITDA because it reflects our ability to service our debt obligations. Accordingly, we believe presenting these measures provide useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management team and board of directors. \n\nNon-GAAP information should be considered as supplemental in nature and is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. In addition, our non-GAAP financial measures may not be the same as or comparable to similar non-GAAP financial measures presented by other companies. \n\nGuidance for fiscal year and third quarter 2024, where adjusted, is provided on a non-GAAP basis. The Company cannot reconcile its expected Net Debt at December 31, 2024 to expected total debt without reasonable effort because certain items that impact total debt and other reconciling measures are out of the Company’s control and/or cannot be reasonably predicted at this time, to which unavailable information could have a significant impact on the Company’s GAAP financial results. \n\nPlease see reconciliations of Non-GAAP measures used in this release (with the exception of our December 31, 2024 Net Debt outlook, as described above) to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, beginning on the following page. \n\n**Reynolds Consumer Products Inc.**  \n---  \n**Reconciliation of Net Income to Adjusted EBITDA**  \n_(amounts in millions)_  \n**Three Months Ended June 30,** |  **Six Months Ended June 30,**  \n**2024** |  **2023** |  **2024** |  **2023**  \n**(in millions)** |  **(in millions)**  \n**Net income – GAAP** |  **$** |  **97** |  **$** |  **66** |  **$** |  **145** |  **$** |  **83**  \nIncome tax expense  |  18  |  23  |  35  |  28   \nInterest expense, net  |  25  |  31  |  51  |  60   \nDepreciation and amortization  |  32  |  30  |  63  |  61   \n**Adjusted EBITDA (Non-GAAP)** |  **$** |  **172** |  **$** |  **150** |  **$** |  **294** |  **$** |  **232**  \n  \n**Reynolds Consumer Products Inc.**  \n---  \n**Reconciliation of Trailing Twelve Months Net Income to Trailing Twelve Months Adjusted EBITDA**  \n_(amounts in millions)_  \n**Twelve Months Ended June 30, 2024** |  **Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2023**  \n**Net income – GAAP** |  **$** |  **360** |  **$** |  **298**  \nIncome tax expense  |  102  |  95   \nInterest expense, net  |  110  |  119   \nDepreciation and amortization  |  126  |  124   \n**Adjusted EBITDA (Non-GAAP)** |  **$** |  **698** |  **$** |  **636**  \n  \n**Reynolds Consumer Products Inc.**  \n---  \n**Reconciliation of Total Debt to Net Debt and Calculation of Net Debt to Trailing Twelve Months Adjusted EBITDA**  \n_(amounts in millions, except for Net Debt to Trailing Twelve Months Adjusted EBITDA)_  \n**As of June 30, 2024**  \nCurrent portion of long-term debt  |  $  |  —   \nLong-term debt  |  1,784   \n**Total debt** |  1,784   \nCash and cash equivalents  |  (101  |  )   \n**Net debt (Non-GAAP)** |  **$** |  **1,683**  \n**For the twelve months ended June 30, 2024**  \n**Adjusted EBITDA (Non-GAAP)** |  **$** |  **698**  \n**Net Debt to Trailing Twelve Months Adjusted EBITDA** |  **2.4x**  \n  \n**As of December 31, 2023**  \n---  \nCurrent portion of long-term debt  |  $  |  —   \nLong-term debt  |  1,832   \n**Total debt** |  1,832   \nCash and cash equivalents  |  (115  |  )   \n**Net debt (Non-GAAP)** |  **$** |  **1,717**  \n**For the twelve months ended December 31, 2023**  \n**Adjusted EBITDA (Non-GAAP)** |  **$** |  **636**  \n**Net Debt to Trailing Twelve Months Adjusted EBITDA** |  **2.7x**  \n  \n**Reynolds Consumer Products Inc.**  \n---  \n**Reconciliation of Q3 2024 and FY2024 Net Income Guidance to Adjusted EBITDA Guidance**  \n_(amounts in millions)_  \n**Three Months Ended September 30, 2024** |  **Year Ended December 31, 2024**  \n**Low** |  **High** |  **Low** |  **High**  \n**Net income (GAAP)** |  **$** |  **82** |  **$** |  **90** |  **$** |  **346** |  **$** |  **358**  \nIncome tax expense  |  27  |  29  |  99  |  102   \nInterest expense, net  |  25  |  25  |  100  |  100   \nDepreciation and amortization  |  31  |  31  |  125  |  125   \n**Adjusted EBITDA** |  **$** |  **165** |  **$** |  **175** |  **$** |  **670** |  **$** |  **685**  \n  \n![](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=bwnews&sty=20240807962049r1&sid=acqr8&distro=nx&lang=en)\n\nView source version on [businesswire.com](http://businesswire.com): <https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240807962049/en/>\n\n**Investor Contact** Mark Swartzberg Mark.Swartzberg@reynoldsbrands.com (847) 482-4081 \n\nSource: Reynolds Consumer Products Inc.\n"
