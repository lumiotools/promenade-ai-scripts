Within the global lithium industry, LV has emerged as a premier hard-rock lithium jurisdiction, as evidenced by major lithium producer Pilbara Minerals Ltd.’s US$370 million acquisition of LV-based Latin Resources Ltd., an exploration company.\n\nOver the last several years, Atlas Lithium has assembled Brazil’s largest portfolio of lithium mineral rights among publicly listed companies. Importantly, the Company holds three key projects that span the major lithium-mineralized zones in LV:\n\n  * The Neves Project in southern LV, Atlas Lithium’s flagship development, has recently been permitted and is advancing towards production;\n  * The Salinas Project in northern LV, spanning 2,070 acres with natural spodumene outcrops, located 4.7 miles from Latin Resources Ltd., and with potential for spodumene deposits;\n  * The Clear Project in central LV, encompassing 470 acres situated 3.8 miles from Sigma Lithium’s mine, and also with potential for spodumene deposits.\n\n\n\nRecent exploration activities at both the Salinas and the Clear Projects have yielded significant progress and such development bodes well for the Company’s strategy of securing as many high-quality deposit areas within LV as feasible. Atlas Lithium’s exploration activities are supervised by Qualified Persons for Lithium, as defined in Item 1300 of Regulation SK. \n\nThe Salinas Project continues to demonstrate its substantial potential, with recent detailed geological mapping revealing two outcrops of spodumene-rich pegmatites in the northwest portion of the mineral property, coinciding with a northeast-southwest trending lithium soil anomaly. Additionally, lithium mineralization has been determined in at least three pegmatites, with geochemical assay results ranging from 2.31% to 4.97% Li2O. Laboratory analysis of detailed soil sampling within the claim has identified at least three parallel north-south and northeast-southwest lithium anomalies associated with mapped pegmatites. The Company has undertaken geophysical surveys and such results have been consistent with the probability of one or more lithium deposits within the claim. \n\nAt the Clear Project, detailed geological mapping of the claim has resulted in the discovery of two pegmatites, with completed soil sampling revealing a substantial northeast-southwest trending lithium anomaly associated with a mapped pegmatite, suggesting the presence of a buried pegmatite swarm. The Company’s technical team has completed an initial round of geophysical studies which have been favorable for the potential of one or more lithium deposits within the mineral right. \n\nThe Company’s strategic approach prioritizes the Neves Project for initial production, while simultaneously advancing exploration at the Clear and Salinas Projects. Over the last several quarters, Atlas Lithium has enhanced its geological assessment methodology through a comprehensive multi-step process: detailed geological mapping, zoned and detailed soil geochemical analysis, and advanced geophysical surveys including LIDAR and magnetic surveys. In the Company’s experience, such systematic approach has demonstrated accuracy in identifying potential spodumene deposits. Given the favorable results so far, the Company is expected to expand its exploration budget in 2025 to accommodate for drilling in both the Clear Project and the Salinas Projects.\n\nRaimundo Almeida, Vice President of Lithium Processing at Atlas Lithium, commented, “Our deposits at the Neves Project are distinguished by large spodumene crystals, which should enable a streamlined production process and deliver lithium concentrate with minimal impurities. This attribute makes our future product particularly attractive to lithium refiners. The latest discoveries across our Lithium Valley project portfolio, especially the high-grade results from initial exploration at the Salinas Project, further demonstrate the effectiveness of our methodical approach in identifying high-potential spodumene deposits.”\n\n“Our strategy centers on establishing production at our flagship Neves Project while developing at least two additional areas – Salinas and Clear – as potential future production sites. Our holdings across multiple lithium-rich zones in Lithium Valley position Atlas Lithium favorably as an emerging industry leader,” added Rodrigo Menck, Board Member of Atlas Lithium.\n\n**About Atlas Lithium Corporation**\n\n[Atlas Lithium Corporation ](https://api.newsfilecorp.com/redirect/3jqZWtqoWE)(NASDAQ: ATLX) is focused on advancing and developing its 100%-owned hard-rock lithium project in the state of Minas Gerais. In addition, Atlas Lithium has 100% ownership of mineral rights for other battery and critical metals including nickel, rare earths, titanium, graphite, and copper.

With this positive decision, Atlas Lithium has all the needed authorizations to assemble and run its processing plant and develop open-pit mining operations at one of its lithium deposits. This marks a crucial milestone in the Company’s goal of becoming a lithium producer. \n\nOn October 25, 2024, a voting board comprised of twelve representatives from the local civil society and government unanimously approved Atlas Lithium’s license application for its Neves Project, resulting in the formal issuance of the permit. On October 26, 2024, the permit was formally published in the official gazette of the Minas Gerais government. This outcome follows the technical recommendation for approval issued by the Environmental Foundation of Minas Gerais in September 2024.\n\nThe permit authorizes Atlas Lithium to assemble and operate its lithium processing plant, to process mined ore from one of its deposits at the facility, and to sell the lithium concentrate that it produces. This key development comes after an extensive technical review process by regulatory agencies that began with the Company’s initial permit application on September 1, 2023. The triphasic permit obtained by Atlas Lithium is the most expeditious licensing modality available as it encompasses the initial, the installation, and the operating licenses all within this same issued authorization (known as “LI/LP/LO” in the local regulatory terminology).\n\nMarc Fogassa, CEO of Atlas Lithium, commented, “We are thrilled with today’s announcement, as permitting is widely considered the most critical risk in any mining project. Atlas Lithium’s permit reflects fourteen months of our team’s meticulous work throughout the licensing process and showcases our unwavering commitment to developing an environmentally responsible and sustainable operation in Brazil’s Lithium Valley – a mineral district which is rapidly establishing itself as a premier location in the global lithium supply chain. This milestone marks a key step for us towards becoming a lithium producer and advances Atlas Lithium into the next phase of our growth trajectory.”\n\n“We are committed to being a responsible corporate citizen for all our stakeholders. With the news provided today, and as the Neves Project proceeds towards implantation and operation, Atlas Lithium will create hundreds of local jobs in the Vale do Jequitinhonha area of Minas Gerais. Additionally, our lithium processing plant is engineered to possibly achieve the smallest environmental footprint in its class,” said Rodrigo Menck, a member of the Board of Directors of the Company. \n\n**About Atlas Lithium Corporation**\n\n[Atlas Lithium Corporation ](https://api.newsfilecorp.com/redirect/2Eb5XcR3Mx)(NASDAQ: ATLX) is focused on advancing and developing its 100%-owned hard-rock lithium project in the state of Minas Gerais.

Atlas Lithium’s Salinas Project spans 388 hectares (approximately 959 acres) and is situated just 5 miles east of Latin Resources’ Colina Project, a significant lithium deposit. It is relevant to note that in August 2024, Pilbara Minerals Ltd., a major lithium producer, announced that it has entered into a binding agreement to acquire lithium exploration company Latin Resources Ltd. for consideration worth approximately US$370 million. \n\nThe Company considers its Salinas Project a promising lithium-bearing area where spodumene-rich pegmatites (“SRPs”) have now been identified and mapped. Atlas Lithium’s technical team has also completed soil geochemistry and LIDAR geological mapping with favorable results, and is now pursuing further geological and geophysical studies prior to initiation of a drilling campaign. Given the attractive observed data and current market dynamics, the Salinas Project area has emerged as a prime candidate for Atlas Lithium’s future growth plans. The Company’s highest priority remains to bring its Neves Project to production. As previously reported, the Neves Project is in the final stage of operational licensing for both its processing plant and one of its lithium deposits. \n\nAtlas Lithium believes that it is strategically positioned to capitalize on its exposure to two significant yet distinct spodumene areas in Brazil’s Lithium Valley. In the southern region, the Company’s Neves Project offers access to high-quality, large-crystal spodumene suitable for open-pit mining and processing into lithium concentrate, a key ingredient in the global supply chain for electric vehicle (EV) batteries. This site is poised to become the source of Atlas Lithium’s initial production and revenue generation. In the northern part of Lithium Valley, as announced today, Atlas Lithium plans to actively participate in the development of the lithium district surrounding the Salinas municipality, a process further catalyzed by the recently announced Pilbara acquisition.\n\n**About Atlas Lithium Corporation**\n\n[Atlas Lithium Corporation ](https://api.newsfilecorp.com/redirect/gOzg5sVrM3)(NASDAQ: ATLX) is focused on advancing and developing its 100%-owned hard-rock lithium project in the state of Minas Gerais.
