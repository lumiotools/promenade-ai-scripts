I’m pleased with the steady progress we are making in both the businesses on multiple fronts.”\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Results**\n\nRevenue was $676 million in the third quarter of 2024, a decrease of 8% on a reported and constant currency basis as compared to revenue of $732 million in the third quarter of 2023.\n\nPrivate Cloud revenue was $258 million in the third quarter of 2024, a decrease of 14% on a reported basis and 15% on a constant currency basis as compared to revenue of $301 million in the third quarter of 2023.\n\nPublic Cloud revenue was $418 million in the third quarter of 2024, a decrease of 3% on a reported and constant currency basis compared to revenue of $432 million in the third quarter of 2023.\n\nLoss from operations was $(174) million in the third quarter of 2024, compared to loss from operations of $(239) million in the third quarter of 2023.\n\nNet loss was $(187) million in the third quarter of 2024, compared to net loss of $(227) million in the third quarter of 2023.\n\nNet loss per diluted share was $(0.82) in the third quarter of 2024, compared to net loss per diluted share of $(1.05) in the third quarter of 2023.\n\nNon-GAAP Operating Profit was $34 million in the third quarter of 2024, a decrease of 25% compared to $46 million in the third quarter of 2023.\n\nNon-GAAP Loss Per Share was $(0.04) in the both the third quarter of 2024 and 2023.\n\nCapital expenditures were $31 million in the third quarter of 2024, compared to $28 million in the third quarter of 2023.\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of $157 million with no balance outstanding on our New Revolving Credit Facility ($375 million of undrawn commitments).\n\n**Financial Outlook**\n\nRackspace Technology is providing guidance as follows:\n\n**Q4 2024 Guidance**  \n---  \n**Total Revenue**|  $668 - $680 million  \n**Private Cloud Revenue**|  $258 - $264 million  \n**Public Cloud Revenue**|  $410 - $416 million  \n**Non-GAAP Operating Profit**|  $34 - $36 million  \n**Non-GAAP Loss Per Share**|  $(0.03) - $(0.05)  \n**Non-GAAP Other Income (Expense)**|  $(47) – $(51) million  \n**Non-GAAP Tax Expense Rate**|  26| %  \n**Non-GAAP Weighted Average Shares**|  240 million  \n  \nInformation about Rackspace Technology’s use of non-GAAP financial measures is provided below under “Non-GAAP Financial Measures”.\n\nDefinitions of non-GAAP financial measures and the reconciliations to the most directly comparable measures in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”) are provided in subsequent sections of this press release narrative and supplemental schedules. Rackspace Technology has not reconciled Non-GAAP Operating Profit, Non-GAAP Loss Per Share, Non-GAAP Other Income (Expense) or Non-GAAP Tax Expense Rate guidance to the most directly comparable GAAP measure because it does not provide guidance on GAAP net income (loss) or the reconciling items between these Non-GAAP measures and GAAP net income (loss) as a result of the uncertainty regarding, and the potential variability of, certain of these items, such as share-based compensation expense. Accordingly, a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measure guidance to the corresponding GAAP measure is not available without unreasonable effort. With respect to Non-GAAP Operating Profit, Non-GAAP Loss Per Share, Non-GAAP Other Income (Expense) and Non-GAAP Tax Expense Rate guidance, adjustments in future periods are generally expected to be similar to the kinds of charges and costs excluded from these Non-GAAP measures in prior periods, but the impact of such adjustments could be significant.\n\n**Conference Call and Webcast**\n\nRackspace Technology will hold a conference call today, November 12, 2024, at 4:00pm CT / 5:00pm ET to discuss its third quarter 2024 results.

All statements, other than statements of historical fact, included in this press release are, or could be, “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and are made in reliance on the safe harbor protections provided thereunder. These forward-looking statements relate to anticipated financial performance, management’s plans and objectives for future operations, business prospects, outcome of regulatory proceedings, market conditions, and other matters. Any forward-looking statement made in this press release speaks only as of the date on which it is made. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise. Forward-looking statements can be identified by various words such as “expects,” “intends,” “will,” “anticipates,” “believes,” “confident,” “continue,” “propose,” “seeks,” “could,” “may,” “should,” “estimates,” “forecasts,” “might,” “goals,” “objectives,” “targets,” “planned,” “projects,” and similar expressions. These forward-looking statements are based on management’s current beliefs and assumptions and on information currently available to management. Rackspace Technology cautions that these statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside of our control, and could cause future events or results to be materially different from those stated or implied in this press release, including among others, risk factors that are described in Rackspace Technology, Inc.’s Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the sections entitled “Risk Factors” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” contained therein.\n\n**Non-GAAP Financial Measures**\n\nThis press release includes several non-GAAP financial measures such as constant currency revenue, Non-GAAP Gross Profit, Non-GAAP Net Income (Loss), Non-GAAP Operating Profit, Adjusted EBITDA and Non-GAAP Earnings (Loss) Per Share. These non-GAAP financial measures exclude the impact of certain costs, losses and gains that are required to be included in our profit and loss measures under GAAP. Although we believe these measures are useful to investors and analysts for the same reasons they are useful to management, as described in the accompanying pages, these measures are not a substitute for, or superior to, GAAP financial measures or disclosures. Other companies may calculate similarly-titled non-GAAP measures differently, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures. We have reconciled each of these non-GAAP measures to the applicable most comparable GAAP measure in the accompanying pages.\n\n**IR Contact** Sagar HebbarRackspace Technology Investor

Constant currency information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant period over period and is calculated by translating the non-U.S. dollar income statement balances for the most current period to U.S. dollars using the average exchange rate from the comparative period rather than the actual exchange rates in effect during the respective period. We also believe this is an important metric to help investors evaluate our performance in comparison to prior periods.\n\n**Three Months EndedSeptember 30, 2023**| **Three Months EndedSeptember 30, 2024**| **% Change**  \n---|---|---  \n(In millions, except %)| **Revenue**| **Revenue**| **Foreign Currency Translation(a)**| **Revenue in Constant Currency**| **Actual**| **Constant Currency**  \nPublic Cloud| $| 431.5| $| 418.3| $| (0.3| )| $| 418.0| (3.1| )%| (3.1| )%  \nPrivate Cloud| 300.9| 257.5| (0.8| )| 256.7| (14.4| )%| (14.7| )%  \nTotal| $| 732.4| $| 675.8| $| (1.1| )| $| 674.7| (7.7| )%| (7.9| )%  \n  \n**Nine Months EndedSeptember 30, 2023**| **Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024**| **% Change**  \n---|---|---  \n(In millions, except %)| **Revenue**| **Revenue**| **Foreign Currency Translation(a)**| **Revenue in Constant Currency**| **Actual**| **Constant Currency**  \nPublic Cloud| $| 1,308.7| $| 1,265.6| $| (1.0| )| $| 1,264.6| (3.3| )%| (3.4| )%  \nPrivate Cloud| 928.7| 785.9| (3.4| )| 782.5| (15.4| )%| (15.8| )%  \nTotal| $| 2,237.4| $| 2,051.5| $| (4.4| )| $| 2,047.1| (8.3| )%| (8.5| )%  \n  \n(a)| The effect of foreign currency is calculated by translating current period results using the average exchange rate from the prior comparative period.  \n---|---  \n  \n**_Non-GAAP Gross Profit_**\n\nWe present Non-GAAP Gross Profit because we believe the measure is useful in analyzing trends in our underlying, recurring gross margins. We define Non-GAAP Gross Profit as gross profit, adjusted to exclude the impact of share-based compensation expense and other non-recurring or unusual compensation items, purchase accounting-related effects, certain business transformation-related costs, and costs related to the Hosted Exchange incident.\n\n**Three Months Ended September 30,**| **Nine Months Ended September 30,**  \n---|---  \n(In millions)| **2023**| **2024**| **2023**| **2024**  \nGross profit| $| 152.0| $| 137.5| $| 474.7| $| 401.7  \nShare-based compensation expense| 2.0| 2.0| 7.4| 5.9  \nSpecial bonuses and other compensation expense (a)| 1.2| 0.7| 3.3| 2.6  \nPurchase accounting impact on expense (b)| 0.6| 0.3| 1.9| 1.5  \nRestructuring and transformation expenses (c)| 6.2| 2.6| 16.0| 11.8  \nHosted Exchange incident expenses, net of proceeds received or expected to be received under our insurance coverage| —| —| 0.3| —  \nNon-GAAP Gross Profit| $| 162.0| $| 143.1| $| 503.6| $| 423.5  \n  \n(a)| Adjustments for retention bonuses, mainly in connection with restructuring and transformation projects, and the related payroll tax, and payroll taxes associated with the exercise of stock options and vesting of restricted stock. Beginning in the second quarter of 2023, includes expense related to the one-time grant of long-term incentive bonuses as a component of our annual compensation award process.  \n---|---  \n(b)| Adjustment for the impact of purchase accounting from the November 2016 merger on expenses.  \n(c)| Adjustment for the impact of business transformation and optimization activities, as well as associated severance, certain facility closure costs and lease termination expenses.  \n  \n**_Non-GAAP Net Income (Loss), Non-GAAP Operating Profit and Adjusted EBITDA_**\n\nWe present Non-GAAP Net Income (Loss), Non-GAAP Operating Profit and Adjusted EBITDA because they are a basis upon which management assesses our performance and we believe they are useful to evaluating our financial performance. We believe that excluding items from net income that may not be indicative of, or are unrelated to, our core operating results, and that may vary in frequency or magnitude, enhances the comparability of our results and provides a better baseline for analyzing trends in our business.\n\nWe define Non-GAAP Net Income (Loss) as net income (loss) adjusted to exclude the impact of non-cash charges for share-based compensation, special bonuses and other compensation expense, transaction-related costs and adjustments, restructuring and transformation charges, costs related to the Hosted Exchange incident, the amortization of acquired intangible assets, goodwill and asset impairment charges, costs related to the closure of a UK office, the interest expense impact from the debt Refinancing Transactions, and certain other non-operating, non-recurring or non-core gains and losses, as well as the tax effects of these non-GAAP adjustments.\n\nWe define Non-GAAP Operating Profit as income (loss) from operations adjusted to exclude the impact of non-cash charges for share-based compensation, special bonuses and other compensation expense, transaction-related costs and adjustments, restructuring and transformation charges, costs related to the Hosted Exchange incident, the amortization of acquired intangible assets, goodwill and asset impairment charges, costs related to the closure of a UK office, and certain other non-operating, non-recurring or non-core gains and losses.\n\nWe define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) adjusted to exclude the impact of non-cash charges for share-based compensation, special bonuses and other compensation expense, transaction-related costs and adjustments, restructuring and transformation charges, costs related to the Hosted Exchange incident, costs related to the closure of a UK office, certain other non-operating, non-recurring or non-core gains and losses, interest expense, expenses for our accounts receivable purchase agreement, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, and goodwill and asset impairment charges.\n\nNon-GAAP Operating Profit and Adjusted EBITDA are management's principal metrics for measuring our underlying financial performance. Non-GAAP Operating Profit and Adjusted EBITDA, along with other quantitative and qualitative information, are also the principal financial measures used by management and our board of directors in determining performance-based compensation for our management and key employees.\n\nThese non-GAAP measures are not intended to imply that we would have generated higher income or avoided net losses if the November 2016 merger and the subsequent transactions and initiatives had not occurred. In the future we may incur expenses or charges such as those added back to calculate Non-GAAP Net Income (Loss), Non-GAAP Operating Profit or Adjusted EBITDA. Our presentation of Non-GAAP Net Income (Loss), Non-GAAP Operating Profit and Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by these items. Other companies, including our peer companies, may calculate similarly-titled measures in a different manner from us, and therefore, our non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to similarly-titled measures of other companies. Investors are cautioned against using these measures to the exclusion of our results in accordance with GAAP.\n\n**Net loss reconciliation to Non-GAAP Net Loss**\n\n**Three Months Ended September 30,**| **Nine Months Ended September 30,**  \n---|---  \n(In millions)| **2023**| **2024**| **2023**| **2024**  \nNet loss| $| (226.6| )| $| (186.6| )| $| (865.8| )| $| (802.2| )  \nShare-based compensation expense| 17.2| 15.5| 51.9| 47.8  \nSpecial bonuses and other compensation expense (a)| 3.3| 2.7| 9.7| 9.1  \nTransaction-related adjustments, net (b)| 1.6| 1.8| 4.1| 4.4  \nRestructuring and transformation expenses (c)| 14.3| 8.8| 63.0| 42.5  \nHosted Exchange incident expenses, net of proceeds received or expected to be received under our insurance coverage| (5.3| )| (1.2| )| (0.4| )| (1.1| )  \nImpairment of goodwill| 165.7| 141.7| 708.8| 714.9  \nUK office closure (d)| —| —| 12.1| —  \nImpairment of assets, net| 48.4| —| 48.4| 20.0  \nNet gain on divestiture and investments (e)| —| (0.1| )| (0.2| )| (0.2| )  \nDebt modification costs and gain on debt extinguishment| (55.4| )| (18.0| )| (163.1| )| (147.2| )  \nInterest expense impact from the Refinancing Transactions (f)| —| (25.0| )| —| (50.6| )  \nOther adjustments (g)| 2.6| (4.3| )| 0.3| (3.8| )  \nAmortization of intangible assets (h)| 39.7| 38.7| 121.6| 116.0  \nTax effect of non-GAAP adjustments (i)| (13.6| )| 15.7| (16.7| )| (3.6| )  \nNon-GAAP Net Loss| $| (8.1| )| $| (10.3| )| $| (26.3| )| $| (54.0| )  \n  \n**Loss from operations reconciliation to Non-GAAP Operating Profit**\n\n**Three Months Ended September 30,**| **Nine Months Ended September 30,**  \n---|---  \n(In millions)| **2023**| **2024**| **2023**| **2024**  \nLoss from operations| $| (239.4| )| $| (173.7| )| $| (884.2| )| $| (880.3| )  \nShare-based compensation expense| 17.2| 15.5| 51.9| 47.8  \nSpecial bonuses and other compensation expense (a)| 3.3| 2.7| 9.7| 9.1  \nTransaction-related adjustments, net (b)| 1.6| 1.8| 4.1| 4.4  \nRestructuring and transformation expenses (c)| 14.3| 8.8| 63.0| 42.5  \nHosted Exchange incident expenses, net of proceeds received or expected to be received under our insurance coverage| (5.3| )| (1.2| )| (0.4| )| (1.1| )  \nImpairment of goodwill| 165.7| 141.7| 708.8| 714.9  \nImpairment of assets, net| 48.4| —| 48.4| 20.0  \nAmortization of intangible assets (h)| 39.7| 38.7| 121.6| 116.0  \nUK office closure (d)| —| —| 12.1| —  \nNon-GAAP Operating Profit| $| 45.5| $| 34.3| $| 135.0| $| 73.3  \n  \n**Net loss reconciliation to Adjusted EBITDA**\n\n**Three Months Ended September 30,**| **Nine Months Ended September 30,**  \n---|---  \n(In millions)| **2023**| **2024**| **2023**| **2024**  \nNet loss| $| (226.6| )| $| (186.6| )| $| (865.8| )| $| (802.2| )  \nShare-based compensation expense| 17.2| 15.5| 51.9| 47.8  \nSpecial bonuses and other compensation expense (a)| 3.3| 2.7| 9.7| 9.1  \nTransaction-related adjustments, net (b)| 1.6| 1.8| 4.1| 4.4  \nRestructuring and transformation expenses (c)| 14.3| 8.8| 63.0| 42.5  \nHosted Exchange incident expenses, net of proceeds received or expected to be received under our insurance coverage| (5.3| )| (1.2| )| (0.4| )| (1.1| )  \nImpairment of goodwill| 165.7| 141.7| 708.8| 714.9  \nUK office closure (d)| —| —| 12.1| —  \nImpairment of assets, net| 48.4| —| 48.4| 20.0  \nNet gain on divestiture and investments (e)| —| (0.1| )| (0.2| )| (0.2| )  \nDebt modification costs and gain on debt extinguishment| (55.4| )| (18.0| )| (163.1| )| (147.2| )  \nOther expense, net (j)| 2.6| 1.0| 0.3| 11.8  \nInterest expense| 56.5| 18.0| 170.7| 80.1  \nProvision (benefit) for income taxes| (16.5| )| 12.0| (26.1| )| (22.6| )  \nDepreciation and amortization (k)| 90.1| 72.3| 279.2| 220.6  \nAdjusted EBITDA| $| 95.9| $| 67.9| $| 292.6| $| 177.9  \n  \n(a)| Includes expense related to retention bonuses, mainly relating to restructuring and integration projects, and the related payroll tax, senior executive signing bonuses and relocation costs, and payroll taxes associated with the exercise of stock options and vesting of restricted stock. Beginning in the second quarter of 2023, includes expense related to the one-time grant of long-term incentive bonuses as a component of our annual compensation award process.  \n---|---  \n(b)| Includes legal, professional, accounting and other advisory fees related to acquisitions, certain one-time compliance costs related to being a public company, integration costs of acquired businesses, purchase accounting adjustments, payroll costs for employees that dedicate significant time to supporting these projects and exploratory acquisition and divestiture costs and expenses related to financing activities.  \n(c)| Includes consulting and advisory fees related to business transformation and optimization activities, payroll costs for employees that dedicate significant time to these projects, as well as associated severance, certain facility closure costs, and lease termination expenses. The nine months ended September 30, 2024 also includes a $9.0 million MEIA early termination fee associated with the sale of our corporate headquarters in March 2024.  \n(d)| Expense recognized related to the closure of a UK office that we exited in the second quarter of 2023 prior to the lease end date.  \n(e)| Includes gains and losses on investment and from dispositions.  \n(f)| Interest expense impact due to the accounting for contractual interest payments on debt instruments entered into as part of the March 2024 Refinancing Transactions, which reduced interest expense relative to contractual interest cost.  \n(g)| Primarily consists of foreign currency gains and losses.  \n(h)| All of our intangible assets are attributable to acquisitions, including the November 2016 merger.  \n(i)| We utilize an estimated structural long-term non-GAAP tax rate in order to provide consistency across reporting periods, removing the effect of non-recurring tax adjustments, which include but are not limited to tax rate changes, U.S. tax reform, share-based compensation, audit conclusions and changes to valuation allowances. When computing this long-term rate for the 2023 and 2024 interim periods, we based it on an average of the 2022 and estimated 2023 tax rates and 2023 and estimated 2024 tax rates, respectively, recomputed to remove the tax effect of non-GAAP pre-tax adjustments and non-recurring tax adjustments, resulting in a structural non-GAAP tax rate of 26% for all periods. The non-GAAP tax rate could be subject to change for a variety of reasons, including the rapidly evolving global tax environment, significant changes in our geographic earnings mix including due to acquisition activity, or other changes to our strategy or business operations. We will re-evaluate our long-term non-GAAP tax rate as appropriate. We believe that making these adjustments facilitates a better evaluation of our current operating performance and comparisons to prior periods.  \n(j)| Primarily consists of foreign currency gains and losses and expense related to our accounts receivable purchase agreement.  \n(k)| Excludes accelerated depreciation expense related to facility closures.  \n  \n**_Non-GAAP Earnings (Loss) Per Share_**\n\nWe define Non-GAAP Earnings (Loss) Per Share as Non-GAAP Net Income (Loss) divided by our GAAP weighted average number of shares outstanding for the period on a diluted basis and further adjusted for the weighted average number of shares associated with securities which are anti-dilutive to GAAP loss per share but dilutive to Non-GAAP Earnings (Loss) Per Share. Management uses Non-GAAP Earnings (Loss) Per Share to evaluate the performance of our business on a comparable basis from period to period, including by adjusting for the impact of the issuance of shares that would be dilutive to Non-GAAP Earnings (Loss) Per Share.\n\n**Three Months Ended September 30,**| **Nine Months Ended September 30,**  \n---|---  \n(In millions, except per share amounts)| **2023**| **2024**| **2023**| **2024**  \nNet loss attributable to common stockholders| $| (226.6| )| $| (186.6| )| $| (865.8| )| $| (802.2| )  \nNon-GAAP Net Loss| $| (8.1| )| $| (10.3| )| $| (26.3| )| $| (54.0| )  \nWeighted average number of shares - Diluted| 216.0| 226.4| 214.8| 223.6  \nEffect of dilutive securities (a)| 6.4| 9.4| 2.9| 9.3  \nNon-GAAP weighted average number of shares - Diluted| 222.4| 235.8| 217.7| 232.9  \nNet loss per share - Diluted| $| (1.05| )| $| (0.82| )| $| (4.03| )| $| (3.59| )  \nPer share impacts of adjustments to net loss (b)| 1.01| 0.78| 3.91| 3.35  \nPer share impacts of shares dilutive after adjustments to net loss (a)| 0.00| (0.00| )| 0.00| 0.01  \nNon-GAAP Loss Per Share| $| (0.04| )| $| (0.04| )| $| (0.12| )| $| (0.23| )  \n  \n(a)| Reflects impact of awards that would have been anti-dilutive to net loss per share, and therefore not included in the calculation, but would be dilutive to Non-GAAP Loss Per Share and are therefore included in the share count for purposes of this non-GAAP measure. Potential common share equivalents consist of shares issuable upon the exercise of stock options, vesting of restricted stock units (including performance-based restricted stock units) or purchases under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the \"ESPP\"), as well as contingent shares associated with our acquisition of Datapipe Parent, Inc. Certain of our potential common share equivalents are contingent on Apollo achieving pre-established performance targets based on a multiple of their invested capital (\"MOIC\"), which are included in the denominator for the entire period if such shares would be issuable as of the end of the reporting period assuming the end of the reporting period was the end of the contingency period.  \n---|---  \n(b)| Reflects the aggregate adjustments made to reconcile Non-GAAP Net Loss to our net loss, as noted in the above table, divided by the GAAP diluted number of shares outstanding for the relevant period.  \n  \n![](https://ml.globenewswire.com/media/Y2Y5OWNjNjAtYThkZC00ZDM5LWIzMjAtM2E0MTE5ZmI0OTUxLTEwMTcyOTc=/tiny/Rackspace-US-Inc-.png)\n\n### Footer Main\n\n  * [About](https://www.rackspace.com/about)\n  * [Support Portal](https://support.rackspace.com/?_gl=1%2A16wepbu%2A_ga%2AMTY3NjM3ODgxNi4xNTk0ODQyNDQx%2A_ga_P5J3XFCZLB%2AMTYxMzE2NDczNy43LjEuMTYxMzE3MTE4Ny4w&amp%3B_ga=2.58601955.879068005.1612996620-1676378816.1594842441)\n  * [Careers](https://rackspace.jobs)\n  * [Investors](/investor-relations)\n  * [Contact Us](https://www.rackspace.com/contact)\n\n\n\n### Socials\n\n  * [ ](https://www.facebook.com/rackspacetechnology)\n  * [ ](https://www.linkedin.com/company/rackspace-technology/)\n  * [ ](https://twitter.com/Rackspace)\n  * [ ](https://www.youtube.com/rackspace)\n\n\n\nConsulting & Advisory Services\n\n  * [Multicloud Strategy](https://www.rackspace.com/cloud/multicloud)\n  * [Data Modernization](https://www.rackspace.com/data/data-modernization)\n  * [Cloud Security](https://www.rackspace.com/security/multicloud-security)\n\n\n\nProfessional Services\n\n  * [Cloud Adoption & Migration](https://www.rackspace.com/cloud/cloud-migration)\n  * [Cloud Native Enablement](https://www.rackspace.com/applications/cloud-native)\n  * [Application Modernization](https://www.rackspace.com/applications/application-modernization)\n\n\n\nManaged Services\n\n  * [Cloud Management & Operations](https://www.rackspace.com/cloud/cloud-management)\n  * [SaaS Lifecycle Management](https://www.rackspace.com/applications/saas-optimization)\n  * [Data Management](https://www.rackspace.com/data/data-management)\n\n\n\nQuick Links\n\n  * [Cloud Library](https://www.rackspace.com/library)\n  * [Whitepapers](https://www.rackspace.com/resources?region%5B113%5D=113&content_type%5Bwhite_paper%5D=white_paper)\n  * [Infographics](https://www.rackspace.com/resources?region%5B113%5D=113&content_type%5Binfographic%5D=infographic)\n  * [Datasheets](https://www.rackspace.com/resources?region%5B113%5D=113&content_type%5Bdata_sheet%5D=data_sheet)\n  * [Webinars & Videos](https://www.rackspace.com/resources?region%5B113%5D=113&content_type%5Bvideo%5D=video&content_type%5Bwebinar%5D=webinar)\n\n\n\n© 2024 Rackspace Technology, Inc.\n\n### Legal\n\n  * [Trademarks](https://www.rackspace.com/information/legal/copyrights_trademarks)\n  * [Terms](https://www.rackspace.com/information/legal/websiteterms)\n  * [Legal Info](https://www.rackspace.com/information/legal)\n  * [Privacy Center](https://www.rackspace.com/information/legal/privacycenter)\n  * [Responsibility](https://www.rackspace.com/about/responsibility)\n  * [Sitemap](https://www.rackspace.com/sitemap)\n\n\n\n[ × ](javascript:void\\(0\\);)\n\nYou are using an outdated browser and are receiving a degraded experience.
