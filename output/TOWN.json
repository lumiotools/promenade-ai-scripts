Excluding certain items affecting comparability, core earnings (non-GAAP) were $43.39 million, or $0.58 per diluted share, in the current quarter compared to $44.88 million, or $0.60 per diluted share, for the quarter ended September 30, 2023.\n\n\"Our third quarter results continued to deliver increased net interest income and noninterest income contributions from our diverse business model which were in line with expectations. We remain committed to prudent balance sheet management strategies. We were also excited to announce our partnership with Village Bank which will meaningfully enhance our Richmond presence, which is core to our franchise future growth. Lastly, the recently released FDIC Deposit Market Share Report for 2024 continues to demonstrate the strength of our Main Street banking model and core deposit franchise, resulting in the #1 market share, or 30%, in our legacy Virginia Beach-Norfolk-Newport News, VA-NC MSA,\" said G. Robert Aston, Jr., Executive Chairman.\n\n**Highlights for Third Quarter 2024:**\n\n  * Total revenues were $174.52 million, an increase of $1.65 million, or 0.96%, compared to third quarter 2023. Noninterest income increased $2.43 million, driven by growth in residential mortgage banking income and insurance commissions. Partially offsetting the increase in noninterest income was a $0.78 million decline in net interest income.\n  * Total deposits were $14.36 billion, an increase of $482.37 million, or 3.48%, compared to third quarter 2023. Total deposits increased 0.63%, or $90.58 million, in comparison to June 30, 2024, 2.52% on an annualized basis.\n  * Noninterest-bearing deposits decreased 3.99%, to $4.27 billion, compared to third quarter 2023 and represented 29.71% of total deposits. Compared to the linked quarter, noninterest-bearing deposits decreased 0.84%.\n  * Loans held for investment were $11.41 billion, an increase of $239.55 million, or 2.14%, compared to September 30, 2023, but a decrease of $39.23 million, or 0.34%, compared to June 30, 2024.\n  * Annualized return on common shareholders' equity was 8.18% compared to 9.04% in third quarter 2023. Annualized return on average tangible common shareholders' equity (non-GAAP) was 11.54% compared to 13.11% in third quarter 2023.\n  * Net interest margin was 2.90% for the quarter and tax-equivalent net interest margin (non-GAAP) was 2.93%, including purchase accounting accretion of 3 basis points, compared to the prior year quarter net interest margin of 2.95% and tax-equivalent net interest margin (non-GAAP) of 2.98%, including purchase accounting accretion of 5 basis points.\n  * Compared to the linked quarter, net interest margin increased 4 bp and spread increased 6 bp. \n  * The effective tax rate was 11.52% in the quarter compared to 17.34% in third quarter 2023 and 15.93% in the linked quarter. The lower effective tax rate in the current quarter was primarily due to the impact on state and federal taxes from the increase in credits and losses related to LIHTC investment properties placed in service during the period.\n\n\n\n\"Growth has certainly been challenging in the current environment but we believe our balance sheet is well positioned to support mid-single digit growth rates as we look ahead to next year. We plan to aggressively expand Towne Insurance and evaluate other opportunities to enhance our fee-based lines of business to further drive our differentiated business model,\" stated William I. Foster III, President and Chief Executive Officer.\n\n**Quarterly Net Interest Income:**\n\n  * Net interest income was $112.28 million compared to $113.06 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was driven by increased deposit costs, which were mostly offset by higher yields on earning assets.\n  * On an average basis, loans held for investment, with a yield of 5.46%, represented 74.16% of earning assets at September 30, 2024 compared to a yield of 5.13% and 73.45% of earning assets in the third quarter of 2023.\n  * The cost of interest-bearing deposits was 3.28% for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to 2.77% in second quarter 2023. Interest expense on deposits increased $17.96 million, or 27.98%, over the prior year quarter driven by the increase in rate and growth in interest-bearing deposits.\n  * Our total cost of deposits increased to 2.29% from 1.84% for the quarter ended September 30, 2023 due to a combination of higher interest-bearing deposit balances coupled with higher rates. The Federal Reserve Open Market Committee lowered the overnight funds rate late in the third quarter. Management is expecting the decrease to have favorable impact on deposit costs in the fourth quarter of 2024.\n  * Average interest-earning assets totaled $15.40 billion at September 30, 2024 compared to $15.21 billion at September 30, 2023, an increase of 1.26%. The Company anticipates approximately $604 million of cash flows from its securities portfolio to be available for reinvestment in the next twenty-four months.\n  * Average interest-bearing liabilities totaled $10.25 billion, an increase of $493.95 million, or 5.06%, from prior year, driven by deposit growth. Borrowings have declined between periods. There were no short term FHLB borrowings in the third quarter of 2024, compared to an average of $248.91 million in the prior year quarter.\n\n\n\n**Quarterly Provision for Credit Losses:**\n\n  * The quarterly provision for credit losses was a benefit of $1.10 million compared to an expense of $1.01 million in the prior year quarter and a benefit of $177 thousand in the linked quarter.\n  * The allowance for credit losses on loans decreased $2.36 million in third quarter 2024, compared to the linked quarter. The decrease in the allowance was driven by a modest decline in the loan portfolio, primarily in higher-risk real estate construction and development loans, combined with continued strength in credit quality, and improvements in macroeconomic forecast scenarios utilized in our model.\n  * Net loan charge-offs were $0.68 million in the quarter compared to net recoveries of $1.07 million in the prior year quarter and $19 thousand in the linked quarter. Year-to-date 2024, net loan charge-offs were $1.18 million compared to net loan charge-offs of $2.81 million in first nine months of 2023.\n  * The ratio of net charge-offs to average loans on an annualized basis was 0.02% in third quarter 2024, compared to (0.04)% in third quarter 2023 and 0.00% in the linked quarter.\n  * The allowance for credit losses on loans represented 1.08% of total loans at September 30, 2024, compared to 1.12% at September 30, 2023, and 1.10% at June 30, 2024. The allowance for credit losses on loans was 18.70 times nonperforming loans compared to 17.60 times at September 30, 2023 and 19.08 times at June 30, 2024.\n\n\n\n**Quarterly Noninterest Income:**\n\n  * Total noninterest income was $62.24 million compared to $59.81 million in 2023, an increase of $2.43 million, or 4.06%.\n  * Residential mortgage banking income was $11.79 million compared to $10.65 million in third quarter 2023. Loan volume increased to $598.18 million in third quarter 2024 from $520.41 million in third quarter 2023. Both, the number of loans originated and the per-loan average balance increased in third quarter 2024 compared to third quarter 2023. Refinance activities increased in the quarter after more than a year of low activity. Residential purchase activity was 91.49% of production volume in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 95.96% in third quarter 2023. Management expects mortgage production volumes to be positively impacted by any additional reductions in the Federal Reserve overnight rate.\n  * While level with the linked quarter at 3.28%, gross margins on residential mortgage sales increased 11 basis points from 3.17% in third quarter 2023.\n  * Total net insurance commissions increased $1.95 million, or 8.20%, to $25.73 million in third quarter 2024 compared to 2023. This increase was primarily attributable to increases in property and casualty commissions, which were driven by organic growth.\n  * Property management fee revenue decreased 12.34%, or $1.58 million, to $11.22 million in third quarter 2024 compared to 2023. Reservation levels declined compared to the prior year.\n\n\n\n**Qua****rterly Noninterest Expense:**\n\n  * Total noninterest expense was $126.90 million compared to $117.70 million in 2023, an increase of $9.20 million, or 7.81%. This increase was primarily attributable to growth in salaries and employee benefits of $4.87 million, professional fees of $1.95 million, software of $0.66 million, data processing of $0.56 million, and advertising and marketing of $0.51 million.\n  * Salaries and benefits expense increases were driven by an increase in banking personnel and production incentives.\n  * Investment in technology related to banking services and information monitoring continued to drive both direct and indirect costs. Professional fees increased due to consulting and outside services. Software costs increased due to higher core system costs, while data processing increased due to higher processing costs and merchant fee increases.\n  * Advertising and marketing increased, driven by business development.\n\n\n\n**Consolidated Balance Sheet Highlights:**\n\n  * Management is focused on strategic balance sheet management with a concentration on controlled loan growth and maintaining strong levels of liquidity.\n  * Total assets were $17.19 billion for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, a $119.18 million increase compared to $17.07 billion at June 30, 2024.

There were declines in several loan categories from the linked quarter, with the most significant decline in the real estate construction and development category. The Company continued to maintain strong credit discipline throughout the period.\n  * Mortgage loans held for sale increased $76.27 million, or 40.56%, compared to prior year and $63.56 million, or 31.66%, compared to the linked quarter, driven by the increase in production.\n  * Total deposits increased $482.37 million, or 3.48%, primarily in interest-bearing demand and time deposits, compared to prior year. In the linked quarter comparison, total deposits increased $90.58 million, or 2.52% on an annualized basis.\n  * Noninterest-bearing deposits decreased $177.23 million, or 3.99%, compared to prior year and $36.15 million, or 0.84%, compared to the linked quarter, primarily in commercial and escrow accounts.\n  * Total borrowings decreased $116.22 million, or 28.55%, compared to third quarter 2023 and $4.35 million, or 1.47%, compared to the linked quarter.

We remain\ncommitted to prudent balance sheet management strategies. We were also excited to announce our\npartnership with Village Bank which will meaningfully enhance our Richmond presence, which is core to\nour franchise future growth. Lastly, the recently released FDIC Deposit Market Share Report for 2024\ncontinues to demonstrate the strength of our Main Street banking model and core deposit franchise,\nresulting in the #1 market share, or 30%, in our legacy Virginia Beach-Norfolk-Newport News, VA-NC\nMSA,\" said G. Robert Aston, Jr., Executive Chairman.\nHighlights for Third Quarter 2024:\n• Total revenues were $174.52 million, an increase of $1.65 million, or 0.96%, compared to third\nquarter 2023. Noninterest income increased $2.43 million, driven by growth in residential\nmortgage banking income and insurance commissions. Partially offsetting the increase in\nnoninterest income was a $0.78 million decline in net interest income.\n• Total deposits were $14.36 billion, an increase of $482.37 million, or 3.48%, compared to third\nquarter 2023. Total deposits increased 0.63%, or $90.58 million, in comparison to June 30, 2024,\n2.52% on an annualized basis.\n1\n• Noninterest-bearing deposits decreased 3.99%, to $4.27 billion, compared to third quarter 2023 and\nrepresented 29.71% of total deposits. Compared to the linked quarter, noninterest-bearing deposits\ndecreased 0.84%.\n• Loans held for investment were $11.41 billion, an increase of $239.55 million, or 2.14%, compared\nto September 30, 2023, but a decrease of $39.23 million, or 0.34%, compared to June 30, 2024.\n• Annualized return on common shareholders' equity was 8.18% compared to 9.04% in third quarter\n2023. Annualized return on average tangible common shareholders' equity (non-GAAP) was\n11.54% compared to 13.11% in third quarter 2023.\n• Net interest margin was 2.90% for the quarter and tax-equivalent net interest margin (non-GAAP)\nwas 2.93%, including purchase accounting accretion of 3 basis points, compared to the prior year\nquarter net interest margin of 2.95% and tax-equivalent net interest margin (non-GAAP) of 2.98%,\nincluding purchase accounting accretion of 5 basis points.\n• Compared to the linked quarter, net interest margin increased 4 bp and spread increased 6 bp.\n• The effective tax rate was 11.52% in the quarter compared to 17.34% in third quarter 2023 and\n15.93% in the linked quarter. The lower effective tax rate in the current quarter was primarily due\nto the impact on state and federal taxes from the increase in credits and losses related to LIHTC\ninvestment properties placed in service during the period.\n\"Growth has certainly been challenging in the current environment but we believe our balance sheet is well\npositioned to support mid-single digit growth rates as we look ahead to next year. We plan to aggressively\nexpand Towne Insurance and evaluate other opportunities to enhance our fee-based lines of business to\nfurther drive our differentiated business model,\" stated William I. Foster III, President and Chief Executive\nOfficer.\nQuarterly Net Interest Income:\n• Net interest income was $112.28 million compared to $113.06 million for the quarter ended\nSeptember 30, 2023. The decrease was driven by increased deposit costs, which were mostly\noffset by higher yields on earning assets.\n• On an average basis, loans held for investment, with a yield of 5.46%, represented 74.16% of\nearning assets at September 30, 2024 compared to a yield of 5.13% and 73.45% of earning assets in\nthe third quarter of 2023.\n• The cost of interest-bearing deposits was 3.28% for the quarter ended September 30, 2024,\ncompared to 2.77% in second quarter 2023. Interest expense on deposits increased $17.96 million,\n2\nor 27.98%, over the prior year quarter driven by the increase in rate and growth in interest-bearing\ndeposits.\n• Our total cost of deposits increased to 2.29% from 1.84% for the quarter ended September 30, 2023\ndue to a combination of higher interest-bearing deposit balances coupled with higher rates. The\nFederal Reserve Open Market Committee lowered the overnight funds rate late in the third quarter.\nManagement is expecting the decrease to have favorable impact on deposit costs in the fourth\nquarter of 2024.\n• Average interest-earning assets totaled $15.40 billion at September 30, 2024 compared to\n$15.21 billion at September 30, 2023, an increase of 1.26%. The Company anticipates\napproximately $604 million of cash flows from its securities portfolio to be available for\nreinvestment in the next twenty-four months.\n• Average interest-bearing liabilities totaled $10.25 billion, an increase of $493.95 million, or 5.06%,\nfrom prior year, driven by deposit growth. Borrowings have declined between periods. There were\nno short term FHLB borrowings in the third quarter of 2024, compared to an average of $248.91\nmillion in the prior year quarter.\nQuarterly Provision for Credit Losses:\n• The quarterly provision for credit losses was a benefit of $1.10 million compared to an expense of\n$1.01 million in the prior year quarter and a benefit of $177 thousand in the linked quarter.\n• The allowance for credit losses on loans decreased $2.36 million in third quarter 2024, compared to\nthe linked quarter. The decrease in the allowance was driven by a modest decline in the loan\nportfolio, primarily in higher-risk real estate construction and development loans, combined with\ncontinued strength in credit quality, and improvements in macroeconomic forecast scenarios\nutilized in our model.\n• Net loan charge-offs were $0.68 million in the quarter compared to net recoveries of $1.07 million\nin the prior year quarter and $19 thousand in the linked quarter. Year-to-date 2024, net loan charge-\noffs were $1.18 million compared to net loan charge-offs of $2.81 million in first nine months of\n2023.\n• The ratio of net charge-offs to average loans on an annualized basis was 0.02% in third quarter\n2024, compared to (0.04)% in third quarter 2023 and 0.00% in the linked quarter.\n• The allowance for credit losses on loans represented 1.08% of total loans at September 30, 2024,\ncompared to 1.12% at September 30, 2023, and 1.10% at June 30, 2024. The allowance for credit\nlosses on loans was 18.70 times nonperforming loans compared to 17.60 times at September 30,\n3\n2023 and 19.08 times at June 30, 2024.\nQuarterly Noninterest Income:\n• Total noninterest income was $62.24 million compared to $59.81 million in 2023, an increase of\n$2.43 million, or 4.06%.\n• Residential mortgage banking income was $11.79 million compared to $10.65 million in third\nquarter 2023. Loan volume increased to $598.18 million in third quarter 2024 from\n$520.41 million in third quarter 2023. Both, the number of loans originated and the per-loan\naverage balance increased in third quarter 2024 compared to third quarter 2023. Refinance\nactivities increased in the quarter after more than a year of low activity. Residential purchase\nactivity was 91.49% of production volume in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 95.96% in third\nquarter 2023. Management expects mortgage production volumes to be positively impacted by any\nadditional reductions in the Federal Reserve overnight rate.\n• While level with the linked quarter at 3.28%, gross margins on residential mortgage sales increased\n11 basis points from 3.17% in third quarter 2023.\n• Total net insurance commissions increased $1.95 million, or 8.20%, to $25.73 million in third\nquarter 2024 compared to 2023. This increase was primarily attributable to increases in property\nand casualty commissions, which were driven by organic growth.\n• Property management fee revenue decreased 12.34%, or $1.58 million, to $11.22 million in third\nquarter 2024 compared to 2023. Reservation levels declined compared to the prior year.\nQuarterly Noninterest Expense:\n• Total noninterest expense was $126.90 million compared to $117.70 million in 2023, an increase of\n$9.20 million, or 7.81%. This increase was primarily attributable to growth in salaries and\nemployee benefits of $4.87 million, professional fees of $1.95 million, software of $0.66 million,\ndata processing of $0.56 million, and advertising and marketing of $0.51 million.\n• Salaries and benefits expense increases were driven by an increase in banking personnel and\nproduction incentives.\n• Investment in technology related to banking services and information monitoring continued to drive\nboth direct and indirect costs. Professional fees increased due to consulting and outside services.\nSoftware costs increased due to higher core system costs, while data processing increased due to\nhigher processing costs and merchant fee increases.\n• Advertising and marketing increased, driven by business development.\n4\nConsolidated Balance Sheet Highlights:\n• Management is focused on strategic balance sheet management with a concentration on controlled\nloan growth and maintaining strong levels of liquidity.\n• Total assets were $17.19 billion for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, a $119.18 million\nincrease compared to $17.07 billion at June 30, 2024.

Such non-GAAP financial measures include the following: fully tax-equivalent net interest margin, core operating earnings, core net\nincome, tangible book value per common share, total risk-based capital ratio, tier one leverage ratio, tier one capital ratio, and the tangible common equity to\ntangible assets ratio. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures to assess the performance of TowneBank’score business and the strength of its\ncapital position. Management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful additional information about TowneBankto assist investors in\nevaluating operating results, financial strength, and capitalization. The non-GAAP financial measures should be considered as additional views of the way our\nfinancial measures are affected by significant charges for credit costs and other factors. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as a\nsubstitute for operating results determined in accordance with GAAP and may not be comparable to other similarly titled measuresof other companies.

(\"Village\"), and its wholly owned bank subsidiary, Village\nBank, a Midlothian, Virginia, based bank with nine banking offices serving the Greater Richmond\nMetropolitan Area and Williamsburg, Virginia. The proposed acquisition of Village and Village Bank has\nbeen approved by the Boards of Directors of TowneBank, Village, and Village Bank and is expected to close\nin first quarter 2025, subject to customary closing conditions, including the receipt of required regulatory\napprovals and the approval of Village's shareholders. At June 30, 2024, Village had total assets of\n$747.73 million, gross loans of $606.09 million, and total deposits of $628.91 million.\nUnder the terms of the Village merger agreement, Village shareholders will receive $80.25 per share in cash\nfor each outstanding share of Village common stock held immediately prior to the effective date of the\nmerger, and each share of Village common stock will be canceled and retired. As a result of the merger,\neach share of Village restricted stock granted under an equity or equity-based compensation plan that is\nunvested or contingent and outstanding, immediately prior to the effective date of the merger, will be fully\nvested and converted into the right to receive $80.25 per share in cash.\nFarmers Bankshares, Inc.: On January 13, 2023, TowneBank completed its acquisition of Farmers and its\nwholly owned bank subsidiary, Farmers Bank, in an all-stock transaction. As part of the merger, Farmers\nand Farmers Bank merged with and into TowneBank.

Based on the closing price of TowneBank's common\nstock on January 13, 2023, of $31.42 per share, the aggregate consideration paid to former Farmers common\nshareholders and holders of equity awards to acquire Farmers common stock was approximately\n$59.60 million.\nThe Farmers merger has been accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting. Under this\nguidance, an entity is required to recognize the assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and the consideration\ngiven at their fair value on the acquisition date. The assets and liabilities, both tangible and intangible, were\nrecorded at their estimated fair values as of the January 13, 2023, merger date. The fair value of\nconsideration exchanged exceeded the recognized amounts of the identifiable net assets and resulted in\ngoodwill of $5.53 million. Goodwill resulted from a combination of expected synergies, acquisition of\nexpanded insurance capabilities, expansion into Isle of Wight and Southampton counties with the addition of\nfive locations, and growth opportunities. None of the goodwill recognized is expected to be deductible for\nincome tax purposes.\n13\nPART I. FINANCIAL INFORMATION\nItem 1.

FINANCIAL INFORMATION\nItem 1. Financial Statements\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nIn general, the macroeconomic forecast scenarios utilized in the current quarter models showed moderate\nimprovements from the previous quarter. Additional factors considered were changes in loan portfolio\ncomposition, interest rates, loan risk ratings, charge-off experience, and inherent risks within specific loan\ngroups.\nCredit quality indicators\nFor commercial credits, the Company's internal credit risk grading analysis assesses the capability of the\nborrower to repay contractual obligations of the loan agreements as scheduled, or at all. The Company's\ninternal credit risk grading system is based on numerous factors, including management's experiences with\nsimilarly graded loans. Credit risk is inherent in the business of extending loans and leases to borrowers and\nis monitored by management and reflected within the allowance for credit losses for loans. The allowance\nfor credit losses is an estimate of expected losses inherent within the Company's loans held for investment\nportfolio.\nCredit risk grades are refreshed on an ongoing basis and affirmed at least semiannually. At affirmation,\nmanagement analyzes the resulting scores, as well as external statistics and factors to track loan performance.\nOn an as-needed basis, credit risk grades may be updated between review periods if new information arises\nrelated to the customer's ability to repay the loan. The Company differentiates its loan segments based on\nshared risk characteristics for which expected credit loss is measured on a pool basis.\nThe Company's internally assigned risk grades are as follows:\nPass - Several pass credit grades comprise loans in this category, which are assigned based on varying levels\nof risk, ranging from credits that are secured by cash or marketable securities, to management attention\ncredits, which have all the characteristics of an acceptable credit risk but warrant a more than normal level of\nmonitoring.\nSpecial Mention - These assets are characterized by well-defined credit weaknesses and carry the distinct\npossibility that the Company will sustain some loss if such weakness or deficiency is not corrected.\nSubstandard - The borrower's ability to repay is threatened by a clearly defined weakness, related to the\ncapacity of the obligor, which jeopardizes ultimate repayment of the loan according to terms.\nDoubtful - The borrower's ability to repay in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and\nvalues, is highly questionable and improbable. Some loss of principal and income is likely; however, the\ntotal amount of such loss cannot be determined at the present time. Loans in this category are immediately\nplaced on nonaccrual status, with all payments applied to principal until such time as the potential loss\nexposure is eliminated.\nFor consumer-related credits, the Company utilizes credit scores calculated and maintained by one of three\ncredit bureaus. Credit scores range between 300 and 850, with a lower score indicating a potentially higher\nrisk. Credit scores are updated semi-annually, with the most recent update in July 2024.\n29\nPART I.

In most cases\nthese are loans in which the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty that we believe will necessitate the\noperation or sale of the underlying collateral to provide substantially all of the repayment.\nIn estimating ECL, ASC 326 prescribes that if foreclosure is probable, a CDA is required to be measured at\nthe fair value of collateral. If foreclosure is not probable, the borrower is experiencing difficulty and\nrepayment is expected to be repaid by operation of collateral, the Company uses the fair value of collateral\nexcluding selling costs to determine ACL. At September 30, 2024, CDA loans measured at the fair value of\ncollateral totaled $16.91 million, with specific reserves of zero. At December 31, 2023, CDA loans\nmeasured at the fair value of collateral totaled $10.39 million, with specific reserves of zero.\n34\nPART I. FINANCIAL INFORMATION\nItem 1.

FINANCIAL INFORMATION\nItem 1. Financial Statements\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNote 8. Segment Reporting\nThe Company has three reportable segments: Banking, Realty, and Insurance. The Banking segment\nprovides loan and deposit services to retail and commercial customers. The Realty segment provides\nresidential resort property management services and originations of a variety of mortgage loans. Prior to the\nsale of BHHS Towne Realty in second quarter 2023, the Realty segment also offered residential real estate\nservices and commercial and residential title insurance. Mortgage loans are originated and sold principally\nin the secondary market through purchase commitments from investors. The Insurance segment provides\nfull-service commercial and retail insurance and employee benefit services.\nAll the segments are service-based. Due largely to overlapping geographic markets, the Banking segment\noffers a distribution and referral network for the Realty and Insurance segments, and the Realty and\nInsurance segments offer a similar network for the Banking segment. A major distinction is the source of\nincome. The Realty and Insurance segments are commission and fee-based, while the Banking segment is\ndriven principally by net interest income.\nSegment profit and loss is measured by net income after income tax. Inter-segment transactions are recorded\nat cost and eliminated as part of the consolidation process. Because of the interrelationships of the various\nsegments, the information presented is not indicative of how the segments would perform if they operated as\nindependent entities.\nEffective April 27, 2023, the Company transferred its ownership interest in BHHS Towne Realty, which was\nformerly a subsidiary of TowneBank, to BHHS RW Towne Realty, LLC, in exchange for a minority interest\nin that company which is accounted for as an equity method investment. The transaction also included the\ncombination of the contributing companies’ respective mortgage, title, and property management lines of\nbusiness. Our income from this investment is recorded in the Banking segment in other income.\nThe following tables provide information about reportable segments and reconciliation of such information\nto the Consolidated Financial Statements for the periods indicated (dollars in thousands):\n40\nPART I.

Commitments and Contingencies\nCommitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to customers provided there is no violation of any\ncondition set forth in the contract.

Variable Interest Entities\nLow Income Housing Tax Credit Partnerships\nAs part of its community reinvestment initiatives, the Company invests within its footprint in multi-family\naffordable housing developments as a limited partner. The Company has determined that it is not the\nprimary beneficiary of these partnerships because the general partner of each limited partnership has both the\npower to direct the activities that most significantly affect the performance of each partnership and the\nobligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that could be significant to the entities.\n45\nPART I.

Fair Value Disclosures\nFair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability\n(an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction\nbetween market participants on the measurement date. A three-level valuation hierarchy was established for\ndisclosure of fair value measurements. The valuation hierarchy is based upon the transparency of inputs to\nthe valuation of an asset or liability as of the measurement date. The three levels are defined as follows:\nLevel 1 Valuation is based on quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\nLevel 2 Valuation is based on observable inputs, other than Level 1 prices, which are observable or can be\ncorroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.\nLevel 3 Valuation is based on unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and\nwhich are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.\nThe following is a description of valuation methodologies used for instruments measured at fair value on a\nrecurring basis.\nSecurities available for sale: Fair values are based on published market prices or dealer quotes. If a quoted\nmarket price is not available, fair value is estimated using quoted market prices for similar securities. The\nfair value of certain corporate securities is based on a discounted cash flow model which utilized Level 3, or\nunobservable inputs, the most significant of which were a discount rate and weighted-average life.\nMortgage loans held for sale: TowneBank elects to carry mortgage loans held for sale at fair value. Fair\nvalues of mortgage loans held for sale are based on commitments on hand from investors or, if commitments\nhave not yet been obtained, prevailing market rates. Best efforts delivery transactions set the sale price with\nthe investor on a loan-by-loan basis at the time each loan is locked with the respective borrower. Intent to\n46\nPART I. FINANCIAL INFORMATION\nItem 1. Financial Statements\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nsell on the mandatory market is established for mortgage loans held for sale when TowneBank enters into a\nloan commitment or interest rate lock with the customer. For additional information about mortgage loans\nheld for sale, refer to Note 15.\nDerivative financial instruments: Interest rate lock commitments, related to the origination of mortgage\nloans held for sale, are recorded at estimated fair value based on the value of the underlying loan, which in\nturn is based on quoted prices for similar loans in the secondary market. However, this value is adjusted by a\nfactor which considers the likelihood that the loan in a lock position will ultimately close. This factor, the\nfall-out rate, is derived from the Company's internal data and is adjusted using management judgment. The\nfall-out rate is largely dependent on the processing stage that a loan is currently in and the change in\nprevailing interest rates from the time of the rate lock. As such, interest rate lock commitments are classified\nas recurring Level 3. For the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, and the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023, the Company used a weighted-average fall-out rate of 13.53%.\nForward loan sale commitments: Loan sales agreements are evaluated to determine whether they meet the\ndefinition of a derivative because facts and circumstances may differ significantly. The Company has made\nthe determination that the best efforts contracts do not meet the definition of derivative instruments, and the\nCompany has elected the fair value option for the forward loan sale commitments. Forward loan sale\ncommitments that economically hedge the closed loan inventory are recognized at fair value on the\nConsolidated Balance Sheets in other assets or other liabilities, with changes in their fair values recorded as a\ncomponent of mortgage banking activities in the Consolidated Statements of Income. The Company\nestimates the fair value of its forward loan sale commitments using a methodology similar to that used for\nderivative loan commitments.\nTo mitigate the effect of the interest rate risk inherent in providing rate lock commitments to borrowers, the\nCompany enters into either a forward sales contract to sell loans to investors when using best efforts or a\nTBA mortgage-backed security under mandatory delivery. The forward sales contracts lock in a price for the\nsale of loans with similar characteristics to the specific rate lock commitments. The Company has not\nformally designated these derivatives as a qualifying hedge relationship; accordingly, changes to fair value\nare recorded to earnings each period. These valuations fall into a Level 2 category.\n47\nPART I. FINANCIAL INFORMATION\nItem 1.

These adjustments to fair value usually result from application of lower-of-\ncost-or-market accounting or write-downs of individual assets. For assets measured at fair value on a\nnonrecurring basis that were still held on the balance sheet at quarter-end, the following table provides the\nlevel of valuation assumptions used to determine each adjustment and the carrying value of the related assets\nat September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 (in thousands):\nSeptember 30, 2024 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Fair Value\nOther real estate owned and other nonperforming assets $ — $ — $ — $ —\nDecember 31, 2023 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Fair Value\nOther real estate owned and other nonperforming assets $ — $ — $ 908 $ 908\nThe following is a description of valuation methodologies used for assets measured on a nonrecurring basis.\nLoans: Loans for which repayment of the loan is expected to be provided solely by the value of the\nunderlying collateral are considered collateral-dependent and are valued based on the fair value of such\ncollateral. Collateral values are estimated using inputs based on observable market data or inputs based on\ncustomized discounting criteria. In cases where such inputs were unobservable, specifically, discounts\napplied to appraisal values to adjust such values to current market conditions or to reflect net realizable\nvalue, the loan balance is reflected within Level 3 of the hierarchy.\nOther real estate owned and other nonperforming assets: The fair value of foreclosed property is\nmeasured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis (upon initial recognition or subsequent impairment) and is\nclassified within Level 3 of the valuation hierarchy. When transferred from the loan portfolio, other real\nestate owned is adjusted to fair value less estimated selling costs and is subsequently carried at the lower of\n49\nPART I.

Borrowings\nTowneBank is a member of the FHLB and may borrow funds based on criteria established by the FHLB.\nThese advances could be either short- or long-term, depending on our related cost and needs, and are secured\nby a blanket lien on residential mortgages and other real estate-secured loans. The FHLB may call these\nborrowings if the adjusted collateral balance falls below the borrowing level.\nThe Company also has REPOs which are overnight short-term investments and are not insured by the FDIC.\nSecurities pledged as collateral under these REPO financing arrangements cannot be sold or repledged by the\nsecured party and are therefore accounted for as a secured borrowing. Collateral pledging requirements for\nREPOs are monitored daily. Securities pledged as collateral for REPOs consist primarily of MBSs issued by\nGSEs and GNMA. The market value of securities pledged could decline. Due to the overnight short-term\nnature of REPOs, the carrying amount of repurchase agreements approximates fair value, and potential risk\ndue to a decline in the value of the pledged collateral is low.\nWith the January 2023 acquisition of Farmers, the Company assumed two issues of capital notes with an\naggregate carrying value of $8.50 million. The first issue, with a carrying value of $2.69 million at\nacquisition, bears a 3.00% fixed annual rate and matures August 14, 2025. The second issue, with a carrying\nvalue of $5.82 million at acquisition, bears a 3.25% fixed annual rate and matures August 14, 2027. These\nissues are included in subordinated debt, net on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nOn February 9, 2022, the Company issued $250.00 million of fixed-to-floating-rate subordinated notes due\nFebruary 15, 2032, in a public offering. The Company received $246.90 million in net proceeds after\ndeducting discounts and issuance costs. The subordinated notes accrue interest at a fixed rate of 3.125% for\nthe first five years until February 15, 2027. From and including this date and for the remaining five years of\nthe subordinated notes' term, interest will accrue at a floating rate of three-month SOFR plus 1.68%. The\nCompany may redeem the subordinated notes, in whole or in part, on or after February 15, 2027.\nThe following table presents information related to our borrowings for the dates indicated (in thousands):\nSeptember 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nMarket value of securities pledged as collateral for REPOs $ 61,440 $ 72,051\nCarrying value of capital notes assumed with Farmers acquisition $ 7,941 $ 7,757\nCarrying value of Company issued capital notes $ 248,503 $ 248,039\n52\nPART I.

FINANCIAL INFORMATION\nItem 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following table lists key asset and liability categories at September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, for\ncomparative purposes.\nSeptember 30, June 30, Total Change\n(dollars in thousands) 2024 2024 Change %\nTotal assets $ 17,188,020 $ 17,068,843 $ 119,177 0.70 %\nTotal cash and cash equivalents 1,296,064 1,301,446 (5,382) (0.41) %\nTotal investment securities 2,600,336 2,488,788 111,548 4.48 %\nMortgage loans held for sale 264,320 200,762 63,558 31.66 %\nLoans, net of unearned income and deferred costs (\"loans\") 11,412,518 11,451,747 (39,229) (0.34) %\nAllowance for credit losses on loans (123,191) (125,552) (2,361) (1.88) %\nNoninterest-bearing deposits 4,267,628 4,303,773 (36,145) (0.84) %\nTotal deposits 14,363,170 14,272,588 90,582 0.63 %\nTotal borrowings 290,819 295,169 (4,350) (1.47) %\nAllowance for credit losses on loans to period end loans 1.08 % 1.10 %\nTotal assets increased 0.70%, or $119.18 million, in the quarter, driven by increases in investment securities\nand mortgage loans held for sale, offset by declines in loans. Investment securities increased due to\npurchases and market value improvements in the quarter, and mortgage loans held for sale increased driven\nby elevated mortgage loan levels. Loans declined, primarily in real estate construction and land\ndevelopment. Net unrealized losses in our AFS debt securities decreased to $110.62 million at\nSeptember 30, 2024, from $172.93 million at June 30, 2024. Construction and land development loans are\nsignificantly impacted by the higher rate environment of recent years. The number of new projects has\ndecreased, leading to declines in loan levels as existing projects are completed. Management's focus remains\non strategic balance sheet management with a concentration on controlling loan growth and maintaining\nstrong levels of capital and liquidity.\nTotal deposits increased $90.58 million during the quarter. Noninterest-bearing deposits decreased\n$36.15 million in the quarter. Management believes noninterest-bearing deposits are returning to their pre-\nCOVID19 seasonal swings.\nThe following table presents the key components affecting the Company's financial performance in the three\nand nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to prior year.\nThree Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\n(dollars in thousands) 2024 2023 Change %\nNet income attributable to TowneBank $ 42,949 $ 44,862 $ (1,913) (4.26) %\nNet interest income 112,282 113,058 (776) (0.69) %\nNoninterest income 62,236 59,806 2,430 4.06 %\nTotal revenue 174,518 172,864 1,654 0.96 %\nProvision for credit losses (1,100) 1,007 (2,107) (209.24) %\nNoninterest expense 126,900 117,702 9,198 7.81 %\nAcquisition-related expenses 460 572 (112) (19.58) %\nNoninterest expense, excluding acquisition-related expenses 126,440 117,130 9,310 7.95 %\n55\nPART I.

This discussion should be read in conjunction with our\nConsolidated Financial Statements and notes to the financial statements appearing elsewhere in this report.\nCritical Accounting Estimates and Significant Accounting Policies\nPreparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with GAAP requires management\nto make judgments, assumptions, and estimates in certain circumstances that affect amounts reported in the\nConsolidated Financial Statements and accompanying footnotes. Certain accounting estimates are\nparticularly sensitive because of their significance to the financial statements and because of the possibility\nthat future events affecting them may differ significantly from management's current judgments. We\nconsider our policy for the allowance for credit losses to be a critical accounting policy. Refer to our 2023\nAnnual Report to Shareholders for further discussion of significant accounting policies.\nANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nConsolidated Performance Summary\nResults of Operations: We reported the following for the periods indicated:\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30, September 30, September 30,\n(dollars in thousands, except per share data) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nTotal revenue $ 174,518 $ 172,864 $ 516,590 $ 538,575\nOperating revenue (non-GAAP) $ 174,498 $ 172,310 $ 516,496 $ 529,189\nDiluted earnings per share $ 0.57 $ 0.60 $ 1.61 $ 1.67\nReturn on average assets 1.00 % 1.06 % 0.95 % 1.00 %\nReturn on average tangible assets (non-GAAP) 1.09 % 1.17 % 1.04 % 1.11 %\nReturn on average equity 8.12 % 8.96 % 7.80 % 8.48 %\nReturn on average tangible equity (non-GAAP) 11.42 % 12.97 % 11.11 % 12.35 %\nNet interest margin 2.90 % 2.95 % 2.83 % 3.09 %\nNet interest margin TE (non-GAAP) 2.93 % 2.98 % 2.86 % 3.12 %\nNet Interest Income.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nmarket interest rates and the volume and mix of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. The yields and\nrates in this discussion and in the following tables have been computed based upon interest income and\nexpense adjusted to a TE basis (non-GAAP) using a 21% federal marginal tax rate.\nThe following graph summarizes the key components of net interest margin over the past eight quarters. The\ncost of interest-bearing liabilities declined 9 bp in the quarter while the yield on interest-earning assets\ndeclined 3 bp as the spread between earning asset yield and interest-bearing liability cost widened and net\ninterest margin increased for the second consecutive quarter.\nMargin Comparison by Quarter\n6.00\n5.14 5.11\n4.80 4.87 4.95\n4.61\n4.49\n4.16\n4.00\n3.53\n3.39 3.30 3.36 3.27\n3.01 2.98 3.07\n3.05\n2.54 2.84 2.86 2.75 2.89 2.93\n2.67\n2.00\n2.07\n1.96\n1.82 1.80 1.78 1.84\n1.65\n1.11\n0.00\n12/31/22 03/31/23 06/30/23 09/30/23 12/31/23 03/31/24 06/30/24 09/30/24\nEarning Asset Yield Interest-Bearing Liability Cost\nInterest Spread Net Interest Margin - TE\nTowneBank reported net interest income, on a TE basis (\"net interest income-TE\"), of $113.39 million for\nthe quarter ended September 30, 2024, which was $0.86 million, or 0.76%, below the third quarter 2023 total\nof $114.26 million. Interest income-TE was $197.73 million in the quarter ended September 30, 2024,\n$13.68 million, or 7.43%, higher than the $184.05 million reported for quarter-end September 30, 2023, due,\nprimarily, to Federal Reserve actions to combat inflation resulting in higher rates. However, interest expense\nincreased $14.54 million, or 20.83%, for the same period, driven by year-over-year increases in both rate and\nvolume.\nAverage earning assets increased to $15.40 billion in the quarter ended September 30, 2024, from\n$15.21 billion in the comparative prior year quarter, an increase of 1.26%. The yield on earning assets was\n5.11% in the quarter ended September 30, 2024, up compared to 4.80% in prior year. Average loan balances\nin third quarter 2024 were $11.42 billion, $249.50 million, or 2.23%, higher than the same period one year\nago, and loan yields increased 33 bp.\nAverage interest-bearing liabilities were $10.25 billion in third quarter 2024, up from $9.75 billion in the\ncomparative prior year quarter, an increase of 5.06%. The cost of interest-bearing liabilities was 3.27% in\nthird quarter 2024, compared to 2.84% in third quarter 2023, a 43 bp increase.\n57\nPART I. FINANCIAL INFORMATION\nItem 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nTE net interest margin, which is net interest income-TE expressed as a percentage of average earning assets,\nwas 2.93%, or 5 bp lower, for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to the September 30, 2023,\nquarter margin of 2.98%.\nThe Federal Reserve's Federal Funds target range declined in late September 2024 after holding at a 23-year\nhigh since third quarter 2023. Repricing of both assets and liabilities lag behind rate changes, driven by the\nproperties of the underlying product, and has continued to impact yields and margins. The following table\nlists the Federal Funds target range for the periods indicated.\nTarget Range for\nDate Federal Funds (%)\nMarch 16, 2020 - March 16, 2022 0 - 0.25\nMarch 17, 2022 - May 4, 2022 0.25 - 0.50\nMay 5, 2022 - June 15, 2022 0.75 - 1.00\nJune 16, 2022 - July 27, 2022 1.50 - 1.75\nJuly 28, 2022 - September 21, 2022 2.25 - 2.50\nSeptember 22, 2022 - November 2, 2022 3.00 - 3.25\nNovember 3, 2022 - December 14, 2022 3.75 - 4.00\nDecember 15, 2022 - February 1, 2023 4.25 - 4.50\nFebruary 2, 2023 - March 22, 2023 4.50 - 4.75\nMarch 23, 2023 - May 3, 2023 4.75 - 5.00\nMay 4, 2023 - July 26, 2023 5.00 - 5.25\nJuly 27, 2023 - September 18, 2024 (1) 5.25 - 5.50\nSeptember 19, 2024 - present 4.75 - 5.00\n(1) 23-year high\nThe increases in rate in the past two years, coupled with a shift in deposit mix into higher yielding deposit\nproducts, has negatively impacted margin. From a repricing standpoint, interest-bearing liabilities are\ntypically short-term and reprice more quickly than interest-earning assets which, in a rising rate environment,\nleads to margin compression. The Company has seen a 4 bp improvement in interest-bearing deposit costs\nfrom the linked quarter as a result of the decrease in the Federal Funds target range. In third quarter 2024,\nthe Company saw a second sequential improvement in margin after steady declines beginning with 1st\nquarter 2023. Management believes we will continue to see margin improvements continuing into 2025 as\nwe see the continued repricing of interest-bearing deposits and fixed rate loans.\nThe following tables depict our interest income on earning assets and related average yields, as well as\ninterest expense on interest-bearing liabilities and related average rates paid for the periods presented.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nProvision for Credit Losses. The third quarter 2024 provision for credit losses was a benefit of\n$1.10 million, compared to an expense of $1.01 million for the same period one year ago. The provision for\ncredit losses in the first nine months of 2024 was a benefit of $2.15 million compared to an expense of\n$16.23 million in the prior year. Our 2023 provision included an initial provision for credit losses of\n$4.01 million related to non-PCD loans and commitments acquired in the Farmers transaction in first quarter\n2023.\nIn third quarter 2024, we had net charge-offs of $0.68 million compared to net recoveries of $1.07 million in\nthird quarter 2023. In the first nine months of 2024, net charge-offs were $1.18 million, compared to\n$2.81 million for the same period in 2023. The primary source of charge-offs in 2024 has been indirect\nconsumer auto loans. Factors impacting the current quarter provision included the decline in higher-risk real\nestate construction and development loans, continued strength in credit quality, and a continuation of\nimprovements in macroeconomic forecast scenarios utilized in our models.\nNoninterest Income. Total noninterest income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024,\nwas $62.24 million and $192.04 million, respectively, compared to $59.81 million and $188.53 million for\nthe same respective periods in 2023. Noninterest income as a percentage of total operating income was\n35.67% for third quarter 2024, compared with 34.71% for third quarter 2023. In the nine-month comparison,\nexcluding a nonrecurring gain on sale of equity investments transaction totaling $8.83 million in 2023,\nnoninterest income would have increased 6.87%, or $12.35 million, over the prior year.\nOur noninterest income primarily consists of fee income produced by our three reportable segments, less\napplicable commission expenses.

Refinance activities increased to nearly 9% for\nthe first time since mid-2022. Purchase volume was 91.49% of total loan volume in third quarter 2024,\ncompared to 95.96% in the prior year quarter. Recent declines in mortgage rates have benefited refinance\nactivities while new purchase volume remains constrained by low housing inventories.\nInsurance commissions increased due to organic growth in property and casualty commission income.\nContingency and bonus revenue, which consists primarily of amounts received from various property and\ncasualty carriers, also increased in third quarter 2024 compared to 2023 due to organic growth. Management\ncontinues to search for opportunities to grow insurance segment revenues both organically and through\ndisciplined mergers and acquisitions.\nProperty management income, net of commission expense, decreased in the quarter but increased in the first\nnine months over comparative periods in 2023. The primary source of income from this line of business is\nvacation property commissions and associated fees. Income in the first nine months of 2024 increased over\nprior year, driven by an acquisition in March 2024. Occupancy levels declined in third quarter 2024\ncompared to 2023.\nIn the first nine months of 2024, BOLI income increased compared to 2023 due to the inclusion of proceeds\nfrom life insurance claims in second quarter 2024. We sold seven investment securities with a carrying\nvalue of $48.10 million in the first nine months of 2024. We did not sell any investment securities in third\nquarter 2024 or the first nine months of 2023. We recorded net gains on the sale of AFS securities of\n$74 thousand in the first nine months of 2024 and zero net gains or losses on the sale of AFS securities for\nthe same period in 2023. The Company recorded a gross gain on the sale of BHHS Towne Realty of\n$8.83 million in second quarter 2023.\nNoninterest Expense. For the quarter ended September 30, 2024, total noninterest expense was\n$126.90 million, which was $9.20 million more than comparative 2023. As a percentage of operating\nincome, noninterest expense was 72.72% for third quarter 2024 and 68.31% for comparative 2023. In the\nnine months ended September 30, 2024, total noninterest expense, at $376.48 million, was an increase of\n$9.15 million over the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\n62\nPART I.

Salaries and benefits expense increased driven by increases in\nbanking personnel, higher producer incentives focused on generating deposits, and health insurance costs.\nThe Company opened a full-service branch in second quarter 2024. The Company also opened full-service\nbranches in mid-second quarter 2023 and third quarter 2023, which are impacting the year-over-year\ncomparison.\nIn our Banking segment, we had a total of 1,471 full-time equivalent employees at September 30, 2024, as\ncompared to 1,446 at September 30, 2023.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nmonths: in Cary, NC, in April 2024; in Raleigh, NC, in November 2023; and in Richmond, VA, in April\n2023. In addition, we relocated our regional headquarters in Greensboro, NC, in April 2024, and a branch in\nGreenville, NC, in January 2024.\nInvestment in technology related to banking services and information monitoring continued to drive both\ndirect and indirect costs. Professional fees increased due to consulting and outside services. Software costs\nincreased due to higher core system costs, while data processing increased due to higher volumes and\nprocessing costs, merchant fee increases, and core conversion expenses in one of our vacation management\ncompanies.\nAcquisition-related expenses decreased in third quarter 2024 compared to 2023. The Company acquired\nFarmers in first quarter 2023. Directors fees and expenses increased in the quarter and year to date primarily\ndue to costs associated with a strategic planning retreat.\nFDIC and other insurance expense was relatively flat in the quarterly comparison, but increased year to date.\nThese fluctuations were due to a combination of timing differences associated with quarterly assessment\nincreases and a true-up of the FDIC special assessment on certain banks related to the Deposit Insurance\nFund.\nProvision for Income Taxes. Our provision for income tax expense represented an effective tax rate of\n11.52% in third quarter 2024 compared to an effective rate of 17.34% for third quarter 2023. The lower\neffective tax rate in the current quarter was primarily due to the impact on state and federal taxes from the\nincrease in credits and losses related to LIHTC investment properties placed in service during the period.\nSegment Performance Summary\nOur reportable segments are a traditional full-service community bank, a realty business, and a full-service\ninsurance agency. In this section, we discuss the performance and financial results of our segments. For\nfurther financial details, see \"Note 8. Segment Reporting\" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nin this report.\nBanking Segment. Income before income tax provision and noncontrolling interest from the Banking\nsegment was $40.71 million and $110.13 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024,\ncompared to $47.16 million and $126.73 million for the same respective periods in 2023.\nTotal revenue increased marginally in the three months ended September 30, 2024, but decreased in the nine-\nmonth comparison to 2023. Declines in net interest income were offset by increases in investment\ncommission income and BOLI for a marginal quarterly increase. Year to date, the decline in net interest\nincome outpaced increases in noninterest income. Margin compression was the primary driver of the decline\nin net interest income because growth in interest expense on deposits outpaced growth in interest income.\nThe provision for credit losses decreased in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 compared to prior\nyear due to decreases in our real estate construction and development portfolio, continued strength in credit\nquality, and a continuation of improvements in macroeconomic forecast scenarios utilized in our model.\nNoninterest expenses increased in the third quarter and nine-month comparison to 2023. Salaries and\nemployee benefits increased in both the quarter and first nine months of 2024 compared to 2023.\nProfessional fees, data processing, and software, which are included in other expenses, increased a combined\n$2.92 million in the quarter and $4.90 million in the first nine months of 2024 compared to 2023.\nAcquisition expenses, which are also included in other expenses, declined $8.46 million in the first nine\n64\nPART I.

FINANCIAL INFORMATION\nItem 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nResidential mortgage production increased in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, compared to\n2023, driven by higher production levels and per loan averages. In the third quarter of 2024, refinance\nactivities increased to almost 9% of our quarterly volume driven by a decline in mortgage rates. Low homes\nfor sale inventory levels continue to be a challenge in our footprint and industry wide.\nThe following table presents key quarterly information related to our residential mortgage production\n(dollars in thousands):\nThree Months Ended\nSeptember 30, June 30, March 31, December 31, September 30,\n2024 2024 2024 2023 2023\nGross realized gain on sales and fees as a % of\nloans originated 3.28 % 3.28 % 3.34 % 3.06 % 3.17 %\nLoans Sold $ 526,998 $ 605,134 $ 410,895 $ 468,014 $ 567,291\nPurchase % 91.49 % 94.85 % 95.66 % 95.06 % 95.96 %\nRefinance % 8.51 % 5.15 % 4.34 % 4.94 % 4.04 %\nThe Company has focused on aligning its infrastructure costs with production levels and will continue to\nevaluate its cost structure in relation to the current economic environment. As part of its realignment, the\ntotal number of full-time equivalent employees in our residential mortgage banking business decreased to\n402 at September 30, 2024, compared to 464 at September 30, 2023. Additionally, the Company is placing\ngreater emphasis on increasing production via retail channels as opposed to volumes from partner\nrelationships and is focused on enhancing margin-related gains on sale. Margins on the sale of loans\nincreased 11 bp over third quarter 2023. The Company expects to continue to benefit from the cost savings\ninitiatives begun in 2023. In the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, the Company recognized\nincome of $0.61 million and $1.42 million, respectively, on its residential mortgage banking business,\ncompared to losses of $0.80 million and $6.35 million in the third quarter and first nine months of 2023,\nrespectively.\nNet property management fees decreased in the third quarter but increased in the first nine months of 2024,\ncompared to 2023. The nine-month increase was driven by revenue from an acquisition that occurred in\nMarch 2024. Property management fees are from short-term vacation rentals. Following a surge in domestic\ntravel post-pandemic, the short-term rental market expanded, as did the form of those rentals.

FINANCIAL INFORMATION\nItem 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nOverview. At September 30, 2024, total assets were $17.19 billion, which is $352.98 million, or 2.10%,\nhigher than total assets at December 31, 2023. Our loan portfolio, less unearned income and deferred costs,\nmade up 66.40% of our period-end assets and totaled $11.41 billion at September 30, 2024. Average assets\nfor the quarter ended September 30, 2024, were $17.03 billion, an increase of $345.10 million, or 2.07%,\nfrom the quarter ended December 31, 2023. Management continues to prioritize balance sheet strength and\nstrong levels of liquidity in the current environment.\nAverage earning assets for third quarter 2024 increased $304.13 million from fourth quarter 2023 to\n$15.40 billion. Our average total deposits were $14.26 billion for third quarter 2024, an increase of\n$350.72 million, or 2.52%, compared to fourth quarter 2023. Average noninterest-bearing deposits for the\nquarter ended September 30, 2024, decreased $102.93 million, or 2.33%, from the quarter ended\nDecember 31, 2023.\nInterest-Bearing Deposits in Financial Institutions. Interest-bearing deposits in other banks and at the FRB\n- Richmond and federal funds sold are used for daily cash management purposes, management of short-term\ninterest rate opportunities, and liquidity. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, these\nbalances were $1.16 billion and $1.04 billion and consisted mainly of deposits in other banks and overnight\ndeposits with the FRB.\nThe average balance of interest-bearing deposits in other banks and at the FRB during third quarter 2024 was\n$1.23 billion, or 7.96%, of average total earning assets, compared to $1.14 billion, or 7.56%, of average total\nearning assets for fourth quarter 2023.\nSecurities Available for Sale. Our AFS debt securities portfolio is reported at fair value, which is\ndetermined based on market prices of similar instruments. The AFS debt securities portfolio was\n$2.36 billion at September 30, 2024, compared with $2.13 billion at December 31, 2023. The average\nbalance during third quarter 2024 was $2.31 billion, compared to $2.01 billion during the quarter ended\nDecember 31, 2023. The average AFS debt securities portfolio represented 14.98% and 13.35% of average\nearning assets in third quarter 2024 and the quarter ended December 31, 2023, respectively. During the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2024, we had sales, maturities, and calls totaling $206.52 million in investment\nsecurities that were classified as AFS.\nNet unrealized losses related to the fair value of AFS debt securities decreased $40.29 million in the first\nnine months of 2024. Unrealized losses in the AFS debt securities portfolio are primarily driven by the\nincrease in market interest rates rather than credit quality. AFS debt securities are reviewed quarterly to\nassess whether an allowance for credit losses is required. An allowance for credit losses on impaired AFS\ndebt securities is recorded when the present value of expected future cash flows of the investment security is\nless than its amortized cost basis, limited to the amount by which the security's amortized cost basis exceeds\nthe fair value. At September 30, 2024, the allowance for credit losses on AFS debt securities was\n$1.17 million, compared to $1.50 million at December 31, 2023. For further financial details, see \"Note 4.\nInvestment Securities\" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this report.\nSecurities Held to Maturity. HTM debt securities are valued at amortized cost and totaled $212.35 million\nat September 30, 2024, and $477.51 million at December 31, 2023. The average balance during third quarter\n2024 was $212.38 million, compared with $517.86 million in fourth quarter 2023, representing 1.38% and\n3.43% of total average earning assets, respectively. These securities are held primarily for yield and\n70\nPART I. FINANCIAL INFORMATION\nItem 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\npledging purposes. HTM debt securities are reviewed quarterly for potential credit losses. The allowance\nfor credit losses on HTM debt securities was $77 thousand at September 30, 2024, and $84 thousand at\nDecember 31, 2023. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we had maturities and calls totaling\n$265.16 million in HTM debt securities. For further financial details, see \"Note 4. Investment Securities\" of\nthe Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this report.\nMortgage Loans Held for Sale. At September 30, 2024, we held $264.32 million in mortgage loans\noriginated and intended for sale in the secondary market, as compared with $149.99 million at December 31,\n2023. Average mortgage loans held for sale were 1.35% of average earning assets for the quarter ended\nSeptember 30, 2024, compared to 1.08% for the quarter ended December 31, 2023. The majority of\nmortgage loans held for sale are precommitted to investors, which minimizes our interest rate risk.\nLoan Portfolio. Loans, net of unearned income and deferred costs, were $11.41 billion at September 30,\n2024, which was a $83.50 million, or 0.74%, increase over $11.33 billion at December 31, 2023. As a\npercentage of total average earning assets, average loans were 74.16% for the quarter ended September 30,\n2024, compared with 74.39% for the quarter ended December 31, 2023. We expect to continue managing\nloan growth to align with deposit growth trends with a target of annualized low to mid-single digits.\nCommercial real estate loans constituted 58.75% and 58.69% of our loan portfolio at September 30, 2024\nand December 31, 2023, respectively.

Classified commercial real estate loans totaled $26.95 million, or 73.08% of total\nclassified credits at September 30, 2024.\nAllowance for Credit Losses and Asset Quality. The allowance for credit losses on funded loans at\nSeptember 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, was $123.19 million and $126.46 million, respectively. The\ndecrease in the allowance was driven by a modest decline in the loan portfolio, primarily in higher-risk real\nestate construction and development loans, combined with continued strength in credit quality, and\nimprovements in macroeconomic forecast scenarios utilized in our model. Loan balances in indirect\nconsumer auto loans declined $11.33 million compared to the linked quarter and coupled with seasoning of\nthe remaining loans in that category resulted in a decline in that category's allowance. The allowance was\nequal to 1.08% of total loans outstanding at September 30, 2024, compared with 1.12% at December 31,\n2023.\nClassified loans, defined as loans in the substandard and doubtful categories, represented 0.32% of total\nloans at both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Total criticized loans, defined as special mention\nand classified loans, declined from $142.34 million in fourth quarter 2023 to $139.82 million in third quarter\n2024. Loans 30 to 89 days past due totaled $7.61 million at September 30, 2024, as compared to\n$9.52 million at December 31, 2023. The allowance for credit losses on funded loans was equal to 18.70x of\nnonperforming loans at September 30, 2024, compared with 18.48x at December 31, 2023. Our allowance\nfor credit losses, for both funded loans and unfunded commitments, was determined by evaluating numerous\nvariables, many of which are interrelated or dependent on other assumptions and estimates, and considered\npast events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts.

When loans are placed on\nnonaccrual status, interest receivable is reversed against interest income recognized in the current period, and\nany prior-year unpaid interest is charged off against the allowance for loan losses. Interest payments\nreceived thereafter are applied as a reduction of the remaining principal balance so long as doubt exists as to\nthe ultimate collection of the principal. Loans are removed from nonaccrual status when they become\ncurrent as to both principal and interest and when the collection of principal or interest is no longer doubtful.\nSimilarly, residential mortgage loans and other consumer loans are also placed on nonaccrual status when\nfull collection of principal and interest becomes doubtful, or when any portion of principal or interest\nbecomes 120 days past due, whichever occurs first, unless the debt is both well-secured and in the process of\ncollection or exempt under regulatory rules.\nAt September 30, 2024, we had $7.47 million in nonperforming assets, which amounted to 0.04% of total\nassets.

In addition to meeting member demand for\nloans and deposit withdrawals, we must fund balance sheet growth and meet current obligations in relation to\noperating costs, investment repurchases, and short-term funding sources. We manage liquidity through\nadherence to established policies, which are monitored by management and ALCO. Our liquid assets consist\nof cash, interest-bearing deposits in financial institutions, federal funds sold, securities available for sale,\ninvestments, and loans maturing within one year. Mortgage loans held for sale are typically held on our\nbooks for less than 60 days and are funded, primarily, through their sale. We also have the ability to access\nshort-term and long-term borrowings through FHLB, correspondent banks, federal funds purchased, and the\nFederal Reserve discount window.\n77\nPART I.

Financial measures related to regulatory capital under Basel III are utilized by\nbanking regulators as a basis for assessing a bank's capital adequacy. Management believes these ratios\nprovide insight into the Company's financial condition, asset quality, and capital adequacy. These ratios\ninclude:\n• Common equity Tier 1 to risk-based assets (CET1)\n• Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets\n• Total risk-based capital to risk-based assets\n• Tier 1 capital to average quarterly assets (Tier 1 leverage)\nRisk-based capital guidelines for United States banking organizations have been issued by the Federal\nReserve System, the FDIC, and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. Per these guidelines, we\nconsider our sources of liquidity to be adequate to meet our estimated needs and have sufficient alternative\nsources of liquidity to meet our funding commitments and growth plans.\nRisk-based capital ratios, which include CET1, Tier 1 capital, total capital, and leverage capital, are\ncalculated based on Basel III regulatory transitional guidance related to the measurement of capital, risk-\nweighted assets, and average assets. Under FDIC rules, we are considered \"well capitalized\" as of\nSeptember 30, 2024.\nThe following table provides information on our risk-based capital position as of the dates indicated (dollars\nin thousands):\nSeptember 30, December 31,\n2024 2023 2023\nRisk-based capital ratios (1):\nCommon equity Tier 1 (4.5% minimum requirement) 12.63 % 12.19 % 12.18 %\nTier 1 (6.0% minimum requirement) 12.76 % 12.31 % 12.29 %\nTotal (8.0% minimum requirement) 15.54 % 15.09 % 15.06 %\nTier 1 leverage ratio (4.0% minimum requirement) 10.38 % 10.06 % 10.17 %\n(1) Well-capitalized requirements under Prompt Corrective Action: Common equity Tier 1 of 6.5%, Tier 1 of 8.0%, Total of 10.0%,\nand Tier 1 leverage ratio of 5%.\n78\nPART I.

We encourage\nreaders to consider the unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements and other financial information\ncontained in this Form 10-Q in their entirety, and not to rely on any single financial measure.\nTaxable Equivalent Basis. Interest income, yields, and ratios on a taxable equivalent basis are considered\nnon-GAAP financial measures. Management believes net interest income on a taxable equivalent basis\nprovides an insightful picture of the interest margin for comparison purposes. The taxable equivalent basis\nalso allows management to assess the comparability of revenue arising from both taxable and tax-exempt\nsources. The taxable equivalent basis assumes a federal statutory tax rate of 21%.\nThe Company presents return on average assets, return on average tangible assets, return on average equity,\nand return on average tangible equity. Management excludes the balance of average goodwill and other\nintangible assets from the Company's calculation of return on average tangible assets and return on average\ntangible equity. This adjustment allows management to review the Company's core operating results and\ncore capital position.\nNon-GAAP Reconciliations.

FINANCIAL INFORMATION\nItem 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nDisclosures About Market Risk. Our ALCO monitors loan, investment, and liability portfolios to ensure\ncomprehensive management of interest rate risk. These portfolios are analyzed for proper fixed-rate and\nvariable-rate mixes under various interest rate scenarios.\nThe asset and liability management process is designed to achieve relatively stable net interest margins and\nensure liquidity by coordinating the volumes, maturities, or repricing opportunities of earning assets,\ndeposits, and borrowed funds. It is the responsibility of the ALCO to determine and achieve the most\nappropriate volume and mix of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, as well as ensure an adequate\nlevel of liquidity and capital within the context of corporate performance goals. The ALCO also sets policy\nguidelines and establishes long-term strategies with respect to interest rate risk exposure and liquidity. The\nALCO meets regularly to review our interest rate risk and liquidity positions in relation to present and\nprospective market and business conditions, and adopts funding and balance sheet management strategies\nintended to ensure that the potential impact on earnings and liquidity as a result of fluctuations in interest\nrates is within acceptable standards.\nMarket Risk. The effective management of market risk is essential to achieving our strategic objectives. As\na financial institution, our most significant market risk exposure is interest rate risk. The primary objective\nof interest rate risk management is to minimize the effect that changes in interest rates have on net interest\nincome. This is accomplished through active management of asset and liability portfolios, with a focus on\nthe strategic pricing of asset and liability accounts and management of appropriate maturity mixes of assets\nand liabilities. The goal of these activities is the development of appropriate maturity and repricing\nopportunities in our portfolios of assets and liabilities that will produce consistent net interest income during\nperiods of changing interest rates.\nPrudent balance sheet management requires processes that monitor and protect us against unanticipated or\nsignificant changes in the level of market interest rates. Net interest income stability should be maintained in\nchanging rate environments by ensuring that interest rate risk is kept to an acceptable level.\nThe ability to reprice our interest-sensitive assets and liabilities over various time intervals is of critical\nimportance. An asset-sensitive balance sheet structure implies that assets, such as loans and securities, will\nreprice faster than liabilities; consequently, net interest income should be positively affected in an increasing\ninterest rate environment. Conversely, a liability-sensitive balance sheet structure implies that liabilities,\nsuch as deposits, will reprice faster than assets; consequently, net interest income should be positively\naffected in a decreasing interest rate environment.\nInterest Rate Risk. We utilize a variety of measurement techniques to identify and manage our exposure to\ninterest rates. We do not use off-balance-sheet financial instruments to manage interest rate sensitivity and\nnet interest income. We do, however, use a variety of traditional and on-balance-sheet tools to manage our\ninterest rate risk. Gap analysis, which monitors the \"gap\" between interest-sensitive assets and liabilities, is\none such tool. In addition, we use simulation modeling to forecast future balance sheet and income\nstatement behavior. By studying the effects on net interest income of rising, stable, and falling interest rate\nscenarios, we can position ourselves to take advantage of anticipated interest rate movement and to protect\nourselves from unanticipated rate movements by understanding the dynamic nature of our balance sheet\ncomponents.\nAt September 30, 2024, we had $4.81 billion more liabilities than assets subject to repricing within one year.\nThis is a one-day position, which is continually changing and is not necessarily indicative of our position at\nany other time.\n81\nPART I. FINANCIAL INFORMATION\nItem 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nEarnings Simulation Analysis: Management uses simulation analysis to measure the sensitivity of net\ninterest income to changes in interest rates. The model calculates an earnings estimate based on current and\nprojected balances and rates. This method is subject to the accuracy of the assumptions that underlie the\nprocess, but it provides an additional analysis of the sensitivity of earnings to changes in interest rates to\nstatic gap analysis. Assumptions used in the model rates are derived from historical trends, peer analysis,\nand management's outlook, and include loans and deposit growth rates and projected yields and rates. All\nmaturities, calls, and prepayments in the securities portfolio are assumed to be reinvested in like instruments.\nMortgage loans and mortgage-backed securities prepayment assumptions are based on industry estimates of\nprepayment speeds for portfolios with similar coupon ranges and seasoning. Different interest rate scenarios\nand yield curves are used to measure the sensitivity of earnings to changing interest rates. Interest rates on\ndifferent asset and liability accounts move differently when the prime rate changes and are reflected in the\ndifferent rate scenarios.\nThe following table represents interest rate sensitivity on our net interest income using different rate\nscenarios:\n% Change in\nChange in Prime Rate Net Interest Income\n+ 200 basis points 8.70 %\n+ 100 basis points 6.11 %\n- 100 basis points 2.31 %\n- 200 basis points 4.45 %\nMarket Value Simulation: Market value simulation is used to calculate the estimated fair value of assets\nand liabilities over different interest rate environments. Market values are calculated based on discounted\ncash flow analysis. The net market value is the market value of all assets minus the market value of all\nliabilities. The change in net market value over different rate environments is an indication of the longer-\nterm repricing risk in the balance sheet. The same assumptions are used in the market value simulation as in\nthe earnings simulation. The following table reflects the change in net market value over different rate\nenvironments:\nChange in Net Market Value\nChange in Prime Rate (dollars in thousands)\n+ 200 basis points $ (64,255)\n+ 100 basis points $ (81,770)\n- 100 basis points $ 60,777\n- 200 basis points $ 96,276\nRates of loan prepayments are based on historical experience of similar loans in rising and falling rate\nenvironments. Assumptions used on non-maturity deposit rate changes, or betas, are based on historical\nexperience of similar account types. Time deposit pricing is assumed to change consistent with the changes\nin other market yield curves, such as U.S. Treasury rates. Those loan and deposit assumptions are subject to\nthe risk of rates changing faster or slower or by a higher absolute amount, as well as differing competitive\nenvironments. Because these correlations are based on competitive and market conditions, the Company\nnotes that future results may be different from estimates, and such differences could be material.\n82\nPART I.

Based on our reviews, we are\nnot aware of any material modifications that should be made to the condensed financial statements\nreferred to above for them to be in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United\nStates of America.\nWe have previously audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting\nOversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”), the consolidated balance sheet of the Company as of\nDecember 31, 2023, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income (loss),\ncash flows and equity for the year then ended (not presented herein), and in our report dated February\n28, 2024, we expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements. In our\nopinion, the information set forth in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet as of\nDecember 31, 2023, is fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to the consolidated balance sheet\nfrom which it has been derived.\nBasis for Review Results\nThese interim financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. We are a public\naccounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the\nCompany in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of\nthe Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our review in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. A review of interim financial\nstatements consists principally of applying analytical procedures and making inquiries of persons\nresponsible for financial and accounting matters. It is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted\nin accordance with the standards of the PCAOB, the objective of which is the expression of an opinion\nregarding the financial statements taken as a whole. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion.\nCharlotte, NC\nNovember 6, 2024"
