          "content": "CODE OF BUSINESS CONDUCT AND ETHICS\nOF ANPAC BIO-MEDICAL SCIENCE CO., LTD.\n(ADOPTED BY THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF ANPAC BIO-MEDICAL SCIENCE CO., LTD.\nON October 31, 2019, EFFECTIVE UPON THE EFFECTIVENESS OF ITS REGISTRATION\nSTATEMENT ON FORM F-1 RELATING TO ITS INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING)\nI. Purpose\nAnPac Bio-Medical Science Co., Ltd., its subsidiaries and its variable interest entities\n(the “Company”) is committed to conducting its business in accordance with applicable laws,\nrules and regulations and the highest standards of business ethics. This Code of Business\nConduct and Ethics (the “Code”) contains general guidelines for conducting the business of\nthe Company. To the extent this Code requires a higher standard than required by\ncommercial practice or applicable laws, rules or regulations, the Company adheres to these\nhigher standards.\nThis Code is designed to deter wrongdoing and to promote:\n(i) honest and ethical conduct, including the ethical handling of actual or apparent\nconflicts of interest between personal and professional relationships;\n(ii) full, fair, accurate, timely, and understandable disclosure in reports and\ndocuments that the Company files with, or submits to, the U.S. Securities and Exchange\nCommission (the “SEC”) and in other public communications made by the Company;\n(iii) compliance with applicable governmental laws, rules and regulations;\n(iv) prompt internal reporting of violations of the Code; and\n(v) accountability for adherence to the Code.\nII. Applicability\nThis Code applies to all directors, officers and employees of the Company, whether\nthey work for the Company on a full-time, part-time, consultative, or temporary basis\n(together, “AnPac Personnel”).\nThe Board of Directors of the Company (the “Board”) has appointed the leader of\nLegal and Compliance Department as the compliance officer for the Company (the\n“Compliance Officer”). If you have any questions regarding the Code or would like to report\nany violation of the Code, please contact the Compliance Officer. Any questions or violations\nof the Code involving an executive officer, which include the Chief Executive Officer, Chief\nFinancial Officer and any other persons who perform similar functions for the Company\n(each an “executive officer”), shall be directed or reported to any of our independent director\non the Board or the members of the Audit Committee of the Board, and any such questions or\nviolations will be reviewed directly by the Board or the Audit Committee of the Board.\n1\nIII. Conflicts of Interest\nA. Identifying Conflicts of Interest\nA conflict of interest occurs when a AnPac Personnel’s private interest interferes, or\nappears to interfere, in any way with the interests of the Company as a whole. You should\nactively avoid any private interest that may influence your ability to act in the interests of the\nCompany or that may make it difficult to perform your work objectively and effectively. In\ngeneral, the following are considered conflicts of interest:\n1. Competing Business. No AnPac Personnel may be concurrently employed by\na business that competes with the Company or deprives it of any business.\n2. Corporate Opportunity. No AnPac Personnel should use corporate property,\ninformation or his or her position with the Company to secure a business opportunity that\nwould otherwise be available to the Company. If you discover a business opportunity that is\nin the Company’s line of business, through the use of the Company’s property, information or\nposition, you must first present the business opportunity to the Company before pursuing the\nopportunity in your individual capacity.\n3. Financial Interests.\n(i) No AnPac Personnel may have any financial interest (ownership or\notherwise), either directly or indirectly through a spouse or other family member, in any other\nbusiness entity if such financial interest adversely affects the employee’s performance of\nduties or responsibilities to the Company, or requires the employee to devote certain time\nduring such AnPac Personnel’s working hours at the Company;\n(ii) no AnPac Personnel or his/her family member may hold any\nownership interest in a privately-held company that is in competition with the Company;\n(iii) a AnPac Personnel or his/her family member may hold up to but no\nmore than 5.0% ownership interest in a publicly traded company that is in competition with\nthe Company;\n(iv) no AnPac Personnel or his/her family member may hold any\nownership interest in a company that has a material business relationship with the Company;\nand\n(v) ownership interest mentioned above in clause (i)-(iv) do not include a\nAnPac Personnel’s ownership of share incentive awards and resulting securities in another\ncompany.\nIf a AnPac Personnel has ownership interest as described in clause (iii) and (v)\nabove, the AnPac Personnel must immediately report such ownership in accordance with\nrelevant rules and policies of the Company.\n4. Loans or Other Financial Transactions. No AnPac Personnel may obtain loans\nor guarantees of personal obligations from, or enter into any other personal financial\ntransaction with, any company that is a material customer, supplier or competitor of the\nCompany. This guideline does not prohibit arms-length transactions with recognized banks\nor other financial institutions.\n2\n5. Service on Boards and Committees. No AnPac Personnel should serve on a\nboard of directors or trustees or on a committee of any entity (whether profit or not-for-profit)\nwhose interests reasonably could be expected to conflict with those of the Company. AnPac\nPersonnel must obtain prior approval from the Board before accepting any such board or\ncommittee position. The Company may revisit its approval of any such position at any time\nto determine whether service in such position is still appropriate.\nIt is difficult to list all of the ways in which a conflict of interest may arise, and we\nhave provided only a few, limited examples. If you are faced with a difficult business\ndecision that is not addressed above, ask yourself the following questions:\n• Is it legal?\n• Is it honest and fair?\n• Is it in the best interests of the Company?\nB. Disclosure of Conflicts of Interest\nThe Company requires that AnPac Personnel fully disclose any situations that\nreasonably could be expected to give rise to a conflict of interest. If you suspect that you\nhave a conflict of interest, or something that others could reasonably perceive as a conflict of\ninterest, you must report it immediately to the Compliance Officer. Conflicts of interest may\nonly be waived by the Board, or the Audit Committee of the Board, and will be promptly\ndisclosed to the public to the extent required by law.\nC. Family Members and Work\nThe actions of family members outside the workplace may also give rise to conflicts\nof interest because they may influence a AnPac Personnel’s objectivity in making decisions\non behalf of the Company. If a member of a AnPac Personnel’s family is interested in doing\nbusiness with the Company, the criteria as to whether to enter into or continue the business\nrelationship, and the terms and conditions of the relationship, must be no less favorable to the\nCompany compared with those that would apply to a non-relative seeking to do business with\nthe Company under similar circumstances.\nAnPac Personnel should report any situation involving family members that could\nreasonably be expected to give rise to a conflict of interest to their supervisor or the\nCompliance Officer. For purposes of this Code, “family members” or “members of your\nfamily” include your spouse, brothers, sisters and parents, in-laws and children.\nIV. Gifts and Entertainment\nA. Generally\nThe giving and receiving of gifts is common business practice. Appropriate business\ngifts and entertainment are welcome courtesies designed to build relationships and\nunderstanding among business partners. However, gifts and entertainment should never\ncompromise, or appear to compromise, your ability to make objective and fair business\ndecisions.\n3\nIt is the responsibility of AnPac Personnel to use good judgment in this area. As a\ngeneral rule, AnPac Personnel may give or receive gifts or entertainment to or from\ncustomers or suppliers only if the gift or entertainment could not be viewed as an inducement\nto any particular business decision. Any gift and entertainment expenses made on behalf of\nthe Company must comply with the relevant guidelines, policies and instructions.\nAnPac Personnel may only accept appropriate gifts. We encourage AnPac Personnel\nto submit gifts received to the Company.\nThe Company’s business conduct is founded on the principle of “fair transaction.”\nTherefore, no AnPac Personnel may give or receive kickbacks, bribe others, or secretly give\nor receive commissions or any other personal benefits.\nB. United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act Compliance\nThe United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”) prohibits giving anything\nof value, directly or indirectly, to officials of foreign governments or foreign political\ncandidates in order to obtain or retain business. A violation of FCPA not only violates the\nCompany’s policy but is also a civil or criminal offense under FCPA which the Company is\nsubject to after the Code becomes effective. No AnPac Personnel shall give or authorize\ndirectly or indirectly any illegal payments to government officials of any country. While the\nFCPA does, in certain limited circumstances, allow nominal “facilitating payments” to be\nmade, any such payment must be discussed with and approved by your supervisor in advance\nbefore it can be made.\nC. Political Contributions\nExcept as approved in advance by the Chief Executive Officer or Chief Financial\nOfficer of the Company, the Company prohibits political contributions (directly or through\ntrade associations) by any AnPac Personnel on behalf of the Company. Prohibited political\ncontribution activities include:\n(i) any contributions of Company funds or other assets for political purposes;\n(ii) encouraging individual AnPac Personnel to make any such contribution; and\n(iii) reimbursing AnPac Personnel for any political contribution.\nV. Fair Dealing\nThe Company strives to compete and to succeed through superior performance and\nproducts and without the use of unethical or illegal practices. Accordingly, the Company’s\nAnPac Personnel should respect the rights of, and should deal fairly with, the Company’s\ncustomers, suppliers, competitors and AnPac Personnel and should not take unfair advantage\nof anyone through manipulation, concealment, abuse of privileged information or any\nmaterial misrepresentation. For example, an individual should not:\n(i) give or receive kickbacks, bribe others, or secretly give or receive\ncommissions or any other personal benefits;\n(ii) spread rumors about competitors, customers or suppliers that the individual\nknows to be false;\n4\n(iii) intentionally misrepresent the nature of quality of the Company’s products; or\n(iv) otherwise seek to advance the Company’s interests by taking unfair advantage\nof anyone through unfair dealing practices, including engaging in unfair practices through a\nthird party.\nVI. Protection and Use of Company Assets\nAnPac Personnel should protect the Company’s assets and ensure their efficient use\nfor legitimate business purposes only. Theft, carelessness and waste have a direct impact on\nthe Company’s profitability. The use of the funds or assets of the Company, whether for\npersonal gain or not, for any unlawful or improper purpose is strictly prohibited.\nTo ensure the protection and proper use of the Company’s assets, each AnPac\nPersonnel should:\n(i) exercise reasonable care to prevent theft, damage or misuse of Company\nproperty;\n(ii) promptly report the actual or suspected theft, damage or misuse of Company\nproperty;\n(iii) safeguard all electronic programs, data, communications and written materials\nfrom inadvertent access by others; and\n(iv) use Company property only for legitimate business purposes.\nVII. Intellectual Property and Confidentiality\n1. All inventions, creative works, computer software, and technical or trade\nsecrets developed by an employee in the course of performing the employee’s duties or\nprimarily through the use of the Company’s materials and technical resources while working\nat the Company, shall be the property of the Company.\n2. The Company maintains a strict confidentiality policy. During an employee’s\nterm of employment, the employee shall comply with any and all written or unwritten rules\nand policies concerning confidentiality and shall fulfill the duties and responsibilities\nconcerning confidentiality applicable to the employee.\n3. In addition to fulfilling the responsibilities associated with his position in the\nCompany, an employee shall not, without first obtaining approval from the Company,\ndisclose, announce or publish trade secrets or other confidential business information of the\nCompany, nor shall an employee use such confidential information outside the course of his\nduties to the Company.\n4. Even outside the work environment, an employee must maintain vigilance and\nrefrain from disclosing important information regarding the Company or its business,\ncustomers or employees.\n5. An employee’s duty of confidentiality with respect to the confidential\ninformation of the Company survives the termination of such employee’s employment with\nthe Company for any reason until such time as the Company discloses such information\n5\npublicly or the information otherwise becomes available in the public sphere through no fault\nof the employee.\n6. Upon termination of employment, or at such time as the Company requests, an\nemployee must return to the Company all of its property without exception, including all\nforms of medium containing confidential information, and may not retain duplicate materials.\nVIII. Accuracy of Financial Reports and Other Public Communications\nUpon the completion of the IPO, the Company will be a public company which is\nrequired to report its financial results and other material information about its business to the\npublic and the SEC. It is the Company’s policy to promptly disclose accurate and complete\ninformation regarding its business, financial condition and results of operations. AnPac\nPersonnel must strictly comply with all applicable standards, laws, regulations and policies\nfor accounting and financial reporting of transactions, estimates and forecasts. Inaccurate,\nincomplete or untimely reporting will not be tolerated and can severely damage the Company\nand result in legal liability.\nAnPac Personnel should be on guard for, and promptly report, any possibility of\ninaccurate or incomplete financial reporting. Particular attention should be paid to:\n(i) financial results that seem inconsistent with the performance of the underlying\nbusiness;\n(ii) transactions that do not seem to have an obvious business purpose; and\n(iii) requests to circumvent ordinary review and approval procedures.\nThe Company’s senior financial officers and other employees working in the finance\nand accounting department have a special responsibility to ensure that all of the Company’s\nfinancial disclosures are full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable. Any practice or\nsituation that might undermine this objective should be reported to the Compliance Officer\nand internal audit department.\nEmployees are prohibited from directly or indirectly taking any action to coerce,\nmanipulate, mislead or fraudulently influence the Company’s independent auditors for the\npurpose of rendering the financial statements of the Company materially misleading.\nProhibited actions include but are not limited to those actions taken to coerce, manipulate,\nmislead or fraudulently influence an auditor:\n(i) to issue or reissue a report on the Company’s financial statements that is not\nwarranted in the circumstances (due to material violations of IFRS, generally accepted\nauditing standards or other professional or regulatory standards);\n(ii) not to perform audit, review or other procedures required by generally\naccepted auditing standards or other professional standards;\n(iii) not to withdraw an issued report; or\n(iv) not to communicate matters to the Company’s Audit Committee of the Board.\n6\nEmployees with information relating to questionable accounting or auditing matters\nmay also confidentially, and anonymously if they desire, submit the information in writing to\nthe Company’s Audit Committee of the Board.\nIX. Company Records\nAccurate and reliable records are crucial to the Company’s business and form the\nbasis of its earnings statements, financial reports and other disclosures to the public. The\nCompany’s records are the source of essential data that guides business decision-making and\nstrategic planning. Company records include, but are not limited to, booking information,\npayroll, timecards, travel and expense reports, e-mails, accounting and financial data,\nmeasurement and performance records, electronic data files and all other records maintained\nin the ordinary course of our business.\nAll Company records must be complete, accurate and reliable in all material respects.\nThere is never an acceptable reason to make false or misleading entries. Undisclosed or\nunrecorded funds, payments or receipts are strictly prohibited. You are responsible for\nunderstanding and complying with the Company’s record keeping policy. Contact the\nCompliance Officer if you have any questions regarding the record keeping policy.\nX. Compliance with Laws and Regulations; Insider Trading\nEach employee has an obligation to comply with the laws of the cities, provinces,\nregions and countries in which the Company operates. This includes, without limitation, laws\ncovering commercial bribery and kickbacks, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets,\ninformation privacy, insider trading, offering or receiving gratuities, employment harassment,\nenvironmental protection, occupational health and safety, false or misleading financial\ninformation, misuse of corporate assets or foreign currency exchange activities. Employees\nare expected to understand and comply with all laws, rules and regulations that apply to your\nposition at the Company. If any doubt exists about whether a course of action is lawful, you\nshould seek advice immediately from the Compliance Officer.\nEmployees are prohibited from trading securities while in possession of material\nnonpublic information, whether of the Company or other companies, and must comply with\ninsider trading and any applicable securities law and the Company’s Statement of Policies\nGoverning Material, Non-Public Information and the Prevention of Insider Trading regarding\nsecurities transactions and handling of confidential information. Insider trading is both\nunethical and illegal and will be firmly dealt with by the Company. Prohibition on insider\ntrading applies to members of the employees’ family and anyone else sharing the home of the\nemployees. Therefore, employees must use discretion when discussing work with friends or\nfamily members, as well as with other employees.\nXI. Workplace Environment\nA. Discrimination and Harassment\nThe Company is firmly committed to providing equal opportunity in all aspects of\nemployment and will not tolerate any illegal discrimination or harassment based on race,\nethnicity, religion, gender, age, national origin or any other protected class. For further\ninformation, you should consult the Compliance Officer.\n7\nB. Health and Safety\nThe Company strives to provide employees with a safe and healthy work\nenvironment. Each employee has responsibility for maintaining a safe and healthy workplace\nfor other employees by following environmental, safety and health rules and practices and\nreporting accidents, injuries and unsafe equipment, practices or conditions. Violence and\nthreatening behavior are not permitted.\nEach employee is expected to perform his or her duty to the Company in a safe\nmanner, free of the influences of alcohol, illegal drugs or other controlled substances. The use\nof illegal drugs or other controlled substances in the workplace is prohibited.\nXII. Violations of the Code; Protection Against Retaliation\nAll employees have a duty to report any known or suspected violation of this Code,\nincluding any violation of laws, rules, regulations or policies that apply to the Company.\nReporting a known or suspected violation of this Code by others will not be considered an act\nof disloyalty, but an action to safeguard the reputation and integrity of the Company and its\nemployees.\nIf you know of or suspect a violation of this Code, it is your responsibility to\nimmediately report the violation to the Compliance Officer and the internal audit department,\nwho will work with you to investigate your concern. Any suspected violation of this Code\ninvolving an executive officer shall be directed or reported to any of our independent\ndirectors on the Board or to the Audit Committee of the Board. All questions and reports of\nknown or suspected violations of this Code will be treated with sensitivity and discretion.\nThe Compliance Officer, the Board or the Audit Committee of the Board and the Company\nwill protect your confidentiality to the extent possible, consistent with the law and the\nCompany’s need to investigate your concern.\nIt is the Company’s policy that any AnPac Personnel who violates this Code will be\nsubject to appropriate discipline, including termination of employment, based upon the facts\nand circumstances of each particular situation. Your conduct as a AnPac Personnel, if it\ndoes not comply with the law or with this Code, can result in serious consequences for both\nyou and the Company.\nThe Company strictly prohibits retaliation against a AnPac Personnel who, in good\nfaith, seeks help or reports known or suspected violations. AnPac Personnel inflicting\nreprisal or retaliation against another AnPac Personnel for reporting a known or suspected\nviolation will be subject to disciplinary action up to and including termination of\nemployment.\nXIII. Waivers of the Code\nWaivers of this Code will be granted on a case-by-case basis and only in\nextraordinary circumstances.

Conclusion\nThis Code contains general guidelines for conducting the business of the Company\nconsistent with the highest standards of business ethics. If you have any questions about\nthese guidelines, please contact the Compliance Officer. We expect all AnPac Personnel to\nadhere to these standards. Each AnPac Personnel is separately responsible for his or her\nactions. Conduct that violates the law or this Code cannot be justified by claiming that it was\nordered by a supervisor or someone in higher management. If you engage in conduct\nprohibited by the law or this Code, you will be deemed to have acted outside the scope of\nyour employment. Such conduct will subject you to disciplinary action, including\ntermination of employment.\n9"

This Charter is subject to subsequent revision and interpretation by the\nBoard.\n10\nAnnex A\n5605(a)(2) of Nasdaq Stock Market Rule\n\"Independent Director\" means a person other than an Executive Officer or employee of the\nCompany or any other individual having a relationship which, in the opinion of the\nCompany's board of directors, would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in\ncarrying out the responsibilities of a director. For purposes of this rule, \"Family Member\"\nmeans a person's spouse, parents, children and siblings, whether by blood, marriage or\nadoption, or anyone residing in such person's home. The following persons shall not be\nconsidered independent:\n(A) a director who is, or at any time during the past three years was, employed by\nthe Company;\n(B) a director who accepted or who has a Family Member who accepted any\ncompensation from the Company in excess of $120,000 during any period of\ntwelve consecutive months within the three years preceding the determination\nof independence, other than the following:\n(i) compensation for board or board committee service;\n(ii) compensation paid to a Family Member who is an employee (other\nthan an Executive Officer) of the Company; or\n(iii) benefits under a tax-qualified retirement plan, or non-discretionary\ncompensation.\nProvided, however, that in addition to the requirements contained in this paragraph\n(B), audit committee members are also subject to additional, more stringent requirements\nunder Rule 5605(c)(2).\n(C) a director who is a Family Member of an individual who is, or at any time\nduring the past three years was, employed by the Company as an Executive\nOfficer;\n(D) a director who is, or has a Family Member who is, a partner in, or a\ncontrolling Shareholder or an Executive Officer of, any organization to which\nthe Company made, or from which the Company received, payments for\nproperty or services in the current or any of the past three fiscal years that\nexceed 5% of the recipient's consolidated gross revenues for that year, or\n$200,000, whichever is more, other than the following:\n(i) payments arising solely from investments in the Company's securities;\nor\n(ii) payments under non-discretionary charitable contribution matching\nprograms.\n11\n(E) a director of the Company who is, or has a Family Member who is, employed\nas an Executive Officer of another entity where at any time during the past\nthree years any of the Executive Officers of the Company serve on the\ncompensation committee of such other entity; or\n(F) a director who is, or has a Family Member who is, a current partner of the\nCompany's outside auditor, or was a partner or employee of the Company's\noutside auditor who worked on the Company's audit at any time during any of\nthe past three years.\n(G) in the case of an investment company, in lieu of paragraphs (A)-(F), a director\nwho is an \"interested person\" of the Company as defined in Section 2(a)(19)\nof the Investment Company Act of 1940, other than in his or her capacity as a\nmember of the board of directors or any board committee.\nDefinition of Independence — Rule 5605(a)(2)\nIt is important for investors to have confidence that individuals serving as\nIndependent Directors do not have a relationship with the listed Company that would impair\ntheir independence. The board has a responsibility to make an affirmative determination that\nno such relationships exist through the application of Rule 5605(a)(2). Rule 5605(a)(2) also\nprovides a list of certain relationships that preclude a board finding of independence. These\nobjective measures provide transparency to investors and Companies, facilitate uniform\napplication of the rules, and ease administration. Because Nasdaq does not believe that\nownership of Company stock by itself would preclude a board finding of independence, it is\nnot included in the aforementioned objective factors. It should be noted that there are\nadditional, more stringent requirements that apply to directors serving on audit committees,\nas specified in Rule 5605(c).\nThe Rule's reference to the \"Company\" includes any parent or subsidiary of the\nCompany. The term \"parent or subsidiary\" is intended to cover entities the Company controls\nand consolidates with the Company's financial statements as filed with the Commission (but\nnot if the Company reflects such entity solely as an investment in its financial statements).\nThe reference to Executive Officer means those officers covered in Rule 16a-1(f) under the\nAct. In the context of the definition of Family Member under Rule 5605(a)(2), the reference\nto marriage is intended to capture relationships specified in the Rule (parents, children and\nsiblings) that arise as a result of marriage, such as \"in-law\" relationships.\nThe three year look-back periods referenced in paragraphs (A), (C), (E) and (F) of the\nRule commence on the date the relationship ceases. For example, a director employed by the\nCompany is not independent until three years after such employment terminates.\nFor purposes of paragraph (A) of the Rule, employment by a director as an Executive\nOfficer on an interim basis shall not disqualify that director from being considered\nindependent following such employment, provided the interim employment did not last\nlonger than one year. A director would not be considered independent while serving as an\ninterim officer. Similarly, for purposes of paragraph (B) of the Rule, compensation received\nby a director for former service as an interim Executive Officer need not be considered as\ncompensation in determining independence after such service, provided such interim\n12\nemployment did not last longer than one year. Nonetheless, the Company's board of directors\nstill must consider whether such former employment and any compensation received would\ninterfere with the director's exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the\nresponsibilities of a director. In addition, if the director participated in the preparation of the\nCompany's financial statements while serving as an interim Executive Officer. Rule\n5605(c)(2)(A)(iii) would preclude service on the audit committee for three years.\nParagraph (B) of the Rule is generally intended to capture situations where a\ncompensation is made directly to (or for the benefit of) the director or a Family Member of\nthe director. For example, consulting or personal service contracts with a director or Family\nMember of the director would be analyzed under paragraph (B) of the Rule. In addition,\npolitical contributions to the campaign of a director or a Family Member of the director\nwould be considered indirect compensation under paragraph (B). Non-preferential payments\nmade in the ordinary course of providing business services (such as payments of interest or\nproceeds related to banking services or loans by a Company that is a financial institution or\npayment of claims on a policy by a Company that is an insurance company), payments\narising solely from investments in the Company's securities and loans permitted under\nSection 13(k) of the Act will not preclude a finding of director independence as long as the\npayments are non-compensatory in nature. Depending on the circumstances, a loan or\npayment could be compensatory if, for example, it is not on terms generally available to the\npublic.\nParagraph (D) of the Rule is generally intended to capture payments to an entity with\nwhich the director or Family Member of the director is affiliated by serving as a partner,\ncontrolling Shareholder or Executive Officer of such entity. Under exceptional circumstances,\nsuch as where a director has direct, significant business holdings, it may be appropriate to\napply the corporate measurements in paragraph (D), rather than the individual measurements\nof paragraph (B). Issuers should contact Nasdaq if they wish to apply the Rule in this manner.\nThe reference to a partner in paragraph (D) is not intended to include limited partners. It\nshould be noted that the independence requirements of paragraph (D) of the Rule are broader\nthan Rule 10A-3(e)(8) under the Act.\nUnder paragraph (D), a director who is, or who has a Family Member who is, an\nExecutive Officer of a charitable organization may not be considered independent if the\nCompany makes payments to the charity in excess of the greater of 5% of the charity's\nrevenues or $200,000. However, Nasdaq encourages Companies to consider other situations\nwhere a director or their Family Member and the Company each have a relationship with the\nsame charity when assessing director independence.\nFor purposes of determining whether a lawyer is eligible to serve on an audit\ncommittee, Rule 10A-3 under the Act generally provides that any partner in a law firm that\nreceives payments from the issuer is ineligible to serve on that issuer's audit committee. In\ndetermining whether a director may be considered independent for purposes other than the\naudit committee, payments to a law firm would generally be considered under Rule\n5605(a)(2), which looks to whether the payment exceeds the greater of 5% of the recipient's\ngross revenues or $200,000; however, if the firm is a sole proprietorship, Rule 5605(a)(2)(B),\nwhich looks to whether the payment exceeds $120,000, applies.\n13\nParagraph (G) of the Rule provides a different measurement for independence for\ninvestment companies in order to harmonize with the Investment Company Act of 1940. In\nparticular, in lieu of paragraphs (A)-(F), a director who is an \"interested person\" of the\nCompany as defined in Section 2(a)(19) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, other than\nin his or her capacity as a member of the board of directors or any board committee, shall not\nbe considered independent.\n5605(c)(2)(A) of Nasdaq Stock Market Rule\nEach Company must have, and certify that it has and will continue to have, an audit\ncommittee of at least three members, each of whom must:\ni. be an Independent Director as defined under Rule 5605(a)(2);\nii. meet the criteria for independence set forth in Rule 10A-3(b)(1) under the Act\n(subject to the exemptions provided in Rule 10A-3(c) under the Act);\niii. not have participated in the preparation of the financial statements of the\nCompany or any current subsidiary of the Company at any time during the past\nthree years; and\niv. be able to read and understand fundamental financial statements, including a\nCompany's balance sheet, income statement, and cash flow statement.\nAdditionally, each Company must certify that it has, and will continue to have, at\nleast one member of the audit committee who has past employment experience in finance or\naccounting, requisite professional certification in accounting, or any other comparable\nexperience or background which results in the individual's financial sophistication, including\nbeing or having been a chief executive officer, chief financial officer or other senior officer\nwith financial oversight responsibilities.\n5605(c)(3) of Nasdaq Stock Market Rule – Audit Committee Responsibilities and\nAuthority\nThe audit committee must have the specific audit committee responsibilities and\nauthority necessary to comply with Rule 10A-3(b)(2), (3), (4) and (5) under the Act (subject\nto the exemptions provided in Rule 10A-3(c) under the Act), concerning responsibilities\nrelating to: (i) registered public accounting firms, (ii) complaints relating to accounting,\ninternal accounting controls or auditing matters, (iii) authority to engage advisers, and (iv)\nfunding as determined by the audit committee. Audit committees for investment companies\nmust also establish procedures for the confidential, anonymous submission of concerns\nregarding questionable accounting or auditing matters by employees of the investment\nadviser, administrator, principal underwriter, or any other provider of accounting related\nservices for the investment company, as well as employees of the investment company.\n5615 of Nasdaq Stock Market Rule – Exemptions from Certain Corporate Governance\nRequirements\n14\nThis rule provides the exemptions from the corporate governance rules afforded to\ncertain types of Companies, and sets forth the phase-in schedules for initial public offerings,\nCompanies emerging from bankruptcy, Companies transferring from other markets and\nCompanies ceasing to be Smaller Reporting Companies. This rule also describes the\napplicability of the corporate governance rules to Controlled Companies and sets forth the\nphase-in schedule afforded to Companies ceasing to be Controlled Companies.\n(a) Exemptions to the Corporate Governance Requirements\n…\n(3) Foreign Private Issuers\n(A) A Foreign Private Issuer may follow its home country practice in lieu of the\nrequirements of the Rule 5600 Series, the requirement to disclose third party director and\nnominee compensation set forth in Rule 5250(b)(3), and the requirement to distribute annual\nand interim reports set forth in Rule 5250(d), provided, however, that such a Company shall:\ncomply with the Notification of Noncompliance requirement (Rule 5625), the Voting Rights\nrequirement (Rule 5640), have an audit committee that satisfies Rule 5605(c)(3), and ensure\nthat such audit committee's members meet the independence requirement in Rule\n5605(c)(2)(A)(ii). Except as provided in this paragraph, a Foreign Private Issuer must comply\nwith the requirements of the Rule 5000 Series.\n(B) Disclosure Requirements\n(i) A Foreign Private Issuer that follows a home country practice in lieu of one or\nmore of the Listing Rules shall disclose in its annual reports filed with the Commission each\nrequirement that it does not follow and describe the home country practice followed by the\nCompany in lieu of such requirements. Alternatively, a Foreign Private Issuer that is not\nrequired to file its annual report with the Commission on Form 20-F may make this\ndisclosure only on its website. A Foreign Private Issuer that follows a home country practice\nin lieu of the requirement in Rule 5605(d)(2) to have an independent compensation\ncommittee must disclose in its annual reports filed with the Commission the reasons why it\ndoes not have such an independent committee.\n(ii) A Foreign Private Issuer making its initial public offering or first U.S. listing on\nNasdaq shall disclose in its registration statement or on its website each requirement that it\ndoes not follow and describe the home country practice followed by the Company in lieu of\nsuch requirements.\nIM-5615-3. Foreign Private Issuers\nA Foreign Private Issuer (as defined in Rule 5005) listed on Nasdaq may follow the\npractice in such Company's home country (as defined in General Instruction F of Form 20-F)\nin lieu of the provisions of the Rule 5600 Series, Rule 5250(b)(3), and Rule 5250(d), subject\nto several important exceptions. First, such an issuer shall comply with Rule 5625\n(Notification of Noncompliance). Second, such a Company shall have an audit committee\nthat satisfies Rule 5605(c)(3). Third, members of such audit committee shall meet the criteria\nfor independence referenced in Rule 5605(c)(2)(A)(ii) (the criteria set forth in Rule 10A-\n15\n3(b)(1) under the Act, subject to the exemptions provided in Rule 10A-3(c) under the Act).\nFinally, a Foreign Private Issuer that elects to follow home country practice in lieu of a\nrequirement of Rules 5600, 5250(b)(3), or 5250(d) shall submit to Nasdaq a written statement\nfrom an independent counsel in such Company's home country certifying that the Company's\npractices are not prohibited by the home country's laws. In the case of new listings, this\ncertification is required at the time of listing. For existing Companies, the certification is\nrequired at the time the Company seeks to adopt its first noncompliant practice. In the interest\nof transparency, the rule requires a Foreign Private Issuer to make appropriate disclosures in\nthe Company's annual filings with the Commission (typically Form 20-F or 40-F), and at the\ntime of the Company's original listing in the United States, if that listing is on Nasdaq, in its\nregistration statement (typically Form F-1, 20-F, or 40-F); alternatively, a Company that is\nnot required to file an annual report on Form 20-F may provide these disclosures in English\non its website in addition to, or instead of, providing these disclosures on its registration\nstatement or annual report. The Company shall disclose each requirement that it does not\nfollow and include a brief statement of the home country practice the Company follows in\nlieu of these corporate governance requirement(s). If the disclosure is only available on the\nwebsite, the annual report and registration statement should so state and provide the web\naddress at which the information may be obtained. Companies that must file annual reports\non Form 20-F are encouraged to provide these disclosures on their websites, in addition to the\nrequired Form 20-F disclosures, to provide maximum transparency about their practices.\n16\nRule 10A-3(b) of the Exchange Act – Listing Standards Relating to Audit Committee\n(1) Independence.\ni.
