(Nasdaq: QXO) today announced its financial results for the third quarter 2024. The company reported a loss of $0.01 per basic and diluted share attributable to common shareholders.\n\n**THIRD QUARTER 2024 SUMMARY RESULTS**  \n---  \n**Three Months Ended**| **Nine Months Ended**  \n**September 30,**| **September 30,**| **Percent**| **September 30,**| **September 30,**| **Percent**  \n _(in thousands)_| **2024**| **2023**| **Change**| **2024**| **2023**| **Change**  \nRevenue:  \nSoftware product, net| $| 3,028| $| 2,850| 6.2| %| $| 10,284| $| 9,471| 8.6| %  \nService and other, net| 10,127| 10,573| (4.2| )%| 31,846| 30,337| 5.0| %  \nTotal revenue, net| $| 13,155| $| 13,423| (2.0| )%| $| 42,130| $| 39,808| 5.8| %  \nNet income (loss)| $| 17,132| $| (2,110| )| NM| $| 16,680| $| (1,489| )| NM  \nAdjusted EBITDA1| $| (11,469| )| $| 665| NM| $| (12,177| )| $| 2,033| NM  \nNM - Not Meaningful  \n  \n1 See \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section for additional information on non-GAAP financial measures.\n\nBrad Jacobs, chairman and chief executive officer of QXO, said, “With over $5 billion in cash, no debt and a seasoned leadership team, we’re poised to make QXO a leader in the $800 billion building products distribution industry.”\n\n**Third** **Quarter** **Highlights**\n\nTotal revenue for the quarter was $13.16 million, compared with $13.42 million for the same period in 2023. Software product revenue was $3.03 million, compared with $2.85 million for the same period in 2023. Service and other revenue was $10.13 million, compared with $10.57 million for the same period in 2023.\n\nNet income, inclusive of $57.0 million interest income, was $17.1 million.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure, was negative $11.47 million, compared with positive $665,000 for the same period in 2023. The decline in Adjusted EBITDA relates to higher employee-related costs, reflecting the introduction of a new senior management team to execute QXO’s expansive growth plan.\n\nThe company completed two previously announced private placements during the quarter, raising approximately $4.1 billion to support its growth strategy and increasing the number of common shares outstanding to 409.4 million.\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, the company had approximately $5.04 billion in cash on hand.\n\n**About** **QXO** QXO provides technology solutions, primarily to clients in the manufacturing, distribution and service sectors. The company provides consulting and professional services, including specialized programming, training and technical support, and develops proprietary software. As a value-added reseller of business application software, QXO offers solutions for accounting, financial reporting, enterprise resource planning, warehouse management systems, customer relationship management, business intelligence and other applications.

Other companies may calculate this non-GAAP financial measure differently, and therefore our measure may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. This non-GAAP financial measure should only be used as a supplemental measure of our operating performance.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA includes adjustments for share-based compensation, transaction, and severance costs as set forth in the attached reconciliation. Transaction adjustments are generally incremental costs that result from an actual or planned acquisition or divestiture and may include transaction costs, consulting fees, retention awards, internal salaries and wages (to the extent the individuals are assigned full-time to integration and transformation activities) and certain costs related to integrating and converging IT systems. Management uses this non-GAAP financial measure in making financial, operating and planning decisions and evaluating QXO’s ongoing performance.\n\nWe believe that Adjusted EBITDA improves comparability from period to period by removing the impact of our capital structure (interest and financing expenses), asset base (depreciation and amortization), tax impacts and other adjustments as set out in the attached tables that management has determined are not reflective of core operating activities and thereby assist investors with assessing trends in our underlying businesses.\n\nBecause of these limitations, you should consider Adjusted EBITDA alongside other financial performance measures, including various cash flow metrics, net income (loss), and our other GAAP results.\n\n**Forward-Looking** **Statements** This release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Statements that are not historical facts, including statements about beliefs, expectations, targets and goals are forward-looking statements. These statements are based on plans, estimates, expectations and/or goals at the time the statements are made, and readers should not place undue reliance on them. In some cases, readers can identify forward-looking statements by the use of forward-looking terms such as “may,” “will,” “should,” “expect,” “opportunity,” “intend,” “plan,” “anticipate,” “believe,” “estimate,” “predict,” “potential,” “target,” “goal,” or “continue,” or the negative of these terms or other comparable terms. Forward-looking statements involve inherent risks and uncertainties and readers are cautioned that a number of important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any such forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described herein include, among others:\n\n  * risks associated with potential significant volatility and fluctuations in the market price of the company’s common stock;\n\n\n  * risks associated with raising additional equity or debt capital from public or private markets to pursue the company’s business plan, including potentially one or more additional private placements of common stock, and the effects that raising such capital may have on the company and its business, including the risk of substantial dilution or that the company’s common stock may experience a substantial decline in trading price;\n\n\n  * the possibility that additional future financings may not be available to the company on acceptable terms or at all;\n\n\n  * the possibility that an active, liquid trading market for the company’s common stock may not develop or, if developed, may not be sustained;\n\n\n  * the possibility that the company’s outstanding warrants and preferred stock may or may not be converted or exercised, and the economic impact on the company and the holders of common stock of the company that may result from either such exercise or conversion, including dilution, or the continuance of the preferred stock remaining outstanding, and the impact its terms, including its dividend, may have on the company and the common stock of the company;\n\n\n  * uncertainties regarding the company’s focus, strategic plans and other management actions;\n\n\n  * the risk that the company is or becomes highly dependent on the continued leadership of Brad Jacobs as chairman and chief executive officer and the possibility that the loss of Mr. Jacobs in these roles could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business, financial condition and results of operations;\n\n\n  * the possibility that the concentration of ownership by Mr. Jacobs may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of the company and might affect the market price of shares of the common stock of the company;\n\n\n  * the risk that Mr. Jacobs’ past performance may not be representative of future results;\n\n\n  * the risk that the company is unable to attract and retain world-class talent;\n\n\n  * the risk that the failure to consummate any acquisition expeditiously, or at all, could have a material adverse effect on the company's business prospects, financial condition, results of operations or the price of the company’s common stock;\n\n\n  * risks that the company may not be able to enter into agreements with acquisition targets on attractive terms, or at all, that agreed acquisitions may not be consummated, or, if consummated, that the anticipated benefits thereof may not be realized and that the company encounter difficulties in integrating and operating such acquired companies, or that matters related to an acquired business (including operating results or liabilities or contingencies) may have a negative effect on the company or its securities or ability to implement its business strategy, including that any such transaction may be dilutive or have other negative consequences to the company and its value or the trading prices of its securities;\n\n\n  * risks associated with cybersecurity and technology, including attempts by third parties to defeat the security measures of the company and its business partners, and the loss of confidential information and other business disruptions;\n\n\n  * the possibility that new investors in any future financing transactions could gain rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of the company’s existing stockholders;\n\n\n  * the possibility that building products distribution industry demand may soften or shift substantially due to cyclicality or seasonality or dependence on general economic and political conditions, including inflation or deflation, interest rates, governmental subsidies or incentives, consumer confidence, labor and supply shortages, weather and commodity prices;\n\n\n  * the possibility that regional or global barriers to trade or a global trade war could increase the cost of products in the building products distribution industry, which could adversely impact the competitiveness of such products and the financial results of businesses in the industry;\n\n\n  * risks associated with periodic litigation, regulatory proceedings and enforcement actions, which may adversely affect the company’s business and financial performance;\n\n\n  * uncertainties regarding general economic, business, competitive, legal, regulatory, tax and geopolitical conditions; and\n\n\n  * other factors, including those set forth in the company’s filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, including its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 and subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q.\n\n\n\nThe company cautions that forward-looking statements should not be relied on as predictions of future events, and these statements are not guarantees of performance or results. Forward-looking statements herein speak only as of the date each statement is made. The company undertakes no obligation to update any of these statements in light of new information or future events, except to the extent required by applicable law.\n\n**Media****Contact:** Joe Checkler [joe.checkler@qxo.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=jVwSj-3jn0Xj2EO9hk0qCmmYzOFmtmoGvY-AcrwwZG8t6K4XUZT_A7BwHKE1e9J1SyaKLVB3TlFGJ2zgOgl3XzICFEqMfsWyQi0NZ59FqVQ=) 203-609-9650\n\n**Investor** **Contact:** Mark Manduca [mark.manduca@qxo.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=EkQ1EL39ux11xFNv-qFhyYq8mdYBfxJkh44oysii87fp8OHbPKLUqp0Z9uC8dFlY3BA8j5klyBTIXmCLfxfNW7N99xw4uS_g5TtZRriaIik=) 203-321-3889\n\n**QXO, INC.

Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those\ndescribed herein include, among others:\n• risks associated with potential significant volatility and fluctuations in the market price of the Company’s common stock;\n• risks associated with raising additional equity or debt capital from public or private markets to pursue the Company’s business plan, including potentially one or more\nadditional private placements of common stock, and the effects that raising such capital may have on the Company and its business, including the risk of substantial\ndilution or that the Company’s common stock may experience a substantial decline in trading price;\n• the possibility that additional future financings may not be available to the Company on acceptable terms or at all;\n• the possibility that an active, liquid trading market for the Company’s common stock may not be sustained;\n• the possibility that the Company’s outstanding warrants and preferred stock may or may not be converted or exercised, and the economic impact on the Company and\nthe holders of common stock of the Company that may result from either such exercise or conversion, including dilution, or the continuance of the preferred stock\nremaining outstanding, and the impact its terms, including its dividend, may have on the Company and the common stock of the Company;\n• uncertainties regarding the Company’s focus, strategic plans and other management actions;\n• the risk that the Company is or becomes highly dependent on the continued leadership of Brad Jacobs as chairman and chief executive officer and the possibility that\nthe loss of Mr. Jacobs in these roles could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations;\n• the possibility that the concentration of ownership by Mr. Jacobs may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of the Company and might affect the\nmarket price of shares of the common stock of the Company;\n• the risk that Mr. Jacobs’ past performance may not be representative of future results;\n• the risk that the Company is unable to attract and retain world-class talent;\n• the risk that the failure to consummate any acquisition expeditiously, or at all, could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business prospects, financial\ncondition, results of operations or the price of the Company’s common stock;\n• risks that the Company may not be able to enter into agreements with acquisition targets on attractive terms, or at all, that agreed acquisitions may not be\nconsummated, or, if consummated, that the anticipated benefits thereof may not be realized and that the Company encounter difficulties in integrating and operating\nsuch acquired companies, or that matters related to an acquired business (including operating results or liabilities or contingencies) may have a negative effect on the\nCompany or its securities or ability to implement its business strategy, including that any such transaction may be dilutive or have other negative consequences to the\nCompany and its value or the trading prices of its securities;\n• risks associated with cybersecurity and technology, including attempts by third parties to defeat the security measures of the Company and its business partners, and\nthe loss of confidential information and other business disruptions;\n• the possibility that new investors in any future financing transactions could gain rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of the Company’s existing\nstockholders;\n• the possibility that building products distribution industry demand may soften or shift substantially due to cyclicality or seasonality or dependence on general\neconomic and political conditions, including inflation or deflation, interest rates, governmental subsidies or incentives, consumer confidence, labor and supply\nshortages, weather and commodity prices;\n• the possibility that regional or global barriers to trade or a global trade war could increase the cost of products in the building products distribution industry, which\ncould adversely impact the competitiveness of such products and the financial results of businesses in the industry;\n• risks associated with periodic litigation, regulatory proceedings and enforcement actions, which may adversely affect the Company’s business and financial\nperformance;\n3\n• uncertainties regarding general economic, business, competitive, legal, regulatory, tax and geopolitical conditions; and\n• other factors, including those set forth in the Company’s filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, including its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the\nfiscal year ended December 31, 2023 and subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q.\nThe company cautions that forward-looking statements should not be relied on as predictions of future events, and these statements are not guarantees of performance or results.\nForward-looking statements herein speak only as of the date each statement is made.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Unaudited)\nNOTE 1 – DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS\nQXO, Inc. (“QXO”, “we”, “our”, or the “Company”) was formerly known as SilverSun Technologies, Inc. (“SilverSun”). On June 6, 2024, we changed the Company’s name\nfrom SilverSun to QXO and changed its ticker symbol on the Nasdaq Capital Market from SSNT to QXO, upon completing a $1.0 billion cash investment in SilverSun by\nJacobs Private Equity II, LLC (“JPE”) and certain minority co-investors. Refer to Note 3 - Equity of the “Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements” for further\ndetails about the investment and related to changes to our capital structure.\nQXO is a technology solutions and professional services company that helps businesses manage and monetize their enterprise assets. We do this through our legacy operations,\nwhich provide critical software applications, consulting and other professional services, including specialized programming, training, and technical support. Our customers are\nprimarily small and mid-size companies in the manufacturing, distribution and services industries.\nOur strategy is to build QXO into a tech-forward leader in the $800 billion building products distribution industry with the goal of generating outsized stockholder value through\naccretive acquisitions and organic growth, including greenfield openings. We are executing our strategy toward a target of tens of billions of dollars in annual revenue in the next\ndecade.\nNOTE 2 – BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nBasis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation\nThe accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements contain all adjustments necessary to state fairly the financial position of the Company as of\nSeptember 30, 2024, the results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 and cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2024\nand 2023 in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”). These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been\nprepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) and consequently have been condensed and do not include all disclosures\nnormally made in an Annual Report on Form 10-K. The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included herein should be read in conjunction with the\nconsolidated financial statements and notes included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on\nMarch 14, 2024. All significant inter-company transactions and accounts have been eliminated in consolidation.\nSignificant Accounting Policies\nOther than policies noted herein, there have been no material changes from the significant accounting policies disclosed in Note 2 of the “Notes to Consolidated Financial\nStatements” included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nReclassifications\nThe Company has reclassified certain prior period amounts to conform with the current period presentation in the unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets related to\nunbilled services and deferred charges which are now presented within prepaid expenses and other current assets. Additionally, the Company has reclassified certain prior period\namounts to conform with the current period presentation in the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations related to selling and marketing expenses, general and\nadministrative expenses, share-based compensation, and other expense which is now presented within selling, general, and administrative expenses. As further discussed in Note\n3 – Equity, all per share amounts and common share amounts have been adjusted on a retroactive basis to reflect the Reverse Stock Split (as defined below).\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of unaudited financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets\nand liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of\nrevenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\n10\nCash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash\nThe Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents. The Company maintains cash balances\nacross a diversified portfolio of global financial institutions that exceed FDIC insured limits. The Company has not experienced any losses in such accounts. Amounts included\nin restricted cash represent those required to be set aside by a contractual agreement as collateral for the Company’s credit card program. The following table provides a\nreconciliation of cash and cash equivalents:\nAs of\n(in thousands) September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nCash and cash equivalents $ 5,037,112 $ 6,143\nRestricted cash included in prepaid expenses and other current assets 3,500 —\nTotal cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash $ 5,040,612 $ 6,143\nPrepaid Expenses and Other Current Assets\nThe following table presents the components of prepaid expenses and other current assets:\nAs of\n(in thousands) September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nUnbilled services $ 449 $ 194\nDeferred charges — 736\nRestricted cash 3,500 —\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets 12,342 1,754\nTotal prepaid expenses and other current assets $ 16,291 $ 2,684\nAccrued Expenses\nThe following table presents the components of accrued expenses:\nAs of\n(in thousands) September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nAccrued interest $ — $ 25\nAccrued payroll and benefits 5,276 1,910\nAccrued other 7,212 746\nTotal accrued expenses $ 12,488 $ 2,681\nInterest Income (Expense), net\nThe following table presents the components of interest income (expense), net:\nThree Months Ending September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n(in thousands) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nInterest income $ 56,998 $ 6 $ 60,492 $ 16\nInterest expense (9) (14) (54) (58)\nInterest income (expense), net $ 56,989 $ (8) $ 60,438 $ (42)\n11\nRevenue Recognition\nComponents of revenue:\nThe following table presents the components of revenue:\nThree Months Ending September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n(in thousands) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nSoftware revenue $ 3,011 $ 2,850 $ 10,284 $ 9,471\nProfessional consulting revenue 3,988 4,832 13,699 13,725\nMaintenance revenue 1,450 1,486 4,252 4,104\nAncillary service revenue 4,706 4,255 13,895 12,508\nTotal revenue, net $ 13,155 $ 13,423 $ 42,130 $ 39,808\nRoll-forward of Allowance for Expected Credit Losses\nThe following table represents the roll-forward of the allowance for expected credit losses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and the year ended December 31,\n2023:\n(in thousands) September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nBalance at beginning of period $ 510 $ 490\nCurrent period provision for expected losses 25 115\nWrite-offs (13) (95)\nBalance at end of period $ 522 $ 510\nAdvertising and Marketing\nAdvertising and marketing expenses consist of advertising and payroll related expenses for personnel engaged in marketing, business development and selling activities. These\ncosts are expensed as incurred.\nDeferred Revenue\nDeferred revenue consists of maintenance on proprietary products (contract liabilities), customer telephone support services (contract liabilities) and deposits for future\nconsulting services that will be earned as such services are performed over the contractual or stated period, which generally ranges from three to twelve months. As of\nSeptember 30, 2024, there were $519,200 in deferred maintenance and support services and $2.3 million in deposits for future consulting services. As of December 31, 2023,\nthere were $943,000 in maintenance and support services, and $2.2 million in deposits for future consulting services.\nFinancial Instruments\nFair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement\ndate. To increase the comparability of fair value measures, the following hierarchy prioritizes the inputs to valuation methodologies used to measure fair value:\nLevel 1: Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for assets or liabilities. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to\nLevel 1 inputs.\nLevel 2: Observable prices that are based on inputs not quoted on active markets but corroborated by market data.\nLevel 3: Unobservable inputs are used when little or no market data is available. The fair value hierarchy gives the lowest priority to Level 3 inputs.\nThe Company’s current financial assets and liabilities approximate fair value due to their short-term nature and include cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts\npayable, and accrued liabilities.\n12\nProperty and Equipment\nThe following is a summary of property and equipment, net:\nAs of\n(in thousands) September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nLeasehold improvements $ 99 $ 166\nEquipment, furniture, and fixtures 4,159 3,943\nProperty and equipment 4,258 4,109\nLess: Accumulated depreciation and amortization (3,802) (3,606)\nProperty and equipment, net $ 456 $ 503\nDepreciation expense related to these assets for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was $56,400 and $198,200, respectively, compared with $75,300 and\n$253,400 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively.\nShare-Based Compensation\nThe Company recognizes share-based compensation expense based on the equity award’s grant date fair value. For grants of restricted stock units (“RSUs”) subject to service-\nbased vesting conditions, the fair value is established based on the market price of the common stock on the date of the grant. For grants of performance-based restricted stock\nunits (“pRSUs”) subject to market-based vesting conditions, the fair value is established using a Monte Carlo simulation lattice model. The determination of the fair value of\nshare-based awards is affected by the Company’s stock price and a number of assumptions, including volatility, performance period, risk-free interest rate and expected\ndividends. The Company accounts for forfeitures as they occur. The grant date fair value of each RSU is amortized over the requisite service period.\nRecent Authoritative Pronouncements\nIn November 2024, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2024-03, Income Statement - Reporting Comprehensive\nIncome - Expense Disaggregation Disclosure (Subtopic 220-40): Disaggregation of Income Statement Expense, which requires disclosure in the notes to the financial statements\nof specified information about certain costs and expenses. The amendments are effective for the fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2026, and for interim periods within\nthe fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2027. Early adoption is permitted. The amendments should be applied either prospectively to financial statements issued for\nreporting periods after the effective date of this ASU or retrospectively to any or all prior periods presented in the financial statements. The Company is currently evaluating the\nnew guidance to determine the impact it may have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosure.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures, which requires disaggregated information about a\nreporting entity’s effective tax rate reconciliation, as well as information related to income taxes paid to enhance the transparency and decision usefulness of income tax\ndisclosures. This ASU will be effective beginning with the Company's 2025 annual reporting period. The Company is currently evaluating the timing and impacts of adoption of\nthis ASU.\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosure, which updates the required disclosures to\ninclude significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker (CODM) and included within each reported measure of segment profit or\nloss. ASU 2023-07 requires that a public entity disclose, on an annual and interim basis, an amount for other segment items by reportable segment and a description of its\ncomposition. ASU 2023-07 additionally requires that a public entity with a single reportable segment provide all the disclosures required by the amendments in this update and\nall existing segment disclosures. This ASC is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and will be effective for interim periods within fiscal years beginning\nafter December 15, 2024. The Company does not believe the adoption of this standard will have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.\nIn July 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-03, Presentation of Financial Statements (Topic 205), Income Statement—Reporting Comprehensive Income (Topic 220),\nDistinguishing Liabilities from Equity (Topic 480), Equity (Topic 505), and Compensation—Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Amendments to SEC Paragraphs Pursuant to\nSEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 120, SEC Staff Announcement at the March 24, 2022 EITF Meeting, and Staff Accounting Bulletin Topic 6.B, Accounting Series Release 280\n—General Revision of Regulation S-X: Income or Loss Applicable to Common Stock.

Pursuant to the\nInvestment Agreement, we issued and sold an aggregate of 1,000,000 shares of Convertible Perpetual Preferred Stock, par value $0.001 per share (the “Convertible Preferred\nStock”), which are initially convertible into an aggregate of 219,010,074 shares of common stock at an initial conversion price of $4.566 per share and issued and sold warrants\nexercisable for an aggregate of 219,010,074 shares of common stock (the \"Warrants\"). Additionally, we amended the Company’s certificate of incorporation to, among other\nthings, effect an 8:1 reverse stock split with respect to the Company’s common stock (the “Reverse Stock Split”). The Investment Agreement and related transactions closed on\nJune 6, 2024 (the “Equity Investment”) and generated gross proceeds of approximately $1.0 billion before deducting fees and offering expenses.\nFollowing the closing of the Equity Investment, the Board of Directors of the Company was reconstituted such that: i) the number of seats on the Board was designated by JPE,\nii) each of the directors (including Mr. Jacobs) was designated by JPE, iii) each standing committee of the Board was reconstituted in a manner designated by JPE, and iv) Mr.\nJacobs was appointed as Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer of the Company.\nIssuance of Convertible Preferred Stock\nOn June 6, 2024, under the terms of the Investment Agreement, the Company issued 1,000,000 shares of Convertible Preferred Stock. The Convertible Preferred Stock has an\ninitial liquidation preference of $1.0 thousand per share, for an aggregate initial liquidation preference of $1 billion. The Convertible Preferred Stock is convertible at any time,\nin whole or in part and from time to time, at the option of the holder thereof into a number of shares of common stock equal to the then-applicable liquidation preference divided\nby the conversion price, which initially is $4.566 per share of common stock (subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments). Shares of Convertible Preferred Stock are initially\nconvertible into an aggregate of 219,010,074 shares of common stock (after giving effect to the Reverse Stock Split). The Convertible Preferred Stock is not redeemable or\nsubject to any required offer to purchase.\nThe Convertible Preferred Stock ranks, with respect to dividend rights and distribution of assets upon liquidation, winding-up or dissolution, senior to the Company’s common\nstock. Holders of Convertible Preferred Stock will vote together with the holders of the Company’s common stock on an “as-converted” basis on all matters, except as otherwise\nrequired by law. In addition, the approval of holders of at least a majority of the outstanding shares of the Convertible Preferred Stock, voting separately as a single class, will be\nrequired for certain matters set forth in the Certificate of Designation for the Convertible Preferred Stock.\nDividends on the Convertible Preferred Stock are payable quarterly, when, as and if declared by the Board of Directors of the Company at the rate per annum of 9% per share on\nthe then-applicable liquidation preference (subject to certain exceptions in the event that the Company pays dividends on shares of its common stock). During the quarter ended\nSeptember 30, 2024, the Company paid $9.8 million of quarterly dividends to holders of Convertible Preferred Stock. Subsequent to the close of the quarter ended September 30,\n2024, the Company paid $22.5 million of quarterly dividends to holders of Convertible Preferred Stock.\nWarrants\nThe aggregate number of shares of the Company’s common stock subject to the Warrants is 219,010,074 shares. The Warrants are exercisable at the option of the holder at any\ntime until June 6, 2034. The Warrants have an exercise price of $4.566 per share of common stock with respect to 50% of the Warrants, $6.849 per share of common stock with\nrespect to 25% of the Warrants, and $13.698 per share of common stock with respect to the remaining 25% of the Warrants.\nEach Warrant may be exercised, in whole or in part, at any time or times on or after the issuance date and on or before the expiration date at the election of the holder (in such\nholder’s sole discretion) by means of a “cashless exercise” in which the holder will be entitled to receive a number of shares of the Company’s common stock equal to the\nquotient of the product of the Closing Sale Price (as defined in the Warrant Certificate) of a share of the Company’s common stock on the trading day immediately preceding the\ndate on which the holder elects to exercise its Warrant, less the adjusted exercise price, multiplied by the number of shares of the Company’s common stock issuable upon\nexercise of such Warrant, divided by the aforementioned Closing Sale Price of a share of the Company’s common stock on the trading day immediately preceding the date on\nwhich the holder elects to exercise its Warrant.\nEquity Investment Dividend\nUnder the terms of the Investment Agreement, the Company declared a $17.4 million aggregate cash dividend to its stockholders of record as of the day before the closing of the\nEquity Investment. The dividend was paid on June 12, 2024 from proceeds received by the Company from the Equity Investment.\nReverse Stock Split\nOn June 6, 2024, as contemplated by the Investment Agreement, the Company effected an 8:1 Reverse Stock Split, which reduced the Company's issued and outstanding share\ncount of common stock from 5,315,581 to 664,284 shares (par value $0.00001 per share). The Company has recast all share and per-share data and amounts to show the effects\nof the Reverse Stock Split.\n14\nPrivate Placements\nOn June 13, 2024, the Company entered into purchase agreements with certain institutional and accredited investors to issue and sell in a private placement an aggregate of\n340,932,212 shares of our common stock at a price of $9.14 per share, and pre-funded warrants (the \"Pre-Funded Warrants\") to purchase 42,000,000 shares of our common stock\nat a price of $9.13999 per Pre-Funded Warrant. Each Pre-Funded Warrant has an exercise price of $0.00001 per share, is exercisable immediately and until the Pre-Funded\nWarrant is exercised in full. The closing of the issuance and sale of these securities was consummated on July 19, 2024, and generated gross proceeds of approximately $3.5\nbillion before deducting agent fees and offering expenses.\nOn July 22, 2024, we entered into additional purchase agreements with certain institutional and accredited investors to issue and sell in a private placement an aggregate of\n67,833,699 shares of our common stock at a price of $9.14 per share. The closing of the issuance and sale of these securities was consummated on July 25, 2024, and generated\ngross proceeds of approximately $620 million, before deducting agent fees and offering expenses.\nNOTE 4 – EARNINGS (LOSS) PER COMMON SHARE\nThe Company’s Convertible Preferred Stock is classified as a participating security in accordance with ASC 260. Basic and diluted earnings (loss) per share is computed using\nthe two-class method, which is an earnings allocation method that determines earnings (loss) per share for common shares and participating securities. The weighted-average\nnumber of common shares outstanding used in the basic and diluted net loss per share calculation include pre-funded warrants as the pre-funded warrants are exercisable at any\ntime for nominal consideration. Both basic and diluted earnings (loss) per common share are adjusted on a retroactive basis to reflect the Reverse Stock Split as discussed in\nNote 2 – Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies.\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\n(in thousands, except per share data)\nBasic and diluted earnings (loss) per share computation:\nNet income (loss) $ 17,132 $ (2,110) $ 16,680 $ (1,489)\nLess: Preferred stock dividend (22,500) — (28,500) —\nLess: Undistributed earnings allocated to participating\nsecurities — — — —\n(Loss) income attributable to common shareholders (5,368) (2,110) (11,820) (1,489)\nWeighted-average common shares 325,030 657 109,576 657\nWeighted average pre-funded warrants 33,783 — 11,343 —\nTotal weighted-average common shares outstanding 358,813 657 120,919 657\nBasic and diluted earnings per share $ (0.01) $ (3.21) $ (0.10) $ (2.27)\nThe following table summarizes securities that, if exercised, would have a antidilutive effect on diluted earnings per share attributable to the common shareholder.\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\n(in thousands)\nStock options — 20 — 20\nConvertible Preferred Stock 219,010 — 219,010 —\nWarrants 219,010 — 219,010 —\nStock-based awards 21,711 — 21,711 —\nTotal potential dilutive securities not included in earnings per\nshare 459,731 20 459,731 20\nNOTE 5 – INTANGIBLE ASSETS\nIntangible assets consist of proprietary developed software, intellectual property, and customer lists. Proprietary developed software is carried at cost less accumulated\namortization; intellectual property, customer lists and acquired contracts are carried at acquisition date fair value less accumulated amortization.\n15\nIntangible assets at September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, consisted of the following:\nAs of\n(in thousands) September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nProprietary developed software $ 390 $ 390\nIntellectual property, customer lists, and acquired contracts 9,048 9,069\nAccumulated amortization (5,192) (4,540)\nTotal intangible assets $ 4,246 $ 4,919\nAmortization expense related to the above intangible assets for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was $220,500 and $652,900, respectively, as compared with\n$162,000 and $485,900 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023.\nNOTE 6 – LONG-TERM DEBT\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company extinguished all long-term debt obligations.

In assessing loss contingencies related to legal proceedings that are pending against the Company,\nor unasserted claims that may result in such proceedings, the Company evaluates the perceived merits of any legal proceedings or unasserted claims as well as the perceived\nmerits of the amount of relief sought or expected to be sought therein.\n16\nThe Company believes that it has adequately accrued for the potential impact of loss contingencies that are probable and reasonably estimable, and does not believe that the\nultimate resolution of any matters to which it is presently a party will have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations, financial condition or cash\nflows. However, the results of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty, and an unfavorable resolution of one or more of these matters could have a material adverse\neffect on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nNOTE 9 – ASSET PURCHASE AGREEMENT\nOn November 13, 2023, SWK Technologies, Inc. acquired the customer list and prepaid time from clients of JCS Computer Resource Corporation (“JCS”) pursuant to an Asset\nPurchase Agreement for cash of $278,500 and a promissory note in the amount of $1.0 million (the “JCS Note”) for a total consideration of $1.3 million.

The vesting of certain pRSUs is also subject to achievement of performance goals relating to the\nCompany’s TSR compared to the TSR ranking of each company that is in the S&P 500 index. The performance goals for a portion of the pRSUs will be measured over a\ncumulative performance period ending on December 31, 2028, and the performance goals for the remainder of the pRSUs will be measured based on designated performance\nperiods that occur within such cumulative period.\nThe following table summarizes the market based conditions:\nPercentile Position vs. Units Earned as a\nS&P 500 Index Companies Percentage of Target\nBelow 55th Percentile — %\n55th Percentile 100 %\n65th Percentile 150 %\n75th Percentile 175 %\n80th Percentile 200 %\n90th Percentile 225 %\nThe following table summarizes the activity related to the Company’s pRSUs for the nine months ended September 30, 2024:\n(in thousands, except for weighted average grant date fair value) Number of pRSUs Weighted Average Grant\nDate Fair Value\nBalance at beginning of period — $ —\nGranted 8,420 20.24\nBalance at end of period 8,420 $ 20.24\nAs of September 30, 2024, total unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested pRSUs was $161.5 million and is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average\nperiod of 3.72 years.\nThe fair value of the RSUs with a market condition was determined on the date of grant using a Monte Carlo model to simulate total stockholder return for the Company and\npeer companies with the following assumptions\nPerformance Period 4.42 years\nWeighted-average risk-free interest rate 4.03 %\nWeighted-average expected volatility 40 %\nWeighted-average dividend yield 0 %\nThe risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve with a term equal to the expected term of the pRSU in effect at the time of grant.

Upon vesting, the RSUs and\npRSUs result in the issuance of shares of the Company’s common stock after required tax withholdings. The holders of the RSUs and pRSUs do not have the rights of a\nstockholder and do not have voting rights until shares are issued and delivered in settlement of the awards.\nNOTE 12 – RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS\nUpon the closing of the Equity Investment, pursuant to the execution of the Investment Agreement, the Company reimbursed JPE for certain transactional, market research and\nemployee costs related to establishing the foundation for QXO to move forward. These costs, as defined in the Investment Agreement, equated to a total reimbursement of $15.3\nmillion, which was treated as a reduction of the proceeds received from the Equity Investment.\nIn connection with the Equity Investment, Mark Meller was terminated as CEO of SilverSun Technologies, Inc. and entered into a new employment agreement to serve as\nPresident of SWK Technologies, a wholly-owned subsidiary of QXO. Mr. Meller received a lump-sum payment of $2.8 million in connection with this agreement.\nIn connection with the private placement that closed on July 25, 2024, certain directors and officers of the Company purchased an aggregate of 262,585 shares of common stock\nfor $2.4 million.\nItem 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nOur unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”). These\naccounting principles require us to make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions. We believe that the estimates, judgments and assumptions upon which we rely are\nreasonable based upon information available to us at the time that these estimates, judgments and assumptions are made. These estimates, judgments and assumptions can affect\nthe reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and\nexpenses during the periods presented. Our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements would be affected to the extent that there are material differences between\nthese estimates and actual results. In many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by GAAP and does not require management’s\njudgment in its application. There are also areas in which management’s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result. The\nfollowing discussion should be read in conjunction with our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and notes appearing elsewhere in this report.\nOverview\nQXO, Inc. (“QXO”, “we”, or the “Company”) was formerly known as SilverSun Technologies, Inc. (“SilverSun”). On June 6, 2024, we changed the Company’s name from\nSilverSun to QXO and changed its ticker symbol on the Nasdaq Capital Market from SSNT to QXO, upon completing a $1.0 billion cash investment in SilverSun by Jacobs\nPrivate Equity II, LLC (“JPE”) and certain minority co-investors. Refer to Note 3 - Equity of the “Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements” for further details\nabout the investment and related changes to our capital structure.\nQXO is a technology solutions and professional services company that helps businesses manage and monetize their enterprise assets. We do this through our legacy operations,\nwhich provide critical software applications, consulting and other professional services, including specialized programming, training and technical support. Our customers are\nprimarily small and mid-sized companies in the manufacturing, distribution and service industries.\nOur strategy is to create a tech-forward leader in the $800 billion building products distribution industry with the goal of generating outsized stockholder value through accretive\nacquisitions and organic growth, including greenfield openings. We are executing our strategy toward a target of tens of billions of dollars of annual revenue in the next decade.\nWe grow our legacy business with a multi-pronged plan that fosters recurring revenue, customer retention and the steady expansion of our installed customer base, accomplished via\nsales and acquisitions.

Many of\nour offerings are billed on a subscription basis, increasing our monthly recurring revenue from new business in tandem with cross-selling. Our model is designed to increase average\nrevenue per customer over the course of the relationship, facilitating our growth without a commensurate increase in costs of sales, and enhancing our profitability profile.\n19\nOur legacy business has five core components:\n• Enterprise Resource Planning Software\nSubstantially all our initial sales of ERP financial accounting solutions consist of pre-packaged software and associated services to customers in the United States. We\nresell Sage, Accumatica, and other ERP software products, and provide related services, including installation, implementation, support, training, and a technical help desk.\n• Value-Added Services for ERP\nOur consulting and professional services organization shepherds our customer relationships from installation to go-live and forward as needed. A significant portion of\nour service revenue comes from continuing to work with existing customers as their needs change, with flexible revenue options that include prepaid services, time and\nmaterials as utilized and annual support.\n• IT Managed Network Services and Business Consulting\nWe provide comprehensive managed Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) solutions, such as infrastructure-as-a-service, cybersecurity, cloud hosting, business continuity,\ndisaster recovery, data back-up, network maintenance and server applications upgrade services.\n• Cybersecurity\nOur cybersecurity-as-a-service offering is managed by our security operations center and includes incident response, cybersecurity assessments and hacking\nsimulations.

Net revenue for the nine months\nincreased across our lines of business as we grew our customer base through strategic acquisitions and continued renewals of our subscription-based services. Specifically,\nsoftware product revenue increased as we expanded our Sage Intacct and Acumatica product lines, and service revenue increased as we expanded our hosting application\nservices and consulting practices.\nCost of revenue\nCost of revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased $360,000 or 4.5%, compared with the same period in the prior year. As a percentage of revenue,\nmargin expanded to 41.4%, compared with 39.9% for the same period in the prior year. Margin expansion in the period is attributed to improved operational productivity in\nserving customer demand. For the nine months of 2024, cost of revenue increased $1.3 million or 5.5% associated with the increase in revenue, compared with the same period\nin the prior year. Margin increased to 40.1%, compared with 39.9% for the same period in the prior year, as we expanded our product offerings in newly acquired lines of\nbusiness to grow our customer base.\nOperating expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses for the third quarter of 2024 increased $31.3 million or 406.0%, compared with the same period in the prior year. Selling, general\nand administrative expenses for the nine months of 2024 increased $37.0 million or 217.6%, compared with the same period in the prior year. The year-over-year increases in\noperating expenses are primarily due to: i) salary and expense and share-based compensation associated with the Company’s new senior management team put in place to\nexecute our expansive growth plan, ii) the severance payment contemplated in the Investment Agreement for Mark Meller and, iii) certain transaction costs associated with the\nprivate placements.\n21\nDepreciation and amortization expense for the third quarter of 2024 increased $49,000 or 25.0%, compared with the same period in the prior year. Depreciation and amortization\nexpense for the first nine months of 2024 increased $138,000 or 22.7%, compared with the same period in the prior year. The year-over-year increases are attributed to higher\namortization expense associated with the acquisition of JCS in 2023.\nInterest income (expense), net\nInterest income increased $57.0 million and $60.5 million for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024, compared with the same periods in the prior year.\nThe increase is attributed to the interest earned on our cash position due to the cash infusion from the Equity Investment and the private placements that closed in July 2024.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nAdjusted EBITDA\nTo provide investors with additional information regarding our financial results, we have disclosed here and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP\nfinancial measure that we calculate as net income (loss) excluding depreciation and amortization; share-based compensation; income tax (benefit) provision; interest (income)\nexpense; transaction costs; severance costs and other items that we do not consider representative of our underlying operations. We have provided a reconciliation below of\nAdjusted EBITDA to net income (loss), the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. Management uses Adjusted EBITDA in making financial, operating and\nplanning decisions and evaluating QXO’s ongoing performance.\nWe believe that Adjusted EBITDA facilitates analysis of our ongoing business operations because it excludes items that may not be reflective of, or are unrelated to, QXO’s core\noperating performance, and may assist investors with comparisons to prior periods and assessing trends in our underlying business. Other companies may calculate this non-\nGAAP financial measure differently, and therefore our measure may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. This non-GAAP financial measure\nshould only be used as a supplemental measure of our operating performance.\nBecause of these limitations, you should consider Adjusted EBITDA alongside other financial performance measures, net income (loss), and our other GAAP results.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of net income (loss) to Adjusted EBITDA.\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\n(in thousands) September 30, 2024 September 30, 2023 September 30, 2024 September 30, 2023\nReconciliation of net income (loss) to Adjusted EBITDA\nNet income (loss) $ 17,132 $ (2,110) $ 16,680 $ (1,489)\nAdd (deduct):\nDepreciation and amortization 277 237 851 739\nShare-based compensation 13,985 — 13,985 41\nInterest (income) expense (56,989) 8 (60,438) 42\nProvision (benefit) for income taxes 6,031 (456) 5,859 (286)\nTransaction costs 8,095 2,986 8,118 2,986\nSeverance costs — — 2,768 —\nAdjusted EBITDA $ (11,469) $ 665 $ (12,177) $ 2,033\nThe year-over-year declines in three- and nine-month 2024 Adjusted EBITDA were due to higher employee-related costs in the third quarter, reflecting the introduction of a new\nsenior management team to execute the Company’s expansive growth plan.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOn June 6, 2024, we closed the Equity Investment under the Investment Agreement that we entered into on April 14, 2024 among the Company, JPE and certain minority\ninvestors. Pursuant to the Investment Agreement, we issued and sold an aggregate of 1,000,000 shares of Convertible Perpetual Preferred Stock, par value $0.001 per share (the\n\"Convertible Preferred Stock\"), which are initially convertible into an aggregate of 219,010,074 shares of common stock at an initial conversion price of $4.566 per share, and\nwe issued and sold warrants exercisable for an aggregate of 219,010,074 shares of common stock (the \"Warrants\"). Upon closing, the Equity Investment generated gross\nproceeds of $1.0 billion, before deducting agent fees and offering expenses. For more information on the Investment Agreement, refer to Note 3 - Equity.\n22\nOn June 13, 2024, we entered into purchase agreements with certain institutional and accredited investors to issue and sell in a private placement an aggregate of 340,932,212\nshares of our common stock at a price of $9.14 per share, and Pre-Funded Warrants to purchase 42,000,000 shares of our common stock at a price of $9.13999 per Pre-Funded\nWarrant. Each Pre-Funded Warrant has an exercise price of $0.00001 per share, is exercisable immediately and until the Pre-Funded Warrant is exercised in full. The closing of\nthe issuance and sale of these securities was consummated on July 19, 2024, and generated gross proceeds of approximately $3.5 billion before deducting agent fees and offering\nexpenses.\nOn July 22, 2024, we entered into additional purchase agreements with certain institutional and accredited investors to issue and sell in a private placement an aggregate of\n67,833,699 shares of our common stock at a price of $9.14 per share. The closing of the issuance and sale of these securities was consummated on July 25, 2024, and generated\ngross proceeds of approximately $620 million, before deducting agent fees and offering expenses.\nUnder the terms of the Investment Agreement, we declared a $17.4 million aggregate cash dividend to its stockholders of record as of the day before the closing of the Equity\nInvestment. The dividend was paid from proceeds received from the Equity Investment. Under the terms of the Convertible Preferred Stock, dividends are paid quarterly when,\nas and if declared by our Board of Directors (the “Board”), at the rate per annum of 9% per share. During the quarter ended September 30, 2024, we paid $9.8 million of\nquarterly dividends to holders of Convertible Preferred Stock. Subsequent to the close of the quarter ended September 30, 2024, we paid $22.5 million of quarterly dividends to\nholders of Convertible Preferred Stock.\nThe Company’s cash balance was $5.04 billion as of September 30, 2024 and consisted primarily of cash on deposit with banks and investments in money market funds. We\ncontinually evaluate our liquidity requirements in light of our operating needs, growth initiatives and capital resources. We believe that our existing liquidity and sources of\ncapital are sufficient to support our operations over the next 12 months.\nCash provided by operating activities\nCash provided by operating activities increased by $30.1 million, compared with the same period in the prior year. The year-over-year increase is attributed to interest income\nearned in the period offset by higher personnel costs associated with the execution of the Company's strategy as contemplated in the Investment Agreement.\nCash used in investing activities\nCash used in investing activities decreased by $11,000, compared with the same period in the prior year. Investment in capital expenditures is mainly associated with IT\nequipment to support the business.\nCash provided by (used in) financing activities\nCash provided by financing activities was $5.0 billion, compared with $1.9 million of cash used in financing activities in the same period in the prior year. The year-over-year\nincrease is attributed to the Equity Investment of June 6, 2024 and the private placements in July 2024. The Company paid the common stock dividend, the preferred stock\ndividend, and paid its long-term debt obligations with proceeds from these investments.\nItem 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nWe do not hold any derivative instruments and do not engage in any hedging activities.\nItem 4. Controls and Procedures\nManagement’s Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nWe maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Securities\nExchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms and\nthat such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow\ntimely decisions regarding required financial disclosure.\nAs of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report, our management, under the supervision and with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal\nfinancial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e). Based upon this evaluation, our\nprincipal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at a reasonable assurance level as of\nSeptember 30, 2024.\nChange in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to\nmaterially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\n23\nLimitations on the Effectiveness of Controls\nOur disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives as specified\nabove. Management does not expect, however, that our disclosure controls and procedures will prevent or detect all error and fraud. Any control system, no matter how well\ndesigned and operated, is based on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that its objectives will be met. Further, no evaluation of controls\ncan provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been\ndetected.\nPART II – OTHER INFORMATION\nItem 1.

Vested Long-Term\nIncentive Value shall be calculated using the value at Termination Date, based on the Committee’s chosen methodology for such\nvaluation (e.g., closing stock price on Termination Date, average of closing stock prices during the 30-day trading period prior to and\nincluding the Termination Date, etc.).\n(d) Without Cause or for Good Reason Following a Change of Control.

The payments and benefits provided under Sections 6(c) and 6(d) of this Agreement\n(other than the Accrued Benefits and other than in the event of termination by reason of Employee’s death or Disability) are subject\nto and conditioned upon (i) the Employee satisfying the Release Requirement set forth in Section 13(j) of this Agreement and (ii)\nEmployee’s compliance with the covenants in this Agreement, including without limitation, the covenants in Sections 7 through\nSection 16 of this Agreement . The Severance Payment if any, payable hereunder shall be paid in substantially equal installments\nover the twelve-month period, following the Termination Date, consistent with the Company’s payroll practices, with the first\ninstallment to be paid no later than the second regularly scheduled payroll date after the Release Requirement is satisfied and with\nany installments that would\n-6-\notherwise have been paid prior to such date accumulated and paid together with such first installment. The CIC Severance Payment,\nif any, payable hereunder shall be paid in one lump sum within five business days following the satisfaction of the Release\nRequirement.

With respect to any payment or benefit payable pursuant\nto Section 6 that constitutes nonqualified deferred compensation within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code, if the applicable\nChange of Control does not constitute an event described in Section 409A(a)(2)(v) of the Code and the regulations thereunder, then\nsolely to the extent necessary to avoid the application of additional taxes and penalties on such payment or benefit under Section\n409A of the Code, such payment or benefit shall be paid or provided on the same schedule that would have applied to such payment\nor benefit absent the occurrence of a Change of Control.\n(f) Section 280G. In the event that any payments, distributions, benefits or entitlements of any type payable to Employee\n(“Payments”) (i) constitute “parachute payments” within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code and (ii) but for this paragraph\nwould be subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code (the “Excise Tax”), then Employee’s Payment shall be\nreduced to such lesser amount (the “Reduced Amount”) that would result in no portion of such Payments being subject to the Excise\nTax; provided that the Payments shall not be so reduced if the Company determines, based on the advice of a nationally recognized\naccounting firm selected by the Company prior to a Change of Control (the “Accountants”), that without such reduction Employee\nwould be entitled to receive and retain, on a net after tax basis (including, without limitation, any excise taxes payable under\nSection 4999 of the Code), an amount that is greater than the amount, on a net after tax basis, that Employee would be entitled to\nretain upon receipt of the Reduced Amount. Unless the Company and Employee otherwise agree in writing, any determination\nrequired under this Section 6(f) shall be made in writing in good faith by the Accountants. The reduction of the Payments shall be\nmade in the order determined by the Committee, provided that such reduction will be made in a manner that that is intended to\ncomply with Section 409A to the extent applicable. For purposes of making the calculations required by this Section 6(f), the\nAccountants may make reasonable assumptions and approximations concerning applicable taxes and may rely on reasonable, good\nfaith interpretations concerning the application of the Code, and other applicable legal authority. The Company and Employee shall\nfurnish to the Accountants such information and documents as the Accountants may reasonably require in order to make a\ndetermination under this Section 6(f), and the Company shall bear the cost of all fees the Accountants charge in connection with any\ncalculations contemplated by this Section 6(f).\n(g) Mitigation; Offset. The amount of the Severance Payment shall be offset and reduced (but not below zero) by the full amount\nof the Non-Compete Payments to which Employee is entitled under this Agreement. In addition, the Board may determine that (i)\nany part of the remaining portion of the Severance Payment (after application of the offset contemplated by the immediately\npreceding sentence) and/or (ii) solely if the Termination Date does not occur within the two-year period following a Change of\nControl, any Non-Compete Payments to which Employee is entitled under this Agreement, shall be reduced (but not below zero) by\nthe amount\n-7-\nof any income that Employee earns from any other work, whether as an employee or as an independent contractor, during the one\nyear period commencing on the Termination Date.\n7. Confidentiality Covenant. Employee agrees to use “Confidential Information” (as that term is defined in Section 24)\nonly for the Company’s benefit. Employee agrees that, other than as required to perform Employee’s duties for the Company,\nEmployee will not at any time use, disclose, download or copy Confidential Information (including but not limited to personal email\nor storage media) or assist any other person or entity to do so. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, nothing\ncontained herein is intended to, or shall be interpreted in a manner that does, prohibit, limit or restrict Employee from exercising any\nlegally protected whistleblower rights (including pursuant to Rule 21F under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended).\n8. Return of Company Property When Requested. Employee agrees to promptly return to the Company when the\nCompany requests, but in any event by Employee’s Termination Date, all Confidential Information and all other Company property\n(tangible or intangible) in Employee’s possession or control (e.g., all documents, data, recordings, smartphones, computers and other\nbusiness equipment, inclusive of all information stored in electronic form), obtained or prepared by or for or utilized by Employee in\nthe course of Employee’s employment, all of which Employee acknowledges and agrees is and shall remain the Company’s sole and\nexclusive property.

Employee further agrees, when requested or by Employee’s Termination Date, to conduct a diligent search of all\nof the electronic documents and information, electronic devices (including, without limitation, computers, hard drives, flash drives,\nand mobile devices), remote and virtual storage and file systems, emails and email accounts, voicemails, text messages, instant\nmessaging conversations and systems, and any other devices, facilities, systems, accounts, or media that have electronic data storage\nor saving capabilities, in Employee’s possession, custody, or control, for any copies or iterations of Confidential Information, and\nimmediately inform the Company of any copies or iterations of Confidential Information Employee locates pursuant to such search,\nand follow Company directives with respect to remitting such information or documents to the Company and remediating the same.\nIf Employee breach this Section 8, then pursuant to Section 20, Employee’s employment shall, at the Company’s election, be\nterminated for Cause or be deemed to have been terminated for Cause retroactive to the Termination Date. Employee also\nacknowledges that any breach of this Section 8 may cause the Company to seek an adverse inference against the Employee in the\nevent of litigation, and Employee agrees that such breach shall be considered material and entitle the Company to equitable and\nmonetary relief, including its attorneys’ fees and costs pursuant to Section 23.\n9. Ownership of Intellectual Property. Except as otherwise provided by applicable law, Employee agrees that all “Work\nProduct” (as that term is defined in Section 24) created in whole or in part by Employee while employed by the Company is the\nCompany’s exclusive\n-8-\nproperty, and that Employee will promptly, fully and effectively communicate all Work Product to the Company. Accordingly,\nEmployee agrees that all Work Product eligible for any form of copyright protection made or contributed to in whole or in part by\nEmployee within the scope of Employee’s employment while so employed shall be deemed a “work made for hire” under the\ncopyright laws and shall be owned by the Company, and that the Company may sell, use, copy, reproduce, display, perform or alter\nas it sees fit, without any further right or claim by or remuneration to Employee. To that end, Employee hereby now (and upon the\nCompany’s request, in the future Employee will) assign, transfer and convey to the Company, all of Employee’s “Proprietary Rights”\n(as that term is defined in Section 24) in all Work Product for the Company’s exclusive ownership and use, together with all rights to\nsue and recover for past and future infringement or misappropriation thereof.

During Employee’s employment and\nduring the Restricted Period, Employee hereby agrees not to, directly or indirectly, (a) discontinue or reduce the extent of the\nrelationship between the Company Entities and the individuals, partnerships, corporations, professional associations or other\nbusiness organizations that have a business relationship with any Company Entity and about which business relationship the\nEmployee was aware (collectively, “Associated Third Parties”), or to obtain or seek products or services the same as or similar to\nthose offered by the\n-9-\nCompany Entities from any source not affiliated with the Company Entities; and (b) solicit, assist in the solicitation of, or accept any\nbusiness from any Associated Third Parties in relation to a product or service that competes with the products and/or services offered\nby the Company Entities. This undertaking on Employee’s part for the Company’s benefit is called Employee’s “Non-Solicit\nCovenant.”\n13. Post-Employment Covenant Not to Compete with Us.\n(a) Duration and Geographic Scope. During the Non-Compete Period (as defined on Exhibit C), Employee is not allowed to\ncompete with Company Entities in the “Restricted Territory” (geographic area) described below. This undertaking on the Employee’s\npart for the Company’s benefit is called the Employee’s “Non-Compete Covenant.”\n(b) Employee’s Non-Compete Covenant to the Company. Employee agrees that Employee will not, during Employee’s\nemployment and during the Non-Compete Period, within the Restricted Territory, directly or indirectly (whether or not for\ncompensation) become employed by, engage in business with, serve as an agent or consultant to, become an employee, partner,\nmember, principal, stockholder or other owner (other than a holder of less than 1% of the outstanding voting shares of any publicly\nheld company) of any Competing Business. For purposes of this Agreement, “Competing Business” shall mean any individual,\ncorporation, limited liability company, partnership, unincorporated organization, trust, joint venture or other entity that (i) engages or\nis planning to engage in any business or businesses in which the Company Entities are actively engaged during Employee’s\nemployment, including, but not limited to, any line of business involved in building and construction products distribution\n(collectively, the “Business”) or (ii) engages in mergers and acquisition activities related to the Business, including, without\nlimitation, researching, analyzing and evaluating companies for investment in or acquisition of, for itself or clients.

If the Company terminates\nEmployee’s employment without “Cause” (as that term is defined in Section 24 below), then the Company will make “Non-Compete\nPayments” to Employee in an amount calculated as set forth in subsection (f) below.\n(e) Termination of the Restricted Period. The Company has the right, at the Company’s discretion, to waive Employee’s Non-\nCompete Covenant and/or terminate or reduce the Non-Compete Period, whether in whole or in part. Upon providing Employee\nnotice to that effect, no\n-10-\nNon-Compete Payments will be due with respect to any period subject to this waiver or reduction.\n(f) Amount and Timing of Non-Compete Payments During the Restricted Period. If the Company terminates Employee’s\nemployment without Cause and does not elect to waive the Employee’s Non-Compete Covenant or to terminate or reduce the\nEmployee’s Non-Compete Period, the Company will pay Employee each month during the Non-Compete Period an amount equal to\nthe monthly amount of the Employee’s target total annual cash compensation at the time of Employee’s Termination Date in\naccordance with the Company’s payroll procedures on the Company’s normal payroll dates. In the event the Company waives or\nreduces the Non-Compete Period, the Company will make a payment equal to the Employee’s monthly target total annual cash\ncompensation for the duration of the revised Non-Compete Period. (For example, if the Company reduces the Non-Compete Period\nto three (3) months, the Company will pay the Employee the Employee’s monthly amount of target total annual cash compensation\nfor three (3) months, in accordance with the Company’s normal payroll procedures during that period.).\n(g) Additional Non-Compete Payments and Extension of the Employee’s Restricted Period. The Company has the right, at the\nCompany’s discretion, to extend the Non-Compete Period during one or more Extended Non-Compete Periods (as defined in Exhibit\nC). If the Company elects to extend the Non-Compete Period, the Employee agrees that, during any Extended Non-Compete Period,\nthe Employee shall be bound by the restrictions set forth in Section 13(b) in the same manner applicable during the Non-Compete\nPeriod. If the Company exercises this option to extend the Non-Compete Period, the Company will pay Employee “Additional Non-\nCompete Payments” consisting of, for each month of the relevant extension period, an amount equal to the monthly amount of the\nEmployee’s target total annual cash compensation as of the Termination Date in accordance with the Company’s payroll procedures\non our normal payroll dates.\n(i) The Employee shall deliver a written notice to the Company not more than one hundred twenty (120)\ndays, and not less than one hundred (100) days, prior to the expiration of the Non-Compete Period or Extended Non-Compete\nPeriod, as applicable, specifying the date that such expiration will occur.\n(ii) If the Company elects to extend the Non-Compete Period or any Extended Non-Compete Period, the\nCompany will notify the Employee in writing of such fact not later than the ninetieth (90th) day prior to the commencement of the\napplicable Extended Non-Compete Period.\n(iii) The Company may terminate or reduce the duration of any Extended Non-Compete Period. Upon\nproviding the Employee notice to that effect, no Additional Non-Compete Payments will be due with respect to any period subject to\nthis reduction.\n(iv) By signing this Agreement, the Employee agrees to accept and abide by the Company’s elections.\nNotwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, the right of the Company to extend the Non-Compete Period\nhereunder shall lapse upon a Change of Control.\n(h) Consequences of Employee’s Breach of Employee’s Non-Compete Covenant. The Company reserves the right to use any\nremedies available to the Company in law or in equity to enforce the Company’s rights under this Agreement, generally, and the\nEmployee’s Non-Interference Covenant, Non-Compete Covenant, Non-Solicit Covenant and other covenants to\n-11-\nthe Company set forth in this Agreement, specifically. The Employee also agrees that if the Employee breaches the Employee’s Non-\nCompete Covenant to the Company, the Employee will repay to the Company all of the Non-Compete Payments the Company has\nmade to the Employee.\n(i) Coordination with Other Benefits. If the Company elects to enforce the Employee’s Non-Compete Covenant, in whole or in\npart, and the Employee is eligible for any other cash severance benefit under this Agreement or any other policy, plan or agreement,\nsuch other cash severance benefit shall be reduced (but not below zero) by the amount of the Non-Compete Payments.\n(j) Conditions to Severance. Any monies the Company pays the Employee under this Agreement pursuant to this Section 13,\npursuant to Section 6(c) (ii) through (v), Section 6(c)(vii) or Section 6(d)(ii) through (vi), will be subject to (i) the Employee’s\nexecution and non-revocation of a general release of claims in a form reasonably acceptable to the Company within twenty-one (21)\ndays (or, to the extent required by law, forty-five (45) days) following the Termination Date (collectively, the “Release\nRequirement”) and (ii) Employee’s incurring a “Separation from Service” (within the meaning of Section 409A(a)(2)(A)(i) of the\nInternal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”) and Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(h)) (a “Separation from\nService”) from the Company. Payment of Non-Compete Payments, if due, will commence not later than the second regularly\nscheduled payroll date following satisfaction of the Release Requirement, with any installments that would have been made during\nthe period from the Termination Date to the date of satisfaction of the Release Requirement based on regularly scheduled payroll\ndates accumulated and paid on the date that such installments commence. In the event that the Company determines it cannot make a\npayment to the Employee during the six (6)-month period following the Employee’s Separation from Service because the Employee\nis a “specified employee” within the meaning of Code Section 409A and making a payment to the Employee during such six (6)-\nmonth period would result in the application of tax penalties under Code Section 409A, the Company will pay Employee a lump-\nsum amount equal to the cumulative amount that would have otherwise been paid to Employee during such period (without interest)\non the first business day following the end of the six (6)-month period (or such earlier date upon which such amount can be paid\nwithout resulting in the application of tax penalties under Code Section 409A). For purposes of Code Section 409A, each installment\npayment provided under this Agreement will be treated as a separate payment. In addition, the Employee will not be entitled to\nseverance or Non-Compete Payments in connection with the Employee’s termination of employment with the Company if the\nEmployee is offered employment by any successor to all or any portion of our Business.\n14. Refraining from Disparaging the Company. While employed by the Company and thereafter, the Employee agrees\nnever to disparage, malign or impugn the Company or any of the Company’s officers, directors and employees; provided, however,\nthat nothing herein shall prohibit the Employee from exercising any rights under Section 7 of the National Labor Relations Act,\nproviding truthful testimony, or from initiating, participating in or cooperating with an investigation or proceeding conducted by any\nlocal, state or federal governmental agency. In addition, nothing herein shall be construed to waive or limit the Employee’s right to\nreceive an award for information provided to the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n-12-\n15. Cooperating After Employment Ends. While employed by the Company and thereafter, Employee agrees to fully\ncooperate with the Company in connection with any investigation, suit, action or proceeding in which the Employee may have\nrelevant information or testimony, including but not limited to providing testimony at depositions or trial, which cooperation and\nappearance Employee fully agrees to without the necessity of a subpoena or court order. If Employee’s assistance is required after\nthe Employee’s employment has ended, the Company will reimburse Employee for Employee’s reasonable, out-of-pocket travel\nexpenses and accommodate Employee’s personal and business schedule to the extent practicable.\n16. Giving Notice to a New Employer and to the Company. Employee agrees that during the Restricted Period, Employee\nwill provide any new employer written notice of each of the restrictions to which Employee is subject under this Agreement (e.g.,\nEmployee’s Non-Interference Covenant, Employee’s Non-Solicit Covenant and Employee’s Non-Compete Covenant) before\nEmployee accepts an offer of employment and concurrently provide to the Company a copy of each such written notice. Employee\nshall also provide the Company with fourteen (14) days advance notice prior to becoming employed by any person or entity or\nengaging in any business of any type or form, regardless of whether or not the prospective employer or business is engaged in a\nCompeting Business.\n17. Prohibited Use of Confidential Information of Employee’s Prior Employers. It is vital to the Company that the\nEmployee does not disclose to the Company or use any information or materials that might constitute a former employer’s\nconfidential information. Accordingly, Employee (a) agrees not to disclose or use any former employer’s confidential information in\nany form unless Employee first obtained the prior written consent of that former employer and (b) represent to the Company that\nEmployee searched for and deleted any emails, documents or files prepared, generated, obtained or used by Employee that contain\nany such confidential information of a prior employer.\n18. Authority to Enter into this Agreement; No Conflicts. Employee represents that Employee has the right to enter into\nthis Agreement, that doing so is not and does not conflict with or breach any obligations Employee may have under any agreement\nEmployee has or any court order, and that Employee’s signature on this Agreement makes a valid and binding obligation, fully\nenforceable in accordance with its terms.\n19. Prior Restrictive Covenant Agreements to Which Employee is Bound. Employee represents to us that Employee: (a)\nhas provided Company true, correct and complete copies of any agreement to which Employee is subject containing non-\ncompetition, non-solicitation or similar restrictions or covenants in favor of any prior employer or other party; and (b) are free to\nenter into this Agreement and be employed by the Company in accordance with the terms of this Agreement without breaching or\nviolating any such prior agreements.\n20. Employee Acknowledgments Regarding Termination for Cause. Employee acknowledges that Employee’s breach of\nEmployee’s representations, covenants and agreements set forth in Sections 7 through 19 hereof is grounds for immediate\ntermination for Cause by the Company. Employee agrees that if, subsequent to the Termination Date, the Company determines that\nthe Company could have terminated Employee’s employment for Cause, or the Company discovers a breach of any provision herein,\nEmployee’s employment shall, at the\n-13-\nCompany’s election, be deemed to have been terminated for Cause retroactive to the Termination Date.\n21. Employment At-Will. Employee is employed at-will. Nothing in this Agreement changes Employee’s at-will\nemployment status or confers any right with respect to continuation of employment, and nothing in this Agreement interferes in any\nway with the Parties’ right to terminate the employment relationship at any time, with or without Cause or advance notice.\n22. Governing Law; Arbitration and Consent to Jurisdiction.\n(a) Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with its express terms, and otherwise in\naccordance with the laws of the State of Delaware without reference to its principles of conflicts of law.\n(b) Arbitration. Any claims Employee wishes to make arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the breach thereof,\nEmployee’s employment with the Company, or the termination of that employment will be resolved by binding arbitration before a\nsingle arbitrator in the State of Delaware, or at another location as mutually agreed upon by the parties, administered by the\nAmerican Arbitration Association (“AAA”) in accordance with its Employment Arbitration Rules, and judgment on the award\nrendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. This provision does not apply to claims that, under\nlaw, may not be subject to a pre-dispute arbitration agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary under the Rules of the AAA\nor the general grant of authority to the arbitrator contained herein, the arbitrator shall have no jurisdiction or authority to compel any\nclass or collective claim, to consolidate different arbitration proceedings or to join any other party to any arbitration between\nEmployee and the Company. The arbitrator shall, for all such claims Employee wishes to file, have the exclusive authority to\ndetermine the applicability, interpretation and enforceability of this Agreement, but shall have no jurisdiction or authority to compel\nany class or collective claim or to join any other party to an arbitration between us.\n(c) Consent to Jurisdiction. Employee hereby irrevocably consents and submits to the jurisdiction of any state or federal court\nlocated in the State of Delaware, including without limitation to decide any and all claims brought by the Company alleging a\nviolation or enforceability of Sections 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13 or 14 hereof, as well as any claims relating to misappropriation of trade\nsecrets.
